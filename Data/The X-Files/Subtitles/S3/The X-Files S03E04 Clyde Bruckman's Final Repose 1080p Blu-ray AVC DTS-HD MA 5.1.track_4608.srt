1
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,341
"I foresee a romantic affair

2
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:09,678
between superstar Madonna
and superwitness Kato Kaelin."

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:13,348
That's a gimme.
That's not really going out on a limb, is it?

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:17,352
"I foresee author JD Salinger
finally publishing a new novel...

5
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:20,939
...and hitting the talk-show circuit
to promote it."

6
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,108
That's just playing the odds.

7
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:29,239
"I foresee the revelation that not Elvis,
but rather Buddy Holly, is still alive...

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,119
...having faked his own death
so many years ago."

9
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:38,957
"Holly will not only re-emerge,
but also regroup with the Crickets...

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,628
...and they will headline
in next year's Lollapala..."

11
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,298
"Lollapaz... pazoola."

12
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:49,301
What the hell is "Lollapallazo"?

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,304
Who's Buddy Holly?

14
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:59,394
Just give me my lotto ticket
and a pint of malt Scotch whisky.

15
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,563
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,776
One of these.

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,659
6 When I die

18
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:15,827
6 That'll be the day

19
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:23,168
- Sorry.
- Don't apologise.

20
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:25,837
You're a better dancer than my last date.

21
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,975
So what has brought you
to Madame Zelma?

22
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:43,981
Well, can you really know everything
about me just by looking at my hands?

23
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:45,774
Hm.

24
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,985
The palms tell me all.

25
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:52,864
I would just like
for you to be able to tell me...

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,327
...why am I going to be doing
the things that I'm going to be doing?

27
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:02,624
Madame Zelma, she is a palm reader,
not a psychologist.

28
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,793
I know, I know. It's just...

29
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:10,549
I think I've somehow caught a glimpse
of my own future... myself.

30
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:14,386
And I see me doing things that...

31
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:18,473
...that just seem so out of character for me.

32
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,810
These are things that not only
do I not wanna be doing...

33
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:27,649
...but I can't even imagine myself capable
of doing. And, yet, there I am. I'm doing 'em.

34
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:30,235
Mister...

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,488
- Please, you're hurting me.
- I know. I know.

36
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:37,242
And I'm sorry. But you're a fortune-teller.

37
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,203
- No. Please...
- You should've seen this coming.

38
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:46,001
Argh!

39
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,640
They say the eyes capture
the last image a murder victim sees.

40
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:44,726
- So what do they say about the entrails?
- Yuck.

41
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,312
Is it true you asked for help on this case?

42
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:51,733
- This guy's an expert at this sort of thing.
- I heard he was a bit unorthodox.

43
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:55,153
- He comes highly recommended.
- Yeah, I saw him on TV.

44
00:03:55,278 --> 00:04:00,742
- So he's a publicity hound. He gets results.
- I worked on a case he did. Very spooky.

45
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:04,454
As long as he gives us leads,
I don't care how big a kook...

46
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:15,924
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

47
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:19,010
I forgot you were coming.
I'm Cline. This is Havez.

48
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:23,432
We're thinkin' this guy might be a Satanist,
what with the eyeballs.

49
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:25,767
Satanists take the eyeballs
and leave the body,

50
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,937
and not in anything but modern myths.

51
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,191
- He's gouging eyes for no reason?
- Nobody does anything without a reason.

52
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:39,114
We've composed a profile with explanations
of his attacks and also his choice of victims.

53
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:42,367
- Does it explain the entrails?
- Anthropomancy.

54
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:47,539
It was once believed that you could divine
your future by studying human entrails.

55
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:51,460
So this guy is hackin' up people
in order to see his future?

56
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:55,464
There's a possible connection with
all his victims being prognosticators.

57
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,049
Till this one. She was a doll collector.

58
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,510
And an amateur tasseographer.

59
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:06,808
She read tea leaves. You can gain insight
into your future by examining the pattern...

60
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,977
...on the bottom of the cup.

61
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,646
- You believe in this?
- I'm not convinced.

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,524
- But I'm pretty sure the victim was.
- Why?

63
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,069
Her leaves were telling her
she was about to be murdered.

64
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,075
<i>(cop) I'm sorry, people.</i>

65
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:28,079
- (woman) Mr Yappi!
- <i>(cop)</i> You're gonna have to stand back.

66
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,836
- Mr Yappi, I appreciate you coming here.
- Quiet.

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,424
Yes, I'm seeing visions. Visions of the killer.

68
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,511
He does not feel like
he's in control of his life.

69
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:45,180
Very important. That's why he kills. Yes.

70
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,933
- Can you see what he looks like?
- He looks like...

71
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:51,186
...a white man with facial hair... or not.

72
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,940
But he has, yes...

73
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:59,110
...a tattoo somewhere on his body.

74
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:02,697
Maybe the tattoo has the facial hair, I think.

75
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,868
Huh!

76
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:10,121
I see him here, forcing himself,
yes, on the girl.

77
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,250
But he cannot perform...

78
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,127
...so he's taking out his rage.

79
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,924
It's gone. I lost the vision.

80
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,468
Someone is blocking me.

81
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:28,473
I am picking up negative energy.

82
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,410
- Please, leave this room.
- I'm part of this investigation.

83
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:53,582
- You give off negative energy.
- I assure you, I believe in psychic ability.

84
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:58,169
So you say with your mouth,
but your thoughts tell me the truth.

85
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,631
Agent Mulder, please.

86
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,677
I can't take you anywhere.

87
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,180
<i>(clapping)</i>

88
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,687
Now, excuse me.
I have an interview to give.

89
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,940
Sceptics like you make me sick.

90
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,109
Mr Yappi, read this thought.

91
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,155
So's your old man!

92
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:33,288
It's too bad about your negative energy.
You missed quite a performance.

93
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,998
Look what he did to my pen.

94
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,626
Let me impress you with my psychic ability.

95
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,795
Mr Yappi proclaimed
the victim's body was near water.

96
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,717
He saw a church or school in the vicinity. He
got a flash of the letter S and the number 7.

97
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,220
- What's your point?
- His leads are so vague as to be useless...

98
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:51,640
...yet easily seen as correct after the fact.

99
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:54,643
He said the killer doesn't
feel in control of his life.

100
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:57,812
- That's true of everyone at times.
- He said other things.

101
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:01,983
Some are bound to be right, but most
will turn out wrong. Which is which?

102
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:07,656
Look, all I know is that Yappi has provided
more solid leads on this case than you have.

103
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:13,078
Now, if you don't mind, I have to get
an APB out on a white male, 17 to 34...

104
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,998
...with or without a beard,
maybe a tattoo, who's impotent.

105
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,209
Let's go.

106
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:24,714
Might as well go home, Mulder.
This case is as good as solved.

107
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:31,054
So General Mutual has a very
comprehensive $200,000 life policy...

108
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,766
...at a net annual cost of $2400.

109
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,519
You see, the thing is...

110
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,772
...we were really hoping to buy a boat.

111
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:43,858
Mr Gordon, as a young husband...

112
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:49,864
...you'll find that your new responsibilities
take precedence over recreational needs.

113
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:52,075
But this is a really good boat.

114
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,454
You don't get it, do you, kid?

115
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,290
Two years from now...

116
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,876
...while driving down Route 91

117
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:07,132
...coming home to your wife
and baby daughter...

118
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:10,635
...you're gonna be hit head-on by a drunk...

119
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,263
...driving a blue '87 Mustang.

120
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:19,894
You'll end up looking worse than 60 feet
of bad road your body slides across...

121
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:23,398
...after flying out your front windshield.

122
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:28,111
Mister, you really need to work
on your closing technique.

123
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,940
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not your lighter, Mrs Lowe.

124
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,151
I want your garbage.

125
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,203
Get outta here, you monster.

126
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:25,043
Is everything all right, Mrs Lowe? You
have enough supplies? Enough dog food?

127
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,523
Oh, God.

128
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,817
It's creepy, isn't it?

129
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,903
The Stupendous Yappi said
the first victim's body has been dumped.

130
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:56,241
- Then we find it in a Dumpster.
- Ooh, I just got a chill down my spine.

131
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,080
Who found the body?

132
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:08,253
According to the report, Mr Bruckman, you
didn't touch the body after you found her.

133
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:14,175
- Why would I want to?
- You reported a body with its eyes out out.

134
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,346
The body was facedown. How did
you know the eyes had been removed?

135
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,765
Well, they had been, hadn't they?

136
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,102
Then what are you complaining about?

137
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,272
How had the eyes been cut out?

138
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:31,192
By a piece of crystal ball,
of all cockamamie things.

139
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,319
We did find
some crystal shards on the body.

140
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:36,030
How do you know it was from a crystal ball?

141
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:41,703
Well, it just figures. I mean,
if a guy goes to kill a fortune-teller...

142
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:45,540
...he's obviously going to assault her
with her own crystal ball...

143
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:50,128
...and use a shattered piece as
a sort of lance, isn't he?

144
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:57,302
How much have you heard about
the recent slayings in town?

145
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:03,308
Just that some nut is killing fortune-tellers
and ripping their eyes and entrails out.

146
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:07,562
How did you know about the entrails?
That hasn't been released to the press.

147
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,772
I never read the papers.

148
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,609
Too depressing.

149
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:18,156
Mr Bruckman, I'm sorry, but I'm going
to have to ask you to come with us.

150
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,829
Step inside, Mr Bruckman.

151
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,749
What... what is this all about?

152
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,251
A murder occurred here earlier this evening.

153
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,924
We believe it was committed by the person
who murdered the woman that you found.

154
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:39,093
- Is there anything you can tell us?
- I didn't do it.

155
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:41,262
You're not under suspicion.

156
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:45,266
But I do harbour a suspicion
that you can see things about this crime.

157
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,021
- Things that we can't see.
- I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

158
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,190
I think you do.

159
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:57,528
Yeah, yeah, right. I'd like to see
both your badges again, right now.

160
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,701
I don't blame you, Mr Bruckman.

161
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:07,622
I'm supposed to believe that's a real name?

162
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:11,876
What is this all about?
I found a dead body in my Dumpster.

163
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:17,048
I reported it to the police and now,
suddenly, I'm accused of doing things...

164
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:20,635
...or being able to do things,
that I couldn't possib...

165
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,078
<i>(coughing)</i>

166
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,997
<i>(retching)</i>

167
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,207
Pinch me.

168
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,587
He's performing the same routine as The
Stupendous Yappi, just in a different style.

169
00:13:56,713 --> 00:14:00,258
No, something told me,
something <i>is</i> telling me this guy's for real.

170
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,093
Oh, so now you're psychic?

171
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:10,101
The killer, he doesn't feel like
he's in control of his own life.

172
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,105
I mean, like, who is? Am I right?

173
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,775
But this guy...

174
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,905
...he truly believes...
he sees himself as some kind of a...

175
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,535
- PUDpet

176
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:31,622
Can you describe him?
Do you get a visual impression of him?

177
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,710
So you can see <i>into</i> him, but not at him?

178
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,631
I didn't mean to give off
any negative energy.

179
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:42,800
Negative energy? What is this?

180
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,474
What is it? What do you see?

181
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,977
He's having sex with her. There.

182
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,938
- Is he raping her?
- Oh, no, no, no, not at all.

183
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:00,401
In fact, she's instigating the whole thing.

184
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:02,653
Then what's wrong?

185
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,073
Oh!

186
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:09,994
Sometimes it just seems that
everyone's having sex except for me.

187
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:18,336
Can you tell us why the killer
is murdering people in the way that he is?

188
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,466
Why does anyone do the things they do?
Why do I sell insurance? I wish I knew.

189
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,761
Why did this woman collect dolls?

190
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,930
What was it about her life?

191
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:33,309
Was it one specific moment
where she suddenly said: I know, dolls.

192
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,438
Or was it a whole series of things...

193
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:40,608
...starting when her parents first met...

194
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,985
...that somehow combined in such a way

195
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:46,364
that she had no choice
but to be a doll collect...

196
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:03,131
You'll find a woman tomorrow morning...
by the fat, little, white, Nazi storm trooper.

197
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:07,510
Glenview Lake.
Her body's floating in Glenview Lake.

198
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:14,725
Now, if you'll excuse me...

199
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:19,355
...I think I've seen enough deaths
for one night.

200
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:31,159
- OK, go.
- We got her!

201
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,870
One more. Here we go.

202
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,588
Doesn't that propane tank
bear more than a slight resemblance...

203
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,007
...to a fat, little, white, Nazi storm trooper?

204
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,844
Mulder, the human mind
naturally seeks meaningful patterns...

205
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,180
...in things that don't inherently have any.

206
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:56,184
Given the suggestion of an image,
you can't help but see that shape.

207
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:59,270
If that tank weren't there,
you'd see it in a rock or tree.

208
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,439
Did you answer my question?

209
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:08,029
Yes, it looks like a Nazi storm trooper,
but that only proves my point.

210
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,865
He named the water the victim would be in.

211
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,618
That only implies that he put her in there.

212
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,621
- I don't believe he's the killer.
- I don't believe he's psychic.

213
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:19,874
If he's neither, how did he know
where the body would be?

214
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,043
Maybe he's just lucky.

215
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,712
<i>...38, 40 and 44.</i>

216
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,591
<i>- Once again, the numbers are: 8, 12...
- Why?</i>

217
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:32,220
- <i>Why do</i> I <i>do this</i> to <i>myself?</i>
- <i>(knocking)</i>

218
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,932
Come in.

219
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,227
I knew it was you.

220
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:42,313
I know why you're here.

221
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:49,320
You're here because you found that
woman's body where I told you it would be.

222
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:53,741
And now you're convinced
I have some sort of psychic power.

223
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:58,246
So while your sceptical lady partner
is off performing an autopsy...

224
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:03,251
...you came here to ask my help
catching this serial murderer.

225
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,671
Everything you said is correct.

226
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:08,839
Oh, it's you.

227
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,467
I won't help you. Please leave.

228
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:16,347
- But you do admit to having this gift.
- I got it all right.

229
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:19,433
The only problem is it's nonreturnable.

230
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:24,689
Your ability has staggering implications
upon physics and human consciousness.

231
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:27,858
It's one which most people
would be envious of,

232
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:30,611
yet you seem to treat it with disdain.

233
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:33,364
Do you wanna know
how you're going to die?

234
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,827
Yes, I would.

235
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:41,664
No, you don't.

236
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,750
Not knowing has its own drawbacks,

237
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,962
which is why a good insurance policy
is so important.

238
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:52,633
I don't know what kind of coverage
the FBI has, but General Mutual has...

239
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:55,803
This murderer has already
committed four homicides.

240
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,222
He'll commit more
whether I help you or not.

241
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:02,852
- How can you be so sure?
- How could I see the future if it didn't exist?

242
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,731
But if the future is written,
then why bother to do anything?

243
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,358
Now you're catching on.

244
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,159
Mr Bruckman, I believe in your ability,
but not your attitude.

245
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,994
I can't watch people die...

246
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:24,915
...without doing everything in my albeit
unsupernatural power to interfere.

247
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:29,253
Well, you see, that's another reason
I can't help you catch this guy.

248
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:33,507
I might adversely affect the fate of
the future. His next victim might be...

249
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:37,345
...the mother of the daughter
whose son invents the time machine.

250
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:41,432
Then the son goes back in time
and changes world history.

251
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:47,438
And then Columbus never discovers
America, man never lands on the moon...

252
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,900
...the US never invades Grenada.

253
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:56,447
Or something less significant
resulting in the fact

254
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,032
that my father never meets my mother...

255
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,868
...and consequently I'm never born.

256
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,623
So when do we start?

257
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:14,298
I don't know what it is,
but it belonged to a victim.

258
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,467
That's a hit.

259
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:21,972
In psychical parlance, a correct guess
is a "hit". An incorrect guess is a "miss".

260
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:26,977
The guy who cast the mould for this
will die of prostate cancer at the age of 82.

261
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,981
- Hit or miss?
- I have no way of verifying that information.

262
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,901
Then Why'd you ask me?

263
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:37,154
Do you receive
any other impressions from it?

264
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,495
It's ugly. Next.

265
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,755
<i>(knocking)</i>

266
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:02,972
I was told you were interrogating a suspect.

267
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,182
I'm now convinced of our psychic's ability.

268
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:07,017
Or, rather, his one ability.

269
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:10,521
He is able to divine
how people are gonna die, but that's all.

270
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,274
He can't provide any practical information.

271
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:18,195
I got it. This is yours.
This is from your New York Knicks T-shirt.

272
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,699
Miss.

273
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:24,535
This is worse than playing the lotto.

274
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,290
Try reading this.

275
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:34,628
- Save me the headache, Scully. What is it?
- It was found on the woman from the lake.

276
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:37,381
Identical key chains were found
on two other victims.

277
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:42,052
I managed to trace the insignia to an
investment firm called Uranus Unlimited.

278
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:47,308
They provide market strategies based
on astrological forecasts. It's owned by...

279
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,644
Claude Dukenfield: age 43...

280
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:53,063
...316 Roundview Lane...

281
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,816
...divorced with two children...

282
00:21:56,567 --> 00:22:00,237
...makes about $87,000 a year, nonsmoker.

283
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:03,991
- Is that a hit or a miss?
- As far as I know, it's correct.

284
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,161
You got all that information
by handling that key chain?

285
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:11,248
Oh, no.
I sold him a policy a couple of months ago.

286
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,001
It's just a coincidence.

287
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:18,088
In any case,
we're trying to get a hold of him.

288
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:20,257
Oh, you won't be able to do that.

289
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,885
He's been murdered.

290
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:29,350
- (Bruckman) We're almost there.
- How are you receiving this information?

291
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,853
- How should I know?
- I mean, are you seeing it in a vision?

292
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:36,524
Or is it a sensation?
How do you know where to go?

293
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,692
I just know.

294
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:41,278
- But how do you know?
- I don't know.

295
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,783
Look, it's just up ahead.

296
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:51,205
There are worse ways to go,
but I can't think of a more undignified one...

297
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,791
...than autoerotic asphyxiation.

298
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,462
Why are you telling me that?

299
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,299
Look, forget I mentioned it.
It's none of my business.

300
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,720
Oops! Pull over here.

301
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:08,889
<i>Stop. Stop, stop, $109-</i>

302
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,822
This is the spot.

303
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:29,743
I guess you run into a lot of dead bodies
in your line of work.

304
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:32,329
You get used to it.

305
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:36,417
Ineverhave.
I'm not sure you're supposed to.

306
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,920
Do you remember the first time
you foresaw someones death?

307
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:43,424
- 1959.
- What happened in 1959?

308
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:47,511
- Buddy Holly's plane crashed.
- You prognosticated Buddy Holly's death?

309
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,931
Oh, God, no. Why would I wanna do that?

310
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:54,268
But I did have a ticket
to see him perform the next night.

311
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,938
Actually, I was a bigger fan of
the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly.

312
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:01,025
"Chantilly Lace", that was the song.

313
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,193
I'm not following.

314
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:09,783
The Big Bopper was not supposed
to be on the plane with Buddy Holly.

315
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:14,121
He won the seat from somebody else
by flippin' a coin for it.

316
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:18,459
- I'm still not following.
- Imagine all the things that had to occur...

317
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:22,963
...not only in his life
but in everybody else's...

318
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,550
...to arrange it so that
on that particular night...

319
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:32,640
...the Big Bopper would be in a position
to live or die depending on a flippin' coin.

320
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:36,185
I became so obsessed with that idea...

321
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:42,316
...that I gradually became capable of seeing
the specifics of everybody's death.

322
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm not one who readily believes
in that kind of thing.

323
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,073
If I was, I wouldn't believe that story.

324
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:52,826
I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true.

325
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,413
I was a bigger fan of
the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly.

326
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:01,919
- Where's the body?
- Yeah, I don't understand how you know...

327
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:06,674
...that this is the exact area
but you can't pinpoint the exact spot.

328
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,263
I guess I can't see the forest for the trees.

329
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,270
OK, now!

330
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:30,447
I'm glad I could bring
a little smile into your life.

331
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,908
I'm not smiling, I'm wincing.

332
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:52,886
- (Bruckman) What is this?
- The only evidence from Dukenfield's body.

333
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,640
That fibre may have come from
something the killer was wearing.

334
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:59,727
Don't you have crime labs
that analyse these things?

335
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,981
- Yes. Yes, we do.
- It'll take them time to provide information.

336
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,358
A similar fibre was on an earlier victim.

337
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:08,902
We're waiting for the lab
to determine its source.

338
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:14,158
- You'd be saving us a great deal of work.
- Look, I've got my own work to do.

339
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,785
I'm not a crime fighter by trade.

340
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:23,917
Mr Bruckman...

341
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:27,504
...I can't speak for my partner,
but I'm desperate.

342
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,340
For some insurance.

343
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,845
General Mutual has some
very comprehensive coverage...

344
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:51,111
No, I can't tell you where this is from...

345
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:56,200
...but the killer's gonna kill more people
before you catch him.

346
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:59,119
- Can you see him physically yet?
- No.

347
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:03,791
No, just more insight into his character,
which I know you hate.

348
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,960
He thinks he's psychic.

349
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,129
- Is he?
- I hope not.

350
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,882
I've seen things he's seen.

351
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,176
Like what? What does he see?

352
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,054
You.

353
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,058
He sees you...

354
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,227
...trying to catch him.

355
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,230
Where does this take place?

356
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,233
In a kitchen.

357
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,652
You're looking around for someone.

358
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:36,740
He's behind you now, but you don't know it,
and he's stalking towards you and...

359
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,409
- Oh, God!
- What? What do you see?

360
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,079
He's got a knife. It's got blood on it.

361
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:45,916
- Why don't I see him? What am I doing?
- You're looking down.

362
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:51,046
You stepped in a pie that's fallen to
the floor. The killer comes up to you and...

363
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,424
- Coconut cream.
- What?

364
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,512
The pie - coconut cream.
Or is it lemon meringue?

365
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:03,433
- I don't know. I'm not sure. It's hazy.
- Whatever. Please continue.

366
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:08,105
As you're looking down...
he comes up with the knife and...

367
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:12,025
Banana cream. Definitely banana cream.

368
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:16,613
All right, I'm looking down at this
banana-cream pie and then what?

369
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:20,701
He sees himself...
coming up to you from behind...

370
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,955
And? And what does he see?

371
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,875
Oh.

372
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,587
Nothing.

373
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,132
The visions of a madman.

374
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,636
You got all that from this?

375
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,724
How am I supposed to get anything
from this tiny little thing?

376
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,310
This came in the mail today.

377
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,062
Who's it from?

378
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,775
The killer.

379
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:07,247
"Like our lives, this is a mere formality
to let you know I know that you know."

380
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,420
"Can't wait till our first meeting when I kill
you, not before you explain some things."

381
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:18,175
"First on the list: why in the world did I send
you this letter? Sincerely, you know who."

382
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,928
"PS: say hi to the FBI agents."

383
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,346
Hi.

384
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,265
He must have been
at the crime scenes and seen us.

385
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:29,519
No, this is postmarked the day <i>before</i>
Mr Bruckman joined our investigation.

386
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,689
You have to come with us.
We gotta get you outta here.

387
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:37,194
Look, I'll be dead before you catch this guy
no matter what you do.

388
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,950
You've come to me because
you're searching for someone.

389
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,453
But don't worry. This person will find <i>you.</i>

390
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,039
It's a relative or a close friend.

391
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,501
Actually, a guy I'm gonna kill.

392
00:29:57,214 --> 00:29:59,299
Ah, yes, it's clearer now.

393
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:03,971
You seek answers from a special man
who possesses a special wisdom.

394
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,181
This is real cream...

395
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,310
...not the phoney stuff. I know the difference.

396
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,021
And the chocolate, very rich.

397
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:17,401
Look at these cute little doilies
they put everything on.

398
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:20,237
Are you sure you don't wanna join me?

399
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:28,078
- So what are you doing?
- Studying background checks.

400
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,580
This is what detective work is really like.

401
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:34,084
We can't come up with suspects
by having visions.

402
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,836
Jealous?

403
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,422
You're very confused right now.

404
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,259
Nothing seems to make sense to you.

405
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,348
You don't know why you do
the things that you do.

406
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:53,520
But your confusion is soon to come to
an abrupt end with the arrival of a woman.

407
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:58,775
A blonde or a brunette. Maybe a redhead.

408
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:03,739
There's something you haven't explained.
Can you see your own end?

409
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,367
I see our end.

410
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:11,288
We end up in bed together.

411
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:14,124
I'm... I'm sorry.

412
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:18,628
I shouldn't have said that.
I don't mean to offend you or scare you.

413
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,964
Not here, not this bed.

414
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,886
I just meant I see us quite clearly...

415
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,972
...in bed together.

416
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,975
You're holding my hand...

417
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,312
...very tenderly.

418
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:39,566
You're looking at me with
such compassion and I feel...

419
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,154
Tears are streaming down my face.

420
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,991
I feel so grateful.

421
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:54,915
This is just a very special moment
neither of us will ever forget.

422
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,419
Mr Bruckman...

423
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,589
...there are hits and there are misses.

424
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,800
And then there are misses.

425
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,763
I just call 'em as I see 'em.

426
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,352
Wow. I'm really impressed.

427
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:19,856
I've been to a lot of fortune-tellers,
but by far you're the best.

428
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,859
There's still one more card left.

429
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,696
This card's not meant for me.

430
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,865
It's yours.

431
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:38,041
So Ahab mistakes the prophecy
and, as a result, dies.

432
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,463
- A similar fate happens to Macbeth.
- Still, you're not the least bit curious?

433
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,382
<i>(knocking)</i>

434
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,885
That must be Mulder.
Time for the midnight shift.

435
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,651
All right. So how <i>do</i> I die?

436
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,905
You don't.

437
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,075
<i>(knocking)</i>

438
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:23,253
Get this, Scully. The lab analysis
from the first bit of fibre came back.

439
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,672
- It's lace.
- Chantilly lace?

440
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,175
You know what I like.

441
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:32,679
It's not likely that the killer was wearing
anything made out of Chantilly lace.

442
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:37,100
- But the Big Bopper, Chantilly lace...
- It's a coincidence.

443
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:40,604
If they're just coincidences,
why do they feel so contrived?

444
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:44,191
That's one to pose
to the psychic philosopher.

445
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,359
Good night, Mulder.

446
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,366
Am I keeping you awake?

447
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,622
I'm waiting for you to ask me another
one of those psychic-ability questions.

448
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:04,628
I've had dreams where I had a vision and
then later on I've seen that vision in reality.

449
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:08,965
And, as a psychic, have you
ever had prophetic dreams like that?

450
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,968
I have only one dream.

451
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:16,306
I dream it every night. You're not one
of those people who turns everything...

452
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,477
- ...into a sexual symbol, are you?
- No. No, I'm not a Freudian, no.

453
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:26,233
I'm lying naked... in a field of red tulips.

454
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,613
I'm not concerned with
where I am or how I got there.

455
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,159
I'm at peace.
And it's then that I realise I'm dead.

456
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:41,623
My body begins to turn
a greenish white with spots of purple.

457
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,668
Next, the insects arrive.

458
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,005
The inevitable follows:
putridity and liquescence.

459
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,259
Before I know it, I'm nothing but bones.

460
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:57,764
When I start fading to dust, I lose whatever
care I might have had about my clothes.

461
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:02,102
And as I begin to feel myself
slipping away towards I know not what...

462
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,770
...I wake up.

463
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,939
Well, good night.

464
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,776
<i>(knocking)</i>

465
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,611
Mulder, there's...

466
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,321
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yeah.

467
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,907
I just didn't sleep well. What's up?

468
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:20,954
Havez is gonna stay with Bruckman while
we go to a tarot reader around the corner.

469
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,664
There's been another murder.

470
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,376
I'm losing patience with our psychic.
What good are his prophecies?

471
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,752
They're not preventive.

472
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,630
I'm starting to feel
more sympathetic to him.

473
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:34,217
- So you're convinced he's a psychic now?
- No, not really.

474
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,636
Sorry, ma'am.

475
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,391
I am convinced that by thinking he can see
the future he's taken the joy out of his life.

476
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:45,145
(Havez) So then
the priest says to the rabbi...

477
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:48,189
- "I had it set for quail."
- Yeah.

478
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,819
Hey, I thought you said
you hadn't heard that one before.

479
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,988
Ihadni

480
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:02,245
Hey, is it true that you can see
how people are gonna die?

481
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,081
I mean, can you...

482
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,084
...see how I'm going to die?

483
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,549
Lung cancer?

484
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,429
Oh, thank God.

485
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:30,857
<i>(coughs)</i>

486
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,611
Hey,
I gotta go visit your rest room for a second.

487
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,573
Don't open that door for anybody.

488
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,871
<i>- Oh, God.
- (knocking)</i>

489
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,595
Was that not enough of a tip?

490
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,932
They brought you right to me.
Right to where I work.

491
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:48,601
What are the chances of that happening?

492
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:53,022
- Astronomical. It's beyond believability.
- But not impossibility.

493
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:55,859
I mean, after all, here we are.

494
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:59,529
It's funny how things work out sometimes,
isn't it?

495
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,698
I'll say.

496
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:07,287
So there's something I've wanted
to ask you for some time now.

497
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,290
You've seen the things I do
in the past and in the future.

498
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,293
- They're terrible things.
- I know they are.

499
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:16,171
So tell me, please, why have I done them?

500
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,382
Don't you understand yet, son?

501
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,719
Don't you get it?

502
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:30,018
You do the things you do
because you're a homicidal maniac.

503
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,482
That...

504
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:38,568
That does explain a lot, doesn't it?

505
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:43,907
It's all starting to make sense now. Huh!

506
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,995
No.

507
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,164
You don't kill me now.

508
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,416
I don't? Why not?

509
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,002
How should I know?

510
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:09,849
We've either got a copycat killer
or our guy's getting lackadaisical.

511
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:14,771
Not only did he leave the body, but he
didn't even bother to remove the eyes.

512
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,986
If my Miss Manners serves me right,

513
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,615
that protrusion from his left cornea
is a salad fork.

514
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:29,619
(Cline) Something tells me
we're gonna get prints off it.

515
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:37,544
- Mulder, I've found another strand of silk.
- We got more than that this time.

516
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:41,214
- We got fingerprints, a footprint even.
- This is more like it.

517
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:45,552
No more psychics and their vague visions.
We don't even need our own hunches.

518
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:48,388
This case is now about
old-fashioned police work.

519
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,640
It's the bellhop.

520
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:54,227
He's the killer. The bellhop at the hotel.

521
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:58,815
How the hell does she know that?

522
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,984
Woman's intuition.

523
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:08,157
<i>(lift bell)</i>

524
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,457
Havez?

525
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:20,837
Mr Bruckman?

526
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:42,650
Hey!

527
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,454
<i>(clattering)</i>

528
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:32,825
<i>(lift bell)</i>

529
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:35,703
Drop it!

530
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:38,498
Agh!

531
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:46,005
Hey,
that's not the way it's supposed to happen.

532
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:55,014
- How did you know where to find us?
- I didn't.

533
00:41:55,098 --> 00:42:00,186
- I got in the service elevator by mistake.
- Thank heaven for happenstance.

534
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:03,189
None of Bruckman's prophecy came true.

535
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:06,693
The killer didn't get to him first,
but he did kill Havez.

536
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,861
Then Bruckman's all right?

537
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:13,366
- Actually, I don't know. I couldn't find him.
- Then where is he?

538
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,625
"Miss Scully."

539
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,800
"My neighbour passed away last night."

540
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:34,303
"Please see that the remains
of her remains are taken care of."

541
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:38,891
"Would you like a dog? He is well-behaved,
regardless of his actions last night...

542
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,644
...which you can't really blame him for."

543
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:25,772
<i>Well, here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into.</i>

544
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:30,276
<i>- Well, I couldn't help it.
- Let's get back to Peoria where we belong.</i>

545
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:49,796
<i>(Yappi) Do you want to know the future?

<i>I have been consulted by Hollywood stars,

549
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:06,729
<i>I can be your personal psychic consultant.</i>

550

if you will get that promotion?</i>

551
