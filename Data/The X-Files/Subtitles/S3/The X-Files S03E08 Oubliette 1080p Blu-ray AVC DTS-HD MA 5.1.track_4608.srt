00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:06,758
- Name, please?
- Uh, Amy Jacobs.

2
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:10,762
OK, Amy. Fill out your address card.
And may I have the next one in line?

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,606
Carl, I need a reload.

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,027
Hey, Carl. Hey! I need more film.

5
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:28,113
I haven't loaded it yet.

6
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:32,367
Why do you even bother coming in
if you're not gonna do your job?

7
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,487

Amy?

Amy!

13
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,050
Mom!

14
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:02,100
Hurry up with those drinks, Lucy.
We're backin' up.

15
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:10,567
What are you doing?
These are regular. They all ordered large.

16
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,199
What... What happened?

17
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:32,798
Nobody's... gonna spoil us.

18
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:36,968
Nobody's... gonna spoil us.

Nobody's gonna spoil us.

Nobody's... gonna spoil us.

24
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:15,317
- Where's the agent in charge?
- You are?

25
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,487
- Special Agent Mulder.
- I'll let him know you're here.

26
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,996
<i>(detective)</i>
Can we get some shots right here?

27
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:31,917
Yeah. Go ahead and go over them.

28
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,228
Mrs Jacobs?

29
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,940
I'm Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

30
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:57,442
I'm sorry about your daughter.

31
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,611
It's her birthday on Tuesday.

32
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:05,283
- We'll do everything we can to find her.
- Who could do such a thing?

33
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:08,954
Who could take somebody
who wasn't theirs?

34
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:12,457
- I know you must be feeling...
- I'm sorry...

35
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,962
...but how could you really know how I feel?

36
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,823
It's blood. Amy had a nosebleed.

37
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:50,161
Her little sister said it happened when
the kidnapper put his hand over her mouth.

38
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,163
We're running it anyway.

39
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:56,334
- Walt Eubanks, special agent in charge.
- Fox Mulder. Any leads on the suspect?

40
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,005
A vague description from the sister,
hair and fibre bits...

41
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,758
...but he didn't leave any prints
here or in the flowerbeds out front.

42
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:07,762
- What about the neighbours?
- Nobody saw anything. Not a car, nothing.

43
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:12,183
It was someone who knew her. That much
we can figure. He knew where he was going.

44
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,520
I'd bet he didn't know her well
or he wouldn't have been so bold.

45
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:20,025
Either way, we're chasing our tails
until something or someone turns on this.

46
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,110
And this woman at the restaurant?

47
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,279
- You heard about that?
- That's why I came.

48
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,282
- Seems like a pretty thin lead.
- Mind if I talk to her?

49
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,534
Hey, save me the time.

50
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,703
Great. Thanks.

51
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:36,875
<i>(door opens)</i>

52
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,294
- Mulder.
- I thought you missed your flight.

53
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,796
We were delayed in DC.
I tried your cellphone.

54
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,965
I forgot it. I left in a hurry.

55
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:47,719
- Your message said a kidnapping?
- A 15-year-old girl, Amy Jacobs...

56
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,221
...was taken from her bed last night at ten.

57
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,307
- Is she here?
- They haven't found her.

58
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,560
- Then why are we here?
- A 30-year-old, Lucy Householder...

59
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:57,729
...was admitted here shortly after ten.

60
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:00,315
She collapsed at work
suffering from a seizure

61
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,567
and what her doctors call glossolalia.

62
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,653
- Incoherent speech.
- Technically.

63
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:08,156
But she was repeating the exact words
spoken by Amy's abductor...

64
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,909
...at the exact same time
20 miles across town.

65
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:14,245
- That's spooky.
- That's my name, isn't it?

66
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:17,832
Lucy Householder knows something
about kidnapping herself.

67
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,920
When she was eight, she was taken
from her bed while her parents were asleep.

68
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,296
She was missing for five years

69
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,591
until she escaped
and was found by the side of a road.

70
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:30,345
Apparently her abductor kept her
locked in a basement the entire time.

71
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,514
They never caught him.

72
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:34,724
<i>(lift door opens)</i>

73
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,534
Lucy?

74
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,040
I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.
We're with the FBI.

75
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,459
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

76
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,296
I'd like a cigarette.
They won't let me smoke in here.

77
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:10,385
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'd just like a cigarette.

78
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:14,639
A young girl was kidnapped last night.
Have you heard anything about that?

79
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:16,474
What are you asking me for?

80
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:19,644
Do you remember what you said
last night when you collapsed?

81
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,481
- What?
- You said "Nobody's gonna spoil us."

82
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:30,071
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

83
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:34,075
Can you think of any reason
why you might have said it?

84
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,493
What did I just say?

85
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,538
You see, those were the exact words
spoken by the kidnapper

86
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,166
to the girl he took last night.

87
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,004
So you can see that
it might seem strange that you...

88
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,173
So what's your point?

89
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,677
All of us kidnap victims
gotta stick together?

90
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,262
No.

91
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:59,267
We just wanna find the little girl
any way we can, and if you know anything...

92
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,691
Look, what I've been through all my life
I wouldn't wanna wish on anybody.

93
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:11,029
Doesn't mean I can make it any better
for me or anyone else.

94
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:17,202
- Well, thanks for talking to us, Lucy.
- Yeah.

95
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,998
Hey!

96
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:28,129
- When do I get outta here?
- As soon as your doctors feel you can go.

97
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,548
No, they say it's up to you.

98
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:33,551
No. We can't hold you here.
You're free to go.

99
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:42,143
I guess she's not too big on confined spaces.

100
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,354
Yeah.

- Gary Mosier?
- No. Wrong guy.

104

- I might as well give you a hand.
- That's OK. We'll be fine.

105
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,371
Looks like you're in a world of hurt.
Blown sidewall. You'll need a new tyre.

106
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:46,541
- Yeah, it looks that way.
- Got a spare in the trunk?

107
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,626
- Yeah.
- 40 bucks cash.

108
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:51,129
My boss don't gotta know.
Take five minutes.

109

- I can't pay you.
- Make it ten. Take me five minutes max.

Leave me alone!

00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:03,558

- Leave me alone! Get outta here!

- Lucy Householder. Get anywhere on that?
- I'm workin' on it.

115
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:37,008
She's got a criminal record.

116
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,594
Prostitution, narcotics convictions.
She's done some time.

117
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:44,265
- Doesn't surprise me, given her history.
- Boyfriend's inside for child endangerment.

118
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:47,769
Used to live with him up in the hills.
Sketchy characters.

119
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:52,106
- I don't think she's involved.
- Closest thing I got to a lead. loan...

120
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,776
No, let me follow up on that. OK? Thanks.

121
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,028
Mulder!

122
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,948
- I've got something. Something weird.
- What?

123
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,368
I was going over Lucy's medical workup
and something hit me.

124
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,536
Her blood type is O positive.

125
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,455
Yeah?

126
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:12,377
Forensics lifted two blood types off of
her work clothes: O positive and B positive.

127
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,629
Guess what Amy's blood type is.

128
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,382
How could it be Amy's blood?
Lucy was across town.

129
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,384
It begs the question.

130
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:21,302
Because it matches the victim's blood type?

131
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,805
How many people have B-positive blood?

132
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,392
One in five? That'd be hundreds
of thousands of local people alone.

133
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,645
We're talking about a woman
who's tied to this case...

134
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,314
...who had somebody else's blood
on her uniform.

135
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,900
Lucy is a victim, just like Amy Jacobs.

136
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:39,904
If she's got any connection to this case,
that's the extent of it.

137
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:43,157
- Well, we'll know soon enough.
- What are you talkin' about?

138
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,411
I'm running a PCR on her blood
to see if there's a DNA match.

139
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,997
- Do me a favour. Keep that under your hat.
- Why?

140
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,833
Cos I don't want Lucy
treated like a suspect...

141
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,420
...until it's absolutely certain
that she is one. OK?

142
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,865
- Lucy?
- I'm cold.

143
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,034
I brought you another blanket.

144
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:29,120
- We should call the doctor.
- No!

145
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,622
Let me see your face.

146
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:36,210
- What did you do to yourself?
- It's dark. Why is it dark?

147
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:38,296
- I can't see.
- You hold on now.

148
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,798
I can't see!

149
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,363
- How's she doin'?
- Fine.

150
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:48,533
Blood pressure's back to normal.
Temperature's back up.

151
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:51,202
She must've gone
down the rabbit hole for a while.

152
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:55,540
You should get something to eat soon.
Get your blood sugar back up.

153
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:02,797
What do you say, Lucy?
Can I take you to dinner?

154
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:14,225
- Are you feelin' better?
- Better than what?

155
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:18,479
Better than Amy Jacobs.

156
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:20,898
Wouldn't know.

157
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,067
If anybody knows, I say <i>you</i> do.

158
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,238
I got my own set of problems now,
thank you.

159
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:31,576
- How'd you scratch your face?
- Must've done it in my sleep.

160
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,497
Are you using again, Lucy?

161
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:40,751
I'm clean. Passed my test last week.

162
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:42,670
Ask Henry.

163
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,839
With flyin' colours.

164
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,597
Ever experienced
temporary blindness before?

165
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,893
I've probably experienced
just about everything once or twice.

166
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:59,896
It's all been pretty temporary.

167
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,274
That girl's in trouble, Lucy.

168
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,944
And there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

169
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:11,449
You understand? I can't help you.

170
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:21,042
I think you can, Lucy.

171
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,296
- How?
- That's something you have to tell me.

172
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,090
- What can I possibly do?
- Lead us to her.

173
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,969
I don't know where she is.

174
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:35,473
I don't care. I'm not interested.

175
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,314
That's too bad, Lucy, because
right now I think you're her best hope.

176
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:51,614
If I'm her best hope, then that little girl is
in a hell of a lot more trouble than you think.

- Is that Lucy?
- Yeah.

189
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,086
It was taken in 1978,
the week she was found.

190
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,589
<i>(shrieks)</i>

191
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:36,510
She'd been held in the dark so long,
her eyes were hypersensitive to the light.

<i>(wailing)</i>

193
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:42,266
Whoever held her captive
wasn't very big on conversation.

194
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,437
She's 13 years old here
and can barely string two words together.

195
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:53,069
- It's amazing she's gotten anywhere in life.
- By most yardsticks, she hasn't, Mulder.

196
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:59,533
- Look, I think we've got a break in the case.
- What is it?

197
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:05,122
School pictures were mailed out this week
to everyone in Amy's class except Amy.

198
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,376
- Who's the photographer?
- Larken Scholastic.

199
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:11,879
The photographer's assistant was fired
the day after the shoot.

200
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,464
A man named Carl Wade.

201
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,384
- What have you got on him?
- DMV's an old address.

202
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:21,722
But he spent much of the past 15 years
institutionalised for a bipolar condition.

203
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:24,266
The only thing current we have
is this photo,

204
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,061
taken by his employer trying out a camera.

205
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,398
- Have you shown this to Amy's sister?
- They're doing it now.

206
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,067
I'm gonna take it and show it to Lucy.

- Lucy, wait.
- No. I'm done with you.

212
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,565
I just wanna ask you a question.

213
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,652
- Lucy, wait a second.
- Don't... touch me.

214
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,532
I don't like to be touched.

215
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,579
I'm sorry.

216
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,925
I was doin' OK until this. You know?

Figures.

218
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,432
I just wanna show you a photograph, OK?

219
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,400
You recognise him, don't you?

220
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:43,447
Lucy!

Ow!

226
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,552
Lucy?

227

<i>(Lucy sobs)</i>

228
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,229

<i>(Lucy sobs)</i>

230
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:56,747
He's probably changed a lot
over the last 17 years.

231
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,417
Did you even know his name?

232
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,756
Carl Wade.

233
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,010
He worked as a photographer's assistant.

234
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:14,223
School pictures, mostly.
That's where he saw Amy Jacobs.

235
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:23,107
- So what do you want from me?
- Tell me what you're goin' through.

236
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,529
It might feel good to tell somebody.

237
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,243
I feel like it's happening all over again.

238
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:39,289
You can actually feel
what she's going through, can't you?

239
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:48,382
- I don't wanna go through this again.
- Lucy, she needs your help.

240
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,927
- There's nothing I can do.
- Lucy...

<i>(car pulls up)</i>

242
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,901

<i>(door opens and closes)</i>

244
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,417
- We're arresting Lucy Householder.
- Why?

245
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,794
I think you know why, Agent Mulder.

246
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,673
- What the hell is happening?
- Mulder...

247
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:33,510
The blood on Lucy's uniform
was an exact DNA match.

248
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,764
- Lucy was covered in Amy Jacobs' blood.
- She didn't do it.

249
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:39,016
It's incontrovertible evidence.

250
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,185
(Eubanks) Agent Mulder!

251
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:49,109
- Where is she?
- She was just here.

252
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,820
Well, she's gone now.

253
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,119
(Amy) Please!

254
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,789
I'm... I'm thirsty.

255
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:04,166
You shouldn't have run.

256
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:11,340
I was taking care of you.
I thought you understood that.

257
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:16,178
- Why did you run away?
- Please, mister! I need some water!

258
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,058
You shouldn't have run!

259
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,355
Please...

260
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,191
I'm so thirsty.

I don't wanna die here.

00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,444
Please, mister. <i>(sobs)</i>

<i>- Don't let me die!
- (door slams)</i>

267
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:29,293
- You'll drive her away with this.
- She was driven away. I'm tryin' to find her.

268
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:33,046
Witnesses placed her across town
at the exact time of the kidnapping.

269
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,717
- I'm well aware of the facts.
- Trust me. She's not workin' with Wade.

270
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,887
How'd she get the blood on her?

271
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,473
She may have bled it.

272
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,893
She bled Amy Jacobs' blood?

273
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:49,229
It may explain why there was
so little of it in Amy's bedroom.

274
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,982
Agent Eubanks. Line three.

275
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:56,945
I don't have time for this nonsense.
We've got a young girl's life at stake.

276
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:02,743
I hate to say this, Mulder,
but I think you just ran out of credibility.

277
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:06,914
- He's wrong, Scully.
- You are protecting her beyond reason.

278
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,458
I think she's connected to Amy Jacobs,

279
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,418
just not the way
everybody else thinks she is.

280
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,755
Did you consider she may be
connected to Carl Wade?

281
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,591
Carl Wade?
Why would she be connected with him?

282
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,886
Abused children crave their parents' love

283
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,513
and hostages develop sympathy
for their captors.

284
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:26,600
Maybe Lucy developed
an emotional dependency.

285
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,937
After five years in a dark pit,
I'm sure they had a connection.

286
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,022
Just not what <i>you</i> suggest.

287
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,859
It makes more sense than the notion
that she's bleeding Amy's blood.

288
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:41,698
I think Wade's abduction of Amy triggered
some kind of physical response in Lucy.

289
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,742
Some kind of empathic transference.

290
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,703
That's how I account for
what Lucy's going through.

291
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:50,040
And for the identical words
that corresponded to Amy...

292
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,542
...and the spontaneous wounds and blood.

293
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:57,464
- Then why did she run, if she's innocent?
- Because she's afraid.

294
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,967
You don't see what you're doing, do you?

295
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,302
You are so close to this,
you just don't see it.

296
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:03,387
What don't I see?

297
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,973
The extreme rationalisation that's going on.

298
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,893
Your identification with the victim.
Or, in this case, the suspect.

299
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,396
You're becoming an empath yourself.

300
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:15,899
You are so sympathetic to Lucy as a victim,
like your sister...

301
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:19,403
...that you can't see her
as capable of committing this crime.

302
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,655
You don't think I've thought of that? I have.

303
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,658
Not everything I do and think
goes back to my sister.

304
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:28,078
You of all people
should realise that motivations...

305
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:32,374
...can be more complex than the result
of one childhood experience.

306
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,876
Agent Mulder!

307
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,714
We've got a man on the way in
who spotted Wade.

308
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:47,764
Yeah, that's the guy. I offered to fix his flat.

309
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,601
I tried to do the guy a favour
and he went wacko on me.

310
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:56,106
- He freaked the minute I got outta my truck.
- What about the girl? Was she with him?

311
00:30:56,231 --> 00:31:00,027
I didn't see anyone else.
Guess she could've been in the trunk.

312
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,946
- Can you give us an exact spot?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,206
Right in the middle of nowhere.

314
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,792
- Which way was the car headed?
- West.

315
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:21,798
Interstate 12... County 15 North... 903...

316
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,594
Look at this. Right off the 903.

317
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:31,475
- Easton?
- That's where Lucy was found 17 years ago.

318
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,232
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

319
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:01,004
It's a small town. Somebody's bound
to know Wade's face, know where he lives.

320
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:06,009
But we already stick out like a sore thumb.
If we canvass, someone'll phone him.

321
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,845
He's a photographer, right?

322
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:14,017
- Yeah.
- He should have an account here.

323
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,188
<i>(sobbing)</i>

324
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:45,609
Amy?

325
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,281
Mulder?

326
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:54,117
- Yeah.
- What's happening? Did you find her?

327
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:30,320
Where are they, Lucy?

328
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,824
Tell us where Wade took Amy.

329
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,785
I don't know.

330
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,998
Anything happens to that girl, Lucy,
and you'll be tried as an accomplice.

331
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,003
- Were they here when you arrived?
- No.

332
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,839
- You haven't seen or spoken with 'em?
- I said no.

333
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:52,008
Then why are you here?

334
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:55,595
- I don't know.
- Just showed up for no reason?

335
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,014
That's what you ask us to believe?

336
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,685
I've been here before.

337
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,853
A long time ago.

338
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,940
It was where he kept me.

339
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,859
So why are you here now?

340
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,365
Take her outside and place her in custody.

341
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,868
No. I'll take her.

342
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,204
- Come on, Lucy.
- Agent...

343
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,373
It's all right.

344
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,061
<i>(Mulder opens car door)</i>

345
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:50,317
He hasn't touched her. Not yet.

346
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,823
He wants to, but he can't.
That's why he takes the pictures.

347
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:00,577
What else, Lucy? Tell me what else.

348
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:08,918
If he can't have her all to himself,
that's when he's dangerous.

349
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,588
That's when he'll start hurting her.

350
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,757
- You came to help her.
- No.

351
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,844
Why else would you come back here
if not for Amy? You're sharing her pain.

352
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:21,097
- I can't!
- You're the survivor.

353
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:25,268
You're the strong one.
Now Amy needs some of your strength.

354
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:30,899
- She's not gonna make it.
- She has to. And you have to help her.

355
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,570
She's cold.

356
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,365
She's cold... and wet.

357
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,367
<i>(coughs)</i>

358
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:45,246
- Lucy, <i>sit</i> down. <i>Sit</i> down.
- <i>(Lucy continues to cough)</i>

359
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:54,130
Mulder! They found Wade's car
north of here.

360
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,472
- They're in the water.
- What?

361
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:06,976
- There's a river nearby. I think they're there.
- But it's east. The car was north.

362
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,481
Wade lives here. He knows these woods.
He could be doubling back.

363
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:17,570
- Did she tell you that?
- No, but I think she's trying to.

364
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,572
Mulder, wait!

365
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,159
Stay with her. And get word to Eubanks

366
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:26,121
that Wade may be heading
towards the river.

367
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,833

Nobody...

374
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:54,983
Nobody's gonna spoil us.

378
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,708
Can you sit up? Can you breathe?
Are you able to breathe?

379
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:20,425
This is Agent Kreski. I've got an emergency
medical situation. Requesting EMS. Over.

380
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,651
Wade!

381
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:41,404
Federal officer! Hold it right there!

382
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,853
She's not breathing.

383
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,939
No pulse either.

384
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,532
One, two, three, four...

385
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:27,742
Come on, Amy, breathe!

386
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:32,622
...two, three, four, five...

387
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,462
There's nothing.

388
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:43,550
Mulder, it's no good. I'm sorry.

389
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,802
Damn it, Amy, come on!

390
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,137
Stop! You can't help her.

391
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,976
Mulder, it's no use.

392
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,562
Mulder, stop it.

393
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:57,564
Stop it.

394
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,482
Mulder, stop!

395
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,174
<i>(gurgle)</i>

396
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:27,760

<i>(Amy coughs)</i>

398
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:40,023
- She's breathing.
- Have you got her? Is that her?

399
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,525
Yeah, we got her!

400
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,947
We need an EMS unit here right away
with heat and oxygen.

401
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:53,453
They're close. They're up at Wade's place
right now, workin' on Lucy Householder.

402
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:56,706
<i>(Amy coughs)</i>

403
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,877
I'm cold. I wanna go home.

404
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,005
It's gettin' dark.
We have to get her off the river.

405
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:09,010
<i>(coughs)</i>

406
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,902
She just started coughin'.
Then she couldn't breathe.

407
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:29,906
By the time the EMS guys got here,
she was already gone.

408
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,898
- How's Amy?
- She's exhausted.

409
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:48,151
But it looks like she'll be fine.

410
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:51,154
The doctors will keep her
for a day or two just to be sure.

411
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:54,782
- How serious were her injuries?
- Wade must have left her alone.

412
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:58,077
There were no injuries.

413
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,164
He dragged her through the woods
for at least a mile.

414
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:06,085
I know, Mulder. I can't explain it.
She didn't have a cut on her.

415
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:12,341
Nobody wants to talk about that right now.
They're just relieved to have her back safe.

416
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,635
Did they finish up on Lucy?

417
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:19,348
Yes. They, uh... they brought in
a state pathologist last night.

418
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,186
So I stopped by to get
the autopsy reports on my way.

419
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:25,688
She drowned, didn't she?

420
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:29,859
They found five litres of water in her lungs.

421
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:35,531
She saved Amy's life.

422
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:38,493
Mulder...

423
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:45,625
Whatever there was between them,
you were part of that connection.

424
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,211
Did you think about that?

425
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,379
Lucy may have died for Amy...

426
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:54,801
...but without you
they never would have found her.

427
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:57,386
I think she died for more than Amy.

428
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:01,224
What do you mean?

429
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,395
I think finally it was...

430
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,857
...the only way she could escape.

431
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:14,987
The only way she could forget
what happened 17 years ago.

432
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:20,743
Finally the only way
she could outrun Carl Wade.
