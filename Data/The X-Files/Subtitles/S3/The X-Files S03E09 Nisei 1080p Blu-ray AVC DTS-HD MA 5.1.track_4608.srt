00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:16,101
<i>(child)</i> Hurry up!

2
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:54,389
All clear!

3
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,710
<i>(speaks Japanese)</i>

4
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,967
Come on in.

5
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:07,559
- What are you watching?
- Something that just came in the mail.

6
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:11,229
That's not your usual brand
of entertainment.

7
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,983
- What is it?
- According to the ad I answered...

8
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:18,361
...it's an alien autopsy.
Guaranteed authentic.

9
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:23,575
- You spent money for this?
- $29.95. Plus shipping.

10
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,747
This is even hokier than the one
they aired on the Fox network.

11
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,584
- You can't see what they're operating on.
- But it does look authentic.

12
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,420
I mean, the setting and the procedures.

13
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:39,424
I mean, it does look as if an actual autopsy
is being performed, doesn't it?

14
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:42,427
Well, I don't know why they would
be wearing gas masks.

15
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:47,182
Maybe it's because of this green substance
they seem to be extracting from the subject.

16
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:51,269
- Can you identify that?
- Olive oil? Snake oil?

17
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,188
I suppose you think it's alien blood.

18
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,941
It's widely held that aliens don't have blood.

19
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:59,361
- If this is an alien autopsy...
- Where's the alien?

20
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:02,614
But what's so intriguing
to me is the striking <i>lack</i> of detail.

21
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:07,118
- Well, what do you want for $29.95?
- That autopsy you saw on TV was so fake...

22
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:11,039
- ...because it tried to show too much.
- And this is real because it doesn't?

23
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:14,626
Yes, and because of, uh... because of this.

24
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:30,475
- Who's selling these tapes?
- Some guy in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

25
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,980
Claims he pulled it off the satellite dish
at two in the morning.

26
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:23,695
- Front door's boarded up.
- Back door's been busted open.

27
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,865
Hope nobody let the rat out.

28
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,731
Mulder, in here.

29
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:10,825
- <i>He's</i> still warm.

Come on down.

32
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,093
I get tired of losin' my gun.

33
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,935
OK, now face the fence.

34
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:23,064
Face the fence!

35
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,068
What's your name?

00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,487
<i>(speaks Japanese)</i>

37
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:33,324

- (Japanese)

38
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:37,078
Great.

39
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:39,831
Give me the bag.

40
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,667
Give me the bag.

41
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:49,090
OK, let's go.

42

- <i>Let's g0!</i>
<i>- (Japanese)</i>

43
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,203
Either they can't locate an interpreter,
or the interpreter...

44
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:22,123
...didn't interpret the instructions
and got lost somewhere.

45
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,543
- Did you try the FBI field office?
- This is a tall request...

46
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,046
...in Allentown this time of night.

47
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:31,633
Well, look at this. A beacon in the night.

48
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:41,226
- Agent Mulder. Scully.
- This is a surprise, sir.

49
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,229
- You don't speak Japanese, by any chance?
- I wish I could.

50
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,398
- It might save us all some embarrassment.
- What do you mean?

51
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:51,486
I'm with a federal attorney,
trying to sort out a little international mess.

52
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,489
- He said you made an arrest tonight.
- A murder suspect.

53
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,909
- You're gonna have to release him.
- What are you talking about?

54
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,203
According to the Japanese
diplomatic corps,

55
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:02,580
the man is a high-ranking diplomat.

56
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:05,166
This man sitting in here?

57
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,338
- If that's Kazuo Sakurai.
- I didn't get his name.

58
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:14,843
- I was too busy getting my ass kicked.
- What about the victim or the paperwork?

59
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:18,096
It's all gotta be handled
by some other agency.

60
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:21,933
What are you two doing out here anyway?

61
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:24,769
Tracking down a video-piracy thing.

62
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,522
I suggest you keep your nose clean

63
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:31,192
and head straight back to Washington,
Agent Mulder...

64
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:34,279
...before someone takes another swipe at it.

65
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:51,713
I don't know, Mulder. ltjust doesn't track.
What would a Japanese diplomat be doing...

66
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,966
...in that house with a dead man
with his head in a pillowcase?

67
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,304
Obviously not strengthening
international relations.

68
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,474
- Well, what do you wanna do now? Drop it?
- I paid my $29.95, Scully.

69
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,229
I think I'm entitled to a few more answers,
don't you think?

70
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:11,649
- What are you doing?
- I just remembered a piece of evidence...

71
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,235
...that I forgot to turn in.

72
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:29,083
- (Scully) What are those?
- They look like satellite photos.

73
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:33,087
- What would he be doing with these?
- What would he be doing with a list...

74
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:36,424
...of Mutual UFO Network members
in the Allentown area...

75
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,594
...with the name Betsy Hagopian circled?

76
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:45,516
Maybe he was gonna fit her
for a pillowcase too.

77
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:48,603
Why don't you stick around
and check it out in the morning?

78
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,522
- What are you gonna do?
- Go back to DC, like a good boy.

79
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:55,985
Like Skinner told me to do.
Show these to a few friends of ours.

80
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,698
The name of the boat is the Talapus.

81
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,369
Just gotta love them German optics.

82
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:08,456
- You're saying it's from a German satellite?
- No, the optics are German.

83
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:12,543
The technology is probably ours,
but the satellite is most likely Japanese.

84
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:16,214
- Launched from South America.
- Gotta love that global economy, huh?

85
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,967
- Where'd you get this?
- Japanese diplomat.

86
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,888
I'm surprised. The Japanese are very
secretive about their espionage capabilities.

87
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:28,476
- And careful with their intelligence data.
- What exactly are they spying on there?

88
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,979
The Talapus was a salvage ship
out of San Diego.

89
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:34,565
They were looking for a Japanese sub
that went down in World War ll.

90
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,652
It was rumoured to be carrying
a load of gold bullion.

91
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:41,155
- Did they find it?
- Not according to all the reports.

92
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:44,742
But, looking at this photo,
the ship never returned to San Diego.

93
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:47,662
- Why do you say that?
- The rest of these photos...

94
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:51,499
...they track the ship
through the Panama Canal,

95
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,459
all the way to Newport News, Virginia.

96
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:57,213
- The naval shipyard.
- But why would they go there?

97
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:01,676
Maybe what they found
wasn't a Japanese sub.

98
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,431
Good evening, Mr Sakurai.

99
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:03,321
- Hi. Betsy Hagopian?
- I'm sorry. Betsy's not here right now.

100
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:07,116
Is there some way that
I can get in touch with her?

101
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:10,578
- I'm sorry. My name is Dana Scully.
- I know you.

102
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:14,916
- No, I think you must be mistaken.
- We saw you.

103
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,585
Penny! Penny, come here.

104
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,421
I'm afraid I'm not who you think I am.

105
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:23,174
Oh, my God.

106
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,928
She's one.

107
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,806
- One what?
- One of us.

108
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,857
There must be some kind of mistake.
I work for the FBI.

109
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm here conducting a murder investigation.

110
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,528
A murder?

111
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:48,116
Cathy, I'm here at Betsy's. Call the group
and get everyone over here right away.

112
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,120
A man named Steven Zinnzser
was murdered about two miles from here.

113
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:55,706
- Penny, do you hear that?
- Steve Zinnzser was murdered?

114
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,543
- Did you know him?
- He was a member of our chapter.

115
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,712
But you understand I'm not a member.
I'm an FBI agent.

116
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:06,884
- That's what you said.
- But at the door you said I was one of you.

117
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:13,558
Did you have an unexplained event
in your life last year?

118
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:16,644
Were you missing for some time
that can't be accounted for?

119
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:21,399
- Why did you ask me that?
- I think you'd better sit down, Miss Scully.

120
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:25,361
I think there's some people
you're gonna wanna meet.

121
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:32,743
- Talapus?
- It's a salvage ship registered in San Diego.

122
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:38,916
You went out to meet the boat when
customs wouldn't allow it into port.

123
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,835
Oh, yeah. That's right.

124
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,504
But it wasn't customs preventing
her landing. It was the DEA.

125
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:48,009
- The DEA? Why? What was the problem?
- They were searching for contraband...

126
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:51,179
...if I remember correctly.
The boat came through Panama.

127
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:54,098
There was concern that
her crew had picked up a shipment.

128
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,685
- Did they find anything?
- They were never aboard.

129
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:02,106
I think there was a question of confiscating
the boat if the crew were to be arrested.

130
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:05,193
- Were they?
- Apparently not.

131
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:09,030
They were called off and the boat
put out to sea the following morning.

132
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:12,617
- Well, that doesn't make any sense.
- Excuse me?

133
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,622
The Talapus came nonstop from Panama.
She would have had to stop to refuel.

134
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,458
I don't have all the details in my head.

135
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,461
Would you see if there's
any paperwork on this?

136
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,048
See if there's a heading
or a destination for the Talapus?

137
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:31,969
- That might take some time.
- Oh, that's all right. I'm happy to wait.

138
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:44,315
But I've never met any of you.
I've never seen any of you before in my life.

139
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,653
You may not remember.
You've only had one experience.

140
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,906
Most of us here have been
taken many times.

141
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:56,827
Taken? Taken where?

142
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,081
The bright, white place.

143
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:06,003
You remember it, don't you?

144
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:11,092
- I don't know.
- There are men there performing tests.

145
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:19,517
- What men?
- They don't reveal themselves.

146
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,020
They take our memories away,
but somehow they start to seep back.

147
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:27,358
Some may have come back to you
but they didn't make sense.

148
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,945
D'you know about regression hypnosis?

149
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,030
Yes. I'm...

150
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,700
Have you ever considered it?

151
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,036
I'm sorry.
I don't think I'm ready to discuss this.

152
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,039
You're afraid to remember, aren't you?

153
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,044
That's OK. We were all afraid at first.

154
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,980
Agent Mulder?

155
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,204
<i>(car tyres screech)</i>

156
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,509
I don't know. When I opened that door
and saw you standing there...

157
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:26,680
...it was like a revelation.
The image of your face was so clear to me.

158
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:29,099
But why is it that I don't remember you?

159
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,936
All you remember
in the beginning is the light.

160
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:37,358
And then sometimes the faces of the men
that performed the tests.

161
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:56,710
How do you know that you're not
mistaking me for somebody else?

162
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:59,296
You have the mark, don't you?

163
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,716
What mark?

164
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,718
Here.

165
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:07,555
On the back of your neck.

166
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:11,559
We all have them.
It's where they put the implants.

167
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,910
I really have to go. I just came...

168
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:32,830
- To see Betsy.
- Yes. To see Betsy Hagopian.

169
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:36,166
Why are you all at her house? Where is she?

170
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:43,007
- What's wrong with her?
- Betsy's in the advanced stages...

171
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,759
...of an undiagnosed cancer ailment.

172
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:49,346
Her body's full of tumours that
won't respond to any treatment.

173
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:52,266
And you think this is
the result of her abductions?

174
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,020
They've been taking Betsy
since she was in her teens.

175
00:23:56,145 --> 00:24:00,107
- This is what's gonna happen to all of us.
- What do you mean?

176
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,446
I don't know if you understand this or not,
Dana, but we're all gonna end up like Betsy.

177
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,033
We're all dying
because of what they do to us.

178
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,628
I think they found
what they were looking for.

179
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:12,382
I don't remember giving you a key.

180
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:16,303
I came to see you.
Obviously I was late for the party.

181
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:21,391
- Yeah, I guess I should really fire my maid.
- Put the gun down, Mulder.

182
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,977
Somebody else might get hurt.

183
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:30,150
- What are you talking about?
- Kazuo Sakurai, the diplomat you detained.

184
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,319
Our murder suspect.

185
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,322
He didn't make his flight last night.

186
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:40,494
This morning his body was found
floating face down in the C&O Canal.

187
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:44,331
I think we can assume
he wasn't diving for pearls.

188
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,083
The Japanese government believes

189
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,837
that he was murdered
for the contents of a briefcase.

190
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,341
- A piece of evidence that wasn't logged in.
- What do they think was in it?

191
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:57,928
I've got the State Department
breathing down my neck, Mulder.

192
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,055
The Japanese want to prosecute this

193
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,432
outside of diplomatic channels,
so cut the crap.

194
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,436
- Am I being accused of murder?
- Where's the briefcase?

195
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,856
Agent Scully has it.

196
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,859
- She has it in the trunk of her rental car.
- Where is she?

197
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,862
I haven't spoken to her
since I left her in Allentown.

198
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:18,448
You better find her. Because whatever
you stepped in on this case...

199
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:22,536
...is being tracked into my office,
and I don't like the smell of it.

200
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,372
Mind if I tidy up in here a bit first?

201
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,794
This is bigger than me,
you or the FBI, Agent Mulder.

202
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:46,310
I hope you've got other names in your phone
book. I'm taking myself off the hook on this.

203
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,313
You're on your own.

204
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,165
Hello, Fox.

205
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:11,585
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

206
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,760
I understand you're in a difficult position.

207
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,013
Don't look so stunned.
I'm on the intelligence committee.

208
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,849
Secrets are the only real currency
we deal in.

209
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,186
- Then you know what I'm up against.
- Perhaps better than you do.

210
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:32,606
Which, I assume, is why you've come here.

211
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,525
I need your advice on how to proceed.

212
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:39,279
- Return the satellite photos.
- I'd be implicating myself.

213
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:45,535
A good chess player knows
which pieces to sacrifice... and when.

214
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:48,705
I can't afford to be entangled
in a murder investigation.

215
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,124
- Why?
- Because of what I've seen.

216
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,461
It would give them time to bury it
where I might not find it again.

217
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:57,047
Do you trust me, Fox?

218
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:01,551
Then let me earn your trust with the truth.

219
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,305
I'm listening.

220
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,239
Several weeks ago in Knoxville, Tennessee,
four Japanese nationals were murdered.

221
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:27,494
All prominent doctors apparently engaged
in a highly classified project.

222
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,371
What kind of project?

223
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:33,750
The autopsy of an extraterrestrial life form,
was that part of it?

224
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:39,840
I can't tell you. Some secrets
do remain secret, Fox, even to me.

225
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:44,761
I was only just now given the names
of the murdered scientists.

226
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:48,515
The credentials, however,
are a matter of public record.

227
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:52,602
Past deeds which may illuminate
present treacheries.

228
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,772
Your time is limited.

229
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:59,860
Before you become, as you say,
entangled in this...

230
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:04,781
...past the point of being about
to fully understand or expose it.

231
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,617
What am I onto here?

232
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:10,537
Monsters begetting monsters.

233
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,603
<i>(knocking)</i>

234
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,319
- Scully.
- Why is the door locked?

235
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,906
- I have something to show you.
- Do you have any idea where I've been?

236
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:49,076
- Allentown?
- I went to go see those MUFON members...

237
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,662
- ...to find out about Betsy Hagopian.
- What'd you find?

238
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:57,250
I found out that she's dying, along with a lot
of other women who claim to be dying too.

239
00:31:57,334 --> 00:32:00,587
All of them who say that
they have these implanted in them.

240
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,508
It's the same thing that I had
removed from my own neck.

241
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,345
- But you're fine, aren't you, Scully?
- Am I? I don't know, Mulder.

242
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,641
They said that they know me,
that they've seen me before. It was freaky!

243
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:15,268
They know things about me,
my disappearance.

244
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:18,021
That is disturbing.

245
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:22,692
But I don't think you should freak out
until we find out what this thing is.

246
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,861
<i>(phone rings)</i>

247
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,490
Mulder.

248
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,536
- I got a fax coming.
- What is this?

249
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,039
A group of Japanese medical officers
taken during World War ll.

250
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:39,459
- I've seen this man before.
- No, not unless you were in Japan...

251
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:43,046
- ...in the last 50 years.
- No. I've seen him before.

252
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,551
His name is Dr Takeo lshimaru.
He's been dead since 1965.

253
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,219
He was the commander of an elite section

254
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:52,055
of the Japanese medical corps
known as 731.

255
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,808
A unit now known to have
experimented on humans.

256
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,811
They performed vivisections
without anaesthesia...

257
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:01,064
...tested frostbite tolerance levels
on infants...

258
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:04,734
...exposed innocent prisoners of war
to diseases, the plague.

259
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,905
Like their Nazi counterparts,
they were never brought to justice.

260
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:11,908
- What are you doing with these?
- Four of these doctors...

261
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,995
...were on that video tape
performing that autopsy.

262
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,998
Yeah,
but you couldn't tell one from the other.

263
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:21,418
Somebody could.
Those same men were murdered yesterday.

264
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:25,172
- Found here, right on US soil.
- Murdered for what?

265
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,341
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Murdered by whom?

266
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:32,012
- Possibly our government.
- Ours? For what possible reason?

267
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,848
For continuing the work
the Nazis were doing,

268
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,516
trying to create an alien-human hybrid.

269
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,937
- Mulder, that is still a fantasy.
- Scully, after all you've seen!

270
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:44,691
All you've told me.
The tunnel filled with medical files...

271
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,944
...the beings moving past you,
the implant in your neck.

272
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:52,782
- Why do you refuse to believe?
- Believing's the easy part, Mulder.

273
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,619
I just need more than you. I need proof.

274
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,455
You think that believing is easy?

275
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:01,625
<i>(fax machine beeps)</i>

276
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,796
Well, we have proof. I identified
what those spy photos were tracking.

277
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,633
A ship that pulled a UFO
out of the Pacific Ocean...

278
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:14,304
...a UFO that's in a warehouse right now
being guarded by US military personnel.

279
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,974
A UFO that was probably carrying
that EBE we saw on that autopsy tape.

280
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,561
- What am I looking at?
- Part of our government's secret railroad.

281
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,231
Train cars used to carry test subjects...

282
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:27,651
...used to conduct that autopsy
we saw being performed.

283
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:32,322
- Where did you get this?
- From someone like you who wants proof.

284
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,825
Who's also willing to believe.

285
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:48,505
- Amazing.
- Do you know what it is?

286
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,675
Looks like some kind of microprocessor.

287
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,345
So you're saying that this is man-made?

288
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,933
What else would it be?
I mean, it's definitely state of the art.

289
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:04,104
The microlithography is extremely complex.

290
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:07,274
I've never seen anything
even close to this density.

291
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:10,277
Any way of finding out
who manufactures it?

292
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,114
There are a few companies out in San Jose,
a couple in Boston.

293
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,533
It could be any one of them.

294
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:20,620
- What are these chips used for?
- Video games, brake systems.

295
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,624
They're finding new apps every day.
I just read about one being designed...

296
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,545
...to help the severely disabled
operate computers using brain waves.

297
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:29,546
How?

298
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:33,633
Through direct electrochemical interface
with the cerebral cortex.

299
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,802
Pretty incredible, huh?

300
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,888
Yeah.

- The train yard in Quinnimont.

304
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:03,987
Some Japanese men just put someone
in one of those boxcars

305
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,822
from the satellite photos.

306
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:10,743

- Something serious is going down here.

- The thing they put in the train, it was alive.

Mulder...

309
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:19,752
I gotta get on that train. It's hooking up
with a Canadian train outside Cincinnati.

310
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,505
I was right about Dr lshimaru.

311
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,675
He isn't dead.
In fact, he's on your video tape.

312

Well, that's where you know him from, then.

313

- He's in danger.

325
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:35,471
- How do you know?
- He's tracking a train.

326
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:40,768
- You can't let him get on it.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

327
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,815
You've got to get word to him.

328
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,152
Why should I trust you?
You've lied to us before.

329
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:53,239
You're wasting time. Do you understand?

<i>- Why not'?
- Because they know where you are...</i>

333
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:17,263
...and they know what you're doing.

334
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:20,433
- Who told you that?
- Look, it's just too dangerous.

335
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,935
Who told you, Scully?

336
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:29,108
- Scully, it's coming.
- Let it go.

337
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:31,486
I can't.

338
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:39,202
Mulder, don't get on the train. Mulder!
