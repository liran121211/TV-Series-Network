1
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,628
Hey, I, uh...

2
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:46,256
Hey, I was playing that.

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,597
Yeah, I just went to go take a whiz
and now I'm back.

4
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,810
<i>- Even good guys blow it.
- Damn!</i>

5
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,274
You got a problem?

6
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:07,402
It's my game.

7
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,655
I was playing here.

8
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:12,658
Were you, pinhead? Now you're not.

9
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,161
Oh!

10
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:20,958
Maybe you didn't hear me right.
I, uh... I said it was my game.

11
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:25,629
It's his game.
Man, I'd step aside if I were you.

12
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:30,842
All right. You guys wanna play a game?

13
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,680
We'll play a game.

14
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,600
I go first.

15
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:47,150
Oh, man, you shouldn't have done that.

16
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,987
Why?

17
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,739
What's he gonna do?

18
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,873
<i>(6 country rock)</i>

19
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,053
So, is it my turn now?

20
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,807
I'm not wasting my time.

21
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,352
<i>(6 song from jukebox)</i>

22
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,754
<i>(6 same song from jukebox)</i>

23
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:53,110
I feel a new record coming on, man.

24
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:55,987
<i>(arcade game) Fight one, ready, go!</i>

25
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,337
Both eardrums are ruptured.

26
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,217
Cataracts over both eyes.
Probably heat-induced.

27
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:03,054
Probably? Looks like his heart
was cooked right in his chest.

28
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:06,975
I have to admit I've never seen
that kind of localised tissue damage.

29
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:12,105
Well, there is extensive charring along the
sternum, with concomitant rib fractures...

30
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,984
...consistent with electrocution
or exposure to high-voltage current.

31
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,153
But I see no point of contact.

32
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:22,616
Best I can figure is the lightning
struck the car, killed the kid on contact.

33
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,745
Were there contact wounds
on any of the other five victims?

34
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,582
I'd have to look at my notes.
It's clear to me what killed these kids.

35
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,918
- Lightning.
- Well, yeah.

36
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,339
Are you aware that
something like 60 people die

37
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:39,883
from lightning strikes each year?

38
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:44,054
- And five happened here in Connerville.
- It's statistically improbable...

39
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,223
There are only four deaths.

40
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:51,061
Stan, you don't have to defend your work.
Give us a minute, please?

41
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,563
Yeah, sure. I'll be in my office.

42
00:05:55,982 --> 00:06:01,279
My name's Teller. Sheriff's department.
I got word there was an FBI investigation.

43
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:04,574
- Yes, I'm Agent Scully.
- I know who you are.

44
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,619
I just wonder
what the hell you're doin' here.

45
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:15,293
These deaths match other cases of
fatalities attributed to lightning...

46
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:18,380
...with the same inconclusive
forensic evidence.

47
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,967
Do you, uh, know anything about lightning,
Agent Scully?

48
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,843
Yes, I know a little.

49
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:28,640
That lightning kills several people a year,
at home in the shower, or on the phone?

50
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:32,102
That people have seen it
dancing on the ground like balls?

51
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:36,481
The scientists will tell you that they
don't know what makes lightning work.

52
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,024
No, I didn't know that.

53
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:42,195
I know that, because I have breakfast
with those scientists every morning.

54
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,657
- I don't understand.
- That's as clear as glass(!)

55
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,203
Do you know what we manufacture here?
What one of our little local commodities is?

56
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,372
We make lightning.

57
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,875
Down at the Astadourian
Lightning Observatory.

58
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,880
100 ionised rods pointing up into the sky,
designed to stimulate lightning.

59
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,257
I didn't know that either.

60
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,429
You didn't do your homework, did you?
You're doing work that's already been done.

61
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,890
With all due respect,
these autopsies don't quite add up.

62
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:14,728
- Based on what?
- Based on my opinion as a medical doctor.

63
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:19,733
Then, based on your medical opinion,
if you had to give one...

64
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:22,027
...what do you think this boy died of?

65
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,449
Since there is no other explanation,

66
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,743
right now I'd have to concur
with the coroner.

67
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:33,288
That lightning is the most
probable cause of death.

68
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:38,627
And I won't have you or anyone else
suggesting otherwise to this boy's family.

69
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,759
- Feel free to jump in any time.
- Why? You were doing just fine.

70
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:52,432
- Do you have a theory on this?
- I just don't think it's lightning.

71
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,732
Mulder, wait.
What are you expecting to find here?

72
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:04,486
- I don't know yet.
- Would you stop for a second, please?

73
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,990
After everything we've just been through,
after all that we've just seen...

74
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:13,078
...I hope you don't think this is to do with
government conspiracies or UFOs.

75
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:15,914
No evidence so far indicates
either possibility.

76
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,666
What are you looking for?

77
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:21,127
Just cos a forensic profile isn't cut and dry
doesn't mean it's not true.

78
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,171
Teller's explanation works for you?

79
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:27,300
The only scientific conclusion is that
Jack Hammond was killed by lightning.

80
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:30,345
Then this lightning is more
predictable than Teller realises.

81
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,473
It has a definite preference
for the type of person it strikes.

82
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,225
- What?
- Look at the files.

83
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,061
Look at all the other victims.
They're all male, aged 17 to 21,

84
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,438
just like Jack Hammond.

85
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:43,400
At least let's go see where
Jack Hammond was killed.

86
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:46,695
Maybe we'll find something
we both can agree on.

87
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:55,995
Police found Hammond in his car
at 17 minutes past midnight.

88
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,623
The entire electrical system
was shorted out.

89
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:01,126
All the circuitry and wiring had melted.

90
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:04,713
Looks like he was trying
to get away in a big hurry.

91
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,339
Get away from what?

92
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,509
What time was Jack Hammond's
last pizza delivery?

93
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,805
Sometime between 11 and 11.30. Why?

94
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:17,559
Well, all these stores
would have been closed by 11.

95
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,728
Except maybe this one.

96
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:24,858
- Seven, eight, nine...
- Excuse me?

97
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,735
Oh! Uh...

98
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,278
Ten...

99
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,030
Eleven...

100
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,702
- What's your name?
- Uh... Zero.

101
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:39,289
Zero, do you mind if we talk for a minute?

102
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,458
What for?

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,877
I'm With the FBI.

104
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,130
All right.

105
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:58,725
- Were you working here last night?
- Sure. Every night.

106
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,395
Do you recognise this person?

107
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,232
Nah, never seen him.

108
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:10,403
Why don't you take a closer look?
He was here between 11 and 11.30.

109
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:14,199
He was killed in the parking lot.
That was his car.

110
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:18,119
So, if you were
standing here at this counter,

111
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:19,871
you must have seen it happen.

112
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,042
<i>Oh, that was him!</i>

113
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,140
Last I saw, the dude fed a bunch
of quarters into this one.

114
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,392
Then the ambulance shows up.

115
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:45,396
Before the ambulance showed up,
did you notice anything unusual outside?

116
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,152
It's hard to tell. I mean, the place gets pretty
loud. Kinda hard to hear much of anything.

117
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:54,656
Did you notice anyone else around
who might have seen something?

118
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:57,659
I can't, uh...

119
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,954
- I don't really remember.
- Scully, take a look at this.

120
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:04,791
- What?
- What were the names of the other victims?

121
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:09,671
Corey Hufferd, Darin Oswald,
Burke Roberts and Billy...

122
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,465
Darin Oswald. What's his middle name?

123
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,635
- Darin Peter. Why?
- DPO.

124
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:21,099
Darin Peter Oswald. Of the five victims,
wasn't he the only one to survive?

125
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:24,143
- Yes.
- Well, he was here last night.

126
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,902
<i>(6 heavy metal)</i>

127
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,012
Hey, Mrs Kiveat.

128
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,181
- God, Darin, you scared me!
- What?

129
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:06,519
- Where's Frank?
- Oh, he's out on a tow.

130
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,816
- Is there anything I can help you with?
- No. We're supposed to go to dinner.

131
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,695
Oh, are you hungry? I can get you
something to eat. I gotjelly donuts.

132
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,864
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?

133
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:22,368
They're from yesterday,
but they're still good. I had one.

134
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,872
Hey...

135
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,207
Mrs Kiveat...

136
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,172
Hey, about those things
that I said yesterday... I, uh...

137
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:45,975
Sorry I'm late, hon. I, uh...

138
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,020
I had to tow
that poor pizza delivery kid's car.

139
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:55,401
Oh, hey, Darin. I just got a call on the radio.

140
00:12:55,485 --> 00:13:00,073
Some people are coming to see ya.
They say they're with the FBI.

141
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,330
So this is the dude that died, huh?

142
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,499
It's pretty harsh, man.

143
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:15,546
- How'd it happen?
- They say he was struck by lightning.

144
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,715
Yeah... that happens.

145
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,051
Right outside the video arcade.

146
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:23,012
Not a cloud in the sky
from what we can tell.

147
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:26,933
You were there last night, weren't you?
Broke your own record, too.

148
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:29,727
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Well, you must have seen something.

149
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,858
Oh, no, man. When I'm into my game, man,
I'm there, you know?

150
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:40,947
It's like a nuclear explosion could go off,
right? And I wouldn't even notice.

151
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,449
Can I ask you a personal question?

152
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:47,662
- Yeah.
- Do you consider yourself a lucky person?

153
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,831
- Me?
- Yeah.

154
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,374
I don't think so.

155
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:54,752
Of all the people hit by lightning,
you're the only one to survive.

156
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,921
Don't you think you're lucky?

157
00:13:57,005 --> 00:14:00,383
Well, I guess if you look at it like that,
you could be right.

158
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,552
- I could be considered lucky.
- Mulder?

159
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,762
- Yeah?
- What's in your pocket?

160
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,143
- What happened?
- I don't know.

161
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:14,105
It just got hot all of a sudden.

162
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,815
Bummer.

163
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,361
I'm gonna go now.

164
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:25,658
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah. I'll see ya.

<i>Teenagers have been into piercing

00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:47,305

<i>...and I used to sleep in a belt at night...</i>

170
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,193
Why do you want to watch that stuff?
They're all a bunch of losers.

171
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:03,738
At least they're on TV. I don't see you on TV.

Manners don't cost, Darin. They're free!

174
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:12,497
What girl's gonna want
a belchin' fool like you?

- Maybe you'd be surprised.

<i>- (knock at door)
- Dude'?</i>

178
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,848
You won't believe who came by today!

179
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,267
- Let me guess. The FBI?
- How did you know?

180
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,145
- They came by the garage.
- How did they find you?

181
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,481
You tell me. You must have said something.

182
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,857
No, man!

183
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,026
I didn't say squat!

184
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:46,531
Wait up! Come on, man!

185
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,408
- You know I wouldn't do that to you.
- <i>(cow</i> moos)

- Cos I'm in the mood for a little barbecue.
- No, man, not the cows again!

188
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,670
Come on, don't! Don't do this! Not now!

00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,803
- I'm ready.

192
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,514

200
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,184
Are you OK, man?

201
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,068
Excellent.

202
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,413
Have that faxed to my office.
Right away if you can.

203
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,333
Thank you, Dean. I appreciate it.

204
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:25,963
What happened here, Sheriff?

205
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,175
Three dead cows.

206
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,510
- How do you think they died?
- Lightning.

207
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:36,224
I just got off with Dean at the observatory,
which is about a mile through those trees.

208
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,392
Did they report lightning last night?

209
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:42,230
They can detect every flash of lightning
on this planet. Did you know that?

210
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:46,108
- Each one emits radio waves at the exact...
- The Schumann resonance.

211
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,445
Eight cycles per second.
You can pick it up on any transistor radio.

212
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,781
See that, Sheriff? I did my homework.

213
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:55,284
Not much question that lightning
killed these cows last night.

214
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,995
Just like it killed Jack Hammond
the night before last.

215
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,790
Well, that's certainly the way it looks.

216
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,585
Let me show you something else.
It's right over here.

217
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,880
You see this? You know what this is? Huh?

218
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,177
It looks like a fulgurite.
That only happens with lightning.

219
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,889
When sandy soil fuses into glass
from the heat of a discharge.

220
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:19,725
How much more proof do you need? Hmm?

221
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:23,521
I'd say your business here is finished.

222
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:29,694
- Mulder, I'd have to say I think he's right.
- That we're wasting time chasing lightning?

223
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,946
Look at the evidence. What else could it be?

224
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,282
I don't know yet.

225
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:42,707
This is the first lightning strike
I've ever seen that left behind a footprint.

226
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:48,421
Here we go.

227
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:55,303
Considering it's a partial imprint,
there's a lot of information here.

228
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:59,307
That's great. Now can you make me
a little cherub that squirts water?

229
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,519
The tread looks like
a standard military boot. Men's.

230
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:07,189
- Size eight and a half.
- Eight and a half? That's pretty impressive.

231
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:09,567
Well, it says it right here on the bottom.

232
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,945
But I may have something even better.

233
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,031
When I cleaned the imprint
to take the mould...

234
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:17,366
...I found trace amounts
of a viscous substance

235
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,535
actually embedded in the fulgurite.

236
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,786
What is it?

237
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,664
Well, I'd have to conduct
a chemical analysis to be sure,

238
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:26,459
but... it looks like antifreeze.

239
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,504
- Darin Oswald.
- But why?

240
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:34,050
- And how?
- I don't know, but let's see if the shoe fits.

241
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,471
<i>(car tyres screech)</i>

242
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:44,685
- Jeez! You think you own the whole road?
- God!

243
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:48,147
YOU jerk!

244
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,859
Dude, what's happening?

245
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,445
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

246
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,031
Nothin'.

247
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,870
You know, I've been thinking.

248
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,623
First time for everything.

249
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,208
<i>(car horn)</i>

250
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,877
Oh, damn! ABS brakes.

251
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,048
I'm thinkin' we should go somewhere.
Get out of this hole.

252
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:19,345
Maybe check out Las Vegas. You could do
some serious damage someplace like that.

253
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,057
I'm not going to Las Vegas.
I'm not going anywhere without Mrs Kiveat.

254
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,935
Why do you think
she'll wanna go anywhere with you?

255
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,437
She failed you, remember?

256
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:30,731
She thinks you're a retard.

257
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:34,443
Forget school, man.
I'm talkin' about proving my love.

258
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,073
- How you gonna do that?
- By letting her know how I feel.

259
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,659
How all I ever think about is being with her.

260
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,994
Wake up, dude.

261
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:48,457
There's another slight problem.
She's married to your boss.

262
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,252
- Maybe I could fry him.
- Dude, he's your boss.

263
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,629
Not if he's dead, he won't be.

264
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,798
Are you high?

265
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,592
With the FBI hangin' around?

266
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,761
Just forget about it, OK?

267
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:05,015
You can't compete. Frank's good-looking,
he's got his own shop.

268
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:09,603
Plus, he fixes things,
instead of just smashin' stuff up.

269
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:14,650
A woman like that...

270
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,445
...wants someone special.

271
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,658
- I'm special.
- Right.

272
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,661
And I'm gonna show her
just how special I am.

273
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,552
Whoa...!

274
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:46,223
That was a good one! That was a good one!

275
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,685
Come on, man! Let's go check it out!

276
00:21:55,566 --> 00:22:00,446
Darin ain't worth much - I'm the first one
to say it. But he wouldn't hurt a soul.

277
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,157
What kind of trouble is he in, anyway?

278
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,035
Can we have a few minutes, Mrs Oswald?

279
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,663
Thank you.

280
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,403
- Mulder?
- Yeah?

281
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,822
- We've got a size match.
- Eight and a half?

282
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:48,160
Yeah. But it still doesn't prove
that he killed Jack Hammond.

283
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:53,374
- I'm surprised you haven't read that issue.
- Oh, I have.

284
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,710
April is the cruellest month,
but mine didn't come with this.

285
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:00,381
It was between Miss April
and Women of the Ivy League.

286
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:03,467
- Who is she?
- It looks like it's from a yearbook photo.

287
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,177
See?

288
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:06,595
Hmm.

289
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,598
There's a yearbook in Darin's closet.

290
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,157
Her name is Sharon Kiveat.

291
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:31,829
Kiveat. The garage where Darin works
is called Kiveat Auto Body.

292
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,624
<i>(traffic cop) Here you go!</i>

293
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:40,379
Let's go)!

294
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,801
All right, let's move it through here.

295
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:49,680
What happened?

296
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:53,058
Kid got centre-punched.
Just got his licence. He's pretty bad off.

297
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,311
Man, that's rough.

298
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,151
You guys ready for me
to start clearin' the road?

299
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,154
I'm just directing traffic.
Check with the deputy.

300
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,323
Hey, pal, are you OK?

301
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,784
You don't look so good.

302
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,500
Aarghhhh!

303
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,045
Somebody get the EMS guys!

304
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,758
- Easy. You'll be OK.
- What happened?

305
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,926
He just collapsed.

306
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:33,057
- Pulse is thready. I'll get the kit.
- Yeah.

307
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,727
It's all right, buddy. Here we go.

308
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:43,651
Where you goin'? What are you doin'?
Let's get outta here.

309
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,619
I got one... two... three.

310
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,789
- Give me 300 joules.
- Already charged.

311
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:01,210
No, it's not! Something's not
working here! Get the backup!

312
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,755
Hang in there, buddy!

313
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,223
Don't worry, Mr Kiveat.

314
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:17,309
I've seen how they do it on TV.

315
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,526
<i>(beeping)</i>

316
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,450
Wait, we got a rhythm.

317
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,619
HOW the hell...?

318
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:42,209
Rescue 911.

319
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,478
Let me give you a hand with that.

320
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,481
Thank you.

321
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,610
Mrs Kiveat? My name is Fox Mulder.
I'm with the FBI.

322
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,780
I know this is a hard time,
but I'd like to ask some questions.

323
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,991
You were in my
husband's garage yesterday.

324
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,701
Yes.

325
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:23,834
- I'm sorry...
- I'd like to ask you about Darin Oswald.

326
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,503
He was at the scene of the accident,
wasn't he?

327
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,964
Please, I need to see my husband.

328
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,269
I just talked to one of the EMS workers.
He was rattled.

329
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,938
- Why?
- Frank Kiveat's electrocardiogram.

330
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,107
Take a look at this. See that spike?

331
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,611
It indicates that electrical intervention
started his heart.

332
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:55,365
Except the defibrillator wouldn't charge.
The paddles were dead.

333
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,576
- How did he explain this?
- He didn't.

334
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,413
All he saw was Darin Oswald
touching Kiveat's chest.

335
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:07,377
I've been going over Oswald's chart. There's
something I want you to take a look at.

336
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:13,717
He was admitted five months ago
in cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure...

337
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:18,806
...with class-three burns on his back
and scalp. Resuscitated after 21 minutes...

338
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:22,726
Hang on, this is odd.
His blood test showed acute hypokalaemia.

339
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,478
Yeah, what is that?

340
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:28,482
A severe chemical imbalance characterised
by high sodium and low potassium levels.

341
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,734
- Electrolytes, right?
- Yeah.

342
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,820
What do electrolytes do?

343
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:37,950
They generate the electrical impulses in our
bodies. Every time our heart beats...

344
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,245
It's a leap, but what if
Oswald's electrolyte imbalance...

345
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,832
...lets him generate electricity
at levels higher than normal?

346
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,375
It doesn't work like that.

347
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:50,212
Unless his body is abnormally conductive.
If that heel print is Oswald's...

348
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:54,842
...he conducted millions of volts
into the ground and just walked away.

349
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,804
- You think he's some kind of lightning rod?
- No, that he is lightning.

350
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:02,224
And we've got to get to him
before he strikes again.

351
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,952
Dafln?

352
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,745
Darin!

353
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,583
- Darin.
- Don't you touch me, man!

354
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,751
- Relax, Darin.
- Don't you touch me!

355
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:34,548
We just want to talk to you, that's all.
Just ask you a few more questions.

356
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,301
I didn't do anything.

357
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:48,854
How many times do I have to say it?
I don't know how all those people died.

358
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,440
Why did you run when you saw us?

359
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:55,903
I was taking a walk.
Now, that's not against the law, is it?

360
00:28:56,987 --> 00:29:01,909
Anyway, you guys should be giving me
a medal. I mean, I saved my boss's life.

361
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,870
- We're not so sure.
- Why? Who told you that?

362
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,747
Who you been talkin' to?

363
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:11,043
You been talkin' to Zero?
He the one who told you that?

364
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,012
- What'd he say?
- Not much.

365
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,766
- Except that he's a hero.
- How'd he say he revived Kiveat?

366
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:30,270
CPR.
He claims he paid attention in health class.

367
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:34,399
I don't think he just resuscitated
Frank Kiveat. He set the whole thing up.

368
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:37,527
- Causing a heart attack?
- You see what he did to my phone?

369
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:40,572
So we charge him with
assaulting a cellular phone?

370
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:43,700
- We should run lab tests on this kid.
- Look where we are.

371
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:47,245
We don't have the capability
or the time to perform those tests.

372
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:51,166
And, without a confession, we can
only keep him in custody for 72 hours.

373
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,586
I can think of one other person
who might be able to help us.

374
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,882
Mrs Kiveat?

375
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:03,595
Please, I can't do this now.
I'm just leaving for the hospital.

376
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,181
Darin Oswald's in custody, Mrs Kiveat.

377
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,976
We arrested him this afternoon.

378
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:13,605
But we can't press criminal charges
without your help.

379
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,191
Is it OK if we come in?

380
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:27,744
I teach remedial reading at the high school.
Darin was my student.

381
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:30,872
How would you describe
your relationship with him?

382
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:34,918
Well, I'm not blind.
I knew he had a crush on me, but, uh...

383
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:39,381
I felt sorry for him. I thought he was just...

384
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:44,594
ltjust seemed he had more
than his share of bad luck.

385
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:47,806
Did you get him the job
at your husband's garage?

386
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:53,812
Yeah. And then about six months ago
I started getting these phone calls.

387
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:57,983
- Someone would call and then hang up.
- How did you know it was Darin?

388
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,569
The way he looked at me in the garage.

389
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,534
The phone calls made me feel
the same way. I just knew.

390
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:12,664
When did you first suspect that Darin
was involved in more than prank calls?

391
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:16,043
- He told me.
- He confessed to killing those people?

392
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:20,338
No, but he, uh...
he told me that he had... powers.

393
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:24,092
- Dangerous powers.
- When was this?

394
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,764
- Right after the last boy was killed.
- Jack Hammond?

395
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,895
See, at first I didn't believe him.
I thought he was just mouthing off.

396
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:38,356
- But after what happened today...
- Did you tell anyone?

397
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,525
Who would have believed me?

398
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:48,450
And I was afraid.
I was afraid of what he might do to me...

399
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,161
...and what he would...

400
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:55,207
...do to my husband.

401
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,461
Well, you don't have to be afraid any more.

402
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:04,758
You and your husband are safe as long as
we can count on your testimony.

403
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,272
- Where's Oswald?
- I sent him home.

404
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:23,151
- You released him? When?
- After I read your arrest report.

405
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,529
I'm gonna go call Sharon Kiveat.

406
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:29,616
"Suspicion of homicide
by emission of direct electric current."

407
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,034
You don't believe this?

408
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:35,205
I believe that Darin Oswald was involved
somehow in those four deaths.

409
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,958
And that it was irresponsible
for you to let him go.

410
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,670
Let's get this straight.
This kid's throwing lightning bolts?

411
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,839
- In effect.
- "In effect."

412
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,715
There is no scientific basis for that claim.

413
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,803
It's speculation.
No hard evidence, no proof...

414
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:53,056
You said yourself,
science can't explain how lightning works.

415
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,225
Mrs Kiveat's not home.

416
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,602
She's on her way to the hospital.

417
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,582

What are you doing, man?

423
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,666

00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,964
Excuse me, miss. Call Security.

428
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:54,094
Have them deny entry to the hospital
to everyone except emergency personnel.

429
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:03,770
Sharon?

430
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,524
What is it?

431
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:12,112
- We need you to come with us right away.
- Why? What's wrong?

432
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,532
Darin Oswald.
He was released from custody.

433
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:19,536
But how? How could that happen?

434
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,038
You said not to worry, that we were safe.

435
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,791
We don't have much time.
Come with us and we'll explain.

436
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:29,045
The doctor said my husband cannot leave
this room. I'm not leaving him here.

437
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,256
I'll stay with him. You go with Agent Scully.

438
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,340
No.

439
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,217
Sharon, please.

440
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,973
He's here.

00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,935

442
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,819
<i>(elevator bell)</i>

443
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,209
He's dead.

444
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:10,211
Oh, my God!

445
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,755
How many other access points to this floor?

446
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,050
- Other than the elevator, the stairway.
- Stay with them.

447
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,719
- Mulder...
- I'm going after Oswald.

448
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,554
- Mrs Kiveat?
- Darin...

449
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,723
- Don't move.
- Where is she?

450
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,975
I said, <i>don't</i> move.

451
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,772
Darin...

452
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:18,363
- Mrs Kiveat?
- Stop. I'm warning you.

453
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,283
All right, come with me,
please, Mrs Kiveat...

454
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,494
...cos there's some things...

455
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:28,998
- Stuff I need to tell you.
- I want you to step back inside that room.

456
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:33,128
- Are you oomin' with me?
- She's not going anywhere with you, Darin.

457
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,254
I can hurt you!

458
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,756
I can hurt you, too. You have three seconds.

459
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,592
- One...
- Now I'm done foolin' around now!

460
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,344
Stop it!

461
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,851
I'll go with you. OK?

462
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:51,062
If that's what you want, we'll go. Just...

463
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,566
Stop it.

464
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:58,445
Sharon, we can work this all out right here.

465
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,613
No, we can't.

466
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,741
All right.

467
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,621
All right, then.

468
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,349
You were the only person that was
ever nice to me, you know that?

469
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:34,939
I mean...
Hey, you remember that first day in class...

470
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:38,359
...when you wore that green dress
with the yellow flowers on it?

471
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,863
And when you stood
in front of the window...

472
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:44,657
...you could almost see through it?

473
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,952
Where are we going?

474
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:53,875
- Where are you taking me?
- I don't know. Anywhere you wanna go.

475
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,879
I got money from the cash machine,
you know?

476
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,425
Plus, you know,
we can take any car you want.

477
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,886
You know, you just take
your pick, you know.

478
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:09,057
I mean, we can take an Accord or a Maxima.

479
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,559
Do you like any of those?

480
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:15,939
Or, you know,
if you don't wanna go Japanese, you know...

481
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:18,858
- <i>How about</i> a <i>Taurus?</i>
- <i>(car starts up and revs)</i>

482
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,074
No, you're right.
You know, all these cars suck.

483
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:29,577
We'll just boost one of 'em for right now,
and then...

484
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,789
...we'll trade it later.

485
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:43,841
Just take it easy, Mrs Kiveat, all right?

486
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,262
No!

487
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,308
- Mrs Kiveat!
- Hey, come over here!

488
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,602
Come on over here!

489
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,790
Mrs Kiveat?

490
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:19,085
Mrs Kiveat, where are you?

491
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:28,595
Ah, come on now! I said I'd take care of you!

492
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,639
What else did you want?

493
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,809
I'd have given you anything!

494
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,395
Anything you wanted!

495
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:41,107
- Mrs Kiveat!
- Hey, son, turn around.

496
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:44,861
Let's go. I don't know what
kind of trouble you're up to...

497
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:49,073
- ...but I want some answers.
- No! <i>I</i> want some answers!

498
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,869
Where is she?

499
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:56,205
Come on, now! You're pissin' me off!

500
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,588
Teller, get out of there!

501
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:07,008
(shouts) Tell me where she is!

502
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:05,566
I just got off the phone with the coroner.
He's ruling Teller's death accidental.

503
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,735
Lightning?

504
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:10,363
What do the scientists
at the observatory say?

505
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:13,741
They also reported lightning last night.

506
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:17,412
I talked to the DA.
He has no idea how to begin building a case.

507
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,498
- What about the tests?
- The results came in five minutes ago.

508
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,250
And?

509
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:25,211
Nothing unusual was detected, Mulder.

510
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,382
The electrolytes, the blood gas levels,
brain-wave activity...

511
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:32,343
...based on the signs
of all the gathered data...

512
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:37,014
Darin Oswald is a perfectly normal,
perfectly healthy kid.

513
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,184
You believe that, Scully?

514
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:44,439
Neither do I.

515
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:48,776
