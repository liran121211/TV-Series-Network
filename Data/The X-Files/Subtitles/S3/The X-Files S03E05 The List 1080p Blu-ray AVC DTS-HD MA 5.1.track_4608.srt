1
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:24,067
- Simon, are you ready?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,555
- ...reincarnation...
- Excuse me, Warden. It's five o'clock, sir.

3
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:56,725
- How's Neech?
- He's still in with his wife.

4
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:00,437
- No. I mean, how is he? How's he doing?
- Well, he won't eat his meal.

5
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,941
And he won't see the chaplain.
Told him to get the hell out.

6
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:08,111
- What about the hired man?
- He's travellin'.

7
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:15,827
- All right. Let's get Neech prepped.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:19,665
If God can't save his sorry ass, neither can I.

9
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,296
<i>(buzzer)</i>

10
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,929
Time's up, Neech!

11
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:37,182
2,000 volts, man!
You ain't never 00min' back!

12
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:40,352
<i>Freak! (laughs)</i>

13
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:44,856
Just like I've always told you.
I swear on my life, Neech.

14
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,025
Time to go.

15
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:53,156
I ain't ever gonna love another man.
You hear me?

16
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,785
I won't.

17
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:00,122
I won't betray our love. Ever.

18
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,708
It's time, Neech. Time to go.

19
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,043
That phone call's gonna come.

20
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:09,381
The governor is gonna come through.

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,559
- Gotta go now.
- (buzzer)

22
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,987
<i>(buzzer)</i>

23
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,469
We've got a hood if you want it.
It's your option.

24
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:38,637
No.

25
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:41,306
Is there anything you wanna say, Neech?

26
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,975
Last words?

27
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,937
Yeah.

28
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,733
I've been here 11 years, 56 days,
and now you're gonna murder me.

29
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:55,654
The Lord says thou shall be merciful
and just. I know no mercy.

30
00:03:56,071 --> 00:04:00,826
Allah says the spirit shall rise again
and be reborn into this life.

31
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,745
- The soul shall...
- You should begin, Father.

32
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:04,913
The Lord is my shepherd...

33
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:10,752
I will return to avenge all the petty tyranny
and the cruelty I have suffered.

34
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:13,463
I will be recast, reincarnated.

35
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,174
Reunion of spirit and flesh.

36
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:20,303
Mark my words. Five men will die.

37
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:25,434
Five men will go down!
This will be myjustice!

38
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:29,104
This will be my law!
This will be my capital punishment...

39
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:33,608
...and no stay of execution will be granted.
For there is no prejudice.

40
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:36,695
No evidence to be admitted, no lawyer...

41
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,864
Fry him.

42
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:42,367
These men will die righteous death!

43
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,426
Napoleon "Neech" Manley.

44
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:46,181
He was convicted in 1984 for double murder
in the hold-up of a Florida liquor store.

45
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:50,769
The gunman was killed. Manley was the
getaway driver and got sentenced to death.

46
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,939
He was put to death in the electric chair
three days ago.

47
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:58,360
He'd been to the chair twice before, but
the governor granted him last-minute stays.

48
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:01,279
Third time's a charm. What's your interest?

49
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:05,367
Manley was interesting. He's well read,
charismatic. He became a writer.

50
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,370
A prison philosopher.
A week before his execution...

51
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:11,873
...word spread that Neech said
he was gonna be reincarnated.

52
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:14,292
He was gonna come back from the dead.

53
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:18,797
Well, reincarnation has always been popular
on death row. For obvious reasons.

54
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,300
Apparently, this was more than
a dying man's hope against hope.

55
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:26,137
- What do you mean?
- He didn't just claim he was coming back...

56
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:30,600
...but that he was gonna take vengeance
on five men who had mistreated him.

57
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,145
Yesterday a death-row guard
was found dead

58
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,065
inside the cell that Manley had occupied.

59
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,319
His death cannot be explained.

60
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:47,826
- Has a cause of death been determined?
- Suffocation, near as we can tell.

61
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:49,995
Must have been snuffed with a pillow.

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,582
Any idea how a guard could get
murdered in an empty cell like this?

63
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:56,751
No. Not with all the precautions we take.

64
00:06:56,835 --> 00:07:00,422
The guards all wear panic devices.
Was the victim's activated?

65
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,633
No. Apparently he never touched it.

66
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:08,930
Reports say there were threats
this might happen.

67
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:13,018
There's always threats of violence.
Prison's nothing but a police state.

68
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:17,522
Do you give any credence to Neech Manley's
claims that he'd come back for revenge?

69
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:20,942
Neech Manley... Smart man.

70
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:26,364
Very smart man. If he'd stayed outside,
I would have figured him for a Nobel Prize.

71
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:30,035
But he made a mistake.
Paid for it with his life.

72
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,456
You put a man of that intelligence inside
for 11 years, you're gonna pay for it.

73
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,541
What do you mean?

74
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,795
There's bitterness and resentment in here,
seven days a week, 24 hours a day...

75
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,175
...365 days a year.
It gets honed to a real fine point.

76
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:49,804
So Manley planned this and is carrying
it out with the help of someone else.

77
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:54,059
Elaborate as Shakespeare.
Now, you wanna see the victim's body.

78
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:58,897
(guard) Visitors coming through!
Woman on the block!

79
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:11,826
We're holding the corpse until the state
pathologist conducts the official autopsy.

80
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,580
That information should
help us solve the murder.

81
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,083
(Mulder) Did Manley have many friends?

82
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:22,420
A man has to have friends here to watch his
enemies. Mostly people were afraid of him.

83
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,589
- Warden?
- What is it?

84
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,926
The body. I think you should take a look.

85
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:35,433
You should get it into refrigeration or
you won't have anything left to autopsy.

86
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:37,894
Oh, God!

87
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,446
I've been told you believe
Neech Manley's claims.

88
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,368
It's not a matter of how or if he's
comin' back. The question is when...

89
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,788
- ...is he comin' back again?
- What are you saying, Speranza?

90
00:08:56,913 --> 00:09:00,625
- Do you believe Manley killed that guard?
- How else would you explain it?

91
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:06,214
- A prisoner waits for an opportunity...
- Look around! We ain't got no opportunity!

92
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,634
But you've got prisoners on work detail.
A man slips away...

93
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:13,888
This is Q block. Death row. Don't nobody
come in and out without a guard watchin'.

94
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:16,975
- And lately you got double that.
- Why?

95
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:23,314
Cos everybody's afraid
of what they say can't be true.

96
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,651
- Neech is back.
- Reincarnated?

97
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:29,654
He would have called it
transmigration of the soul.

98
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:32,157
- Into what form?
- You. Me. This mattress.

99
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:35,910
I don't know! He didn't specify.
But he's back.

100
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:42,000
I can feel it. The man was electric.
You know what I'm sayin'? Pure energy.

101
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,340
Would it be possible to see the cell
where the guard was murdered?

102
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:52,427
I'll open it up for you.

103
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,263
- (Mulder) Any idea how he did it?
- Like I said...

104
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,856
<i>(prisoner) Yes,</i> sweet girl. <i>Hi.</i>

105
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:19,037
Nothing's been touched.
It's pretty much the way Neech left it.

106
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,965
Did you know Neech Manley?

107
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:33,468
Oh, yeah. I knew him.

108
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,803
What was he like?

109
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:38,306
Neech? Neech was so full of BS
he couldn't stand it.

110
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:39,390
How was that?

111
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:43,311
He started to believe that crap
he'd been preachin' all those years...

112
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,564
...as if knowin' all them religions
made him some kind of god.

113
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,901
- Who do you think killed the guard?
- I don't know who killed him.

114
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,570
But I damn well know who didn't kill him.

115
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:56,074
- Are you afraid at all?
- Me?

116
00:10:56,658 --> 00:11:00,245
I just keep my ass covered
and my eyes peeled. Same as always.

117
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,248
(man) Fornier! Hey! Down here!

118
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,878
I'm gonna check back on your partner.

119
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,765
- Everything OK in there?
- (Mulder) Yeah, I'm fine.

120
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,094
Sh!

121
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,433
(whispers) I'm not gonna hurt you.
I only wanna talk to you, OK?

122
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:09,147
I know who he's gonna kill. There's a list.

123
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,234
One of the cons has it. A man named Roque.

124
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:21,743
- Who are you?
- My name's Parmelly. I want to help you.

125
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,912
(Fornier) Agent Scully?

126
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:36,341
- I was just looking around.
- Not a place for a woman to do that alone.

127
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:42,472
Mulder.

128
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,768
- I'm ready to go now.
- OK. I'll be right there.

129
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,860
- Guard!
- What's wrong, Scully?

130
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:58,154
I'm just ready to get outta here.

131
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:31,521
I want every paintbrush and putty knife
to be accounted for. Understand?

132
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:42,156
Come on, gentlemen, move it.

133
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:05,930
- It's the guard. It's Fornier.
- Come on, you guys. Break it up!

134
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,099
Get back!

135
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,268
I said get back!

136
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:23,406
They haven't recovered the body yet, so it'll
be hard to establish an exact cause of death.

137
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,285
What did your preliminary exam turn up?

138
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,620
Well, the head was severed
below the jaw line

139
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,915
with repeated blows from a putty knife.

140
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,753
There were no other indications of trauma.

141
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:41,132
From the eyewitness reports, there were
already fly larvae infesting the flesh.

142
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,968
That's unusual given
the time-of-death window.

143
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,304
Not altogether.

144
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,639
Here, let me show you this.

145
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:56,064
<i>Lucilia</i> cuprina - better known
as the greenbottle fly.

146
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:59,150
They lay their eggs within a minute
after death occurs.

147
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,653
And they breed more rapidly
in a hot, humid environment.

148
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,822
In the anaerobic environment
of the paint can?

149
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:10,495
On my autopsy on the first victim, the lungs
were absolutely alive with infestation.

150
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,082
Hm. What was determined
to be the cause of that death?

151
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:18,669
Best I can figure, given the lack of
indicators, he was suffocated to death.

152
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,631
Either that... or he drowned.

153
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,472
You've got a visitor, Roque.

154
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:38,106
- I hear you have a list.
- I prefer not to talk about it here.

155
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:41,692
Not on the block.

156
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,822
Guard?

157
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:53,121
Youse a dead man, Roque! You hear me?
I'm gonna peel that head like an onion.

158
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:55,998
I'm gonna break you off a big chunk!
You hear me?

159
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,627
He'll tell you nothing but a bunch of lies!

160
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,507
You talk, punk, I'm gonna
make you my Maytag! He's a liar!

161
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,636
How did you come by this list
you claim to have?

162
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:12,515
I heard Neech on the bars one night
telling Speranza.

163
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,062
- How many names are on the list?
- Five.

164
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:20,231
Just like Neech said.

165
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:23,901
So you knew those two guards
were gonna be murdered?

166
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,738
I knew they were on the list, yeah.

167
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:31,576
- Who do you think killed them?
- I don't know.

168
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,663
I just know who's on the list.

169
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,499
- You wanna make a deal, huh?
- That's right.

170
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,336
I want a transfer out of this hole.

171
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,257
- Why? Are you on the list?
- I ain't saying nothin'.

172
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:50,094
Not until I get my deal.

173
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,597
What if they don't give you what you want?

174
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:55,600
Then they're gonna see the other three die.

175
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,443
I can't make that deal.

176
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:09,864
- You don't have the authority?
- It's not that. If I make that deal...

177
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,784
...every con with half a brain would
come up with a scheme like that.

178
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,205
What if it saves three lives?
Isn't that a deal worth making?

179
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:21,626
My job's about controlling anarchy.
I don't run this prison, I just patrol it.

180
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:25,630
Basically, it's war in here.
We have freedom, they don't.

181
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:29,634
Anything these men want,
somehow... it finds its way in here.

182
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,471
They want a prisoner dead,
somebody'll find a way to put a shiv in.

183
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:37,808
- These are guards being murdered.
- Yes. And if I back down now...

184
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:42,563
...all I'll be doing is sending a message
about the benefits of killing prison guards.

185
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,233
There's a conspiracy at work here.

186
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:49,820
I don't know who's behind it,
but I am gonna crack it. That's my job.

187
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,828
What the hell...? Guard?

188
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,580
Guard!

189
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:01,791
Guard! Get in here!

190
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,296
I guess you'll be able to finish up
that autopsy now, Scully.

191
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:18,266
- He had quite a library.
- Yeah.

192
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,647
Looks like Neech Manley knew his Bible.

193
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:27,858
Listen to this:

194
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:32,363
"I come in return to the beginning of the end
to begin again the journey of souls...

195
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:37,034
...the godhead universal for whom
there is no death, only life eternal."

196
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,704
- What's that from?
- Neech Manley, 1994.

197
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:43,457
This goes on for hundreds of pages.
References to the Hindu Atman...

198
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,711
...parabdha, the Rosicrucians,
Zoroastrianism.

199
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,296
He was obsessed with reincarnation.

200
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,965
Being obsessed doesn't mean you can do it.

201
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:55,052
- Unless he knew something we don't.
- Like what? The secret password?

202
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,472
Every world religion encompasses
the idea of life after death.

203
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:03,728
Millions, even billions, of people believe
in transmigration or rebirth of the soul.

204
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,480
Sorry, that's not
what I learned in catechism.

205
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:11,235
Christianity teaches about the resurrection
and ascendancy of the heavenly body.

206
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,072
Do you honestly believe that Manley
came back from the dead to kill?

207
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:17,575
- Is there another theory?
- A very good one.

208
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,911
- And one much more believable.
- That this is a complex scheme.

209
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:25,499
The headless man planted at the warden's
desk is the work of a conspiracy of inmates.

210
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,169
Or guards.

211
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,088
OK, but imagine if it were true, Scully.

212
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:36,010
Imagine if you could come back and take out
five people who had caused you to suffer.

213
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,221
- Who would they be?
- I only get five?

214
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,435
I remembered your birthday this year,
didn't I, Scully?

215
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,356
Well, here's somebody
we haven't talked to yet.

216
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,191
She should know better than anybody else.

217
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,243
- Mrs Manley?
- Yes?

218
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:07,458
We're from the FBI. We'd like to ask you
a few questions about your husband.

219
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:16,425
I had this dream. Had it many times.

220
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,637
That they put Neech in that chair...

221
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,972
...and they flipped the switch...

222
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,433
...but that he wouldn't die.

223
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,312
You couldn't kill him.

224
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,566
He's a powerful man.

225
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,986
A very powerful man.

226
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:39,240
Did he ever share his thoughts
about dying with you?

227
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,660
- Neech wasn't afraid to die.
- Because of his beliefs?

228
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,581
Sometimes...

229
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:53,003
See, I only got to have personal visiting
days right before the execution dates.

230
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:56,173
There was three in the last 11 years.

231
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,509
But sometimes...

232
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:04,014
...I could feel the power of his beliefs
right through that visiting glass.

233
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,602
You think he's come back, don't you?

234
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,440
You know...

235
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,526
I think that if anyone could...

236
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,321
...it'd be Neech.

237
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,704
<i>(buzzer)</i>

238
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,547
Get up, Roque. Puttin' on the chains.

239
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,552
- Hey, man. For what?
- The warden wants to talk to you.

240
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:57,735
- Other way.
- Where we goin'?

241
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,904
This way.

242
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:08,579
Let go of my arm! I'm goin'!
What you want with me anyway?

243
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:12,583
Stop pushin'!

244
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,513
Hey, Roque.

245
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:32,937
- I wanna talk to you about this list.
- I ain't saying' nothin'.

246
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:37,691
Come on, Roque. You got a big mouth.
What are you shuttin' up now for? Hm?

247
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,243
Who's on the list?

248
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,749
Am I on the list, Roque?

249
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,253
Am I on that list?

250
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,880
Is my name on that list?

251
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,260
You're number five.

252
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:10,266
How's it feel to be on death row, Warden?

253
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,982
- Did you catch her body language?
- She was nervous. Or soared.

254
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:20,651
Of what? That her husband's
gonna keep his word?

255
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:25,155
A lot could have happened in her life
in those 11 years. A lot probably did.

256
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,908
- She thinks she's on the list?
- I don't know.

257
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,911
But I've been thinking
a lot about that list, Scully.

258
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:32,997
<i>(phone rings)</i>

259
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,166
Scully.

260
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:40,129
We're on our way.

261
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,174
That was the warden.
There's been another death.

262
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,509
Who?

263
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:50,264
Roque. They found him beaten to death
in the showers on death row.

264
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,027
Gotta go now.

265
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:08,282
God! You scare me when you do that.

266
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,868
Why? You think it's him?

267
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,455
<i>- Where you gdm"?
- I'm gem' to work.</i>

268
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,291
Parm, I'm scared.

269
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:21,128
- You feel me? I'm shakin' like a little kitten.
- Hey...

270
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,301
Now what are you scared of?

271
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:30,387
What if somebody finds out?
I mean, what if...

272
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:35,476
Will you stop your worryin'?
Everything's gonna be all right.

273
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,686
Hm?

274
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:50,240
He ain't comin' back, Danielle.

275
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,870
He ain't.

276
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,508
<i>(Prisoner) Hey, you movin' in?</i>

277
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,052
I got room in my cell for ya, baby!

278
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,851
- Who found the body?
- One of my guards.

279
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:21,772
- No one heard anything?
- Nobody who should have.

280
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:25,609
I'm ordering a lockdown
until the situation is back under control.

281
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:31,031
As far as I'm concerned, anyone who had
contact with Neech Manley is a suspect.

282
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,746
Warden?

283
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,834
I warned you. That's three.

284
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,755
Warden?

285
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:49,800
Why R0que?

286
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:53,220
Neech hated Roque. They nearly
tried to kill each other once.

287
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:56,640
- Then why the other victims?
- He probably hated them, too.

288
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:58,892
Did he have a history
with the dead guards?

289
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:03,647
Neech had a small behavioural problem
about a year, a year and a half ago.

290
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,400
Fornier and the other men
had to discipline him.

291
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:09,486
- How badly was he beaten?
- He took his licks.

292
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:13,323
So there's a pattern here.
They all had a violent history with Neech.

293
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,660
- They all caused him to suffer physical pain.
- What are you gettin' at?

294
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:18,996
A lockdown may not
solve your problem, Warden.

295
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,915
- It'll put a lid on it.
- If it's a conspiracy among inmates.

296
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:26,670
But how many inmates could have gotten
access to put that body in your office?

297
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:27,963
You're saying the guards are involved.

298
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:32,676
I'm saying Roque may not be number three.

299
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,097
Now, I need a name from you.
I need the name of Neech's executioner.

300
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,601
- It's confidential.
- How many men know it?

301
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,020
Three men, including me.

302
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:46,106
We place an ad, pay him cash.
There's no written record.

303
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,859
- His life may be in danger.
- There is no chance...

304
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:53,947
Look at it this way, Warden. If I'm right,
it'll reduce your list of suspects to four.

305
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,659
- I said three men knew that name.
- I'm counting Neech Manley.

306
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,974
Mr Simon?

307
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,563
Perry Simon?

308
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,029
Couple of days' worth of mail.

309
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,120
Mulder.

310
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,375
What is it?

311
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,742
Oh, God!

312
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,001
I told you, didn't I?

313
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,254
You told me everything
but what I need to know.

314
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,758
- Who else is on that list?
- I can't tell you that.

315
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,010
- How's he doing it?
- I really can't tell ya.

316
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,179
- You'll let those men die?
- Ain't my call!

317
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,098
They'll pin it on somebody.
They'll pin it on you.

318
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,267
- What'll they to do to me?
- Solitary.

319
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:31,521
One hour a week outside your cell,
no contact with anyone.

320
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,149
They say it can break a man.

321
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,694
I can't tell you, man.

322
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,199
You're afraid of Neech?

323
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,202
- I saw him.
- You saw Neech?

324
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,704
Standing outside my cell. Big as life.

325
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,792
Tell me who else is on the list, John.
Who's next?

326
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,127
I can't tell you who's on the list.

327
00:29:54,211 --> 00:30:00,008
- But I can tell you Roque wasn't on it.
- Roque's not on it?

328
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:04,471
Mulder, can I have a minute?

329
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,727
I've gone over Neech's phone calls
over the last two months.

330
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:15,899
Over 30 were made to a man named
Danny Charez. Twice as many as to his wife.

331
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:16,817
And?

332
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,321
Charez has been here three times
to see Speranza since the first murder.

333
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,741
He could be working with him
on the outside.

334
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,082
Look, I've got nothing to hide.

335
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,502
OK, then. What's your business
with John Speranza?

336
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,672
I was trying to get Speranza a deal.

337
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,174
- What kind of deal?
- Retrial, maybe.

338
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:44,428
Reopen the case. I've got
connections with the government.

339
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:48,765
- What kind of connections?
- I used to be an attorney.

340
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,685
Actually, I represented Neech Manley.

341
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,189
- You were Neech Manley's defence lawyer?
- I was 26.

342
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:59,776
I was court appointed.
I had no business on a death-penalty case.

343
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,279
Why help Speranza now?

344
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,034
I heard about Neech's death list.
Word gets around.

345
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:10,954
I know he blames me for him getting fried
so I had to try something.

346
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,707
You think Speranza's
got some sway with Neech?

347
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,628
I'm just trying to save my ass. I've been
to the governor, Speranza, Neech's wife...

348
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:22,966
- Why Neech's wife?
- Maybe she's got some mojo with him, too.

349
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,386
Anyway, I got run outta there
by her crazy boyfriend.

350
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:29,556
- She has a boyfriend?
- Works at the prison.

351
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,142
Waving a freakin' gun in my face.

352
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,153
Hello, John.

353
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:46,156
- What do you want?
- Oh, no, sit down. Sit.

354
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,994
- I'm here to do you good.
- What you talkin' about?

355
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,663
I wanna be your advocate.

356
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,584
I'm gonna get 'em to look
at your case again, pull a few strings.

357
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:01,338
- And what do you want from me?
- Just call off the dogs.

358
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,800
That's all.

359
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:09,304
What do you say?
Scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

360
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,266
All right.

361
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,069
I'll have somebody
from the governor's office down here

362
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,364
to see you by this weekend.

363
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,408
<i>(buzzing)</i>

364
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,415
<i>(gasps)</i>

365
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,110
Where have you been?

366
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,613
Out.

367
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:52,616
Out? What do you mean, out?

368
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,951
What's with you?

369
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:58,371
You see who is sittin' outside
watchin' this house?

370
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,209
You see that car out there?

371
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,962
You know who that is? Huh?
It's the stupid FBI.

372
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:09,132
- They came here tonight askin' about you.
- About me?

373
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,886
Said they saw you wavin' a gun
in some lawyer's face in my front yard.

374
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,555
- That's crazy!
- You said nobody knew about us.

375
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,766
Now lookit! Just lookit!

376
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,650
A woman gets lonely.

377
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:31,112
Sometimes she can't wait around
for her man to be reincarnated.

378
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,409
I think we should notify the warden.

379
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:56,137
- Is that the man?
- That's him.

380
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,848
Parmelly.

381
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:10,110
Yeah, give me Vincent Parmelly's work
sheet for the last week, please? Thank you.

382
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:14,614
- Now, you saw him with Neech's wife?
- Yes.

383
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,784
I hadn't reported it,
but that same guard cornered me...

384
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:21,538
- ...and made an overture for prisoner Roque.
- He's tied in with Roque?

385
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,041
Well, does it make sense to you
that Parmelly is Neech's assassin?

386
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,879
Parmelly's a transfer in from out of state.
He's only been here six months.

387
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:35,635
Well, according to an attorney we spoke to,
he had brandished a gun at the residence.

388
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:38,471
<i>- What attorney'?
- A man named Chavez.</i>

389
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:45,228
<i>- You know Wm'?
- Everybody knows Danny Chavez.</i>

390
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:49,065
He was found dead earlier this evening
in his apartment.

391
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,737
- Murdered?
- Suffocated to death, or so it seems.

392
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,406
Well, he could be the fifth victim.

393
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:03,246
I think somebody ought to go out
and arrest Vincent Parmelly.

394
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,966
Oh, my God!

395
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,643
No...

396
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,312
Neech...

397
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,776
- What the hell are you doin'?
- He's here.

398
00:37:57,444 --> 00:38:01,698
- What are you talking about?
- Neech. I saw him.

399
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,160
Somebody's here, but it ain't Neech.

400
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,667
They're 00min' here!

401
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,341
- It's you, isn't it?
- What?

402
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,804
- You're him.
- You're crazy, baby!

403
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,895
<i>(knocks)</i>

404
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,815
- Put that gun away. It's the police out there.
- I should have known.

405
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:39,402
- (Mulder) Please open the door.
- I should have opened my eyes.

406
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,738
We're federal agents. Open the door.

407
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:43,990
- The way you touched me...
- Danielle?

408
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:48,077
- ...and the sound of your voice.
- Point that gun away, Danielle.

409
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:52,081
I'm tellin' you, they're gonna put you away
just like your old man.

410
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:55,585
- Don't you come near me.
- You're seeing ghosts.

411
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:59,214
Mrs Manley, open the door.

412
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:04,761
<i>(knocking)</i>

413
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:09,516
She's got a gun on Parmelly.

414
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,268
- Centre room, facing away.
- On a count.

415
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,269
<i>(gunshot)</i>

416
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,568
- Drop your weapon!
- Put it down!

417
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:24,739
- Put it down!
- Drop your weapon, Danielle!

418
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,788
- Let's get a paramedic in here!
- It was him.

419
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,958
He came back.

420
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,212
Forget it.

421
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:44,300
I swear it was him. It was Neech.

422
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,071
- No, go this...
- What you talkin' about?

423
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:07,824
Go this way.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

424
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:12,662
Who wants to talk to me?
The warden's office is that way.

425
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:15,164
- We're goin' down here.
- Uh-uh. No.

426
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:17,917
Man, this is bull! I ain't goin' for it!

427
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:23,339
What the hell is this? Why do you want to
talk to me in the shower? Huh? What the...?

428
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,467
John...

429
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:31,097
- Hear about your friend Parmelly?
- He's not my friend.

430
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:36,936
Oh, he's not your friend? Well...
doesn't matter any more anyway, does it?

431
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,105
You promised me a deal.

432
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:42,775
Yeah, well, that was when
there was a deal to be made.

433
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,701
- Who else was in on it, John?
- I can tell you...

434
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:58,708
- Tell me what?
- I can tell you what I know.

435
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:02,295
- Well, tell me what you know.
- Neech's list...

436
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:05,131
...got one man left to die.

437
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:17,060
<i>(punching)</i>

438
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:24,025
(prisoner) What's goin' on out there?
What's goin' on?

439
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,694
Hey, leave him alone!

440
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:31,074
Speranza! Hey, come on!

441
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:48,091
Why are we stopping?

442
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:52,762
You know, it just doesn't make sense.

443
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:04,065
- What?
- Laying it all on Parmelly.

444
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,361
We've been through this.

445
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:11,114
He was only on duty
for one of the guards' murders...

446
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:14,367
...and he didn't know the name
of Neech's executioner.

447
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,703
Then he was working with someone.

448
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:21,040
- Why would he try to get you the list?
- To use fear as leverage for Roque's deal.

449
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:24,377
Neech hated Roque.
He wouldn't have done that, would he?

450
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,047
I don't know. Maybe Parmelly
didn't stick to the original plan.

451
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:31,801
I'm sure shacking up with Neech's wife
wasn't part of it, either.

452
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:35,888
Maybe Neech's wife killing Parmelly
was part of the plan from the start...

453
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:39,976
- ...so that he'd take the proof to his grave.
- I don't see the motives. Do you?

454
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,646
I don't think Parmelly killed anybody.

455
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:46,649
Well, then who did? Neech Manley?

456
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,570
Speranza and Neech's wife
both said they saw him.

457
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,823
It's over, Mulder. Let's just go home.
