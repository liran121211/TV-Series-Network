1
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:08,343
<i>To the Navajo, the earth and its creatures
have great influence over our existence.</i>

2
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:13,432
<i>The stories, passed from
generation to generation...</i>

3
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:18,979
<i>...help us to understand the reason for
our tears of sadness and tears of joy.</i>

4
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:23,150
<i>Animals like the bear,
the spider, and the coyote...</i>

5
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:26,361
<i>...are powerful symbols to our people.</i>

6
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:32,743
<i>When the FBI man, Mulder,
was cured by the Holy People...</i>

7
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,913
<i>...we were reminded of the
story of the Gila monster...</i>

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,875
<i>...who symbolises the healing powers
of the medicine man.</i>

9
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:45,005
<i>In this myth, the Gila monster
restores a man by taking all his parts...</i>

10
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,507
<i>...and putting them back together.</i>

11
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:49,801
<i>His blood is gathered by ants...</i>

12
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:52,262
<i>...his eyes and ears by Sun...</i>

13
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:55,474
<i>...his mind by Talking God and Pollen Boy.</i>

14
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:03,232
<i>Then lightning and thunder
bring the man back to life.</i>

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,409
<i>At the end of the ceremony,
when the FBI man had been healed...</i>

16
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:18,705
<i>...we heard the news from other
Native Americans in the northern plains...</i>

17
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:21,750
<i>...that a great event had taken place.</i>

18
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:26,672
<i>Like the Navajo, these people
have their own stories and myths.</i>

19
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,467
<i>One of these stories tells
of the White Buffalo Woman</i>

20
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,552
<i>who came down from the heavens...</i>

21
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,889
<i>...and taught the Indians
how to lead virtuous lives,</i>

22
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:38,350
<i>and how to pray to the Creator.</i>

23
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,603
<i>She told the people
she would return one day.</i>

24
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:46,483
<i>Then she turned into a white buffalo
and ascended into the clouds...</i>

25
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,069
<i>...never to be seen again.</i>

26
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:55,617
<i>But on this day, when the Holy People
had given the FBI man a miracle...</i>

27
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:58,578
<i>...a white buffalo was born.</i>

28
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:03,834
<i>And every Native American knew,
whether he believed the story or not, .</i> ..

29
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,461
<i>...that this was a powerful omen.</i>

30
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:09,423
<i>And that great changes were coming.</i>

31
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,168
I've got the digital tape.

32
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,503
You're lying.

33
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:52,466
I've got it in my pocket.
I took it out of Mulder's desk.

34
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,217
<i>(footsteps)</i>

35
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,354
Drop your weapon!

36
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,647
- Put it down, Scully!
- No way.

37
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:10,233
- I said put it down!
- I said no!

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,695
- You're setting me up!
- I'm trying to help you!

39
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:16,239
- Then put your weapon down!
- Not a chance.

40
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:20,327
- You're not here to kill me? Prove it!
- I'm not here to have a gun in my face!

41
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,287
Damn it, Skinner!

42
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:24,081
Drop your weapon!

43
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,917
- Back off!
- Put it down!

44
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,794
What the hell is this?

45
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,797
- You OK, Scully?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,965
Get his gun.

47
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,551
Give her the gun!

48
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:40,555
- Give it to her!
- All right.

49
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:45,394
Now I want an explanation.

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,730
I was warned that somebody would kill me.

51
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,942
Someone I trusted.

52
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:59,282
I'm gonna reach into my coat pocket
and end this charade. All right?

53
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:04,746
I presume you both know what this is?
Now <i>I</i> want an explanation.

54
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,000
Your cigarette-smoking friend killed
my father for that tape. Then he killed me.

55
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:12,587
- What are you talking about?
- I was a dead man. Now I'm back.

56
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,297
What is on this tape?!

57
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,967
Defense Department files
that reveal the truth

58
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,677
about our government's involvement...

59
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,056
...in the global conspiracy of silence about
the existence of extraterrestrial life.

60
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,559
- Give me that tape.
- It stays with me.

61
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:26,726
Give her the tape.

62
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,440
If what you say is true, if the information on
this tape is valuable enough to kill for...

63
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:35,694
...then it's the only leverage we've got
to bring these men to justice.

64
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:40,115
It's not gonna do us any good
if it falls back into their hands!

65
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:45,620
Then you'd better make sure it doesn't.

66
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,957
- Come on, Scully. Let's go.
- Where?

67
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,961
There are truths out there
that aren't on that tape.

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,273
- Mulder, I...
- Whatever you're...

69
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,067
I went to your father's funeral.

70
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,281
I told your mother that
you were gonna be OK.

71
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,992
How did you know?

72
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,244
I just knew.

73
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,720
My daughter was brought here.

74
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,515
- What's her name?
- Dana Scully.

75
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,851
- Melissa Scully?
- No...

76
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,394
That's her sister.

77
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:57,108
We just had a Melissa Scully in surgery
with a cranial gunshot wound.

78
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,126
Missy?

79
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,295
It's Mom.

80
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:22,300
We took drastic precautionary measures
due to the nature of the wound.

81
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:26,763
We've induced coma to try and
relieve the trauma on the brain.

82
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,227
- Is she gonna be OK?
- We've done everything we can.

83
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,438
We'll be monitoring her around the clock.

84
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:42,362
Nurse, why don't we get Mrs Scully
a comfortable chair?

85
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,575
That's my father on the left there.

86
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,703
- This was taken when?
- About 1973.

87
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,913
Amazing. Langley, take a look.

88
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:55,292
Do you recognise any of those men?

89
00:06:55,417 --> 00:07:00,088
Are you familiar with a post-World War ll
project known as Operation Paper Clip?

90
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:04,217
The US government provided
safe haven for Nazi war criminals...

91
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,428
...in exchange for their scientific knowledge.

92
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:08,680
I know who this man is.

93
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,181
Victor Klemper.

94
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:13,184
The man next to your father
is one of those criminals...

95
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,854
...though not the most famous of the bunch.

96
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,857
Wernher von Braun,
designer of the V-2 rockets...

97
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,319
...may be the most notorious,
but Klemper takes the prize...

98
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:25,822
...for the most evil Nazi
to escape the Nuremberg trials.

99
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:29,034
- What did he do?
- Experimented on the Jews.

100
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:33,538
Drowned them, put them in pressure
chambers... All in the name of science.

101
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:36,541
Together with von Braun,
Klemper helped us win the space race.

102
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:42,339
Using his scientific data we were able to put
astronauts on the moon before the Soviets.

103
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,341
One giant step for mankind(!)

104
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:47,886
What would he be doing
in a photo with your father?

105
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,512
I don't know.

106
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:52,515
- Do you recognise anybody else?
- No.

107
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:56,227
Operation Paper Clip was supposed
to have been scrapped in the 1950s.

108
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:59,522
- But if this is 1973...
- What happened to Klemper?

109
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:03,860
He's still here, living very well at
the expense of the American taxpayer.

110
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,362
<i>(door opens)</i>

111
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,907
Unbelievable!

112
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,284
We thought you were history!

113
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:14,245
You'll have to wait for my video collection.

114
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,164
<i>(Langley) Where were ya'?</i>

115
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,792
At DC General,
scanning the police frequency

116
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,170
when I heard the report of a shooting.

117
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,339
Agent Scully...

118
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:29,427
- What is it?
- Your sister's in critical condition.

119
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:35,016
Scully!

120
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:38,353
Scully, wait! Scully!

121
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,898
Scully, wait! Scully!

122
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:45,026
I have to go there, Mulder!
That bullet was meant for me!

123
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,738
If they're trying to kill you,
that's the first place they'll look.

124
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,615
Those bastards!

125
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,617
I'll call someone who can help.

126
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:57,288
The only thing you can do for her
right now is to try to crucify them.

127
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:07,549
This is a serious mistake.
An innocent woman's been shot.

128
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:11,052
- Can this be traced?
- This is your man.

129
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:14,347
There was a mistake. It will be rectified.

130
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,558
BY Whom?

131
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:20,270
By whom will this be rectified?

132
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,773
Your ridiculously ineffectual assassins?

133
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,984
They're professionals.

134
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,446
This is not a profession
for men who make mistakes!

135
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:34,659
My God, you presume to make us believe
you can simply fix it with enough bullets?

136
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:38,037
No.

137
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:40,623
This woman... Scully.

138
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,586
I know she believes her partner is still alive.

139
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:47,922
Mulder's dead.
I took care of it myself.

140
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:53,845
And the computer tape containing the
stolen files you tell us was recovered...

141
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,431
You can show it to us?

142
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,645
I wasn't aware that my honesty
was in question or doubt.

143
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,106
Do you have the tape?

144
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,485
Of course I have it!

145
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,196
I think I'd like to see it.

146
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,072
So would I.

147
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:16,659
I have vouchsafed it for reasons of security.

148
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,996
I'll have it here for you tomorrow.

149
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,709
By which time this whole matter
will be cleared up.

150
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,392
<i>(door opens)</i>

151
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,565
- Victor Klemper?
- Yes.

152
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,652
My name is Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.

153
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:55,532
- Your name is Mulder?
- Yes. I think you knew my father.

154
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,994
- What's this about?
- You did some work for our government.

155
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,914
I'm old now. History bores me.

156
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:07,335
Because it escaped you?
Or because you escaped <i>it?</i>

157
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:09,963
Freud, Salk, Crick, Watson...

158
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:13,675
These will be the names they celebrate
at the end of the millennium.

159
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,844
Great scientists.

160
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:19,848
But Klemper? He will be remembered
only as a butcher.

161
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:22,767
History may be the onlyjustice you'll know.

162
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:26,354
Do you know my work?
Do you know what we accomplished?

163
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:29,065
As a Nazi? Or for the blood money
we paid you?

164
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,946
We were young men caught in a fervour.
But our experiments changed the world.

165
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:40,159
- For a lot of innocent Jews.
- Progress demands sacrifice, and I...

166
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,871
I have confronted my demons.

167
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:44,706
And soon I will die too.

168
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:49,210
Like my father. They killed him
and I believe you know why.

169
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:53,172
I believe they would kill anyone
if it is in the best interest of the work.

170
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:55,884
What is this "work"
that my father was involved in?

171
00:11:55,967 --> 00:12:00,471
- I have no answer for you.
- You knew him! Was he a murderer too?

172
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,100
Some things you don't have to know.

173
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:07,145
No, I need to know!
I need to know the truth!

174
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:12,400
Isn't that what you want?
For the truth to be known?

175
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,116
Do you know the formula
of Napier's constant?

176
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:21,659
Yes. Why?

177
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:26,039
The photo was taken at the Strughold
Mining Company in West Virginia.

178
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:30,126
That is all I will tell you.
The rest you can find out yourself.

179
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,295
Let's go, Scully.

180
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,183
<i>(ringing)</i>

181
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,394
Hello?

182
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:50,605
Yes. One moment.

183
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:56,986
It's for you, sir.

184
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,073
<i>- Yes.
- It's Klemper.</i>

185
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,616
Victor!

186
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,035
How are you, old friend?

187
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:07,956
- It's been far too many years.
- What is it, Victor?

188
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,834
I was just paid a visit by the son
of one of our old colleagues.

189
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,713
What did you tell him, Victor?

190
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:19,509
<i>I told him that you were
the most venal man I've ever met.</i>

191
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,179
Beyond that, I told him nothing.

192
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,727
Mulder is alive!

193
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,439
I think it's time to call our friends...

194
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:36,985
...who will handle this matter
more satisfactorily.

195
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:02,844
- Are you expecting visitors?
- Is it Dana? ls Dana here?

196
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,514
No. It's a man.
He says he was asked to come here.

197
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:15,398
My name is Albert Hosteen. I was asked
to come and help with your daughter.

198
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:19,193
- There must be some mistake.
- Is your daughter the FBI woman?

199
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,862
- Dana?
- Yes.

200
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,823
She's very sorry she can't
come here to comfort you.

201
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:28,077
- You know where she is? Is she OK?
- Yes. I believe so.

202
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:47,138
- She is weak.
- She's getting better.

203
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,768
She has the best doctors.
They're watching her around the clock.

204
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:55,563
If it's all right,
I would like to pray over her here.

205
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,998
What would your father
have been doing here?

206
00:15:56,124 --> 00:16:00,294
I don't know. He never came home
wearing a miner's cap.

207
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:10,471
Mulder, take a look at this.

208
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:24,360
- What do you think?
- I'd like to try door number one, Monty.

209
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,371
I'm trying 27828. It's not working.

210
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,915
- Nor here.
- Are you sure it's the right number?

211
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:41,252
Napier's constant is the basis
of all natural logarithms.

212
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:46,841
With a crowbar and a small nuclear device,
I might be able to get through one of these.

213
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:49,844
Mulder!

214
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:54,307
No, wait. Hang on a second.

215
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,853
Whatever we find in here,
you haven't had time to process everything.

216
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,772
- I'm OK.
- You couldn't go to your father's funeral...

217
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:06,360
...and if something in here was to cast doubt
on the kind of man he was...

218
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,532
I just know how it would affect me.

219
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,084
You called me.

220
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,296
Yes, I did.

221
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,382
About?

222
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:32,220
I may have located the digital tape
you're looking for.

223
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:33,763
You may have located it?

224
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:36,599
Yes, although it may fall
into the hands of people...

225
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,101
...who might use it
for purposes not your own.

226
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,437
You wanna work a deal?

227
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,065
Is that what this is?

228
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:47,985
Let me tell you somethin'.
I don't work deals.

229
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,323
I thought you should know
of certain potentialities.

230
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,618
- Do you have the tape?
- As I said, I may have located it.

231
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,995
Do you have the damn tape?!

232
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:04,585
- I'll know more when we next meet.
- I do not negotiate. Do you understand?

233
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,546
- Yes, sir.
- I don't think you do.

234
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,924
I don't think you understand at all.

235
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:15,596
No, I'm quite aware of your policies
in those regards.

236
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:21,143
Then I hope your next
course of action will be more...

237
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,272
...cautious... and informed.

238
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,624
Mulder, look at this.

239
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,508
<i>(Scully)</i> It looks like they're storing records.

240
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,469
<i>(Mulder) or</i> what?

241
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,978
Of medical files, by the look of it.

242
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,023
They've got names, alphabetised.

243
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,836
Lots of files.

244
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:32,214
Lots and lots of files.

245
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:38,429
- What's in these files?
- Standard medical forms.

246
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,891
Birth certificate,
smallpox vaccination certificate...

247
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,518
- And then there's this.
- What is this?

248
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:48,356
It's an old tissue-collection cassette.
The new ones are plastic.

249
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:52,026
- Do they all contain the same materials?
- Yes, exactly.

250
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,405
- What year was this person born?
- 1955. All these files are 1955.

251
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,034
- What year were you born?
- 1964. Why?

252
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,286
Let's go find 1964.

253
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,417
You're looking for a file on me?

254
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,088
Dana Katherine Scully.

255
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,631
What?

256
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,391
It's a recent tissue sample.

257
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:26,394
What the hell is going on here, Mulder?

258
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:28,562
I don't know, Scully.

259
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,793
- That's your sister's file.
- Yeah.

260
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,297
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

261
00:20:58,926 --> 00:20:59,927
Look at this.

262
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,437
- This file was originally mine.
- I don't understand.

263
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,942
<i>(high-frequency tone)</i>

264
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:19,613
- Wait here, Scully.
- Mulder, where are you going?

265
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,803
Mulder?

266
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,850
<i>(hissing sound)</i>

267
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,811
Mulder?

268
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,599
<i>(shouting/guns being loaded)</i>

269
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:58,772
There!

270
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,489
Find the woman too!

271
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,809
Scully?

272
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,978
Mulder!

273
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,523
Scully?

274
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,862
Mulder, I'm down here.

275
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,785
- You OK, Scully?
- I heard gunshots.

276
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,079
- I've been looking for you.
- What happened?

277
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:58,457
We got a small army outside.
I think they got us trapped.

278
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,709
I think there's a way out down here.

279
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,092
This place isn't even on the map.

280
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,594
You'd be surprised what's not on the map.

281
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,097
And what our government will do
to keep it that way.

282
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:58,434
- How's that?
- Last night we were chased by a hit squad.

283
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,603
Driving what looked like CIA fleet sedans.

284
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,194
I may be able to negotiate a deal
that would guarantee your safety.

285
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,904
What kind of deal?

286
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,615
I'll turn over the tape
in return for your reinstatement.

287
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:18,245
- No, sir. I need that tape. I need those files.
- I'm talking about a way to save your lives.

288
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,123
And I'm talking about
an elaborate conspiracy.

289
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,876
Do you know what we found last night?

290
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,002
What?

291
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,838
An elaborate filing system
of medical records.

292
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:30,215
Locked inside a mountain vault.

293
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,301
- For the purpose of?
- I don't know.

294
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:36,221
But the answer's on that tape. In those files.

295
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:40,476
- Is that answer worth your lives?
- It's obviously worth killing us for.

296
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,437
What do you hope to find, Agent Mulder?

297
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,315
Why they killed my father.

298
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,736
And what happened to my sister.

299
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,449
And what they did to Agent Scully.

300
00:26:57,618 --> 00:27:00,954
I think we should let him
make the deal, Mulder.

301
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,249
Look...

302
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,669
Those answers mean nothing
if we're hunted down like animals.

303
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:13,842
We are operating so far outside of the law,
we've given up on the very notion of justice.

304
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:18,180
We have turned ourselves into outsiders.
We have lost our access and our protection.

305
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,183
What makes you think
there's any such thing as justice?

306
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,894
Then what good are those answers
to anybody but you?

307
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,773
- What we found last night...
- Look, I want exactly what you want!

308
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,819
But I need to see my sister.

309
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:46,542
I suppose you already tried
to make a backup of the tape?

310
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,462
It's copy-protected.
I couldn't get a hard copy to print either.

311
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:52,714
What makes you think
they'll honour this deal?

312
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,383
Because if they don't...

313
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,511
...I'll go state's evidence and testify.

314
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,181
Or they'll have to kill me too.

315
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,522
It's up to you, Scully.

316
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,679
I told Skinner to make the deal.

317
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:44,892
But not to hand over the tape
until you agreed to it.

318
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:50,230
- I'm sorry about your sister, Scully.
- I just need to know she's gonna be OK.

319
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,399
<i>(car starts up)</i>

320
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:09,207
<i>(Albert) For two days I had prayed
for the FBI woman's sister.</i>

321
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,211
<i>Her doctor said she was getting better...</i>

322
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:18,383
<i>...and her mother, who would not leave
her bedside, was able to sleep.</i>

323
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:25,599
<i>But word had come from my brothers
in the north that did not give me hope.</i>

324
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,686
<i>The white buffalo calf had survived...</i>

325
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,815
<i>...but after a day it would no longer
drink its mother's milk.</i>

326
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:44,910
<i>On the third day, the mother buffalo
laid down in her stall and would not get up.</i>

327
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,122
<i>They said the men could do nothing for her.</i>

328
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,792
<i>That night she died.</i>

329
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:58,173
<i>My father taught me when I was a boy
that this is how life is.</i>

330
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:04,221
<i>That, for something to live,
another thing must often be sacrificed.</i>

331
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,474
<i>This was my fear now for the young woman.</i>

332
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,980
I'm here to see Melissa Scully.

333
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:19,486
My name's Walter Skinner.
I'm an assistant director at the FBI.

334
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:28,495
I'm very sorry about your daughter.

335
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,999
Dana asked me to deliver a message.

336
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:35,794
- You've been in contact with her?
- Yes.

337
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:38,588
I wanna know where she is and if she's OK.

338
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,466
She's OK, but she's in
a very serious situation

339
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,344
which prevents her from being here.

340
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,471
What kind of situation?

341
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:50,475
One that we hope to reverse
so that Dana can come back to work.

342
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:57,816
That man you just saw,
he's been very curious about this room.

343
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,281
Who are you?

344
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,826
My name is Albert Hosteen.
I was asked to come here.

345
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,370
Albert, do not leave this room. Understand?

346
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,372
Yes.

347
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,990
I could use a beer.

348
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,743
Do you want anything?

349
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:32,911
No.

350
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,621
Are you sure?

351
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,790
Yeah.

352
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,714
<i>(Mulder)</i> Mr <i>Klemper?</i>

353
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,679
Mr Klemper?

354
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,192
Hello again, young lady.

355
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,988
- Where's Victor Klemper?
- Oh, poor Klemper.

356
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:55,076
They found him yesterday.
Apparently, his heart had given out.

357
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,412
You killed him, didn't you?

358
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,875
You're one of the men in this photo.
You knew my father.

359
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,211
Yes, since we were young men.

360
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:08,298
You were involved in this project.
You know why medical data was collected.

361
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,717
Yes, I do indeed.

362
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:16,723
In 1947 a spacecraft was reportedly
recovered in New Mexico.

363
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:22,520
No doubt you know of this, and of the
reported recovery of a body at the site.

364
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:26,858
These incidents coincided with
not only the end of World War ll...

365
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:31,404
...but an ignominious project which brought
Nazi scientists and war criminals...

366
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,740
...to this country to exploit their knowledge.

367
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,242
Operation Paper Clip.

368
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,743
Yes, you know of it already.

369
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:40,747
And you must also know
the work of Dr Josef Mengele...

370
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,374
...the Nazi "Angel of Death".

371
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:46,211
He thought he could produce a super race
through genetic engineering.

372
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,922
As did many of his colleagues
at the Institute

373
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,174
of Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene.

374
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,261
- Like Victor Klemper?
- Poor Victor.

375
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,763
He loved his orchids.

376
00:34:56,888 --> 00:35:01,059
Did you know he was able to create
some of the most beautiful hybrids?

377
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:05,063
Klemper was trying to create
an alien-human hybrid.

378
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:08,358
That's what I saw in the boxcar.
He was using human subjects.

379
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,069
- Mulder, wait!
- My father was involved in this?

380
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:16,533
The technology wasn't there! DNA wasn't
even identified until 1944! This is all a lie!

381
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:20,829
When your father realised what
the medical data was being used for...

382
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,706
...he objected strenuously.

383
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,541
He collected those files?!

384
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,710
With the threat of nuclear holocaust,

385
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,796
the government instructed
men like your father...

386
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:33,091
...to gather genetic data
on the general populace...

387
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:37,470
...for the purposes of
post-apocalyptic identification.

388
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,974
The vaccination records.

389
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,561
They took tissue from everyone
who had a smallpox inoculation.

390
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,896
Hundreds of millions of Americans.

391
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,858
<i>So Hamper had access to a DNA database</i>

392
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,027
of nearly everyone
who was born since 1950.

393
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:55,155
This man is telling you
everything you want to hear.

394
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,241
But it's a fabrication.
It is pure science fiction.

395
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:02,078
- There were no experiments with aliens.
- Why would I lie to you?

396
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:06,708
Like you said before, to protect yourself.
And the continuation of the Nazi agenda.

397
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,084
Human tests.

398
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,545
Why was your file there, Scully?

399
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,882
- I don't know.
- There were current records!

400
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,551
- Yes, but records of what, Mulder?
- Of abductions!

401
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,386
Of abductees!

402
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:29,689
They took my sister.

403
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,025
Why?

404
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,989
They took her as insurance because your
father threatened to expose the project.

405
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,742
Why her? Why not me?

406
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:46,164
It's not for me to say.
But your life is in danger now too.

407
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:49,542
You also threaten to expose the project.

408
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,544
You have become your father.

409
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:55,298
- Why are you telling me this?
- It's what you want to know.

410
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,758
Isn't it?

411
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,263
Is there more?

412
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:06,559
More than you'll ever know.

413
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,692
<i>(ringing)</i>

414
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,070
Yes.

415
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:19,739
Yes, he's just arrived. One moment, please.

416
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,908
You have a call, sir.

417
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,411
Thank you.

418
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,915
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I'm alive.

419
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,460
Ain't that a surprise!

420
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:35,630
Yes! Good! Good, good. Where are you?

421
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,592
Somewhere you'll never find me,
you double-crossing son of a bitch!

422
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:40,927
Are you sure?

423
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:43,263
I'm sure of this.

424
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:47,142
If I so much as feel your presence...

425
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:51,271
...I'm gonna make you a very,
very famous man.

426
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:54,441
You understand?

427
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,777
Yes, thank you. I'll report that to the group.

428
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:07,537
I've just received confirmation that
the digital tape containing the stolen files...

429
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,665
...was destroyed in a car bomb explosion...

430
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,543
...which killed Agent Scully's
would-be assassin.

431
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:16,171
What about Mulder and Scully?

432
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,633
I've a meeting with the FBI.
They wanna make a deal.

433
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,260
For what?

434
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,220
For nothing.

435
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,431
There'll be no deal.

436
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,142
There's no deal to make.

437
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,612
Fox? What time is it?

438
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,238
It's after two.

439
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:46,493
- Did you drive up here? Why didn't you call?
- I needed to see you in person.

440
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:51,164
I need to ask you something.
Something that happened a long time ago.

441
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:56,252
Oh, Fox, I don't remember anything.
I told you before.

442
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,756
Mom, listen to me. When Samantha...

443
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,677
Before she was gone, did Dad ever
ask you if you had a favourite?

444
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,181
- Did he ever ask you that?
- Fox, please!

445
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,475
Mom, did he ever ask you to make a choice?

446
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:13,520
- Don't do this!
- Mom, listen to me! I need to know!

447
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,356
Did he make you make a choice?

448
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:19,359
No. I couldn't choose.

449
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,447
It was your father's choice!

450
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,616
And I hated him for it.

451
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:29,536
Even in his grave, I hate him still.

452
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:51,975
Now...

453
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:54,561
...you wanted to see me?

454
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:01,067
I have the tape you've been looking for.

455
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,987
Really?

456
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,575
I'm prepared to hand it over, or destroy it,
in exchange for Mulder and Scully's safety.

457
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,370
- And for their reinstatement.
- What did I tell you, Mr Skinner?

458
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,622
I don't negotiate.

459
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:18,334
Especially with punks like you
who think they can bluff me.

460
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,546
- Bluff you?
- You haven't got any tape.

461
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,464
You haven't got any deal.

462
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,594
You can't play poker if you're
not holding any cards, Mr Skinner.

463
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:31,389
You ever wondered what
it would be like to, uh...

464
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,183
...die in a plane crash?

465
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:39,397
Of botulism? Even a heart attack's
not uncommon for a man your age.

466
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,983
You think I'm bluffing?

467
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:46,613
I'm not finished yet.

468
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,999
Albert.

469
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,004
<i>(speaks Navajo)</i>

470
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,968
What is this?

471
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:11,679
This is where you pucker up
and kiss my ass!

472
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,098
- Listen...
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

473
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:16,809
This man's name is Albert Hosteen.
Remember that.

474
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,520
If Mulder and Scully
come down with so much as flu...

475
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:24,359
...Albert will recite chapter and verse, file
for file, everything on your precious tape.

476
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:26,319
It's a nice try, Skinner.

477
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,571
You're thinking Albert is an old man...

478
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:32,241
...and there are plenty of ways
you might kill him too.

479
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:34,744
Which is why, in the ancient oral tradition...

480
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:38,790
...he's told 20 other men
the information on those files.

481
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:43,544
So, unless you kill every Navajo
living in four states...

482
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,965
...that information is available
with a simple phone call.

483
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:51,803
Welcome to the wonderful world
of high technology.

484
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:54,305
You're bluffing.

485
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,057
Am I?

486
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:24,001
It happened three hours ago.

487
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:29,674
She went into surgery. The damage to her
brain was worse than they had hoped.

488
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:34,345
Her blood pressure started to rise and...

489
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,931
...she slipped away.

490
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,978
She died for me.

491
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:46,023
I tried to tell her I was sorry,
but I don't think she'll ever really know.

492
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:48,192
She knows.

493
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:51,904
Melissa knows.

494
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,534
You were right.

495
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:00,288
There is no justice.

496
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:04,167
- I don't think this is aboutjustice, Scully.
- Then what is it about?

497
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,171
I think it's about something
we have no personal choice in.

498
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,757
I think it's about fate.

499
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,894
Skinner told me that he talked to you.

500
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:27,440
That you were insistent
about coming back to work.

501
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:28,858
If Melissa's death is...

502
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:31,986
I need something to put my back up against.

503
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:36,282
I feel the same way.
We've both lost so much.

504
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:43,706
But I believe that what we're
looking for... is in the X-Files.

505
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,585
