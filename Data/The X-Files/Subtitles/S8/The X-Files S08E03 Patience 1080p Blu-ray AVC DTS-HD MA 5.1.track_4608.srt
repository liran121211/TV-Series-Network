1
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:10,989
(footsteps creaking)

2
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,511
Land sakes, George,
what are you tryin' to do?

3
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:40,435
- I was trying to be quiet.
- Quiet?

4
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:44,064
I smelled you on the stairs.

5
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:49,194
39 years, I'm still surprised that embalming
fluid of yours doesn't wake the dead.

6
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:53,115
Didn't wake old Zig McPherson tonight,
God rest his soul.

7
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:58,370
Well, you go outside and take those clothes
of yours off, so I can rest mine.

8
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,165
George!

9
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:05,794
I'm going, Tohoma. I'm going.

10
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,349
(creaking)

11
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:20,892
What the hell?

12
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:23,729
What the hell is that?

13
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:31,737
(screeching)

14
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,947
(George screams)

15
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,002
George?

16
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,717
(snarling)

17
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,012
(screams)

18
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,432
(inhuman squealing)

19
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,596
(man) So, this is where
the bad kids are banished to.

20
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,685
(man #2) Put me down here,
I'd probably cook up a lot of crazy ideas, too!

21
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,773
- Good morning.
- Morning.

22
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,777
Um...

23
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,572
I'll catch you guys later.

24
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:44,619
Some friends. They're just curious.

25
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:48,457
I'm not here to be a curiosity,
Agent Doggett. I'm here to work.

26
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,876
I am too, Agent Scully.

27
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:57,257
I've been here all weekend and this morning.
I went over every X-File in that cabinet.

28
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,843
I just left to get some coffee.

29
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,179
Well...

30
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:05,307
- D'you have any questions?
- Just a few!

31
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:13,023
Maybe first you could tell me where
your area is here and where mine's gonna be.

32
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,692
This is my partner's office, Agent Doggett.

33
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,571
You and I will just be using it for a while.

34
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:27,162
- So where do we get started?
- Homicides. Two in Idaho.

35
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,750
White male, 62, undertaker by profession.

36
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,794
He was killed on his porch,
ten feet from his wife.

37
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,963
(slide projector clicks)

38
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,798
Holy God.

39
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:44,846
Cause of death was blood loss
from numerous deep wounds, from bites.

40
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,098
Any thoughts, any questions?

41
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:56,775
- Bites?
- On his head, torso and hands.

42
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,819
Two of his fingers were missing, eaten off.

43
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:03,823
- By what, an animal?
- These were murders.

44
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:08,370
The bites on his wife appear to be human.

45
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:12,499
I've seen some violent crimes,
some seriously screwed-up stuff,

46
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,293
but this is extreme.

47
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:22,133
- Is there demonstration of motive?
- Not according to local PD.

48
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,429
Is there any pattern or ritual or anything?

49
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:32,561
I have to admit, Agent Scully, I'm at a loss.

50
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:37,232
Well, that's a good place to start.

51
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:54,374
- You the folks from the FBI?
- Yeah.

52
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:59,671
- Yale Abbott, Cassia County Sheriff's.
- Hi. Agent Scully. This is Agent Doggett.

53
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,007
We like to handle our own problems,

54
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,677
but some hotshots in the county seat
think this is beyond us.

55
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,972
Not that we don't appreciate
your coming out to help.

56
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,057
Well, I hope we can.

57
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:14,769
- I'm a little baffled by what I've seen.
- Oh, really?

58
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:18,982
Detective, we've seen cases like yours
regularly on our unit.

59
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:22,527
Agent Doggett has only just
been assigned to the X-Files.

60
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,947
There is nothing baffling
about human bite marks.

61
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,783
That's what I was getting around to, ma'am.

62
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:33,038
We're not so sure now
that these bites are human.

63
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:41,129
The bodies were found by neighbours, so
there was contamination of the crime scene.

64
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:47,052
My boys did a damn good job of separating
the various shoe prints and pulling these.

65
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,220
Come on over.

66
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,849
Right there. See that?

67
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,935
- (Doggett) What is it?
- It's not human, I know that.

68
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,773
- It's not quite animal, either.
- There's only four toes.

69
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:05,987
That's not an unheard-of birth defect.
No more rare than polydactyly.

70
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:10,533
- What did she just say?
- I assume she means it could be human.

71
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:15,413
Is that a fair assumption?

72
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,876
I'd say that assumption is the problem here.

73
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:25,632
A strange print is found, and immediately
the most important evidence is thrown out

74
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:27,926
to try and force an explanation.

75
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:31,805
Maybe this print can help
explain those bite marks.

76
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,516
- How?
- I'm not quite sure yet.

77
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,851
She's not quite sure yet.

78
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:41,481
Well, I have to say,
I've worked a lot of homicides.

79
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:44,275
If the victims laid out here for any time at all,

80
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:50,490
in a setting like this, it'd be pretty
remarkable if they didn't attract animals.

81
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,538
I think postmortem predation
is definitely a consideration here,

82
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,541
but I only see one print.

83
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:05,630
And if it were an animal, there would be
numerous prints all over here and in the yard.

84
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:16,057
You agree, Agent Doggett?

85
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,810
I'm gonna go take a look around.

86
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:30,655
I got two old folks in the morgue,
mauled beyond recognition.

87
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,825
I have no motive to go on, no intent.

88
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,287
No evidence cries out for
a human explanation,

89
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,667
yet you stand there telling me flat out
that what we're looking for is a man.

90
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:48,673
Thanks for everything, Agent Scully.
We'll take it from here.

91
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:53,845
I'm sure your explanation will mollify
those hotshots down at the county seat

92
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:57,724
and relieve any general anxiety
about what this thing might be,

93
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,851
but only until it strikes again.

94
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,146
And one more thing.

95
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:07,025
I never said that
what you're looking for is a man.

96
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:13,072
(Doggett) Agent Scully?

97
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,042
Is that a second print?

98
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:33,802
Could be, but I'm not sure
if it tells us anything.

99
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:38,556
Maybe there's no prints in the yard
because whatever made these didn't go there.

100
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,100
It came through the house.

101
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:45,688
If anything,
I'd say this print leads up the stairs.

102
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:01,496
Think I've got another partial here.

103
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:11,339
- There is a more obvious explanation.
- Mm-hm?

104
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:15,510
The more basic answer is
what we're dealing with is simply a man.

105
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:19,597
A psychotic killer with a deformed foot.

106
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,725
You're familiar with
the principle of Ockham's razor?

107
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,021
Yeah. You take every possible explanation
and choose the simplest one.

108
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:32,360
Agent Mulder used to refer to it as
Ockham's principle of limited imagination.

109
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:36,781
Unless you have a simple explanation
as to how a killer with a deformed foot

110
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:39,284
leaves a print only every 25 feet.

111
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,167
Or to what he'd even be doing up here.

112
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:53,298
I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out
just like you are.

113
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,437
Agent Doggett?

114
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,138
It's dark up here.

115
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:45,850
What do you see? Agent Scully?

116
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,478
Right now, not a heck of a lot.

117
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:05,787
If there was anything up here,
it might have gone out that window.

118
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,624
You ever carry one of these?

119
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:13,461
Never.

120
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,892
V for "victory".

121
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:31,729
What?

122
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:35,274
You said the male victim
was missing two fingers?

123
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,486
Well, how'd the fingers get up here?

124
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:45,201
Well, from their smell,
I'd say they were regurgitated...

125
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,786
recently.

126
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,955
By What?

127
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,962
I saw those on the porch, too.

128
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:59,132
Looks like, to me... I don't know.

129
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:02,510
Like it was... It was...

130
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,597
Hanging there?

131
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,929
(screeching)

132
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,149
- You still here?
- Yeah.

133
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,779
I was waiting for lab results
and I wanted to take another look at the body.

134
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:04,614
Why? What did you find?

135
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:09,327
Nothing that will allay anyone's fears
about what killed this man or his wife.

136
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,038
"What"? You mean who killed them.

137
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:18,211
To be honest, what I found here
leans more towards an animal explanation.

138
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:22,924
The scratches on the body
match the four-toed prints that we found.

139
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:26,010
And the bites have fang-like tears.

140
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:30,973
What I thought were marks left
by human molars are now inconclusive

141
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:35,853
because of enzymes that were found
in the bites, which are clearly inhuman.

142
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:43,236
Anticoagulants, which are found
solely in the saliva of bats.

143
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,448
- Bats.
- Yeah.

144
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:51,911
I can't exactly explain it,
but I realise I owe the detective an apology.

145
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:55,039
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

146
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,711
Montana. Headline, circa .

147
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,089
The story's the same as what you told me.

148
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:07,969
The creature was taken to the coroner,
who confirmed it was neither man nor animal.

149
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:13,599
Two days later the coroner was
disembowelled by something with four toes.

150
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:17,645
It ate several body parts
and regurgitated them elsewhere.

151
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:21,566
- Did they ever find it?
- Five men died or disappeared.

152
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,735
Then the killing stops. It doesn't say why.

153
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,283
But 44 years later
it appears it's back and killing again.

154
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,958
(snarling)

155
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,398
You see those marks, right?

156
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,610
And the ones over here on the rafter?

157
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,870
If you ask me,
those look like claw marks.

158
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:22,668
I don't care what kind of a savage he is,
what did this isn't human.

159
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:30,218
If I may speak for Agent Scully, we're both
prepared to concede that point, Detective.

160
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:35,139
- Then you know what this thing is?
- I've got an article I wanna show you.

161
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:39,185
- (Scully) Agent Doggett?
- A rather strange account from .

162
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,146
I found something. A photo album.

163
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,732
- I think it's our first break.
- What is it?

164
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:49,028
The victim's daughter - Ariel -
her body was pulled from the river last week.

165
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:54,075
I got that call. Had to come
tell Mrs McKesson the bad news.

166
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,202
You saying there's a connection?

167
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,372
You not only told her mother
her daughter was dead,

168
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:03,334
but that her body had been
horribly and inexplicably burned.

169
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,837
A daughter who, by the way,
she hadn't seen in over 40 years.

170
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:12,510
Since , to be exact, which is the date
your article says those first killings started.

171
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,597
Do you see the connection?

172
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,227
I'm not sure where you're going
with this, Agent Scully.

173
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:25,356
- The daughter is the connection.
- How is that?

174
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:31,195
I don't know, but these killings only started
up since her burned body has been found.

175
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:37,034
Honest to God! You just jump at
whatever explanation is the most far-fetched.

176
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,914
I suggest you jump at it, too, because
her body may have been burned for a reason.

177
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,542
You're gonna wanna exhume it
to find out why.

178
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:51,048
You want me to dig up a dead body when
I have real people whose lives are in danger?

179
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:53,217
Hey.

180
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,097
(whispering)

181
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,903
What did you say to him?

182
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:16,365
I told him to dig up the body.
Isn't that what you wanted?

183
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,909
What else did you say to him?

184
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,416
I told him you were a leading authority
on paranormal phenomena,

185
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,877
and who are we to argue with an expert.

186
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,963
Look, I am not an expert.

187
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,592
I am a scientist
who happens to have seen a lot.

188
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:40,514
- I am just making a leap here.
- Well, I'm sure you have your reasons.

189
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:47,104
You told him to exhume the body when you
don't even necessarily believe me yourself?

190
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,691
(sighs)

191
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:54,236
I told you I spent the weekend
looking through those X-Files,

192
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,240
and I saw how pretty much
every X-File broke with a leap.

193
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:02,286
Maybe I'm just an old-fashioned cop,
but I don't take leaps.

194
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,707
In my experience,
leaps only get people killed.

195
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:14,799
Well, I'd say that you're taking
a pretty big leap believing in that article

196
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,301
about a human bat.

197
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,399
(screeching)

198
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:55,691
How do you do it? I called the judge's order
in a half-hour ago. You're fast.

199
00:21:55,774 --> 00:22:00,654
Yep. We're really fast
when someone's done most of our work.

200
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,157
What are you talking about?

201
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:08,913
We got out here,
somebody had already dug up the box.

202
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,415
All we had to do was haul it out.

203
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:18,797
I don't know what they were using, but they
scratched up the wood on the lid real good.

204
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:27,181
Let's get this down to the morgue.
I think the sooner the better.

205
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,767
(faint screeching)

206
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,916
God!

207
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,294
(screeching)

208
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:00,714
(Abbott screams)

209
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:10,307
(screeching)

210
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:15,312
(screaming and snarling)

211
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,350
I want a word with you.

212
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,657
We listened to you.
The detective listened to you.

213
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,327
We could've been hunting this thing down.

214
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,538
- You should be doing that now.
- Now?

215
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,416
Now's too late for the detective, isn't it?

216
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:21,629
Look, we don't need you
telling us what to do, or your partner.

217
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,589
She's responsible for this.

218
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:26,800
Nobody's responsible,
except for whatever did it.

219
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:30,888
I don't care who she is or what she is,
she's not touching that body.

220
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,515
We don't need her far-out theories.

221
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,060
She's not welcome here.

222
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:50,699
What happened to the lynch mob?

223
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:54,119
- You hear all that?
- I heard enough.

224
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:58,374
- Things have taken a little turn.
- I don't think so, Agent Doggett.

225
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:02,002
You can think what you want,
but this looks bad for the FBI.

226
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:05,089
- It was unavoidable.
- How do you figure that?

227
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,219
This is the body pulled from the river.

228
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,764
She died of natural causes -
congestive heart failure -

229
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,266
but her body was only burned afterwards.

230
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:20,187
- By who, and why burn it?
- Obviously to cover something up.

231
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,148
- Yeah, but what?
- That's what I still don't know.

232
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:27,486
We know what we're looking for.
We should be out there looking for it.

233
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,905
No use standing here speculating.

234
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:33,033
It kills like an animal, but with purpose.

235
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:37,871
It stalked the detective for the same reason
it stalked the old woman and the undertaker.

236
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:41,542
Each victim had had contact
with this burned body.

237
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:47,631
The undertaker prepared it, her mother lD'd it,
the detective got the call when she was found.

238
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:50,300
Who else would have had contact with it?

239
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,636
The man who found her in the river.

240
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,764
A Myron Stefaniuk.

241
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,808
- Stefaniuk?
- Yeah.

242
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,980
One of the hunters in the photo in
was Ernie Stefaniuk.

243
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:11,864
There's an address in this file.
I hope we're not too late.

244
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,619
(vehicle approaching)

245
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,684
Mr Stefaniuk?

246
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,020
Myron Stefaniuk?

247
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:46,774
- That's me.
- Good. Sorry. You gave us a scare.

248
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:50,027
We went to your home up the road
and we couldn't find you.

249
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,196
Why would that scare you?

250
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:56,784
Sir, we work with the FBI and have reason
to believe your life may be in danger.

251
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:00,204
- I'm in danger?
- We're investigating some murders

252
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,290
that we believe are connected
to the body you found.

253
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,543
I fished it out of the river.
What have I to do with anything?

254
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:11,632
- We're not saying for sure that you do.
- It may just be your connection to the body.

255
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:15,302
There is no connection.
I just fished it out of the river.

256
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:21,058
- Sorry, sir, but that may be enough.
- That's nonsense. Leave me alone.

257
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,435
Ernie Stefaniuk.

258
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,729
Lived in Montana in .

259
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,065
D'you know him?

260
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,901
Ernie was my brother.

261
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:34,488
And one of three hunters
that killed a man that was half-animal.

262
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:39,576
- Please! That was a long time ago.
- Know where we can find him to talk to him?

263
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:43,330
My brother's dead.
That thing killed him.

264
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,250
I have a newspaper story
that says he disappeared.

265
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,503
That was 40 years ago.

266
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,506
Leave it alone! Leave me alone!

267
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,102
(truck engine starts)

268
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,128
We've been out here for nine hours.

269
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:36,466
The only thing this man seems to be
in danger of is terminal loneliness.

270
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,512
Maybe I'm wrong.

271
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:46,727
Maybe this is all just a grand coincidence
and we're wasting our time out here.

272
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,937
You were so sure before.

273
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:54,776
Yeah, I was sure of the facts
as I had deduced them scientifically.

274
00:28:57,195 --> 00:29:01,575
Maybe I'm. ..
I'm trying to force them into shape.

275
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,745
Maybe I'm manufacturing a theory.

276
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,539
What happened to taking a leap?

277
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,334
Maybe I'm just trying too hard.

278
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,754
To do what?

279
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,505
To be Mulder?

280
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,930
You know, I'm not Oxford educated.

281
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:30,479
About all I know about the paranormal is men
are from Mars and women are from Venus.

282
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:35,984
- But I don't think you're wrong, Agent Scully.
- What makes you say that?

283
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:40,697
Well, I'm no Fox Mulder,
but I can tell when a man's hiding something.

284
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:45,869
Myron Stefaniuk fishes a woman
out of the river who's been gone for 40 years.

285
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,164
He has a brother
he hasn't seen in over 40 years,

286
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:54,211
a brother who just happened to hunt down
some kind of creature over 40 years ago.

287
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,838
But what does he have to hide?

288
00:29:56,922 --> 00:30:01,927
That's what I'm hoping
this good cop work is gonna show us.

289
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,650
(Doggett) You there!

290
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,819
(Svullv) Stop right there!

291
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,536
(Scully) I see him.

292
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,294
Stop where you are!

293
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,671
Put your hands up and out!

294
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,509
Now, turn around, slowly.

295
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:10,680
- Are you Ernie Stefaniuk?
- (panicked breathing)

296
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:14,184
- Are you Ernie Stefaniuk?
- Yes.

297
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,741
How's a man supposed to live...

298
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,371
when his fear becomes obsession?

299
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:37,457
You'd do the same thing.

300
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,876
Who wouldn't who wanted to live?

301
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,295
You never left the island?

302
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:49,094
44 years. I wouldn't dare,
knowing it was out there.

303
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,556
That it could come back for me.

304
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:59,104
You know something about it.
About what this thing is.

305
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:10,699
I know on the evolutionary ladder
bats are real close by the apes.

306
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,869
And just as we came from the apes,

307
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:17,330
so might a man sprung from a bat.

308
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:25,297
To live and hunt like a bat, but with
the cold-blooded vengeance of a man.

309
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:32,304
Even if that were true, sir, how could it
possibly find you out here on an island?

310
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,932
I needed to cut off all contact.

311
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:39,060
Communication could be only one way.

312
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,271
My brother helped me.

313
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,568
And then there was my wife.

314
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,946
It was her body your brother pulled in.

315
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:56,036
She gave up everything to be with me.

316
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,499
I forbid her to tell her mother.

317
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:08,673
44 years on six acres of island,
she made only one demand.

318
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,971
To be buried in consecrated earth.

319
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,059
She was a Catholic her whole life.

320
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,821
Mr Stefaniuk.

321
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:37,035
It's killed four people.

322
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:41,456
All of whom would have had
traces of your scent

323
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:46,294
through various degrees
of contact with your wife's body.

324
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,880
- My brother?
- Your brother's OK, Ernie.

325
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:53,009
But he had contact with Ariel's body.
It'll come after him, too.

326
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,804
He's all right.
We spoke with him earlier today.

327
00:34:55,887 --> 00:35:00,850
Today? Today he might have been fine,
but this thing hunts like a bat.

328
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:03,103
It only attacks at night.

329
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:11,319
Stay here. Stay with him.

330
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:34,884
(screeching)

331
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,580
(screeching)

332
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:19,929
(Ernie) I still don't understand.

333
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,724
What's that?

334
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:26,353
- How did you find me out here?
- We followed your brother.

335
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,938
No, I mean who figured it out?

336
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:36,654
I was sure that what we were looking for
was something other than a man.

337
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,452
The detective who was running the case
didn't believe that, and he's dead.

338
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:45,663
But your partner, he believed it?

339
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,624
I think he does now.

340
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:50,126
So it was you who figured it.

341
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:57,967
Well, I made the connections,
but it was Agent Doggett that got us out here.

342
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,805
You ought to be wishing he hadn't.

343
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,642
Excuse me?

344
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:13,316
The moment you stepped foot here,
you're marked now. You know that?

345
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,902
Sir, I'm here to protect you.

346
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:19,364
And how are you gonna do that?

347
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:23,326
You thought of everything, except that.

348
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:29,332
Well, this thing, Mr Stefaniuk,
is still flesh and blood.

349
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,376
It can be killed.

350
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,462
You think it'll just walk through the door?

351
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:40,927
It's waited 44 years. It'll wait out there as long
as it takes, until you can't stand it any more.

352
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,932
How long can you wait, huh? A lifetime
to live in fear like this, a young woman?

353
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:53,273
Are you prepared to sacrifice family, children
and spend your life terrorised by a monster?

354
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,483
(alarm beeps)

355
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,535
- What is that?
- It's ground radar.

356
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,580
The sensor's set at ten-feet high.

357
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:14,043
Anything big enough to set it off
is coming in through the trees.

358
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,880
(thumping)

359
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,260
(thumping continues)

360
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,561
(creaking)

361
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,737
(creaking)

362
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,164
- You hear it?
- No.

363
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,043
Maybe I got it.

364
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,420
Maybe I killed it.

365
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:20,360
If you've got a gun, get it.

366
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:36,060
(gunshot/screaming)

367
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:43,067
(screeching)

368
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:53,494
Agent Scully.

369
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,705
(screeching)

370
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:12,388
- You OK?
- Yeah. I'm OK.

371
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,516
But you're not, Agent Doggett.

372
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,685
Oh, I got you.

373
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:28,738
(distant screeching)

374
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:59,602
Sorry I'm late. I received a fax up in my old
office from Ernie's brother, Myron Stefaniuk.

375
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:03,439
- He's alive? Where is he?
- He doesn't say.

376
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:09,195
He sent this from a small storefront business
just across the state line in Wyoming.

377
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,823
He's gone into hiding.

378
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:18,371
Do you believe it, Agent Doggett?

379
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:21,249
Believe it?

380
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:27,880
That this "thing" is still out there
and someday it's gonna come after us?

381
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:32,468
I'm pretty sure I hit it, Agent Scully.

382
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:34,637
Pretty sure you hit it, too.

383
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:45,314
The guys upstairs were making some noise
about this case and what's in our field report.

384
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:47,400
Yeah.

385
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:49,569
You'll get used to it.

386
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:58,411
I, uh...

387
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:03,332
I never had a desk in here, Agent Doggett,

388
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:07,462
but I'll see that you get one.

389
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:10,465
All right.

390
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:17,013
And I just want to say, um...

391
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:22,477
thank you for watching my back.

392
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,355
Well, I never saw it as an option.

393
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:31,277
I'm sure you don't either.

394
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:36,968

395
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:38,678
(Child) I made this!
