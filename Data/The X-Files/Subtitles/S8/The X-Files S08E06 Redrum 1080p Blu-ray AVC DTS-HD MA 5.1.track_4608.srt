John.

00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:03,690
The press got word you're taking him out.
It looks like Woodstock.

8
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:07,361
Postpone the transfer.
Get him out once the crowd disperses.

9
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:10,239
- Transfer me where?
- No, they'll camp out for days.

- We're going ahead with it.
- John. John, what is goin' on?

11
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:18,747
- Mr Wells. Mr Wells.
- Why did you do it?

12
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,752
All right, back up. Give him some room.
Come on, clear out. Back up.

Have you seen it before?

22
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:51,108
Um... yes.

23
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,319
- Who are you?
- Don't even, Martin.

24
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:59,241
What am I doing here? I'm in this cell. I don't
know where I am or how I even got here...

00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,077
I swear to God, do not play this with me.

eleventh-hour insanity defence.

00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:10,419
- What? John...
- It's time to start telling me the truth!

28
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:18,343
This key card, Mr Wells...

29
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,597
You do recognise it. Is that correct?

30
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:26,768
Yes, it's the swipe card that they use
at the apartment building.

31
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:30,397
- For all I know, it's mine.
- It is yours.

32
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:36,403
It was found in the Dumpster
behind the Strand Hotel.

33
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,447
You tossed it there, didn't you?

34
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,700
You had time to drive to Baltimore
and commit the murder.

35
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,618
Wait. Murder? What murder?

36
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:48,457
Then drive back to DC, toss the key card.
That way you could claim it was stolen.

37
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,879
Make it look like you spent your whole night
watching TV in your hotel room. Right?

38
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,214
Please...

39
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:01,553
What murder?
What is he talking about?

40
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,558
Well, maybe this will
jog your memory, buddy.

41
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,228
Vickie.

42
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,818
My wife.

43
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:19,154
This isn't happening.

44
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,825
This is not happening.

Court van is waiting.

46
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,470
All right. Dignity.
That is your strong suit. Play it.

47
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,600
Don't lower your eyes.
It makes you look guilty.

48
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:33,853
We drew Judge Kinberg.
What's your relationship with him?

49
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,982
- Benjamin?
- First-name basis. Excellent.

<i>(bailiff I All rise.</i>

53
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:51,413
He shot me.

54
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:54,416

Thursday, the seventh day of December.

57
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:05,844
- Thursday? It's not Thursday.
- Shh!

58
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:10,390
- It's Saturday. Yesterday was Friday and...
- Today is Thursday.

59
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,560
There's no court on Saturday. You know that.

60
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,897

00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,609
<i>(gavel)</i>

62
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:24,988
Case number 8ABX03.
District versus Martin Wells.

63
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:28,283
Charge of first-degree murder.

64
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:32,329
- The defence requested a hearing on bail?
- Yes, Your Honour, we have.

65
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:35,790
Mr Wells' status as a prosecutor
makes him a target.

66
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,418
We endanger him by keeping him in custody.

67
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:44,924
I'm assured by the Department of Corrections
that Mr Wells' safety is not a concern.

68
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:47,844
Furthermore, as Your Honour
will certainly agree,

69
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:53,808
Mr Wells is an upstanding citizen and
a respected member of the Maryland Bar.

70
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:57,354
Your Honour, with cold calculation,

71
00:07:57,437 --> 00:08:00,899
Martin Wells brutally stabbed
his wife in their own home.

72
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:04,319
He poses a threat to the public
and should be denied bail.

73
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:08,823
He doesn't pose a threat to anyone, and
he has two children who need him at home.

74
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,910
Why? Because their mom's not around.

75
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,746
Ms Carter.

76
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,710
I can't tell you how sorry I am
to see you on that side of the aisle.

77
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:25,507
I hope you'll forgive me when I do what you,
as a prosecutor, would demand.

78
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,676
Bail is denied.

79
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,931
I will order Mr Wells transferred to a more
secure facility in the interest of his safety.

80
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,850
Transferred? No, Ben.

81
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:39,688
You can't do that.
I can't be transferred. He'll kill me.

82
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,439
Tomorrow morning...

83
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:45,694
If today is really Thursday, tomorrow
is Friday, and that's when he'll do it.

84
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,405
He's gonna shoot me as I'm transferred.

85
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:51,032
- Bailiff.
- You don't understand.

86
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:55,078
It'll happen. It'll happen.

87
00:08:55,328 --> 00:09:00,333
Just listen to me. Ben, it'll happen.
He's gonna kill me! Ben!

88
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:19,602
Mr Wells, we understand that you had
an interesting morning in court.

89
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,522
What is it that you'd like
to speak with us about?

90
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,150
- You're John's partner?
- For God sakes.

91
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,611
Agent Scully. You know that.
You met her yesterday.

92
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:32,741
- Yesterday?
- Yeah. Yesterday. Wednesday.

93
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:36,703
- Wednesday?
- Are you saying that you don't remember?

94
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:43,543
- What is the last thing you do remember?
- Being shot by my father-in-law.

95
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,755
- You're wastin' our time.
- Listen.

96
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,883
I don't know what I experienced.

97
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,637
But what if it was a premonition?

98
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,184
A glimpse of the future.

99
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:04,773
I mean... you do hear
about these kind of things.

100
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,524
Yes.

101
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:09,861
You do.

102
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:18,411
Mr Wells, this shooting aside, is there
anything else that you remember before that?

103
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,998
Um...

104
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:27,921
I was in DC... uh...
for a sentencing hearing.

105
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:31,466
I was staying at the Strand Hotel,
like you said.

106
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,636
That was three days ago, Mr Wells.

107
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:39,766
Are you telling us that you don't
remember anything else?

108
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:42,769
Not the murder of your wife?

109
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:48,983
- No.
- Out of the blue, charged with murder.

110
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:52,612
You wake up one morning
and you can't remember a damn thing.

111
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:56,699
You haven't offered us one scrap
of evidence to support your story.

112
00:10:56,783 --> 00:11:01,704
As your friend, I'm gonna listen to anything
you have to say, but I will not be lied to.

113
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:04,791
I'm not lying.
You're talking to me about key cards.

114
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:09,879
I'm sitting in a jail cell.
I don't understand any of this.

115
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:18,596
But I did not... kill Vickie.

116
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:27,730
If you truly don't remember... then how
can you be certain that you didn't?

117
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,749
Courtney! Haley!

118
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,630
Hey, guys. on!

119
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,135
It's so good to see you.

120
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:44,098
- Come on, give Daddy a big hug.
- Hug your father, <i>nifias.</i>

121
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:55,652
- How are they holding up?
- Good. Good, Mr Wells.

122
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:58,279
They wanna know when you're coming home.

123
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,949
Oh. See, um...

124
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:06,120
Daddy has some things that he has to do -
very, very important things.

125
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:09,874
That's why I have to be here right now.
But then, guess what.

126
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,627
I'll be coming home.

127
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,880
Grandpa says they won't
let you come home.

128
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,236
<i>(gasps)</i>

129
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:46,911
Trina, I need you to get me something
out of the apartment, from the girls' room.

130
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,296
Thank you.

131
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,641
Why didn't you say before the hearing?

132
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:11,769
I hadn't even met you
before the bail hearing.

133
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,440
Nanny cam.

134
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,820
I wish you'd talked to me about this before.
I don't know if this is a great idea.

135
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,655
This may have the murderer on it.

136
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:27,827
Whatever is on that tape, I am an officer of the
court. I have to share it with the prosecution.

137
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,457
You think I'm guilty.
Let's clear this up right now.

138
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,420
Here.

139
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:45,803
My apartment. That's the girls' room,
and this must be the police investigation.

140
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,348
What time did the murder occur?

141
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:54,687
The official report has the police arriving
at your apartment at 6.20am Monday morning.

142
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,065
Your key card was used at 4.17.

143
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:01,069
Which means the killer
is somewhere in-between.

144
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:03,946
Wait. There's your wife.

145
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,705
Um...

146
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,292
We must have missed something.

147
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,881
- Right there.
- Martin, that's you.

148
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:13,558
- I'm not goin'.
- How's that?

149
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:17,728
I told you, this is the day.
If I go, I'll get shot. You cannot transfer me.

150
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:21,524
I don't plan to.
Your lawyers wanna see you.

151
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:31,409
Here's my favourite client.
Martin, you holding up all right?

152
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,870
Brent. I've been better.

153
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,081
We're gonna beat this thing. Guaranteed.

154
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:40,751
I have here one of the finest
criminal-defence specialists. Meet...

155
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,629
We met. I've been thinking about the tape,

156
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:47,758
and I don't see you having
to turn it over to the prosecution.

157
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:48,718
Sorry?

158
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:53,598
I showed you that tape in an effort to clear
my name, not as an admission of guilt.

159
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,683
Um...

160
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,645
Mr Wells, I'm Janet Wilson.
I don't think we've met.

161
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,402
Martin, what is all this about a video tape?

162
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:12,241
The... nanny cam tape.

163
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:19,749
- That's why you're here.
- I'm here to introduce you to your attorney.

164
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:23,294
We met yesterday at the bail hearing.
Don't you remember?

165
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,297
Martin, the bail hearing is set for tomorrow.

166
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:33,804
What day is this?
What day of the week... is this?

167
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,806
Wednesday. Wednesday 6.

168
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:41,562
Yesterday you told me it was Thursday.
The day before that it was Friday.

169
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,233
It's backwards.

170
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:48,486
Everything's going backwards.

171
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,782
I think we should have you speak to someone.
You're under a lot of stress.

172
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,701
Being locked up in this cesspool doesn't help.

173
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,537
We can have you out by tomorrow afternoon.

174
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:03,251
The prosecution's case is weak. They have
no physical evidence tying you to the crime.

175
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:08,506
Plus, they don't have the key card that was
used to access your apartment building.

176
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,802
The key card.

177
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:16,597
(Janet) Without it, they've got nothing.

178
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:48,546
Oh, yeah.

179
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:52,508
Somebody likes you, my brother.

180
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,970
Come on, man. I'm just messin' with you.

181
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,849
What? You ain't got
no sense of humour, Counselor?

182
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,228
- Do I know you?
- No, you don't know me.

183
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:07,481
Damn sure put me in here, though.

184
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:10,359
Possession with intent.
And concealed weapon.

185
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:13,237
Mm-hm. That concealed weapon
was a pipe wrench.

186
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:17,241
I was on my way to my baby's mama's house
to unstick her garbage disposer,

187
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:20,328
but I told you all that.

188
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:24,749
"Concealed weapon" added six months
to my sentence. You remember my name?

189
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,502
No. All I needed to know about you
was that you broke the law.

190
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,838
I broke the law.

191
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:35,718
Well, then, I guess
that makes you "Wife Killer, Esquire".

192
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,735
Yo!

193
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,946
Pick 'em up, you stumbling bitch.

194

<i>(prisoner) Go on.</i>

195
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,881
Argh!

<i>(buzzer)</i>

197
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:36,570
Aw, jeez, Martin. Your face.

198
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:42,410
It's all right. Appreciate you coming. Agent
Scully, I especially wanted to talk to you.

199
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:47,039
It's nice to meet you. I'm sorry
it's not under better circumstances.

200
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:50,459
This is the day we meet.

201
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:53,421
Something is happening to me.

202
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,882
Something I need to try
to explain to you, to you both.

203
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,805
I'm moving backward in time.

204
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:08,978
Every morning I wake up, it's the day before.
For me, yesterday was Thursday.

205
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:13,607
The day before was Friday. Only it's all
new to me every single morning I wake up.

206
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:18,070
I can only remember
what's happened the following day.

207
00:21:18,154 --> 00:21:23,159
Agent Scully, would you mind taking a closer
look at his injuries? Maybe check his scalp.

208
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:27,788
I know this all sounds crazy.
But I'm telling you the truth.

209
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,167
This cut, for instance.

210
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:34,378
It was on my cheek when I woke up yesterday.

211
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:37,798
I woke up this morning, it wasn't there.

212
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:40,759
But then this afternoon, I got cut.

213
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,846
I killed a spider in my cell yesterday.

214
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,932
First thing this morning,
I woke up, it's back again.

215
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:50,853
Because it happened the day before.
I haven't killed it yet.

216
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:55,858
Mr Wells, are you saying you don't remember
the day that your wife was murdered?

217
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,695
I'm talking about two days ago - Monday.

218
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,489
No.

219
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:07,912
I don't... remember it,
because for me, it hasn't happened yet.

220
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:18,172
You do realise that you're not gonna
be able to prove this. Right?

221
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:21,800
I mean, if, uh...

222
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:26,138
if tomorrow is really the day before today,

223
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:30,100
then... we won't have had this conversation.

224
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,564
- Oh, for cryin' out loud.
- You're gonna have to tell us all over again.

225
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:37,733
Yeah, well, uh...

226
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:42,196
make sure I skip that freakin' meeting.

227
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,749
Mr Wells, let's say that all this is true.

228
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,879
Why do you think it's happening?

229
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:01,006
I don't know.

230
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,135
There has to be a reason.

231
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,054
What reason?

232
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,014
Something...

233
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:14,270
I'm meant to understand?

234
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,776
Although I don't know what it could be.

235
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:26,198
Maybe you already have
the answer within you.

I'd really prefer to stay
while you do this, Martin.

239
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,858
I can take you through the chain of evidence.

240
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:04,778
I think I've done this before,
thank you, Ms Wilson.

241
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,665
Mm-hm.

242
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,209
Lookin' for some loopholes, huh?

243
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:23,047
Yeah, man, get yourself outta here.

244
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,343
They praying that you find one little
technicality so they can let you go.

245
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:31,305
- I'm not looking for technicalities.
- What are you looking for?

246
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,974
- The truth.
- The truth?

247
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,103
You better stick to the technicalities.

248
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:42,608
The truth is gonna keep you in here
and make you somebody's bitch.

249
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,693
That's what the truth gonna do.

250
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:51,158
So put on that engineerin' hat, Casey Jones,
cos you got a whole lot of trains to be pullin'.

<i>or if there are indeed
any suspects at this time.</i>

258
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:50,235
<i>much like this one.
The card in question belongs to Martin Wells.</i>

259

<i>It was used by the killer to enter
the apartment building through the garage.</i>

<i>Wells claims no knowledge
of its whereabouts...</i>

00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,913
Not something you wanna wake up to.

262

How you feelin'?

263
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:09,129
Disconnected from reality,
but I guess I'd better get used to it.

264
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,132
Oh, um...

265
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:16,887
Thank you. I assume you let me
spend the night here. Right?

266
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:21,475
- Thank you.
- Like I said, no problem.

267
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,772
So that makes today... Tuesday,
the day after the murder.

268
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,820
John...

269
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:37,241
I know who did it now.

270
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,161
- You know who killed Vickie?
- Latino.

271
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:44,206
Maybe 40, five ten, 185 pounds.

272
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:48,001
He's got a tattoo
of a spider web on his left hand.

273
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:50,796
Last night you said
you had no idea who did this.

274
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,798
Yeah, now I do.

275
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:58,846
Trust me. I don't know his name but you can
find him in the Baltimore City lockup.

276
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:03,058
Call 'em. They can ID him
based on what I just told you.

00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:17,531
<i>I just wanna say my daughter
was an exceptional person.</i>

278
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:22,202
<i>One who was loved

279
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:27,040
<i>(man) Sir, have the police identified
any suspects in your daughter's death?</i>

280
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,418
<i>(Al) They're not telling us much.</i>

281
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:34,256
<i>(man) What about rumours that
your son-in-law is the prime suspect?</i>

282
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:43,223
<i>Reporting from the Calvert House Apartments,
this is Brian Blakley. Back to the studio.</i>

283
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:47,060
No prisoner of that description
was processed in the past 36 hours.

284
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,897
He's in there. He's gotta be there.

285
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,566
Sorry, Martin, he's not.

286
00:28:56,862 --> 00:29:00,574
It must be too soon. He must not get
arrested until later today - Tuesday.

287
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:04,578
That's how he could have been
with me in lockup on Wednesday.

288
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:07,664
Martin, you have seriously lost me.

289
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:12,002
If you're trying to admit something to me
or to yourself, come out with it.

290
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,172
There's a reason all this is happening.

291
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:22,512
- Maybe I already have the answer.
- Well, how's that?

292
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:27,225
There's something in my apartment
that you need to see, John.

293
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,695
- Where is it?
- The girls' bedroom, right there.

294
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,430
Martin? Is this it?

295
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:24,491
My daughters were at
their grandparents', thank God.

296
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:29,204
The bedroom door was open,
with a clear view of the front hallway.

297
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,498
The nanny cam is motion-activated,

298
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:36,128
so it should have caught anyone
coming in or out of the house.

299
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:41,341
There I am. Nobody else on the tape
between my wife and the police.

300
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:44,011
I don't understand it.

301
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:50,350
I'd say this makes you look
more innocent than guilty.

302
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,312
Look there in the mirror.

303
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,648
The sun.

304
00:30:56,732 --> 00:31:02,279
Your wife comes home before
the murderer enters the building at 4.17am.

305
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:06,158
Her time of death is fixed
shortly after that, well before sunrise.

306
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:10,579
You came home later,
when the sun was already up.

307
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:15,292
The killer turned off the tape.

308
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,419
The only question is how?

309
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:22,049
There's a remote control for the nanny cam.
It's in a drawer by the front door.

310
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:28,305
But nobody else knew about it
except for Vickie... and me.

311
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:31,433
Are you sure about that?

312
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:41,818
FBI. I saw your curtains move.
I know you're in there.

<i>(door unlocks)</i>

314
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,407
Mr Wells, I...

315
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:51,453
You knew about the nanny cam, didn't you?
You told the killer about it.

316
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:56,750
- You must have given him my key card, too.
- Mr Wells, I wasn't even there that night.

317
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:01,379
First thing you're supposed
to say is "What nanny cam?"

318
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:11,848
- Is this your guy?
- I'm so sorry, Mr Wells.

319
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,684
He said he'd hurt my family.

320
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,646
He made me give him your key card.

321
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:34,871
His name is Cesar Okcampo.
He's got a full sheet - assault and narcotics.

322
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:39,292
- He knows the drill. He's a clam.
- We'll have Trina's testimony against him.

323
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:43,713
Maybe we won't. He's got her so scared,
we can't count on her.

324

<i>(phone rings)</i>

325
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:48,510

Please.

327
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:55,433

330
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,169
You have my record,
and you can't figure it out?

331
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:25,672
Cesar Okcampo. I don't know you.
I never prosecuted you.

332
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,799
Hector Okcampo, my brother.

333
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:33,180
- What was the charge?
- Possession with intent.

334
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,432
$50 worth of rock.

335
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:39,811
- It was his third strike, remember?
- Yeah, I remember. I did my job.

336
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:43,273
- You sent him up for life.
- I did my job.

337
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:49,696
I do it ten times a week,
every week of the year.

338
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,574
And for this, my wife is murdered?

339
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:57,787
You take away my dignity, my reputation, my
life because your brother's where he belongs?

340
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,290
Brady versus Maryland.

341
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:06,171
You know what I'm talkin' about.
Brady versus Maryland.

342
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:10,967
Prosecution's gotta turn over exonerating
evidence. You had the word of three people.

343
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,261
That wasn't Hector's rock.

344
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:17,557
It was in a jacket that wasn't even his,
left beside him in the club.

345
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:21,728
You knew that. You <i>knew</i> that
and you suppressed the evidence.

346
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,481
Are you telling me
your brother is not a dealer?

347
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:28,902
My brother was a bus boy when you sent
him up. He had two strikes on him.

348
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,279
He wasn't dealin' no more.

349
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:35,867
You sent him up for who he used to be.

350
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:40,872
And cos it was easy. You broke the law.

351
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,967
I tell you what we'll do.

352
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:55,553
You'll be convicted of my wife's murder,
one way or another.

353
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,265
Plead now and I'll look into
your brother's case.

354
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:03,311
Maybe I'll find a way to recommend
a reduced sentence. Time served.

355
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:07,524
You wantjustice? So do I.

356
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:14,447
My brother's dead.

357
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:18,535
Hung himself in his jail cell
a couple of weeks ago.

358
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:23,248
Martin, a word.

359
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:35,468
I'm sorry, Martin. I tried to talk 'em out of it,
but they think they have a case.

360
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,263
Sir, turn around, please.

361
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:42,017
Martin Wells, you are under arrest
for the murder of Vickie Wells.

362
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:47,314
You have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can and will be used against you.

363
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:29,189
Come on, pick up.

364
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,274
Pick up!

365
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,196
<i>(answering machine) Hey, there.
This is the Wells' residence.</i>

366
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,449
<i>We can't come to the phone
right now, so leave a message.</i>

367
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:44,204
Honey, this is Martin. Pick up the phone.
Vickie, pick up the phone.

368
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,831
Pick up the phone!

369
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,794
It's not four o'clock yet.

370
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:55,382
When you get this, go to your parents' house
and wait for me to call.

371
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,967
I'm on my way back to the city.

372
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,804
<i>(banging on door)</i>

373
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,729
John, I need your help.

374
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:10,855
Martin?

375
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:18,196
- Vickie will be murdered inside of two hours.
- Vickie? Your wife?

376
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,741
I called the police. They might think
I was a crank. You call them.

377
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:25,578
- I can describe the suspect, his name.
- How do you know all this?

378
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,832
I haven't got time to explain.
You wouldn't believe it.

379
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:33,920
That's a bad sign because it's two in the
morning. I haven't seen you in three years.

380
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:38,591
- Give me something more to go on.
- This is all happening for a reason.

381
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:42,262
L... I'm being given a second chance.

382
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,266
A second chance to do what?

383
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:51,646
I prosecuted a man named Hector Okcampo.
I suppressed evidence.

384
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:54,691
He was innocent of the crime
he was charged with.

385
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:56,901
- Anything you say...
- You have to report.

386
00:37:56,985 --> 00:38:01,364
I put him away, he died in prison,
his brother wants revenge. Simple as that.

387
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:05,869
You could be disbarred for what you're
saying. You could go to prison. Understand?

388
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:09,414
I understand that I can save Vickie.

389
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,545
Hold on a minute.

390
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:52,332
- You got here in time.
- Are you Martin Wells?

391
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:53,958
Yeah. Vickie? Vickie?

392
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,337
There's nobody here. We checked.

393
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:02,759
- What exactly are we looking for?
- My wife's gonna be attacked here tonight.

394
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:06,471
The killer's gonna use
my key card to enter at 4.17.

395
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:08,806
It's 4.20 now.

396
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:15,522
I don't understand. I...
Where is she?

397
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:21,819
Tell you what. We'll take a sweep through
the neighbourhood, keep our eyes peeled.

398
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:25,323
We're a phone call away if you need us.

399
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:40,547
<i>(phone dials and rings)</i>

400
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,049
Come on. Come on!

401

- <i>Hello?</i>
- Al, it's Martin.

402
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,555
- <i>Martin? What time is it?</i>
- Al...

403
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:53,101
- ls Vickie there?
- No. The <i>kids</i> are here.

404
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:57,146
<i>- (thud)
- Vickie left hours ago. Isn't she home yet?</i>

405
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,691
<i>Martin?</i>

406
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,428

- Honey, why aren't you in DC? What the...
- Where have you been?

409
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,521
I got a flat on the way back from my...

410
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:44,652
- You're scaring me. What's wrong?
- We're in trouble. We have to get out of here.

411
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:49,032
<i>(whispers) Vickie, get in the bedroom.</i>

412
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,452
Lock the door.

413
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:56,706
Call the cops and don't come out
until I say it's OK.

414
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:55,098
Oh, my God, Martin!

415
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:57,767
Martin!

416
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:00,186
No!

417

Martin!

418
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,164

a second chance. Was this it?
