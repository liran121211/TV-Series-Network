1
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:08,468
(man) It's just senseless.
A man so young as Ray.

2
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,931
It's God's cruel trick, Nora.

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:17,144
Don't go blaming God, Curt.
You and I know what killed Ray.

4
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:21,148
Well, we don't know anything for sure.

5
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:24,651
How does a 41-year-old man just...

6
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:26,695
wither away and die?

7
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:31,408
If any of us knew that,
we'd have done somethin' about it.

8
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:35,120
Maybe it was just his time.

9
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:39,041
He was a young man
when he went over, Curt.

10
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:43,462
- Ray got sick because he fought in the Gulf.
- <i>(sighs)</i> Now, don't go there, Nora.

11
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,298
You just make it worse.
The doctors never said...

12
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:49,259
They never said! That's right.

13
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:54,640
My husband's dead, and no one knows why.

14
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:57,684
Maybe I have to find out myself.

15
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,607
They're gonna pay for Ray's death,
whoever's to blame.

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,110
No one's to blame. You're just upset.

17
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:12,783
- You need a good night's sleep.
- I don't wanna sleep, I just...

18
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,160
<i>(Sobs)</i>

19
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,663
You just want Ray back.

20
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:20,374
We all do.

21
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,461
Get some rest. I'll see you tomorrow, OK?

22
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,084
Ray?

23
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,046
<i>(Curt screams)</i>

24
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,409
The car's registered
to a Curtis Delario, local address.

25
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,953
So far he's been unreachable.

26
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:07,666
It's highly unlikely that wherever he is,
he feels like picking up the phone.

27
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:12,796
Muncie PD ran some calculations. Based on
distance travelled and length of skid marks,

28
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,051
the car was going at least 40 when it impacted
the object, which, according to their math,

29
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:23,098
would require something 4300 times
the density of steel to cause this damage.

30
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,308
Hm.

31
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,769
It's interesting, isn't it?

32
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:30,689
I mean, uh, in light of the evidence.

33
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:55,088
From their size and shape,
these look like men's shoes.

34
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:59,968
I hope you're not suggesting that what this
car hit was a man, because there's no way.

35
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:03,805
Well, these impressions in the asphalt
look pretty fresh to me.

36
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,185
I admit to the coincidence, but you know
as well as I that if a man were here,

37
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:11,646
he'd be splattered,
and there's just no evidence of that.

38
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,400
You're right.
Which is suspicious in and of itself.

39
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:21,615
This car definitely hit something, and the only
evidence that we have are these two prints.

40
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:30,957
I hate to ruin your beautiful theory with
ugly facts, but stop to examine the incident.

41
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,044
If a man were standing here,
the driver would have stopped.

42
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,213
<i>(Scully) It looks like he tried to.</i>

43
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:40,383
If a man were in the middle of the road
with a car coming, wouldn't he try to move?

44
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,969
Unless he wanted to stop the car.

45
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:46,681
Yes, but if nothing less than
a block of steel could stop this car,

46
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:51,186
then, ipso facto, it could not have been
a man standing in the street last night.

47
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,231
Or certainly no ordinary man.

48
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:02,405
Just tell me what happened!
Where is he? Where...?

49
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:04,783
Excuse me, ma'am.

50
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:07,118
John Doggett with the FBI.

51
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,539
- You know about this?
- What happened? Where is he?

52
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:14,334
- Curtis Delario, you know him?
- He was a friend of my husband's.

53
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:18,171
- They worked at the salvage yard.
- I want you to calm down, Mrs...?

54
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:22,050
Pearce. How am I supposed to calm down?
Finding this now, it...

55
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,595
- We're not even sure he was driving the car.
- He was.

56
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:28,473
He came over after my husband's funeral,
then he left...

57
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,767
Agent Doggett!

58
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,323
Meet Curtis Delario.

59
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:50,954
I guess he won't be much help
clearing any of this up.

60
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,593
I think I got some answers.

61
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:09,431
So do I. It wasn't the crash
that killed Curtis Delario.

62
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:13,268
He was badly injured,
but he was clearly still alive

63
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:17,731
when his body was pulled
through the car's windshield.

64
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:18,940
Pulled?

65
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:24,154
Yeah. These five deep puncture marks
match five fingers of one hand.

66
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:28,366
- You mean someone reached right in and...?
- Like a bowling ball.

67
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,996
- That seems humanly impossible.
- Certainly for any ordinary man.

68
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:42,047
From the evidence I've gathered, the man
that did this is actually less than ordinary.

69
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:47,510
I was able to reconstruct a section of the
windshield and lift a print from the glass.

70
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:50,972
- Whose?
- Raymond Aloysius Pearce.

71
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:55,310
Husband of Nora Pearce,
woman I spoke with at the accident site.

72
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:58,188
Her recently deceased husband.

73
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,984
Well, if he was recently deceased,
then it must have been an old print.

74
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:09,115
Well, what you would think, except along with
the print, there was evidence of fresh blood.

75
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,243
And it belongs to Ray Pearce too.

76
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,785
Mrs Pearce.

77
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:41,082
Agent Doggett again. Sorry to bother you,
but there are some things I need to go over.

78
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,377
- Everything all right, Nora?
- He's with the FBI.

79
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:50,008
This is Harry Odell. He runs
the salvage yard where Ray and Curt worked.

80
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,302
May I come in?

81
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,893
Agent Doggett, I don't understand.

82
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:05,231
Before, you were talking about Curt.
Now you wanna talk about Ray?

83
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,859
What was their relationship, Mrs Pearce,

84
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,820
your husband and Curtis Delario -
outside of work?

85
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:15,950
I know what their relationship is now.
They're both dead.

86
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:21,039
Your husband's medical record says that
he died after a long, debilitating illness?

87
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,583
Gulf War syndrome.

88
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:29,130
No one will cop to that, but I aim to
prove it... put the blame where it belongs.

89
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:33,718
I'm having trouble proving
something myself, Mrs Pearce.

90
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:38,640
You signed a form to have your husband
cremated, but it appears it never happened.

91
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:41,351
What do you mean?

92
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,813
They gave me the ashes.
They were at the funeral.

93
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:48,983
I can't find a record of Ray's body
ever even being at the crematorium.

94
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:53,863
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Hasn't this woman grieved enough?

95
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:59,160
Let me get to the point, Mrs Pearce.
Is it possible your husband is still alive?

96
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,621
Still alive?

97
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:05,458
- Is this a joke?
- Because we have evidence to suggest

98
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:10,839
that maybe your husband was involved
in the death of Curtis Delario.

99
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,882
Are you saying Ray faked his death?

100
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:17,595
We found Ray's blood
and fingerprints on Curt's car.

101
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:23,101
I watched him die.

102
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:27,438
I nursed him when he was sick,
when he couldn't eat.

103
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:33,528
What you're saying is impossible. He couldn't
even walk or... lift his head at the end.

104
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:39,909
Ray Pearce worked for me nine years.

105
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:44,080
He was a good man.
He never raised a hand to anyone.

106
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,483
Hey. How you doin'?

107
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,988
Ray, right? They said you're new.

108
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,283
Rough night?

109
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,121
You're, uh...
you're eating the tinfoil on the...

110
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:34,923
My name's Larina. I help out around here.

111
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:38,009
You might have some questions
about how it all works.

112
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,471
I don't know. It's pretty basic.

113
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:47,143
Look, um...

114
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:51,522
I've been down the road and back
a few times and...

115
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:54,442
<i>(sighs)</i> I just wanna say...

116
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,903
you're not alone, Ray.

117
00:12:57,403 --> 00:13:03,701
I mean, I... I've been where you've been and...
and sometimes it can help.

118
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,663
You know?

119
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:09,374
Sometimes it's good to just talk.

120
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,627
Make a connection.

121
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,047
You know what I'm sayin', Ray?

122
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:20,677
<i>(sighs)</i> So if there's anything
I can do for you, you know...

123
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,513
You can leave me alone.

124
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,392
OK.

125
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:38,171
<i>(shredder stops)</i>

126
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:41,049
God Almighty.

127
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,968
Ray.

128
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,345
<i>(chuckling) It's</i> true.

129
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,769
Oh, you got everybody wonderin', man.

130
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:57,857
And they're lookin' for you.
They blame you for killing Curt.

131
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:01,194
Now, me and Curt, we're your friends.

132
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:05,239
You can't blame this on us.
You gotta believe me, it wasn't us.

133
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:09,577
Well, I can show you.
It's right here, Ray. It wasn't me.

134
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,000
This time... you stay dead.

135
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,334
<i>(Odell screams)</i>

136
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,533
<i>Scully.</i>

137
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:34,370
Did you find anything to go along
with those holes in Curt Delario's head?

138
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,498
Paint on his hands and nails?

139
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:40,376
- Paint?
- Blue paint, specifically.

140
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,628
Hang on.

141
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:51,179
Uh... no. Is it significant?

142
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:54,765
I don't know.
But Harry was a busy boy last night.

143
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,518
He must've left Nora Pearce's
right after I saw him,

144
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:00,813
right after he'd learned
that Ray Pearce might still be alive.

145
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:02,106
To do what?

146
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:06,944
It's pretty clear he was in his office shredding
papers when he was surprised by someone.

147
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:11,657
- And you think it was Ray?
- Well... somebody took a blast.

148
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:15,411
There's blood all over the doors,
trailing down the stairs.

149
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:19,707
- Massive blood loss.
- But the man with the gun is dead.

150
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,085
I saw guys take hits in the war
that kept right on fighting,

151
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,464
holding their insides in their hands.
It's not impossible.

152
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,967
But to do this to a man's head
after taking two barrels of buckshot...

153
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,386
Or being hit by a car.

154
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,973
I don't see how a man could possibly do this.

155
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:38,768
Well, maybe the question's not how, but why.

156
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:44,357
I mean, if Ray Pearce did indeed kill
this man... what would be his reason?

157
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:47,985
<i>I'm not sure...
but I know where to start Iookin'.</i>

158
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,165
<i>(knocking)</i>

159
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:45,418
<i>(Larina) Hello?</i>

160
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,883
Ray?

161
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,649
Ray... You OK?

162
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,450
Somebody saw you come in
with blood on you.

163
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:21,329
I can see it on your clothes.

164
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,375
Look, Ray...

165
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:31,589
I know it never does anybody any good
getting the cops involved, OK?

166
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:34,300
Look, I've been there, man.

167
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:38,387
I know what it's like to feel dark and alone.

168
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,600
I can get a doctor for you.

169
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,770
Get out.

170
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:52,026
Get out.

171
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,403
OK.

172
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:58,115
OK.

173
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:08,376
They're called "smart metals". The idea is to
one day build things that are indestructible.

174
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:12,463
Cars, equipment, built of alloys
with molecular memory.

175
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,966
If damaged, they'd rebuild
into their original forms.

176
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,219
All by themselves?

177
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,557
- <i>(Doggett)</i> That's amazing.
- And right now, a metallurgist's pipe dream.

178
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:27,269
But beside the point of your visit,
I would imagine.

179
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:33,275
Well, you tell me. I found a document at
a crime scene listing Chamber Technologies.

180
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,947
An employee number on the document
was assigned to a Dr David Clifton.

181
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,741
Dr Clifton's no longer here.

182
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,579
- What happened to him?
- He left the company.

183
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:48,749
I'm actually his successor in this department.

184
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:53,671
Do you deal with a man named Harry Odell
or a business called Southside Salvage?

185
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:56,924
No, I don't deal with materials.
Nor did Dr Clifton.

186
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,802
Our work here is all theoretical.

187
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,222
We have an environmental manager
in charge of waste management,

188
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:09,103
but disposal is done at TSD facilities,
definitely not city salvage yards.

189
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:13,274
- Thanks for your time, Doctor...
- Puvogel. German, no h.

190
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:17,611
- You need me to spell it for you?
- No, no. That's quite all right.

191
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,405
Thanks.

192
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:29,707
<i>- Scully.
- Hey. It's Agent Doggett.</i>

193
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:33,210
- <i>I'm at Chamber Technologies.</i>
- <i>Did you find</i> Dr <i>Clifton?</i>

194
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:37,840
He's left the company, but his successor
says his work was entirely conceptual.

195
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:41,719
- Everything's done on computers.
- What kind of conceptual work?

196
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:44,555
Thing called smart metals.
It's pretty incredible.

197
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,267
<i>Metal alloys designed to rebuild themselves.</i>

198
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,478
I wonder.

199
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:55,149
As it happens, Ray Pearce's illness
is pretty incredible, too.

200
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,776
<i>I've reviewed Ray's medical records
from the VA.</i>

201
00:21:57,902 --> 00:22:01,655
What his wife was calling Gulf War syndrome
is nothing of the kind.

202
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:08,078
His entire cellular makeup was affected by
exposure to a non-identifiable contaminant.

203
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,914
<i>A metal.</i>

204
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,001
What are you sayin'? Ray Pearce
has become some kind of metal man?

205
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,171
That only happens in the movies,
Agent Scully.

206
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,798
Does it, Agent Doggett?

207
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:24,553
Tell you what. I'll press this guy here
a little more on the issue.

208
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:30,142
Maybe there's a reason why he's
not being perfectly forthcoming.

209
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:43,864
<i>(TV) Police are seeking clues in
last night's bloody robbery and murder</i>

210
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:46,283
<i>at Muncie's Southside Salvage.</i>

211
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:50,788
<i>Workmen found the body of 53-year-old
Harry Odell outside his office</i>

212
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,707
<i>at approximately 7.30 this morning.</i>

213
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:57,670
<i>Detectives have refused to comment on
the cause of death pending an autopsy,</i>

214
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:02,132
<i>but sources close to the case describe this
as a vicious and grisly attack.</i>

215
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:06,220
<i>Robbery appears to be
the motive behind this...</i>

216
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,852
<i>- (woman) Operator 525. What city, please?
- Muncie.</i>

217
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,980
Number for a Raymond Pearce.

218
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,240
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.

219
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,993
I just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce,

220
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,580
and it was indeed the same Ray Pearce
pronounced dead three days ago.

221
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:37,251
But that's not all. By all medical standards,
he should still be dead.

222
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:42,339
His blood has enough metal alloy in it
to poison an elephant.

223
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:45,467
Except that he's still a man,
and he'll act and think like one

224
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,970
even if he is more powerful
than a locomotive.

225
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:51,140
But then the question is, why kill his friends?

226
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:55,728
I mean, if he was wronged somehow,
wouldn't he go to them for solace?

227
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,856
- I mean, to his wife, at least?
- That's why I was late.

228
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:03,777
I asked myself that same question.
Ray was an outpatient at the VA.

229
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,948
He had a history of substance abuse.
Did some time for a couple of DUls.

230
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:10,826
- This was ten years ago.
- Cleaned up his act.

231
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:14,955
He met Nora and married her in '91,
checked into a rehab and got straight.

232
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,960
This was a guy to root for, that overcame
adversity and made a life for himself.

233
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:24,632
- Until three days ago.
- I've busted a lot of killers, Agent Scully,

234
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,384
and dollars for doughnuts, they fit a profile.

235
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:30,137
But the Ray Pearce in this file is no murderer,

236
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,308
let alone a guy that would hunt down
his friends and crush their skulls.

237
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:38,896
The man that we're speaking about
withstood impact from a speeding car,

238
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,566
and two shotgun blasts at short range.

239
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,986
Even if we can find him,

240
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,740
who's to say we can stop him?

241
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:46,023
- Make sure that door is secure.
- Dr Puvogel,

242
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:49,943
are you sure he can't
open that door from the inside?

243
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,238
I've got a manual override on the door.

244
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,041
- (thud)
- What the hell was that?

245
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,960
Ray Pearce.

246
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,838
<i>(pounding)</i>

247
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:13,717
The door is four inches thick.

248
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:19,348
- I don't think it's gonna hold!
- You'd better hope it does,

249
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:24,561
cos if it doesn't, he's coming after you,
and I don't know if we can stop him.

250
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:28,065
<i>(pounding stops)</i>

251
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,372
Open it up.

252
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,582
Get it open!

253
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:51,421
There's a rupture in the chamber.
I don't believe this.

254
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,504
Agent Doggett.

255
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,303
Look at this. You see this?

256
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,182
(Doggett) What is that? Is that blood?

257
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,977
Turning itself into metal.

258
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,235
Get him out of the building.

259
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,574
- I didn't do anything to the man.
- You wanna argue, or go someplace safe?

260
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:04,661
- Where's that? Where's safe?
- It's not in here.

261
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,531
My God.

262
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:45,285
- It's true.
- You shouldn't have come, Nora.

263
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,871
I shouldn't have come?

264
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,751
That's what you say to me?

265
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:56,838
I'm your wife.

266
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:01,343
I came here because you didn't come to me.

267
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:07,975
I had to have some stranger tell me.

268
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,770
Why didn't you come, Ray?

269
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,606
Because I'm not me.

270
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,291
I don't care what's happened.

271
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,003
Whatever it is, it's a miracle.

272
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:40,924
<i>Don't go. (winces)</i>

273
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:48,432
- There's your miracle.
- Ray, let me help you.

274
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,935
Please, let me help.

275
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,488
They've got to pay for this.

276
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:06,575
They've all got to pay.

277
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,952
<i>(taps drum)</i>

278
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,112
<i>(whispers) Oh my God!</i>

279
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,705
What's going on?
It's not enough that my life's been threatened.

280
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:39,751
- I'm being treated like a criminal.
- And not without cause.

281
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,712
- Oh my God.
- Do you recognise this man?

282
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,220
<i>(Doggett)</i> We're assuming you don't know
too many guys in this particular condition.

283
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:58,061
- It's not what it looks like.
- Is this Dr David Clifton, your predecessor?

284
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:08,655
- <i>(sighs)</i> Yes.
- You care to explain how he ended up

285
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,365
in a Chamber Technology
hazardous waste barrel?

286
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:12,617
It was his idea. I was against it.

287
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:18,165
If you knew, you might've told me
about this when I first came to see you.

288
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:21,918
He was dying, and he was afraid.

289
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:26,548
- Of what?
- That it would hinder progress, or halt it.

290
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:30,010
- That it would finish us.
- Oh, you're finished.

291
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:36,391
- One way or another, your work here is done.
- We didn't know this was gonna happen!

292
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:42,856
We were just trying to push the envelope,
do the right thing for the company.

293
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,609
Then he got sick.

294
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,491
He was... he was working with an alloy
with a genetic algorithm built into it.

295
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:59,039
It converted electrical energy
into mechanical. Gave it memory.

296
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,458
And it poisoned him.

297
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:05,378
We immediately shut down the project.

298
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,423
But it was too late.

299
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:11,301
He didn't have any family.

300
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:17,307
His work was his life. He wanted to leave us
to continue working on the science.

301
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:23,480
And to ship this barrel and body to Southside
Salvage, where it infected somebody else.

302
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,816
I don't know how that happened,
I swear to God.

303
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:32,697
That barrel was supposed to go
to a designated site.

304
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:39,371
Let me talk to you for a second.

305
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,838
I think he's telling the truth.

306
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,467
What the hell is she doing here?

307
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,263
<i>- (elevator bell)
- Who is it?</i>

308
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:59,015
Nora Pearce, Ray's wife.

309
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,913
Mrs Pearce?

310
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:24,708
What are you doin' here?

311
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,753
How do you know about this place?

312
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,214
She was looking for something.

313
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:35,010
Who'd you call, Mrs Pearce?

314
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,372
<i>(muffled scream)</i>

315
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,187
(man) Let's check in here.

316
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,939
<i>(pounding on door) Police!</i>

317
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:40,867
- <i>(man)</i> You want us to take her in?
- <i>(Doggett)</i> I want to talk to her.

318
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,497
Your husband just
broke through a second-storey wall

319
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:49,042
and eluded a dozen cops at St Clare House.

320
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,003
That please you, Mrs Pearce?

321
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:57,592
Does it please you to know that he killed
a woman volunteer named Larina Jackson?

322
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:02,597
That makes three people. Three people
that he's killed, and for what?

323
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,433
Because they made him what he is.

324
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:10,980
They say this young woman he killed tonight
had been concerned for him,

325
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:13,983
concerned for Ray's welfare.

326
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:19,656
Whatever Ray is, whatever he's become,
it was an accident.

327
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,286
- It was not those people's fault, Mrs Pearce.
- Harry and Curt knew about it.

328
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:30,500
No, they were innocent, just like Ray was.
They didn't know this was gonna happen.

329
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,294
These people here knew.
They got documents on it.

330
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:36,172
Oh, so that's what this is about?

331
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:40,093
This is about
looking for somebody to blame?

332
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:44,681
Ray sent you here, didn't he,
to find that person, to get a name?

333
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:47,767
The Ray I know... died.

334
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:54,023
- The man responsible should pay for that.
- So who is it?

335
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,777
It's the CEO here? The owner?

336
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:02,198
Give us a name, Mrs Pearce,
before someone else has to die.

337
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:06,077
I... I never gave him a name.

338
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:14,419
Get her outta here. Put her on 24-hour watch.

339
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,137
We'll be right outside, ma'am.

340
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,657
Nora?

341
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:49,913
- They're right outside, Ray.
- Did you get me the name?

342
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,790
You killed her.

343
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:57,003
The woman who called me.
For God's sake, Ray, why?

344
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,923
Why her? She cared about you.

345
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:07,805
I need the name.

346
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,767
No one else needs to die, Ray.

347
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,607
You won't do it, not to me.

348
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,193
I need the man's name.

349
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:29,077
- He's in the house!
- Go! Go!

350
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,305
Tell the FBI agents it's Harris.
Ray made me give him the name.

351
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:52,308
Owen Harris! Ray's gonna kill him.

' (Woman) No!

358
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:30,096
Owen Harris, don't look away.

359
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:35,143
- Look at me.
- Why are you doing this?

360
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:38,354
Because you made me.

361
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:43,026
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Southside Salvage.

362
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,945
- I'm just an accountant.
- Daddy!

363
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:50,450
Daddy!

<i>(Siren)</i>

365
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,523
Ray Pearce.

366
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:08,569
He came here to kill this man,
but something stopped him, didn't it?

367
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:10,988
This man, Owen Harris...

368
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:13,282
He begged for his life.

369
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:18,204
It mightjust have saved him.
His attacker got up and ran away.

370
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:27,630
Makes no sense. Pearce was a determined
killer, lookin' for someone to blame.

371
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:29,924
Why StOp here?

372
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:34,595
<i>(Scully) Wherever Ray Pearce went,
the answer to that question went with him,</i>

373
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,307
<i>but I can tell you
why he came after Owen Harris.</i>

374
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,060
<i>It was his name Nora found in the file.</i>

375
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:45,648
He authorised the shipment of
hazardous materials to Southside Salvage.

376
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:50,236
<i>(Doggett)</i> But if Harris is the guy Ray
holds responsible, Why'd Ray let him live?

377
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,490
Well, I think that, uh,
Nora Pearce may have been right.

378
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:58,119
Her husband died, or at least his body did.

379
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:02,081
Whatever killed those people
was an abomination of a man.

380
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:05,084
- It was a machine.
- A machine?

381
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:10,256
Come on. A machine
doesn't know blame, Agent Scully.

382
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:13,134
Nor mercy.

383
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:18,222
Unless what drove Ray to kill
is also what saved those people.

384
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:23,394
Some flicker of humanity.
