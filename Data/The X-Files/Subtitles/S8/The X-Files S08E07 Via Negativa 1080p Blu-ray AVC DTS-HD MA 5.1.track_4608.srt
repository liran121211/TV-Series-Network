1
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:25,194
Damn, Jim, you fell asleep?!

2
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:27,487
We're on a stakeout, man.

3
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,576
- I guess. I don't know.
- What happened over there?

4
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,746
- What are you talkin' about?
- That house, man.

5
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,956
The front door was wide open.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,125
How long you been out?

7
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,379
We'd better check it.

8
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:00,687
Lights out. Door's open.

9
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:02,856
I don't like this.

10
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,285
(Jim) Looks like they all left.

11
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm not so sure.

12
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,711
This can't be.

13
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:53,156
Oh, God.

14
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,909
Stedman.

15
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,502
They're all dead.

16
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,339
(door closes)

17
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:31,111
(gunshots)

18
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,471
(phone rings)

19
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,063
Yeah?

20
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:51,316
It's Agent Scully. I'm sorry to wake you.

21
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:55,737
- What's up?
- I got a call from Assistant Director Skinner.

22
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:58,407
- He has a situation.
- What is it?

23
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,829
An agent is dead. Skinner had him surveilling
a religious cult in Pittsburgh.

24
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,997
All the followers are dead as well.

25
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:09,793
- What happened?
- He's having difficulty determining that.

26
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:18,176
- I'll pick you up.
- I'm sorry, Agent Doggett. I can't go.

27
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,346
Agent Scully?

28
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,350
Um... something unexpected has come up.

29
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:29,312
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

30
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:33,525
- Will I see you later?
- As soon as I can.

31
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:42,784
Ms Scully? The doctor wants
to see you right away.

32
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,189
- Where's Agent Scully?
- Running late.

33
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,608
What do we have?

34
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:20,447
Our man doing routine surveillance
on a cult, the lbogan Temple.

35
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,492
We had a tip they were trafficking narcotics.

36
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,912
Nobody suspected anything like this.

37
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,088
Agent James Leeds. Six-year veteran
of the Bureau, father of two.

38
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:41,843
A patrol cop found him.
Car was locked from the inside.

39
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:46,640
- Nobody saw or heard anything?
- No.

40
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:49,809
This couldn't have happened here.

41
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:53,104
Blood splatter on the seat says it did.

42
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:56,608
It's too narrow.
There's no room to swing the weapon.

43
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,945
- No.
- Besides, it doesn't make any sense.

44
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:04,241
The gun's still holstered,
and the key's in the ignition.

45
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,954
Even if he fell asleep...

46
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:18,129
This is damn weird.

47
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,677
It gets weirder.

48
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:35,188
(Skinner) These people were all killed
the same way as our guy.

49
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:39,943
All 20 cult members dead from
a single deep wound to the forehead.

50
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:46,199
- Is this every member?
- Except one.

51
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:49,911
Their leader, Anthony Tipet, is missing.

52
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:56,418
Tipet was a convicted murderer
who claimed to have found God.

53
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:02,340
We didn't think we were dealing
with an apocalyptic cult.

54
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,676
We've seen this kind of thing before.

55
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,345
Jonestown. Heaven's Gate.

56
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:16,771
However devoted they were, they wouldn't
just let their leader bash their brains in.

57
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:20,025
At least one of 'em would've
had a problem with it.

58
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:23,528
I've considered that.
I'm running tox tests for drugs.

59
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,989
Does that include our man in the car?

60
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,495
AD Skinner? We're still unable
to locate Agent Stedman.

61
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,499
- (Doggett) Angus Stedman?
- (Skinner) Leeds' partner. Do you know him?

62
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,085
- Where'd you look?
- He wasn't at Leeds' motel.

63
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,379
He's not answering his cell or his pager.

64
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:44,090
- Did you check his condo?
- His condo?

65
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:49,804
Stedman's from Pittsburgh. He keeps a condo
here that belonged to his folks.

66
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,601
Angus Stedman, it's John Doggett.

67
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:25,924
(Skinner) Doggett.

68
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:45,276
(man on TV) The body is but clay.

69
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,949
A shell made by God to hold
the twin aspects of the Holy Spirit:

70
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,702
light and dark.

71
00:08:55,995 --> 00:09:00,792
If we have the courage
to see into darkness,

72
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,461
we see into God...

73
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:06,297
free of the clay which confines us.

74
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:11,344
Tipet served 12 years for the bludgeoning
death of his wife. He then became a minister,

75
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:15,098
preaching a hybrid
of evangelical and Eastern religions.

76
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,143
He said a higher plane could be reached
by the via negativa -

77
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:21,813
the path of darkness -
the plane closer to God.

78
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:25,191
Once reached it would let
the spirit travel unhindered.

79
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:28,695
Tipet believed hallucinogens
would lead him to this plane.

80
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:34,409
Specifically, compounds of the bark
of an African tree. The iboga.

81
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:40,540
All these people were so stoned on this bark,
they just let their leader kill them?

82
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,668
We found no trace of the drug
in the blood of any victim.

83
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:50,133
I don't understand. How in the hell did Tipet
manage to slaughter all these people?

84
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:55,513
He was paranoid, but nothing says he wanted
to take the lives of his people or our men.

85
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:58,558
This is our one and only suspect.

86
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,436
Are you telling me he didn't do it?

87
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:05,398
Whoever did this left not even a trace how.

88
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,943
No prints, no forensic evidence whatsoever.

89
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:13,156
Agent Leeds' sedan, the cult house,
Agent Stedman's condo...

90
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,658
were all locked from the inside.

91
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,079
That's impossible.

92
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:23,082
Unless Tipet took the drug and succeeded.

93
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,547
Unless his consciousness was there
but his body was somewhere else.

94
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:34,969
The X-File explanation.

95
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:39,849
I take it this theory comes from Agent Scully?

96
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,106
Agent Scully has yet
to reach any conclusions, sir.

97
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,487
That's the problem. I'm not hearing
conclusions from either one of you.

98
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,783
If this man has "reached a higher plane",

99
00:10:56,866 --> 00:11:03,665
then explain to me why 22 people
are dead, including two FBI agents.

100
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:07,168
Now, I wanna hear
what you're gonna do about it.

101
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,804
If I'm working this case, give me a heads-up

102
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,598
before you tell him
more science-fiction stories.

103
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,976
I don't have another explanation.

104
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:27,939
Those guys in there are right. This whole
story doesn't make a damn bit of sense.

105
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:34,571
I'm supposed to give those guys answers.
You're supposed to help me do that.

106
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:38,741
Tipet's on the run.

107
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,202
Find him, and we just might.

108
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,889
- Spare change?
- I don't have anything. Sorry.

109
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:05,727
Come on, man. I know you got somethin',
cos I hearjinglin' in your pocket.

110
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:12,233
You don't wanna know me.

111
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,253
(phone ringing)

112
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,348
(answerphone beeps)

113
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,558
(Tipet) Pick up the phone, damn you.

114
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,727
Pick up the damn phone!

115
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,189
You did this.

116
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,317
You did this.

117
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,904
God help you, Andre.

118
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,783
- I can't.
- (hangs up)

119
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,481
Agh!

120
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,658
Agent Doggett.
Coroner's report.

121
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,667
"Victims all killed by a single blow
from an axe blade, six to eight inches long."

122
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,963
The photos of wound patterns don't match
up to any known make or manufacturer.

123
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,215
This fit the description?

124
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:04,178
It's a ceremonial axe used a thousand years
ago to cleave the skulls of unbelievers.

125
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:07,807
- It was required reading for Tipet's followers.
- Is this our weapon?

126
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,228
No, sir. It's on permanent display
in a Calcutta museum.

127
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,273
Another dead end.

128
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:18,359
Like everything else in this case.

129
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:27,660
I'm a good investigator, but I'm not the agent
that should be investigatin' this case.

130
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:30,163
Agent Scully can't be here.

131
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:32,457
- You spoke to her?
- Tonight.

132
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,045
She told me to tell you she's fine.
She's taking some personal time.

133
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:40,548
I've got 22 people dead,
and she's takin' personal time?

134
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,514
You're not listening
to what I'm telling you.

135
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,017
Do your best without her.

136
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,694
(footsteps approaching)

137
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:12,747
Spare change?
I'll take whatever you got.

138
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,231
(man yells)

139
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,199
N... No!

140
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,784
No!

141
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,135
(knock at door)

142
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,892
- Sir?
- I think we caught a break.

143
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:18,187
A homeless man was found dead
in Pittsburgh two hours ago.

144
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:23,234
- I had them e-mail me some digital photos.
- Any witnesses?

145
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,237
A man fitting Tipet's description
used the payphone.

146
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,781
- So we got somethin'?
- There's no evidence.

147
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:32,618
- There's no fingerprints, no fibres...
- You got him at the scene.

148
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:35,288
There's nothing to link him to the murder.

149
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:39,584
I'm supposed to believe this guy
doped his way into another plane of reality?

150
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:43,296
That his spirit is goin' around killin' people?

151
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:49,302
All right, just suppose that this drug
finally did what Tipet said it would.

152
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:53,222
That his spirit could be in one place
while his body was in another.

153
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,808
Then tell me why he's doin' it.

154
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:59,937
If he's lookin' for God,
why is he killin' people?

155
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:05,026
Just cos I'm on the X-Files,
you want me to think like Scully and Mulder.

156
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,654
You got the wrong guy.
I need facts, not wild ideas.

157
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:11,824
All right. Then consider this one.

158
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:18,164
I had Pittsburgh PD
check the log on that payphone.

159
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:23,544
10.12pm, a call was placed
to one Andre Bormanis.

160
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:27,173
He's a convicted drug dealer
that sewed time with Tipet.

161
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:30,509
That number's a DC area code.

162
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,186
(knocking)

163
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,733
FBI. open up!

164
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,285
Mr Bormanis? Andre Bormanis?

165
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:00,581
Doctor Bormanis.

166
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,459
Agent Doggett. Agent Skinner.

167
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,836
Can we have a word with you?

168
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:21,936
You always up at this hour,
Dr Bormanis?

169
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,314
It's when I dissect my rats.

170
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:28,025
Neighbours can't hear 'em screaming.

171
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,530
That's a joke.

172
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,120
You spoke to Anthony Tipet
earlier this evening.

173
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:43,332
- My machine picked up. I missed the call.
- What did he want?

174
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,003
We need to find him, Dr Bormanis.

175
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:49,630
This man may have murdered 23 people.

176
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:53,551
23? The news said 22.

177
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,220
Another man died tonight.

178
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:03,311
I'm not doing anything illegal here.

179
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:06,772
I just... I just made him stuff.

180
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:08,816
You mean drugs.

181
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,112
You supplied Anthony Tipet
with drugs, right?

182
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:17,325
Hallucinogens were Tipet's way
into the depths of the soul,

183
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:20,077
the heights of consciousness,

184
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:24,665
planes of being that our feeble
brain chemistry cannot begin to imagine.

185
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:26,917
Was that why you cut yourself?

186
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,755
Or was that the, uh...
mark of the initiated?

187
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,466
It's protection.

188
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,468
At least I hope it is.

189
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,304
Nobody took the trips but Tipet.

190
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,973
See, only his mind was strong enough.

191
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:48,230
You know, I can't tell, Doctor, whether
you admire Tipet or you're afraid of him.

192
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,234
Those people he killed last night,
did they admire him too?

193
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,495
- What are you doing?
- Taking you in.

194
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,623
On what charges? I just explained it to you.

195
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,292
Agh! Don't! Look...

196
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,045
I need that!

197
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:18,177
Don't... don't leave me! Please!

198
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,346
Don't leave me!

199
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,930
Agent Doggett?

200
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:47,683
It's Agent Scully.

201
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,654
Agent Scully?

202
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,324
Skinner told me about the case.

203
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,951
I know you covered for me.
You didn't have to.

204
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:07,703
It's all right.

205
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,872
I appreciate your discretion.

206
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:13,918
It's easy to be discreet
when you don't know what's goin' on.

207
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,337
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

208
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:23,135
Skinner says that you're around the clock
on this. You need to get your rest.

209
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,054
I grabbed a few winks.

210
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:29,892
I asked him to contact some friends of
Mulder's. I think they'll be able to help.

211
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:35,022
- I'd appreciate all the help I can get.
- Doggett, you're a good agent.

212
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,401
Trust your instincts.

213
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:48,369
The drug that Bormanis was cooking up
was some kind of a superamphetamine.

214
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,955
Legal or not, no one's ever seen it before.

215
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:54,416
You think it was intended for Tipet?

216
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,585
He wants it for himself.

217
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,925
He doesn't wanna go to sleep.

218
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,136
- Doggett?
- I wanna talk to him, now.

219
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,145
(distant squeaking)

220
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,151
(squeaking continues)

221
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,972
Can we get this gate open?

222
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,308
Get it open now!

223
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,108
(terrified gasps)

224
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,364
(agonised groans)

225
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,410
Aaaargh!

226
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:25,049
Agent Doggett, what is it?

227
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,263
Open it up.

228
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,552
Byers, we've a right to information.

229
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,429
(Byers) It's not our information.

230
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:16,266
- How many times did we save Mulder's butt?
- How many times did we save Scully's?

231
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:19,603
(Byers) These files are theirs.
They're private.

232
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:23,565
Mulder wouldn't mind. We practically solved
half these cases for him.

233
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,235
Yeah, Byers, quit your whining.

234
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:30,280
Scully asked us to give our assistance,
not to go through her... files.

235
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:32,825
- Like she's gonna care!
- Yeah, right.

236
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,619
Can I help you gentlemen?

237
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,957
You must be Agent Doggett.
I'm John Byers.

238
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:45,796
These are my associates
Melvin Frohike and Richard Langly.

239
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:50,467
You're the guys Scully told me about.
Mulder's friends.

240
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,886
Yes, that's us.

241
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,307
- You publish The Lone Gunman newspaper?
- Our reputation precedes us.

242
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:00,561
Yeah. I read Mulder's files.

243
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,063
Then you know
how badly you'll need our help.

244
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:05,899
We reviewed your case,
as Agent Scully asked.

245
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:10,154
Mondo bizzarro. No of fence, man,
but you're in way over your head.

246
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,491
What help can you give me?

247
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,245
Hit the lights.

248
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,414
Are you familiar with this image?

249
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,417
(Byers) In the Renaissance
it represented an all-seeing god.

250
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,087
That's why our Founding Fathers
put it on the dollar bill.

251
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:32,176
We believe its meaning here relates to
Eastern religion, a belief in the third eye,

252
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,762
or what the Hindus call the Sahasrara.

253
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,847
The third eye...

254
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:42,352
We all have a third eye. If we could open it,
we'd see a new reality - one closer to God.

255
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,522
At least that's what Kesey told me
on the bus back in '64.

256
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,858
You were not on the bus
with Kesey in '64.

257
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,027
I got the pictures to prove it.

258
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:54,198
- Before or after you partied at Altamont?
- Altamont was in the '70s.

259
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:58,368
- Whatever!
- I see where you guys are goin' with this.

260
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:02,456
- Tipet believes he opened his third eye.
- Yes, exactly.

261
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,295
The placement of the wounds on his victims
could suggest he's tryin' to destroy theirs.

262
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,298
Yeah... that could be.

263
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:16,303
But if he's moved closer to God,
why kill 'em? And how?

264
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,891
We don't know why.
But we might tell you how.

265
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:29,066
- You've heard of MK-ULTRA?
- The CIA mind-control project in the '50s?

266
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:34,738
They gave LSD to people, to see what would
happen. Didn't bother tellin' 'em first.

267
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:38,408
They understood the power of hallucinogens
to harness the mind.

268
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,994
Tipet was on hallucinogens,
not his victims.

269
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:45,082
The CIA invested millions
trying to create psychic assassins,

270
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,668
failing where Tipet has succeeded.

271
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:52,422
Reaching a drug-induced higher
consciousness, using his mind as a weapon.

272
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:55,592
He makes his victims think
they're being hit by an axe.

273
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:59,596
- Or any number of nightmares.
- They believe it, it happens.

274
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:06,186
What if Tipet could invade his victims'
consciousness in their sleep?

275
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:10,858
That's why you'd be afraid
to fall asleep, right?

276
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:14,444
If you thought your nightmares
might come true?

277
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,114
- You believe that?
- No.

278
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,617
But if Tipet does...

279
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:25,122
he'll need more drugs to keep killin'.

280
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,549
That's not bad for a beginner.

281
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,164
- Doggett, someone's been here.
- (rats squeaking)

282
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,594
(machinery powering up)

283
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,857
(Doggett) Anthony Tipet. Anthony Tipet!

284
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:36,610
Step away from the saw.

285
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:41,531
You don't understand.

286
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,700
Just step away from the saw.

287
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:47,955
I didn't want this to happen,
but I can't stop it.

288
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,127
He understands.

289
00:29:56,213 --> 00:30:02,302
He saw what can happen.
What will happen... unless I stop it.

290
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,557
Doggett!

291
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:09,476
(screaming)

292
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:18,568
I want a stat trauma panel with full tox,
EKG and metabolic profile.

293
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:22,197
Agent, this man needs to be admitted.
You need to sign him in.

294
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,454
Come in, Agent Doggett.

295
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:18,211
AD Skinner said you could shed light
on the reasons for Tipet's suicide attempt.

296
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,380
Yes, sir, um...

297
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:27,137
Via negativa - the path of darkness -
Tipet believed he reached it.

298
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,142
He believed that the drugs took him inside
the subconscious minds of anyone he knew,

299
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:37,981
making the most horrific, irrational
dream imagery of their nightmares come true.

300
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:41,485
That's why he tried to kill himself-
to make it stop.

301
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,825
Excellent job, gentlemen.

302
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,162
Have your reports on my desk 0900.

303
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:57,250
Case isn't over yet, sir.

304
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,839
AD Skinner says our suspect's
lyin' hospitalised in a coma.

305
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,092
Now you're sayin' it's not over?

306
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:09,596
We have no murder weapon,
no forensic evidence.

307
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,934
Unless we accept Tipet's own beliefs,
which you say are preposterous...

308
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,519
It's over.

309
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:21,191
- We've no way of explaining how he killed...
- I said it's over, Agent Doggett.

310
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:27,197
I don't need every I dotted or every t crossed
to know that we've got our man.

311
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,875
- (phone rings)
- This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message.

312
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:43,713
Agent Scully, I think
we caught the guy who did it.

313
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:48,385
But... still, it...

314
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,889
it just doesn't add up.

315
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,811
(sighs)

316
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:01,064
It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

317
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:06,319
I know this will sound strange,
but there's a part of me that says

318
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,573
what if... what if this guy was right?

319
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,743
What if I should have let him die?

320
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,416
I'm not makin' a whole lot of sense.

321
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,043
Maybe I just need some sleep.

322
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,384
If you get this message... and feel up to it,
you give me a call.

323
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,503
Is the assistant director in?

324
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,798
- That'd be great. Thanks.
- John!

325
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:36,219
Excellent work out there, John.
Just excellent.

326
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,223
Agent Doggett.

327
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,170
Is something wrong?

328
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,646
I'm not sure I'm awake.

329
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:37,739
You think this is a dream?

330
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:40,784
I mean, you standing here talking to me?

331
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:43,453
All those people out there?

332
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:58,301
Last night, I dreamt Tipet was
inside my house, holding an axe.

333
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:03,348
I thought I woke up this morning.

334
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,560
I thought I was awake, but... but then...

335
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:14,025
What do you want me to do, pinch you?

336
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,944
You're already awake.

337
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:19,906
Stedman and Leeds must have
experienced the same thing.

338
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,325
All Tipet's victims.

339
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:27,205
Everything seemed real...
but it was a dream.

340
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:33,086
A dream that ended in their deaths.

341
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,881
Anthony Tipet is in a coma,
never to regain consciousness.

342
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:42,011
He knows me now.

343
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:46,683
He can enter in my dreams.

344
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:50,228
Listen to me.

345
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:54,107
You've had a tough couple of days.
You're tired.

346
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,778
Go home, get some rest.

347
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,813
(distorted) She's going to die.

348
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:20,652
(distorted) I'm not going to let you do that.

349
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:23,780
I'm sorry,

350
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:26,658
I'm not going to kill her.

351
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:32,038
You are.

352
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:45,129
(Scullv) Agent Doggett?

353
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,840
Agent Doggett.

354
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,179
Hi.

355
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:59,602
How'd you get here?

356
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,355
Your door was unlocked.

357
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,483
You just saved my life, Agent Scully.

358
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:09,862
I just woke you up, Agent Doggett.

359
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:15,118
Tipet's in my dreams.

360
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:23,042
- If you hadn't woken me up just now...
- Anthony Tipet is dead.

361
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:28,381
I got the call from Skinner
on my way over here.

362
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:31,467
He never regained consciousness.

363
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:41,477
- Are you OK?
- I seem to be, yes.

364
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,021
If you need some more time off...

365
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,483
I'm... I'm back at work now.

366
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:55,158
That must have been some nightmare
you just had.

367
00:42:56,325 --> 00:43:02,415
Tipet thought he'd find God...
by lookin' in the darkness inside himself.

368
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:05,877
You don't think he succeeded?

369
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,715
In my dreams, I...

370
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,846
I saw terrible, violent images.

371
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,602
Scared the livin' daylights outta me.

372
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:31,694
These things are a part of me,
I can't deny that. But... maybe...

373
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,408
maybe they didn't come from me.

374
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:40,036
Then where'd they come from?

375
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:45,374
It was a bad dream, Agent Doggett.

376
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,919
But that's all it was.

377
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,761
(Child) I made this.

378
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:41,556
