00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,205
Mom!

2
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,293
Watch me!

3
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,962
OK, Billy!

4
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,096
Mom! You're not watching!

5
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,355
Mom!

6
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,252
Billy?

7
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,216
Billy!

00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,261
Billy!

Billy!

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,519
Billy! Billy!

00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:46,358
My little boy!

13
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:49,486
Billy! Billy!

14
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,198
Billy!

15
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,196
- Mom!
- Hi.

16
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:18,867
Josh, I was just coming in.
They know you're supposed to wait.

17
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,246
- They're looking for you.
- Who? Who's looking for me?

18
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,291
Hey, what is it?

19
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,630
Go look, Mom.

20
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,772
Mrs Underwood. We tried to call you.
You must've already left.

21
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:52,150
What is everyone staring at?
What is going on?

22
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,253
Billy?

23
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,856
My beautiful boy.

24
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,943
Billy!

25
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,206
Oh, Billy.

26
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,375
<i>(weeps)</i>

27
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:57,632
I'm just going to shine
this light in your eyes, OK?

28
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:59,968
You're doing great.

29
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,056
Good. Nothing to it.

30
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:14,816
- He won't speak?
- No. Not even to his parents.

31
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,779
- Are they here, his parents?
- They've been here around the clock.

32
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:24,951
I took his prints. It's him.

33
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:28,038
Boy should be a teenager by now,
but look at him.

34
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,459
- Explain to me how that can be.
- I can't say, Sheriff.

35
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:35,837
I'm just here to find out who took him.

36
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:39,341
I talked to everyone at school.
No one saw him come back, or how.

37
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:43,011
The boy just come out of the blue.

38
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:46,973
- Are those the case files?
- Yeah. Plenty more where those came from.

39
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:51,019
There's just not much in 'em.
We never even had a suspect.

40
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:54,147
Have them set 'em over there, would you?

41
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,399
(sheriff I Set those on the table.

42
00:05:56,483 --> 00:06:00,362
What we've got here
is a healthy seven-year-old boy

43
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,114
who was born 17 years ago.

44
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,492
A healthy boy who won't speak.

45
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,828
Excuse me? Are you finished with Billy?

46
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:13,041
- Mr and Mrs Underwood?
- Um, you're with the FBI?

47
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:17,212
I'm Agent Scully, this is Agent Doggett.
We are investigating this case.

48
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,839
It's a miracle, isn't it?

49
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:26,263
Mrs Underwood,
whatever your son has been through,

50
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:29,391
it has somehow
affected his physical condition.

51
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:33,478
So we've been told by every doctor here.
We just want to take him home.

52
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,982
- After ten years, can we do that?
- Not yet.

53
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,988
I want to talk to him first.

54
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,408
<i>(door closes)</i>

55
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,373
How you doing, Billy?

56
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,250
My name's John.

57
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,382
I'm gonna have a seat over here.
Is that OK? Is that all right?

58
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:11,099
Billy, I want you to know
that you're not alone.

59
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:16,521
I've talked to lots of other boys and girls
who've been hurtjust like you.

60
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:22,527
Sometimes when they talk about it,
the hurt starts to go away.

61
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,531
You wanna talk about it, Billy?

62
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:36,958
Maybe you think bad things happened
to you because you've been a bad boy,

63
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:40,920
but I'm here to tell you, that's not true.

64
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:44,966
The bad guy is the one who took you away.

65
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,470
And it's up to you and me to get the bad guy.

66
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,061
See, cos as big and tough as I am,
I can't do it alone. I need your help.

67
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,273
Can you tell me about him, Billy?

68
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:02,901
What's his name?

69
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,070
What did he look like?

70
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,422
You remember this, don't you, Billy?

71
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:31,513
Would you like to have it back?

72
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,934
- What is he doing?
- Uh...

73
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,229
All I want is his name.

74
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:44,401
Who the hell do you think you are?

75
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:47,028
He's only a little boy.

76
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,576
Mr Underwood...

77
00:08:55,912 --> 00:09:00,166
- You think this is a game?
- A serious game. One we have to win.

78
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,212
Have you really worked kid cases before?
Child abductions?

79
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:08,216
I worked the Child Abduction Task Force.
This kid can help us.

80
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:12,595
This is a biological impossibility.

81
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:18,017
That's your area of expertise. I just want to
put the person who did this out of business.

82
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:21,062
Billy just didn't show up.
He got away, or was let go.

83
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,189
If he can talk, he can tell us by who,

84
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:27,652
or he can look at photos and point to the man
who did this, so this doesn't happen again.

85
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:32,115
You are ignoring the fact
that he is still seven years old.

86
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:36,244
"Failure to thrive". Isn't that the term?

87
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,581
Aren't there diseases
that delay puberty and so on?

88
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:43,501
I told you... he's not sick.

89
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:47,172
Good.

90
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,426
Then he can talk.

91
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,107
We're home, honey. Safe at home.

92
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:13,072
I'm going to go pay the sitter, Doug.
You bring Billy in.

93
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:17,035
Are you glad to be home, Billy?

94
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,044
A lot's new here, son.

95
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,465
You have a younger brother now. Josh.

96
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:35,220
You see that big dog out there with him?
That's Sparky.

97
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:38,598
Would you like to go play with him?

98
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,476
<i>(snarling and barking)</i>

99
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,312
Sparky! Get down!

100
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,606
What's gotten into you?

101
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:52,070
- Hey! Knock it off!
- What's the matter, Doug?

102
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,322
The dog just went off.

103
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:59,035
Sparky, what is wrong with you?
Come on, let's go. Come on.

104
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,789
Honey, it's all right.

105
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:07,001
He just didn't recognise you, that's all.
He's a nice dog.

106
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:11,506
He just doesn't realise that you're
part of the family. But you are, Billy.

107
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,385
And we're just so glad
that you're finally home.

108
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:25,103
You going to sleep here, too?

109
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:31,484
- What time is it?
- I spoke with the doctors who treated Billy.

110
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,404
- I looked at his charts.
- Did you find something?

111
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:41,202
Yes and no. What showed up is that Billy
is the same boy who was taken ten years ago.

112
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:43,705
- We know that.
- No.

113
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,624
I mean the same boy.

114
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,129
He has no cavities. He has no tooth decay.

115
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:53,715
He still has four baby teeth he's never lost.

116
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:57,760
He had a routine blood test
six weeks before he disappeared in 1990.

117
00:11:57,844 --> 00:12:01,723
His cell counts, his enzymes,
his hormone levels,

118
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:06,394
they are all exactly the same
as they were ten years ago.

119
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:10,273
- How can that be possible?
- It's medically <i>im</i> possible.

120
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:17,655
So what's the punch line?
Where are you saying he's been?

121
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:25,580
There are X-Files cases
that describe similar paranormal findings.

122
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:30,084
Alien abductees who came back
with anomalous medical stats.

123
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:34,255
These words, "anomalous",
"supernatural", "paranormal".

124
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,635
They purport to explain something
by not explaining it. It's lazy.

125
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:45,892
I'm not saying
that I can explain it, Agent Doggett.

126
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:48,853
But this is definitely not normal.

127
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,777
I went back to the witnesses at the crime
scene, to this guy Ronald Purnell.

128
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,740
- He was detained but dismissed as a suspect.
- What's your interest in this guy?

129
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:07,205
He's a high-school dropout, convicted of
possession, arson and shoplifting since 1990.

130
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:12,710
These are juvenile records.
These are sealed by the court, Agent Doggett.

131
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:16,130
- We're not supposed to have these.
- We're at a standstill.

132
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:22,595
- And you're breaking the law.
- I want to catch this guy, whatever it takes.

133
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,413
We love you so much, Billy.

134
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:54,711
It's so good to have you back,
to be tucking you in.

135
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,589
Sleep tight.

136
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,285
- (Lisa) What does that mean?
- (Doug) You're blind to what's going on.

137
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:32,707
<i>(Lisa)</i> Ten years we prayed for this.
Every night we prayed to God.

138
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,420
- I prayed for our son. He's not the boy I knew.
- What do you expect him to be?

139
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,341
- They told us this will take time.
- Even Josh is afraid of him.

140
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:45,803
- He is nothing to be afraid of.
- I wish I could believe that.

141
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:49,474
How can you sit here
and say these things to me?

142
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:32,183
Anybody in there?

143
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,352
Hello?

144
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,522
Ronald Purnell?

<i>(vehicle approaching)</i>

146
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,211
Ronald Purnell?

147
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,047
Yeah.

148
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:05,174
Can I talk to you?

149
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:09,554
Can you come out,
and we could have a conversation?

150
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:19,438
- Is this about my probation?
- It's about a boy named Billy Underwood.

151
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:22,483
You know that name? Ring a bell?

152
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:27,446
- No.
- It does to everybody else in this area.

153
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,783
He vanished from a school fair
you were at ten years ago.

154
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,077
You remember him now?

155
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:39,292
Yeah, I remember him.

156
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,378
- You think he'd remember you?
- Me?

157
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,131
You. Your face.

158
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,760
You're a trip, man. You know that?

159
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:53,639
This has nothing to do with
being stoned or violating your probation.

160
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:57,101
All I'm asking is that we go see Billy.

161
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,438
See what he says.

162
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,775
- See what he says where?
- Where? Wherever.

163
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,821
Wherever you want. I'll make sure he's there.

164
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,288
You're not making sense, dude.
Just leave me alone.

165
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:02,667
Billy?

166
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,339
Honey, are you here?

167
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:29,652
- What? What are you doing?
- Joshy! Oh, my God! Are you hurt?

168
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,612
No.

169
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,448
You're bleeding! Where did that come from?

170
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:36,242
I don't know.

171
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,624
Billy.

172
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,877
Billy, honey, what are you doing here?

173
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:51,257
Please, Billy. Answer me.

174
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,802
Just got word back from the lab.

175
00:18:55,928 --> 00:19:00,599
Ran the blood twice.
No doubt about it - it's the little boy's.

176
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:04,395
- I thought you said he wasn't cut.
- You're misunderstanding.

177
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:08,399
It's the other son I'm talking about-
Billy, the boy who was kidnapped.

178
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,319
- That doesn't make sense.
- Billy wasn't cut either.

179
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:15,698
No, but he definitely handled the knife.
His prints are on it.

180
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,368
- Where'd he even get it?
- His father's never seen it before.

181
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:21,329
He's no hunter.

182
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:25,499
Never cleaned an animal, which is
about all a knife like that's good for.

183
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,336
Except for killing, of course.

184
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,507
Well, I hate to say this,

185
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:38,763
but I think the best thing for Billy and
his family is if he's removed to an institution

186
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,891
to be observed by people
experienced in these things.

187
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:46,687
You mean remove him? Take him away?
After all his family's been through?

188
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:51,817
This is not a normal child, Agent Doggett,
and this is not a normal act.

189
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,863
You make it sound like he's possessed.
Call the exorcist.

190
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,575
He's a kid who's been through
who knows what kind of hell.

191
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,995
How do you know he's not
trying to communicate something?

192
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,374
And what's the message?

193
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,877
Yes, he's a kid, Agent Doggett. You're right.

194
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,547
He's a kid who materialised
out of thin air, unaged.

195
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:17,843
Do you not somehow recognise
how strange this is?

196
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,724
Did anybody notice this? This symbol?

197
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,559
Yeah. Um...

198
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:32,441
Yeah, I was going to mention that to you,
cos it's, uh... kinda weird.

199
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:35,903
- Weird how?
- We tried everything to find that boy,

200
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:40,741
and who abducted him - went so far as to
bring in a police psychic, ten years back.

201
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:44,912
- Came up with that very same symbol.
- How exactly did he come up with it?

202
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,623
She. Sharon Pearl.

203
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:53,003
- Couldn't say how it came to her.
- I've seen this symbol before, too.

204
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,464
You have?

205
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,980
I'll be damned.

206
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,529
We love you so much, Billy.

207
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,409
Whatever happened,

208
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,911
we wanna put it behind us.

209
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,498
Be a family again.

210
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:37,631
And if you could help us to understand
what you're going through...

211
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,969
we could move forward.

212
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:53,397
No, we're just going to see a doctor,
someone you might want to talk to.

213
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:55,733
We're coming right back.

214
00:21:56,775 --> 00:22:00,988
Nothing's gonna happen.
Mommy won't let anything happen to you.

215
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:09,914
I just want you to get the help you need so we
can all live here together and be happy. OK?

216
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,500
Come on, sweetie.

217
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:47,576
I'll take him, Doug,
if it's such a strain on you.

218
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,007
If you think a shrink has the answers, fine.

219
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:05,928
I just don't want this to ruin
our other son's life in any way.

220
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,940
Billy?

221
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:21,610
Billy?

222
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,031
- Where's Billy?
- Billy?

223
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,741
Billy?

224
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:29,577
<i>(Lisa) Billy?</i>

225
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:32,621
<i>(Lisa and Doug)</i> Billy?

226
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:36,041
Dad!

227
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:46,176
I don't want no trouble.
Whatever you're doing, do it somewhere else.

228
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:50,097
You ever get off your lazy ass
to do anything but hassle me?

229
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,476
Watch your mouth. I got company comin',
and he won't take your lip.

230
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,853
Who?

231
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,196
Tell him to stay out of my face.

232
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,743
- Get away from me.
- Where you goin', weirdo?

233
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,037
Hey. Hey-

234
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:19,043
You steal those clothes off a fat man,
or did you just shrink?

235
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:28,510
Hey, you gonna get your butt
in this trailer, travellin' man?

236
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:33,766
Yeah.

237
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:38,270
All depends on what you got in mind.

238
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:49,466
<i>(woman on tape) Testing, one, two, three...</i>

239
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,763
This is great.

240
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:58,892
Now I've got a psychic who's gonna tell me
what's wrong with my son.

241
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:04,898
I understand your misgivings, but perhaps
you can look at this as just another avenue.

242
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:09,153
- An avenue to what?
- We're gonna solve this case.

243
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,864
We're gonna find out
who did this to your son.

244
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,825
And then what? What am I left with?

245
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:18,996
A kid who stabs knives
into his brother's mattress?

246
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,792
You don't know the half of it.
He gives everyone but his mother the creeps.

247
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:28,297
I just know that this is gonna tear
your family apart. And you can't let it.

248
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,467
You've got to save them
from the damage this can do.

249
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,178
I'll be happy to save what I can.

250
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,890
Come on, Josh. Let's go.

251
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,689
- Is this going to happen?
- Shouldn't you be telling us that?

252
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:48,025
You're no doubt confused, Agent Doggett.

253
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,445
I take psychic readings,
not see through walls.

254
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,410
Sorry to keep you waiting.

255
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,248
Mrs Underwood, I'm Sharon Pearl.

256
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:08,128
I consulted on your son's disappearance
back in 1990.

257
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,006
And you're Billy.

258
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,309
Ms Pearl? Are you OK?

259
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:26,230
There are very powerful forces at work here.

260
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:31,318
Working through this boy.

261
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,822
Drawing him to his brother.

262
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,286
I feel this force...

263
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,249
I feel this force...

264
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,920
<i>coming through you.</i>

265
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,218
You lost someone just like Billy.

266
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,104
<i>(speaks gibberish)</i>

267
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,115
What's happening to her?

268
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,451
Oh, my God.

269
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:39,261
Hey, fartknocker.

270
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,305
<i>(starter grinding)</i>

271
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,474
Where are you goin' in such a big hurry?

272
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:53,233
What's the matter?
Got something in your ears?

273
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,444
Don't touch me, Cal.

274
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,822
Oh, listen to him.

275
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:05,454
No wonder he wears them baggy britches.
Our Ronnie's a big man now.

276
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:15,255
Your old lady said...
the cops came and talked to you.

277
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:26,433
I am talking to you,
not the side of your head.

278
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:30,354
Better mind your p's and q's, Jones.

279
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:35,233
Or I'm gonna tell them
what you did to that little boy.

280
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:40,864
I'm gonna tell them what you got
buried out there in the woods.

281
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:46,244
What's going on with you two?

282
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,122
Talkin' about cars.

283
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:39,673
Well, they've got her stabilised,
and it looks like she's gonna be OK.

284
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:45,387
- If you're at all curious about her condition.
- I'd be more curious if I believed it.

285
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,597
Believed what?

286
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,558
The act.

287
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:54,187
- You think that was an act?
- It's pretty standard fare, isn't it?

288
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:59,317
Float a few choice revelations as if they
came from on high, roll around the floor.

289
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,987
You saw that symbol appear on her forehead.

290
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,366
It's a damn good trick.
Don't ask me how she does it.

291
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:15,500
- Agent Scully, please.
- No. I think you ought to hear this.

292
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,170
<i>(Pearl speaking gibberish)</i>

293
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:25,594
- Now listen to it backwards.
- <i>(singing)</i>

294
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,388
What's that?

295
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,767
It's a child singing... Lyrics.

296
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:35,187
<i>(child singing "All the Pretty Horses")</i>

297
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,733
<i>(hums softly)</i>

298
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,402
<i>(sings along with the child)</i>

299
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,661
You hear that, under the noise?

300
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,331
<i>(singing continues)</i>

301
00:31:56,792 --> 00:32:00,170
- Now...
- What's he doing here?

302
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,027
Get away from me!

303
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,035
Ronnie, open up the car!

304
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:38,041
Ronnie... Ronnie, stop the car!
Agent Scully, he's got Billy!

305
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:07,362
Get out of the car!

306
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,574
Now!

307
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:15,412
Don't move, Ronnie.

308
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,083
Where's Billy?

309
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,796
I thought you said Billy was in the car.

310
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,299
Where's Billy?

311
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,192
I'm gonna go pay. You want anything?

312
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,110
Josh, are you OK, buddy?

313
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,917
Dad, can l...?

314
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,665
Mister?

315
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,506
Pony? Hey, POW?

316
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,515
Hey, there you are.

317
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,278
<i>(screaming)</i>

318
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,447
Help! Help!

319
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:34,134
- Count to ten, Agent Doggett.
- He took Billy.

320
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:37,304
- <i>(sighs)</i>
- He couldn't have.

321
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:40,056
How you gonna back that up,
with Billy missing?

322
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,436
Not five minutes earlier
I saw him enter his home with his mother.

323
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:49,149
I saw him riding in the car with Ronnie.
Why else would Ronnie take off like he did?

324
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:52,319
It's impossible,
like everything else about this case.

325
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:56,323
Like how Billy can be in his home
one minute, and in Ronnie's car the next.

326
00:35:56,406 --> 00:36:00,201
- Everything about this case is impossible.
- This kid is the key.

327
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:03,830
I've been saying that from the beginning,
and I'll say it now.

328
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,084
Agent Doggett, Agent Scully,
I got bad news on top of worse.

329
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:11,713
Josh, the Underwoods' other little boy,
has disappeared.

330
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:17,260
I'm notjokin', not even close.
I got the parents out here now.

331
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,182
I've gotta talk to this kid, Agent Scully.

332
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:26,436
I'm absolutely sure.

333
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,369
Have a seat, Ronnie.

334
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:45,497
I know what you're gonna ask.

335
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:49,125
But I got no answer.

336
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:55,173
Well, there can be only one answer, right?
I mean, why else did you go to the house?

337
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:58,426
You went there for Billy, to get him back.

338
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,596
- No.
- You had him in your car.

339
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,935
- I don't know how he got there.
- Then why go to the house at all?

340
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,356
Because I didn't believe you.

341
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,195
Mom!

342
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:30,542
Didn't believe what?
What's so hard to believe, Ronnie?

343
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:35,547
- You said I could talk to him.
- You needed to.

344
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,759
After all those years, you couldn't
live without him. You wanted him back.

345
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,888
All those years, Ronnie.
All those years. Where'd you keep him?

346

<i>(muffled cries)</i>

347
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:58,570
- Man, you don't understand.
- You were sorry you let him go.

348
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:02,282
No, I...

349
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,451
I couldn't let him go.

350
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:09,205
<i>(sings "All the Pretty Horses")</i>

351
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:23,470
- Who else knew about him? Your mom?
- No.

352
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:26,556
- Where'd you keep him?
- I didn't.

353
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,478
- What did you do to him?!
- I didn't do anything.

354
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,400
I took care of him.

355
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,405
I... I sang to him...

356
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:46,451
so he wouldn't be afraid.

357
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,918
Afraid of who?

358
00:38:57,587 --> 00:39:00,757
Who was he afraid of, Ronnie?

359
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,553
Somebody else involved?
Somebody else make you do it?

360
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:10,642
He take that other kid, too?
Billy's brother? He take him?

361
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:18,274
You're afraid of him, too. You're a victim,
just like those other kids. Is that right?

362
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,488
You, me, Billy.

363
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:26,407
This is our chance, man.

364
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,910
What's his name?

365
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,987
FBI! Cal Jeppy! Come out!

366
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:26,134
It's OK, Josh. You're OK.
We're not gonna hurt you.

367
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:29,971
Agent Doggett?

368
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:32,348
He's on the run.

369
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:44,027
He's in the woods! Watch your fire!
There may be another boy!

370
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,964
Down on your knees!

371
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:08,885
- Hands in the air! Where's the kid?
- He's in the trailer.

372
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:11,471
Other kid!

373
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:15,600
- There's no other kid.
- Billy Underwood!

374
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:18,561
There's no other kid.

375
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,021
<i>(rustle)</i>

376
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:27,654
Get this man in cuffs! Read him his rights!

377
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:29,656
The kid's over...

378
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,614
I don't believe it.

379
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:15,743
OK. The clothes, the age
and condition of the bones,

380
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:18,204
the location of the grave.

381
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:22,542
There is no doubt that that is
Billy Underwood's skeleton in that grave.

382
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:27,046
We spent time with this boy.
Doctors took his blood. You examined him.

383
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,466
I can't accept it.
I can't believe we're asking them to.

384
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,721
I know. But the forensic evidence
is going to come out, and what then?

385
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:37,056
- What if I'm right?
- What do we do?

386
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,810
- We move on, let it go, case closed?
- I know where you are with this.

387
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:48,901
I have been there. You're feeling that you've
failed, that you have to explain this somehow.

388
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:53,781
- And maybe you can.
- Not if that's Billy's body, I can't.

389
00:42:53,865 --> 00:42:59,203
Maybe that's explanation enough. That
that's not Billy's brother in that grave, too.

390
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:03,666
That that man who did this
is never going to be able to do it again.

391
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,587
Isn't that what you wanted, Agent Doggett?

392
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,258
Don't ask me to believe that this is
some kind of justice from beyond the grave.

393
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:19,182
All I'm saying is that maybe you succeeded,
whether you're willing to see that or not.
