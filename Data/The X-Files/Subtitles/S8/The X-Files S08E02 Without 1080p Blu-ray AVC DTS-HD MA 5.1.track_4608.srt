1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,800
<i>(Scully) We live in a darkness
of our own making,</i>

2
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:11,096
<i>blind to a habitant world all but unseen by us.</i>

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:15,517
<i>A world of beings
travelling through time and space</i>

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:19,563
<i>imaginable to us only as flights of fancy.</i>

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,986
<i>Who are these beings we dare to imagine,
but fear to accept?</i>

6
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:30,741
<i>What dark work goes on
inside their impossible machines,</i>

7
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:34,453
<i>cloaked from us by invisible forces?</i>

8
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:38,749
<i>If they know our secrets,</i>

9
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:41,460
<i>why can't we know theirs?</i>

10
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:34,221
<i>(boy) Stop it, please. No!</i>

11
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,932
Stop it. Let me go.

12
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:40,227
- Let me go.
- (man) Let the boy go!

13
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:43,897
Let him go, Mulder!

14
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:55,158
Let him go, or I will be
compelled to use my weapon.

15
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:58,078
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to shoot.

16
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:12,092
Now, are you armed?

17
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:17,097
Come on, damn it. This is just stupid.

18
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,686
Don't turn this into a movie.
Just tell me if you've got a gun.

19
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,105
It's too hot for this BS!

20
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,696
All right, then, lie down.
Lie down on the ground.

21
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:36,116
Keep your hands out.
Lay down on your belly there.

22
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,750
For crying out loud, what are you doing?

23
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,128
Agent Mulder, stay there!

24
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,230
He went over! Over the edge!

25
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,024
Who?

26
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,069
Mulder.

27
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:50,607
All right. I'll talk to Scully.
You guys head back to the school.

28
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,777
Where is he? Where's Mulder?

29
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,363
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

30
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:59,074
An agent said on the radio you saw him.

31
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:03,370
I saw him back right off that cliff
and I saw him fall right over there.

32
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,081
- <i>(Skinner) Then</i> where <i>is he?</i>
- <i>Gone.</i>

33
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,334
- Come on. He can't be gone.
- He can't be, but he is.

34
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:14,756
That cliff there? He fell from there?

35
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,843
It's impossible, a fall like that.

36
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:24,099
A cop sees things. A man drops five stories,
dusts his head off and goes back to work.

37
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:28,812
An old lady gets shot in a restaurant,
plucks the slug out of her egg foo yung.

38
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:32,816
But even if Mulder survives this,
what he does then is too much.

39
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,862
You got your point of impact there,
clear and identifiable.

40
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:40,699
And a set of tracks here
leading down to the wash.

41
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:47,122
Look at these tracks. What do you see?

42
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:51,084
Mulder was running.

43
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,840
- It wasn't Mulder.
- That's the one thing I'm sure of.

44
00:04:56,923 --> 00:05:00,051
It may have looked like Mulder,
but it wasn't Mulder.

45
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:02,304
I told you I knew Mulder.

46
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,806
OK, maybe I didn't know him that well.

47
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,851
But I know who was up there,
and it was Fox Mulder.

48
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:13,148
I'm sure it did look like Mulder and
you have every reason to believe it was him.

49
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:16,109
But it was not Mulder.

50
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:24,117
I told you that I've seen things,
things that I can't explain.

51
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:29,998
Well, I have seen what looks like a man
transform into another man.

52
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,461
What looks like a man,
but who's not a man?

53
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:43,011
- So what is he?
- You don't wanna know.

54
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:47,015
If he's not a man, what the hell is he?

55
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:51,311
Don't turn your back on me.
I'm asking you a legitimate question.

56
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,982
He's alien.

57
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:08,495
- He's a bounty hunter.
- Looking to collect a bounty on...?

58
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:11,873
On Gibson Praise...

59
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:13,875
because he's part alien.

60
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:19,130
He's a human anomaly.

61
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:25,887
This alien bounty hunter disguised himself
as Mulder to come out here and grab the boy?

62
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:30,850
To take him back to his ship,
where we believe Mulder is.

63
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:41,319
You know, Agent Scully, you're starting
to remind me a lot of Agent Mulder yourself.

64
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:44,406
Well, then, you explain it to me.

65
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,834
If it's true or possible that there's someone
like this out there, this bounty hunter,

66
00:06:55,917 --> 00:07:00,380
he could just become anyone.
You, me, any damn one of us.

67
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:03,008
I think that it is true.

68
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,428
And possible.

69
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:11,891
And wherever Mulder is right now...

70
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:15,854
he better damn well be smiling.

71
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,823
<i>(woman) Is this authorised?</i>

72
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,954
<i>(vehicle approaching)</i>

73
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,291
Right. They're here.

74
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:52,265
- Any sign of him, of Mulder?
- Not according to these people.

75
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,851
We went through the school.

76
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,194
- You're better than this.
- Sir?

77
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,575
He's gotta be here somewhere.
Let's search the school again.

78
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:31,596
<i>(cracking)</i>

79
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,309
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

80
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,485
Hello?

81
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:52,450
Sorry. I thought you were...

82
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:55,078
I thought they'd cleared you out of here.

83
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,249
Find something?

84
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:02,502
No. Let's keep looking.

85
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:25,066
- <i>Administration building is clear.</i>
- <i>Copy.</i> Check <i>it again.</i>

86
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:30,405
I want to know how Doggett got here.
How did he even know where we were going?

87
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:35,243
I don't know, but he'll turn this place
upside down looking for the wrong person.

88
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:41,583
- What happened to Gibson Praise?
- Whatever happened to him, he's long gone.

89
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,544
Wherever he is,
he's three steps ahead of us.

90
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,437
We've got a pair of eyeballs on us.
Start walking. I'll be behind you.

91
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,368
Can I talk to you for a minute?

92
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:28,541
You shouldn't have come here.

93
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:42,180
You shouldn't have come.
You'll lead them to me.

94
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,390
I'm here to protect you, Gibson.

95
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:51,147
I know you know that's the truth.

96
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,608
I know you know my thoughts.

97
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:57,612
I know they took the man
you work with - Mulder.

98
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,990
And now they've come to take me.

99
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:10,249
The only reason they wanna take you, Gibson,
is because you're a special boy.

100
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:14,671
They wanna take you
because of what you are.

101
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:18,758
I'm sorry. I didn't know that
someone was following me.

102
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:25,598
My friend Thea knows.
She's the only one at school I've told.

103
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:30,687
She says the FBI is looking for me, too.
She's afraid for me.

104
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,109
She has a right to be afraid.
We don't know who to trust now.

105
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:44,117
- I fell when I was running away.
- You might have broken it.

106
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,208
If they find me, they'll take me.
I know it. I've always known it.

107
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,464
I'm gonna make you a splint, Gibson, OK?

108
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:07,181
I can set your leg, but I'm gonna
need a car to get you out of here.

109
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,646
I'm gonna come back for you. I promise.

110
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,234
I'm not gonna let anything bad
happen to you.

111
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,320
You said that to me once before.

112
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,468
<i>(cellphone rings)</i>

113
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:46,721
Yeah? Deputy director for you.

114
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:53,102
- This is John Doggett.
- I'm getting reports from Arizona...

115
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:56,105
- Yes, sir.
- ..that you found Agent Mulder.

116
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,858
Somebodyjumped the gun on that.
I saw him, but I...

117
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,110
<i>What do you mean you saw him?</i>

118
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:03,279
What the hell is going on out there?

119
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:10,119
I've got local SAR, a rolling ground cordon
and an eye in the sky. We're on top of it.

120
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:14,791
How does the FBI find a man

121
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:19,712
and then lose him
in the middle of the desert?

122
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,631
Cos I'd like to know.

123
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:25,760
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I heard the question.

124
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,887
<i>I put you in charge out there.</i>

125
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,515
Now do the damn job!

126
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:42,318
This amuse you? I amuse you?

127
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,155
No. ltjust made sense to me.

128
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,908
How you found your way here,
who led you to Gibson.

129
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:53,830
- You think I was spying on you?
- No, but I think our new deputy director was.

130
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:57,542
You're being made a pawn
in a rigged game.

131
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,260
You painted me the picture.
Now put it in a frame.

132
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:08,845
All right.

133
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:13,349
You got a good rep, Agent Doggett.
You don't compromise, you don't quit.

134
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,351
You're a damned good FBI agent.

135
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,688
Lot of guys put you
in the director's chair one day.

136
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:22,275
Which is why you've been set up to fail.

137
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:26,529
No amount of rolling cordons
or eyes in the sky will turn up Mulder.

138
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,531
It's just the wrong approach.

139
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:32,243
It's not a question of approach.
It's the only approach I got.

140
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,455
The only way you're gonna find Mulder
is to give in to the truth.

141
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,791
To listen to Scully.

142
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,796
But even then, say you do find him,

143
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,340
even then you lose.

144
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:55,391
You put anything about aliens or UFOs
or alien bounty hunters in your report,

145
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,643
Kersh will ruin you.

146
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,355
I'm betting that was his plan.

147
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:10,656
Is Agent Scully here?

148
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,825
Where's Agent Scully?

149
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:18,539
I need someone who's with Agent Scully
to put her on a radio.

150
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,834
Someone with Agent Scully.

151
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,299
<i>Anyone got</i> a <i>20 on Agent Scully?</i>

152
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,011
<i>Is anyone out there with her?</i>

153
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:40,519
- I'm with Agent Scully.
- Then who's this?

154
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,567
<i>Go for Agent Scully.</i>

155
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:52,615
What?

156
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,742
Give me the radio.

157
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,871
- You're with Scully?
- Across the room from her.

158
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:02,792
From who? From me?

159
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,794
Where?

160
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,463
- What room? Where are you?
- Bunkhouse.

161
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,632
We're in the dorm.

162
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:14,345
Tell him to hold her.
Tell him not to let her out of his sight!

163
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,806
Hold Scully. We're coming to you.

164
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:19,892
Agent Scully!

165
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,061
<i>(choking)</i>

166
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,741
Hey!

There she is!

168
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,384
Do you see her?

169
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,774
- Where did she go? Did you see her?
- No.

170
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,944
She ran right back here!

171
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:15,614
I saw her!

172
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,950
You saw her!

173

174
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,967
Agent, can you breathe?

175
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,143
He thinks it was me.

176
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:50,900
He thinks that I did this to him.
How is that possible?

177
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,740
It's someone in this room.

178
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:08,227
Mulder!

179
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,697
<i>(Siren)</i>

180
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,790
Agent Scully?

181
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,586
Where are you going?

182
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,049
Agent Scully!

183
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:28,140
Get out of the car.

184
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:35,439
Agent Scully!

185
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,734
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

186
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,238
- Drop it and turn around!
- No.

187
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:47,409
Just do it! I know how it works.
Kill shot to the back of the neck.

188
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:50,162
You're pointing your weapon at a friend.

189
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:53,791
Turn around, or I'll assume that
you're not who you say you are.

190
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,627
Scully, it's me! Skinner!

191
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,780
I can prove it.

192
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:29,535
I know your secret. Who else knows it?

193
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:35,708
OK. Then tell me.

194
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:42,089
You tell me. How do I know it's you?

195
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,306
I don't like pointing guns
at pregnant women

196
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:54,268
any more than I like them
pointing guns at me.

197
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,326
This has gone too far, Scully.

198
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:13,871
No. That's what's wrong here.

199
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:17,583
It hasn't gone far enough.

200
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,757
- I need those car keys.
- And what are you gonna do?

201
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,636
Look, we are being hampered here
by the FBI,

202
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:32,514
by John Doggett,
by doubt, by our own mistrust.

203
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:35,684
Whatever it is, it is working
as long as we let it.

204
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:38,937
You told me Mulder wouldn't allow it.

205
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:44,151
Wouldn't let me ruin my career over this.
Over him.

206
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:53,202
But what about you, Scully? I mean,
my God, you've got even more at stake.

207
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,381
I can't take the chance
that I'm never gonna see him again.

208
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:09,343
Mulder could just come walking
out of the dark. We don't know.

209
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:16,475
Look, we've got one last chance here
waiting for us out there in the desert.

210
00:25:18,394 --> 00:25:20,646
Gibson Praise.

211
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,984
It may just be who gets to him first.

212
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:34,785
Get in the car. I'll drive.

213
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,798
Gibson!

214
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:32,718
He's not down there.

215
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,556
I told him to stay here.
He was supposed to stay here.

216
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,726
Gibson!

217
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,564
I found him.

218
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,779
Gibson?

219
00:26:55,574 --> 00:27:00,829
What are you doing out here?
Why didn't you answer me, huh?

220
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,875
He's here.

221
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,673
I hear him.

222
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,682
What are you talking about?

223
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,937
Mulder.

224
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,564
He's somewhere out there.

225
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:35,572
He's got a really bad fever.
I think his leg might be infected.

226
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:39,451
We gotta get you to the hospital.
OK, buddy?

227
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,581
You're so close now.

228
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,836
OK.

229
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,505
Put your arm around my neck.
Watch your leg.

230
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,724
- Agent Scully.
- You take him to the hospital.

231
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,018
What about you?

232
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:25,956
I got a boy here who needs
emergency medical attention!

233
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,653
What?

234
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,864
Are you OK? What's wrong?

235
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:10,042
It's OK, Gibson. Lie down. Lie down.

236
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,694
Mulder!

237
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,762
Mulder!

238
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,013
Oh, my God.

239
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,637
<i>(helicopter engine)</i>

240
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:59,377
For someone who claims he's not
following me, you sure have a knack.

241
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:04,382
- You're where the action is.
- Does that tell you I'm crazy or I'm right?

242
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:09,096
Wandering around in the desert
in the dead of night, you call it.

243
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,974
You say you want to find Mulder,
but you won't do what it takes.

244
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,520
- You're afraid I'm right.
- I'm not afraid of anything.

245
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,107
Except that Mulder's got even you
believing in this crap.

246
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:25,278
You've seen this "crap" for yourself now.
How do you explain what took place today?

247
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:30,075
Let me ask you something hypothetically.

248
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:35,455
If you were to find him out here,
or this ship, or this alien bounty hunter,

249
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:40,085
- what would you do then?
- I know what Agent Mulder would do.

250
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:44,673
- He'd do whatever it took.
- You mean lie. Like you've been lying to me.

251
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:49,469
And flout orders like you've done
every step of the way. Is that what it takes?

252
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:51,471
Give a little, get a little!

253
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:54,391
You knew where the kid was
and wouldn't tell me. Why?

254
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,018
What kid? I don't see any kid.

255
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:02,774
You're lying to me again! Assistant Director
Skinner took him from here to the hospital.

256
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,785
How do you know that?

257
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,039
There's one thing I know
for sure in this case,

258
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:22,419
and that's that Mulder is after this boy
Gibson Praise. Why? It beats me.

259
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:27,632
But when he goes after that kid,
my men will be waiting for him.

260
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:31,344
Your men followed
Assistant Director Skinner?

261
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,562
Where you going?
Agent Scully, where are you going?

262
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:42,522
Your men are at the hospital?

263
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,817
I got it controlled.
Nobody goes in or out of that building.

264
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:49,237
How do you know that they're your men?

265
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:30,070
Scully!

266
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,283
Scully!

267
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:43,792
- Where's the boy?
- Door at the end of the hall, with AD Skinner.

268
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,836
Are you certain?

269
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:52,133
My agents have a visual on the window. The
nurse has checked the boy every 20 minutes.

270
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:56,137
Personnel is going about their business.
We're just waiting for Mulder.

271
00:34:56,221 --> 00:35:00,141
Every minute that you wait,
that boy's in danger. He's exposed.

272
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:04,479
No one's getting past us, Agent Scully.
No one's gotten past us.

273
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,108
You believe that, Agent Doggett?

274
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:28,545
If something tries to rip your throat out,
I got you covered.

275
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,466
AD Skinner.

276
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:36,511
This is John Doggett!

277
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:46,271
What the hell is this?
What the hell's going on?

278
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,648
There's no one in that room.

279
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:57,490
I'm looking for a patient, a boy, 12 years old.

280
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:00,952
He may still be in this building.

281
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:10,211
The window doesn't open.

282
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,381
How's a man and a boy get out of here,
except by that door?

It's OK. I've got him. Gibson.

286
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:40,408
How did you get here?

287
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:45,330
- How did you get him out of that room?
- We went up through the ceiling.

288
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:50,251
I don't know who to trust.

289
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,879
Where is he?

290
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,215
He's right here.

291
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:01,304
They're gonna find him.

An agent needs help!

I said an agent needs help!

297
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:25,490
The best I can say is
it's lucky it all happened in a hospital.

298
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:28,076
Very lucky, yes, sir.

299
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:34,916
I assume the hazardous materials
which caused this must have been medical.

300
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,085
That has not yet been determined.

301
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:42,966
So much here is undetermined.
As remain the whereabouts of Mulder.

302
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,762
But some of your "facts"...

303
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:53,059
like "a man falls from a cliff
and disappears",

304
00:39:53,142 --> 00:40:00,525
"an agent has his throat crushed
by an assailant who vanishes into thin air."

305
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:03,194
This reads like potboiled science fiction.

306
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:06,531
You mean it reads like an X-File.

307
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:13,204
But that's what you intended, wasn't it,
when you assigned me to the case?

308
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:18,418
I'll ask the questions, John.
You just give me some damn answers.

309
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:26,175
Don't come back until you do.

310
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,782
My dad always said
it's not who wins or loses,

311
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:53,077
it's who takes the worst beating that counts.

312
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:57,165
- Is that supposed to cheer me up?
- I thought so.

313
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:01,127
But then I never did get to see your opponent.

314
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,087
And you never will.

315
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:08,051
You still don't believe me.

316
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:12,096
What I don't believe is
how long they're keeping you here.

317
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,976
It's just some things
they have to check out... make sure of.

318
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:21,898
I've got some things
I thought you'd want checked out.

319
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,901
AD Skinner is in stable condition,

320
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:29,030
resting comfortably and
awaiting diagnosis and further study.

Gibson Praise is now a ward of the state,

323
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:39,624
but I asked for special protection,
as I assumed you would yourself.

324
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:45,129
- What are you doing here, Agent?
- Keeping you apprised of the case.

325
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:48,549
That's not your job.

326
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:51,010
It is, actually.

327
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,137
And officially.

328
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:59,894
I'm... assigned now to the X-Files.

00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:21,082
Whatever you and I may differ on,
I'll find him, Agent Scully.
