1
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:23,525
Pick up! Pick up the phone!

2
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,697
Look, I don't know what that bitch told you,
but I'm solid. She's lying to you.

3
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,701
Check her right-hand desk drawer.
It's all there - the whole story.

4
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,369
Pick up, man!

5
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:38,832
Call him off and let's talk about this,
all right? Give me a chance to explain.

6
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:16,119
- Help me! Somebody wants to kill me!
- Who wants to kill you?

7
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:17,829
- He's out there!
- Hold up!

8
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,582
Hold on. Don't do that, guy!
You calm down...

9
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,125
- We've got to stop him!
- Who?

10
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:26,255
He's out there!
We have to get him before he gets me!

11
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:31,260
- Hey, hey! Hey! Get off!
- Take him down, take him down!

12
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,680
No! Let me up!

13
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:36,765
He's gonna kill me!

14
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:42,437
Take it easy. Relax now. Settle down.

15
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,277
No.

16
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:52,489
This isn't enough! I'm not safe in here!

17
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:56,243
Hey, buddy, you've never been safer
in your life, OK? Just relax.

18
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:59,079
He can get me in here!

19
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:02,457
- I'll go call Social Services.
- Right.

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,294
It's not enough!

21
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:08,338
He can get to me! He...

22
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:11,401
They've identified it
as nine-millimetre pistol ammunition.

23
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:16,323
Teflon coated, armour piercing.
It's a single round.

24
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,700
He was shot. No doubt about that.

25
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:23,330
So I assume
the million-dollar question is how?

26
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:26,708
Yeah. What do we know about the victim?

27
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:33,465
Carlton Chase, age 39. Well-to-do realtor,
single, lived in the area all his life.

28
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:36,760
Nothing but parking tickets on his record.

29
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:40,138
Came tearing in last night
saying someone was gonna kill him.

30
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:44,226
- He was right.
- Except I don't see bullet holes in the walls.

31
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:49,064
The round looks to have entered
through the top of his head.

32
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:52,359
Agents.

33
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:55,737
Thanks for coming down so quick.

34
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:59,866
- Al Triguero.
- John Doggett. Agent Scully.

35
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,162
I'd appreciate any help you can give us.
We got this much figured out so far.

36
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:08,083
- Bullet came through the air vent.
- Yeah, that's how it's looking.

37
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,087
There's a burr on this louvre here
where the bullet passed through.

38
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,923
You can barely see it, but it's there.

39
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:20,262
So I'm thinking
this is where the killer hid.

40
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:22,889
He somehow got into this ventilation system,

41
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:26,518
and from here he had
a clear line of sight to shoot Chase below.

42
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,104
Did anyone hear a gunshot?

43
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:33,358
Seems likely you'd hear one. Even with
a silencer, it'd echo through the ductwork.

44
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,945
What's directly above this?

45
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:53,962
I don't understand. How could
someone make that shot from here?

46
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:57,132
They didn't make it from here.

47
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:01,178
- Can I use your pencil?
- Sure.

48
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:27,454
Captain, we're gonna need
your crime scene investigators up here.

49
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,539
You got it.

50
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:32,334
- So, lucky shot?
- Very.

51
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:38,465
But this victim stated that he was gonna
be killed just moments before he was shot,

52
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,843
which doesn't sound lucky at all.

53
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,388
I guess I can't argue with that.

54
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:57,359
- What you got there?
- The old Godfather trick.

55
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:01,655
Wrap a towel around a pistol
to muffle the sound.

56
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,033
The killer was up here all right.

57
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:07,619
So how in the hell did he make that shot?

58
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:13,708
There's thermal-imaging technology
which can pick up body heat through walls.

59
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:18,213
- Maybe that's what allowed him to aim.
- We field-tested that in the Marines.

60
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:22,384
It weighs close to 90 pounds,
has to be cooled with liquid nitrogen.

61
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:26,680
I can't quite see somebody
lugging it up that ladder we just climbed.

62
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:32,394
Either way, the rooftop of a police station?
That's a pretty ballsy place for a hit.

63
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:22,277
<i>(Dew)</i>

64
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,905
<i>(Chase) Pick up! Pick up the phone!</i>

65
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:31,536
<i>Look, I don't know what that bitch told you,

66
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:36,458
<i>Check her right-hand desk drawer.
It's all there</i> - <i>the whole story. Pick</i> up...

67
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,688
What are you doing?

68
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:04,319
My... printer cable is loose.

69
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:07,072
And that's more important than coffee?

70
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,494
- Any messages?
- No.

71
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:17,082
The light's blinking.
Looks like a message to me.

72
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,715
Are you gonna play it or what?

73
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:31,262
Stupid ain't cute, Tammi.
I don't care what your mama says.

74
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:34,974
<i>(Dew)</i>

75
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:39,104
<i>(man) Yeah... I got, like, rats again.</i>

76
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:44,234
<i>I need you to get them all this time.
1806 Brook Valley Turnpike.</i>

77
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:48,071
<i>Last name Allesandry.
You've been here before.</i>

78
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,033
- Dwight?
- Yeah, I got it.

79
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:57,122
No. Did you hear the news
this morning? Carlton Chase?

80
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,091
I just thought it was pretty scary news.

81
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:13,138
Try and get Randall on the phone.

82
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:37,078
<i>(footsteps)</i>

83
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,330
Randall?

84
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,127
Your brother wants to see you.

85
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,124
Randall?

86
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:27,045
You avoiding me?

87
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:33,134
Tammi told you
I wanted to talk to you, right?

88
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:37,680
You wanna tell me
what happened last night?

89
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:50,109
Randall, I'm not mad at you necessarily,
but I need to know exactly what happened.

90
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:56,658
Anytime you do something without telling
me first, you could get us both into trouble.

91
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:59,244
I saw him stealing.

92
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:02,539
- Carlton stealing from me?
- Yeah.

93
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,125
He was skimming.

94
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:10,588
So, where's the money
that he was skimming?

95
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:19,681
You see, the thing of it is, Randall,
you get the money, then you do your thing.

96
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,724
It's a simple equation.

97
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:25,812
That's what I'm talking about
when I say you need to talk to me first!

98
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,481
We'll probably be OK.

99
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:32,402
But in the future...
let's keep the communication lines open.

100
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:35,446
One hand talks to the other, right?

101
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:43,913
Here, I brought you a sandwich.
Meat loaf the way you like it.

102
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:50,169
Go ahead, take it.
It's got mayonnaise and ketchup.

103
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,589
We going out tonight?

104
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,479
Police station's less than a mile from here.

105
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:12,233
Chase ran it on foot.
He says that somebody was after him.

106
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:15,403
This is probably where it all started.

107
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:28,041
- Huh.
- What's that?

108
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,879
Chase did business with an exterminating
company called AAA-1 Surekill.

109
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,761
Six jobs in one month.

110
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:43,514
I know that's a requirement
of selling a house.

111
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,448
Agent.

112
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,539
It's a .45.

113
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:14,504
The bullet that killed Chase
at the police station was a nine millimetre.

114
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:28,226
You know, Elvis used to do this
to his hotel rooms.

115
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,229
I think Carlton Chase did this.

116
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,607
So who was he shooting at?

117
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:37,819
If it was someone in this room,
he sure would've hit 'em.

118
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:40,571
Unless it was someone outside.

119
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,837
- You got the cash?
- What's this look like?

120
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,507
- Who the...
- Evening.

121
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,971
- What? You lost?
- Nope. I think this must be the place.

122
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:08,975
- What, you a cop?
- Oh, hell, no.

123
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,602
No, your secret's safe with me, fellas.

124
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:16,649
But I will be taking that money
off your hands and the dope.

125
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:21,863
Oh, you're funny.
Nah, you know what? Chris Rock is funny.

126
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:24,657
And you? You're just dead.

127
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:27,368
Cap his ass.

128
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:29,704
Bang.

129
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,789
Bang.

130
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,583
Bang.

131
00:14:55,146 --> 00:15:00,193
<i>(Doggett)</i> Yeah, I got it.
Nine millimetre. Sulphuric.

132
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:02,320
No, I got it.

133
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:21,547
All right. Thanks.

134
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:26,344
So which kind of shooting was this:
lucky, coincidental or some third alternative?

135
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:29,347
It's precision marksmanship, that's for sure.

136
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,851
These holes line up perfectly
with the three victims behind there,

137
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:39,482
which tells me that the shooter
was standing right here behind this wall.

138
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:43,444
And consequently wouldn't be able
to see what the hell he's aiming at.

139
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:46,906
Unless he <i>could</i> see.

140
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:52,787
The light our eyes can register is only
one portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

141
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,874
Other wavelengths, from infrared
to gamma, have other properties.

142
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,503
X-rays, for instance,
can pass through solid objects.

143
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,755
Walls, for example.

144
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,759
So, you're saying this guy
used some kind of x-ray machine.

145
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:11,848
You're not saying this guy has x-ray vision?

146
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:15,643
I'm remarking that these wavelengths exist.

147
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:19,605
And the only thing that is stopping us
from seeing them, if you will,

148
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,276
is the biochemical structure of our eyes.

149
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:27,697
I'm conjecturing that
if this structure were somehow different,

150
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,033
we'd have the ability
to see things that we don't.

151
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,330
Call in Clark Kent.

152
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:39,542
OK, so you explain it.

153
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,962
- I can't, so I'm sticking with what I do know.
- Which is?

154
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,339
That this was a drug rip-off.

155
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:49,677
Furthermore, it's the fifth drug rip-off
in this area in the past two months.

156
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,430
Somebody's making a living
capping drug dealers.

157
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:56,642
And how does a dead
real-estate agent figure into that?

158
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,437
Well, that I don't know... yet.

159
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,523
But I did find out one more thing.

160
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,443
Sulphuryl fluoride.

161
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,589
You got a moment to see me in my office?

162
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:31,093
Dwight, I need to get this to the bank.

163
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:33,346
It can wait.

164
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:05,127
Can't you tell your brother
to get some lunch or something at least?

165
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:09,131
He's practically right outside the door.

166
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:12,677
I'll keep the noise level down, if you will.

167
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:24,230
- I just feel like he's always watching me.
- How's he watching you now?

168
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,340
Hello?

169
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:58,639
- Anybody here?
- Yeah.

170
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,729
Agents Doggett and Scully, FBI.

171
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,274
Dwight Cooper.

172
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:14,655
- What can I do for you?
- Mr Cooper, do you recognise these?

173
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:18,576
I don't recognise much of anything
except shapes. Tammi!

174
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:21,370
Tammi, come look at this for me.

175
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,668
I got bad peepers. Legally blind since birth.

176
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,298
This look familiar?

177
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,223
They're ours. They're last
month's billings for Mr Chase.

178
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,684
Oh. Carlton.

179
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,896
One of my best clients.

180
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:52,151
I sent him a ham every Christmas
till he finally told me he was a Jew.

181
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,323
He was a nice guy.

182
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,784
We found some evidence at a crime scene.

183
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:07,249
A piece of fabric on which we found
traces of a chemical. Sulphuryl fluoride.

184
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:11,629
It's an insecticide used only
by licensed exterminators.

185
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:17,259
Yeah, it's good stuff. We use it, along
with about 200 other outfits in central Mass.

186
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:21,263
You've done time, haven't you?

187
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:25,810
Yeah, a long time ago.

188
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:34,985
Now my brother and I are actually members
of the Worcester Chamber of Commerce.

189
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:40,491
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

190
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:46,038
Why did Carlton Chase call this office
14 minutes before he was murdered?

191
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:58,134
8.34pm. We found a call to your office

192
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:01,470
billed on Mr Chase's calling card.

193
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:05,433
It was made from a payphone
not far from where he was murdered.

194
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,184
Wow.

195
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,980
I don't know what to tell you.

196
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:16,235
We were all gone home by that time, and
there wasn't any message on our machine.

197
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:24,243
All right. We'll be in touch
if we have any further questions.

198
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,884
Tammi.

199
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,726
What do you know about that?

200
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:52,938
About Carlton calling here?

201
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,733
He...

202
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:58,611
I guess he must have left a message.

203
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:01,614
What did it say?

204
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,909
I didn't hear it.

205
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:11,415
I was reaching for the play button,
and I hit the erase button by mistake.

206
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:17,129
I should have told you. I was just afraid
that I lost us some business maybe.

207
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:24,845
Come here, baby.

208
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,479
You know I can't see worth a damn.
I just want to have a look at your eyes.

209
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,359
The eyes are the windows of the soul.

210
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:41,862
They tell you everything you need
to know about a person.

211
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,742
So tell me.

212
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,664
Are you filing?

213
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,585
No, Dwight.

214
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:13,018
That's all I needed to know.

215
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:27,366
- Dwight Cooper, arrested in 1986.
- For grand theft auto.

216
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,247
Right. How does
a legally blind guy steal a car?

217
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,168
I assume that he had a partner
who did the driving.

218
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:43,299
That brother he mentioned - Randall Cooper.

219
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:51,682
They were arrested together. Although
Randall apparently didn't serve much time.

220
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,435
They share the same birthday.

221
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,648
- They're twins.
- I hate twins.

222
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:02,484
Twins never rat each other out.

223
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:06,363
Maybe there's someone
in that office who will.

224
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:53,846
Hey, Tammi. You're here early.

225
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:04,148
You know you accidentally
left your car running?

226
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:09,278
You must have been in a real hurry
to get in here and make the coffee.

227
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,657
What you got there?

228
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,077
Can I see?

229
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,663
<i>(Doggett) Dwight Cooper, FBI.</i>

230
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,505
Dwight Cooper, warrant to search.

231
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,052
Have someone read it to you.

232
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,682
What the hell are you looking for?

233
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:42,644
Evidence related to the murder
of Carlton Chase, et al.

234
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,441
What's in the box?

235
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,196
You got me.

236
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,660
What's the combination?

237
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,999
I don't remember.

238
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,877
So much for the easy way.

239
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,724
You owe me for that.

240
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:24,019
I run a clean business.
Nothing here will say otherwise.

241
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,438
I wouldn't be so sure.

242
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,317
Can you explain these, Mr Cooper?

243
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,407
Mr Cooper, you want to tell me
about these invoices?

244
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,130
OK, Randall.

245
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:56,635
Let's talk about your
exterminating company.

246
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:02,933
It's just the three of you, right?
You and your brother and Tammi Peyton?

247
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,856
So how is it that your little company

248
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:13,902
billed over $700,000
to Chase Realty last year?

249
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,281
$700,000.

250
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,785
That's a lot of dead rats.

251
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:27,332
I think that you and your brother
and Carlton Chase

252
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,669
were in a whole other business together.

253
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,637
Man, I gotta get into the bug business.

254
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:47,769
I had no idea you could make so much dough
killing things that creep around behind walls.

255
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,773
You are quite the entrepreneur.

256
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:57,821
I'm just a regular Joe,
providing a public service.

257
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,999
Randall?

258
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,256
I'm just a regular Joe.
Provide a public service.

259
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,646
Is that what your brother
just said to Agent Doggett?

260
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,990
You know why I said that, don't you?

261
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:47,871
Because somehow...
you can see through that wall.

262
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:55,754
You can see your brother behind me
and you can read his lips.

263
00:29:55,837 --> 00:30:00,258
I don't know what gives you the ability,
but I know how you use it.

264
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:05,013
You shoot drug dealers
from places where they can't see you,

265
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:08,392
and then you and Dwight rob them.

266
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,604
That's how you make all that money, isn't it?

267
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,734
No. We're exterminators.

268
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,113
Yeah.

269
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:25,075
You certainly are.

270
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:34,584
And talking to you now,
I think that the whole thing is Dwight's idea.

271
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:43,093
It's time to be your own man, Randall.

272
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,264
It's time to think for yourself.

273
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,039
You tell them anything?

274
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:15,042
No, I said what you said.

275
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,627
We got a problem.

276
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,590
It needs to be taken care of.

277
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,346
I just keep the books.

278
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:32,100
You keep the books on a lot of blood money
going through that office.

279
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:36,063
We're supposed to believe you didn't know?
The drug rip-offs, the murders?

280
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:41,068
I didn't know about any of that.
Dwight doesn't tell me anything.

281
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,071
I just book the cash receipts.

282
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,117
I don't ask where they're from.

283
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,913
I know not to ask.

284
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:59,169
Look, here's where I get confused,
and I'm hoping that you can help me out.

285
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:02,714
Carlton Chase.

286
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,180
We think Chase was Dwight's fence.
He sold the drugs your boss stole.

287
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:12,891
Together, they had a good thing going.

288
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,852
So why was Chase killed?
It seems like bad business.

289
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:18,146
Unless the reason wasn't business.

290
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,025
Unless it was personal.

291
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:29,407
Am I under arrest?

292
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,835
Tammi Peyton's phone records.
Found something interesting.

293
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,088
Calls to Carlton Chase.

294
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,966
All of 'em late night.

295
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:31,428
What do you want to bet
they weren't discussing escrow accounts?

296
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:47,569
So Dwight Cooper learns something's going
on between his girlfriend and Carlton Chase.

297
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:53,116
And he kills him. Or he orders him killed,
assuming Randall's the triggerman.

298
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,746
- (Scully) Maybe not.
- (Doggett) What do you mean?

299
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:02,667
(Scully) Maybe Dwight's
not the one who's jealous.

300
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,011
I know it was you.

301
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,642
I still need help, Randall.

302
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:47,462
I made a reservation for
the three-o'clock bus. You go wait for me.

303
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:51,341
It's right over there - the Big Sky Express.

304
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:55,053
I'll be back right after I get the money.

305
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,141
I know you took that book
to protect me from Dwight.

306
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,440
I need my book, Randall.

307
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:09,526
I can't get my money without it.

308
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:35,385
I'll be back in half an hour, OK?
I'll meet you by the bus.

309
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:44,060
Randall. You know I'm coming back.

310
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:51,568
You saved me from Carlton. I owe you.

311
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,699
Randall.

312
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,749
I'll meet you by the bus.

313
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:43,453
Clothes are gone.
Tammi left in a hurry.

314
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:49,292
- Maybe she thought someone was after her.
- If someone's after you, you don't pack.

315
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:54,005
- You think she planned to go?
- I do. The question is where?

316
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,556
- Who you calling?
- Whoever Tammi called last.

317
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,685
<i>(male voice) Welcome to Concordia
Bus Lines. Our menu options have changed.</i>

318
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:10,188
<i>For reservations, press one.</i>

319
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:30,625
- Tammi.
- <i>(gasps)</i> Dwight!

320
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:35,004
Is this what you had
in your little secret box? Hm?

321
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:39,384
A safety-deposit key. Looks like you
had a lot of my money in there.

322
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:42,595
- Dwight.
- Shut up and drive.

323
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,681
Drive!

324
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:26,389
So this is how you did it, hmm?
You kept two sets of books.

325
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:30,477
Huh. You've been
ripping me off for months.

326
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,148
There's $100,000 difference here. Explains
why you were in a hurry the other morning.

327
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:38,151
- Dwight.
- Shut up!

328
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,904
Randall should've killed you, not Chase.

329
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:44,491
Or maybe you and Carlton
were working together?

330
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:46,493
It wasn't like that.

331
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:53,333
When Carlton found out about the money,
he blackmailed me. He made me... do things.

332
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:56,294
Aw, I bet you put up a big fight.

333
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:04,886
No, wait a minute. If Carlton wasn't stealing
from me, then why did Randall kill him?

334
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:09,974
Dwight, you don't understand.

335
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,810
No, no, no. I do understand.

336
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:15,522
My brother was sweet on you.

337
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:19,776
He killed Carlton because he knew
what was going on between the two of you.

338
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:26,199
Where the hell you been? Hm?

339
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,618
I got something for you to do.

340
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:33,706
<i>(Dwight) Randall, get over here!</i>

341
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,385
Dwight, no.

342
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:48,054
Take it!

343
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:56,145
She ripped us off, Randall, and you knew it.

344
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,064
No, Randall.

345
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:03,319
Did you think the two of you were gonna
run off into the sunset together?

346
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,029
She used you.

347
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,953
Look at me, Randall.

348
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:20,837
I'm the one who loves you. Not her.

349
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:26,175
Not anybody else.

350
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,845
Cos we're blood.

351
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,517
That's thicker than anything.

352
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,613
I'm gonna walk away now.

353
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:52,577
And I'm gonna think hard
about how I can forgive you.

354
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:02,879
You know what you gotta do.

355
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,062
Randall?

356
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,900
You're not gonna do this.

357
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,874
Randall, please.

358
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:46,172
I was coming back for you.

359
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,263
No, you weren't.

360
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:02,063
Randall!

361
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:05,441
No!

362
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:30,425
Agent. Has he said anything?

363
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:34,887
A county DA came in
and he declined representation.

364
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,641
Aside from that,
he's been uncommunicative.

365
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:47,817
APB on Tammi Peyton's a wash so far.
The Bureau in Montana's on alert.

366
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:59,328
He watched her every day,
wherever she was.

367
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:04,333
A man who can look at anything
in the world, and he chooses her.

368
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:11,507
He must have seen something in her
she couldn't see in herself.

369
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:15,845
If you're suggesting
he could see into her heart, Agent...

370
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:20,683
I think we're out of FBI territory on this one.

371
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:24,854
I'll be out front.

372
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,035
