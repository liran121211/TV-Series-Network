1
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,947
(faint heartbeat)

2
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,984
What is this?

3
00:03:55,612 --> 00:04:00,909
Excuse me. Can somebody please tell me
what's going on here?

4
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:04,579
- We're collecting material.
- For?

5
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:07,958
For anything that might be
pertinent to the manhunt.

6
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,670
What manhunt? Manhunt for who?

7
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,714
You're kidding, right?

8
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,761
There's nothing. If you're looking for Mulder,
you're wasting your time.

9
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:22,431
- Are you listening?
- I'm not the man to talk to.

10
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:25,016
Whose stupid idea is this?

11
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,148
Somebody might have had
the courtesy to tell me.

12
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:35,110
There are agents in Mulder's office
who say they're part of an FBI manhunt.

13
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:40,323
I know. Believe me, this is not my idea.
I just found out about it myself.

14
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:43,493
They won't find Mulder this way.
We both know that.

15
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:47,205
I told you last night I will find him.
I'm gonna do that.

16
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,419
OK? I want you to cool out. I don't want you
doing anything to upset your pregnancy.

17
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:58,467
I don't understand. You are the assistant
director. Who's going over your head on this?

18
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:02,471
Our brand-new deputy director.

19
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,014
(phone rings)

20
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,739
AD Skinner, Agent Scully.
Thanks for getting right over.

21
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:24,784
I don't wanna lose any time.
One of our own is missing.

22
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,206
The only acceptable outcome
is that we find him, safe and alive.

23
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,543
- I'm sure the two of you agree.
- That goes without saying, sir.

24
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,587
Good.

25
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:41,092
This comes at a stressful time...
with my new appointment.

26
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:44,054
Thank you for your cooperation
in the hunt for Mulder.

27
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:47,182
Our cooperation?

28
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:52,646
With due respect, there aren't two people
better qualified to be directing this action.

29
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,526
You and AD Skinner are the two primary
witnesses to Mulder's disappearance.

30
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,237
I want your statement taken ASAP.

31
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,781
You make us out to be suspects, sir.

32
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:08,245
- Taken by who?
- My task force leader on this.

33
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:12,999
Special Agent John Doggett.
He's waiting to hear from you now.

34
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,675
One more thing.

35
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:33,019
Anything leaves this building
about aliens, or alien abductions,

36
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:36,731
or any nonsense that might cast
the Bureau in a ridiculous light,

37
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:39,818
and you can forget about
looking for Agent Mulder.

38
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:43,154
You'll both be looking for new jobs.

39
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,997
That's all.

40
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,003
I don't believe this.

41
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:01,381
This isn't about Mulder.
Kersh is covering the FBl's ass.

42
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:05,510
Why do I get the feeling they'd be happy
if we never found him at all?

43
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:14,728
Look... I saw what I saw. I have to make
a statement. I can't say it didn't happen.

44
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:19,858
You heard Kersh. They don't want the truth.
You give them it and they'll hang you with it.

45
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,068
They can hang me with a lie too.

46
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm not gonna sell Mulder out.

47
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,954
What good are you to Mulder

48
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,000
if you give them the power
to ruin your career?

49
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:44,841
We Will find him.

50
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,985
Assistant Director, you can come with me.

51
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,239
Agent Scully, please wait on the wall
until we call you.

52
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:47,070
Water?

53
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,614
It could be a wait.

54
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,534
Thank you.

55
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,999
Aren't you his partner? Mulder?

56
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,793
Yes.

57
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,922
I guess nobody's
beyond suspicion on this thing.

58
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,429
Why are they talking to you?

59
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:15,056
Me? I knew Mulder back a bit.

60
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,144
They're developing a working profile,
character background.

61
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,272
I'd say they have
all the character profile they need.

62
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:25,108
Certainly his reputation.

63
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:28,695
I doubt we agents ever truly
know each other, even our partners.

64
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,948
Not at the end of the day.

65
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:38,288
Their real lives, their friends, girlfriends,
deeply personal things, issues.

66
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:44,794
- I think I know Mulder as much as anybody.
- Yeah, probably so.

67
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:49,048
I always took the rumours with a grain of salt.

68
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:52,302
- What rumours were those?
- Well, you know.

69
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:03,521
That from the beginning he never felt a real
trust with you, that you were ambitious.

70
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:06,399
Where'd that come from?

71
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:10,987
There are women here at the Bureau
that he would confide in.

72
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,865
I don't know if you knew that or not.

73
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,910
No.

74
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:21,372
- When was this?
- I don't know, it's just talk.

75
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:32,091
So what do you think happened... to Mulder?

76
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,386
What's your theory?

77
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,890
What's my theory?

78
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:46,105
My theory is you don't know Mulder at all.

79
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,736
You never did.

80
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,992
John Doggett.

81
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,915
Kersh's task force leader.

82
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,420
You might have just introduced yourself.

83
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:12,257
I was gettin' around to it.

84
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,933
Nice to meet you, Agent Doggett.

85
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,387
(vom its)

86
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,201
(dialling phone)

87
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:12,043
Hi, this is Margaret Scully.
Please leave a message.

88
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:16,381
Mom, it's Dana. I'm sorry
I haven't called you in a while.

89
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,633
I've been busy with work

90
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:25,223
and with something... else that I should
probably tell you about in person.

91
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,688
I don't even know if you're in town
or if you're checking your messages.

92
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,898
But, um...

93
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:38,653
But I really need to see you and talk to you.

94
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:45,159
There's a lot of stuff that's going on with me
right now, and I just really need to talk.

95
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,996
(crackling)

96
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,206
Mom?

97
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:17,191
- John Doggett.
- Stay out of my business!

98
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:19,944
Who is this?

99
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:23,740
- You better have a court order.
- For what? Who is this?

100
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:28,369
How many phones are you tapping? How
many agents are you doing surveillance on?

101
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,872
- Is this Agent Scully?
- Thank you.

102
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,541
You just answered all my questions.

103
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:39,213
(creaking)

104
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:25,343
Stop there! Right there!

105
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,262
Come on through the window nice and easy.

106
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:31,349
OK, I'm coming. It's me.

107
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,935
Your landlord.

108
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,855
I started fixing the antenna on the roof and...

109
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,609
I'm sorry, Mr Coeben. There was a man.

110
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,279
There was someone in the building.
Did you see anyone?

111
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:49,659
Yeah, you know him. Works with you.
Tall guy, brown hair.

112
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:52,411
Who? You don't mean Mulder?

113
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,622
Yeah, Mulder.

114
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,172
Mulder?

115
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,509
Are you in here?

116
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,358
(gasps)

117
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,021
(yells)

118
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:08,566
- (Frohike) It took serious voodoo.
- (Langly) Major satellite hacking.

119
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:11,193
- (Byers) But we got your data.
- (Skinner) What is it?

120
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:15,281
You're seeing real-time images
right off the JPL TOPEX/Poseidon.

121
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,867
We're wired right into the dish.

122
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,661
We can't find raw data
with UFO activity on it.

123
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:25,958
But Langly hacked into the data storage here
and pulled up something just as tasty.

124
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:30,713
This is UFO activity in the Pacific Northwest
just prior to Mulder's abduction.

125
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,966
These markers correspond with
reported alien abductions.

126
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,761
- It's a shopping spree.
- So Mulder's abduction...

127
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:39,764
Was a UFO whistle stop
on the way to the next pick-up.

128
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:43,976
Where? Where's the UFO activity
after Mulder's abduction?

129
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,063
We can't tell.
Not from the data we're pulling down.

130
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:50,858
If we can figure out where that ship
was going, where it's gonna be,

131
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,736
we've got a chance to find Mulder.

132
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,200
(knocks)

133
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:02,244
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

134
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:11,587
- You fly, Agent Doggett?
- Flying's for birds and baseballs. USMC, sir.

135
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,216
In Vietnam we used to fly night sorties
10ft above the treetops.

136
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,552
Before night vision, before fly-by-wire.

137
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:22,431
600 miles an hour and all we had
was an idiot gauge and our wits.

138
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:28,187
Guys used to say they only knew their
altitude by the smell of the VC rice pots.

139
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,148
You've come a long way, sir.

140
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,818
Usin' all the same instincts.

141
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,988
What can I do for you, Agent?

142
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:41,242
This task force, the search for Mulder...

143
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,620
- I'm runnin' it, right?
- You're the man in charge.

144
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:49,208
No one else is involved? Someone acting
under orders from another office?

145
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,877
I think I'd know, Agent.

146
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,588
What prompts the question?

147
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:57,675
My idiot gauge. My wits.

148
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:08,769
You got a chance to shine here, John,
stand in the spotlight.

149
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,314
Show them all you're an ace.

150
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,037
(door opens)

151
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,470
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

152
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:48,392
- I came by to feed Mulder's fish.
- And then you got tired and took a nap.

153
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:55,232
You've got a way about you, Agent Doggett,
that might have worked with the NYPD,

154
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,236
but you're talking to a fellow FBI agent.
I'd appreciate some respect.

155
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,033
Respect like you showed me over the phone?
Give a little, get a little, Agent Scully.

156
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:08,579
Who ambushed me with the phoney chitchat
and then put a wiretap on my phone?

157
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:11,415
- That's BS.
- And now you're followin' me.

158
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:14,084
I just came by to feed the fish.

159
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,718
What do you want
to get on me, Agent Doggett?

160
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,262
What is it you hope to find?

161
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:32,436
- I'm just trying to find Mulder.
- You wouldn't know where to look.

162
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,314
It's in the desk, middle drawer.

163
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:46,700
- I know the answer, Agent Scully.
- I don't even know the question.

164
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,119
What happened to Mulder.

165
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:54,458
I know what you're gonna say, or not,
because you think I'm the big bad wolf.

166
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,918
Do you really believe it?

167
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:00,965
You think by talking in circles I'll just get
dizzy and blurt out this so-called answer?

168
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:05,469
- That he was abducted by aliens?
- You said it. I didn't.

169
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:11,642
I just find it hard to swallow that a scientist,
a serious person, could buy that.

170
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:16,397
Ever see an alien, Agent Scully?

171
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,151
You want me to go on record?

172
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,155
I will go on record to say this.

173
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,076
That I have seen things that I cannot explain.

174
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,997
I have observed phenomena
that I cannot deny.

175
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,874
And that, as a scientist
and a serious person,

176
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,422
it is a badge of honour not to dismiss these
things because someone thinks they're BS.

177
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,383
So you think he was abducted?

178
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:52,266
- I'm just trying to find him.
- Then what are you doing here?

179
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,854
Trying to figure these out.
I found them in his desk there.

180
00:23:57,605 --> 00:24:00,899
Car rental receipts on Agent Mulder's Visa.

181
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:04,361
Four consecutive weekends in May.
Same mileage each trip.

182
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,072
370 miles, 375 miles.

183
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:10,618
Where was he going?

184
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,413
I don't know.

185
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:19,543
Like I said, maybe you really
didn't know your partner.

186
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,712
(cellphone rings)

187
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,010
John Doggett.

188
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,306
Agent Mulder at the FBI.

189
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,577
Assistant Director, follow me.

190
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,247
What's going on? What is this?

191
00:24:57,373 --> 00:25:02,586
Mr Skinner, this way, please. You can
talk with Agent Scully after we're done.

192
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,134
Have a seat.

193
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,853
Someone came into this office after hours
and removed some material.

194
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:23,440
Files. We don't know exactly what just yet.

195
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,029
Who?

196
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:35,369
The office is secured by a pass-card lock and
whoever came in used Agent Mulder's card.

197
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:40,332
- You think Agent Mulder took the files?
- We're wondering about his state of mind.

198
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:44,420
In your statement you said,
prior to his disappearance,

199
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:47,381
Agent Mulder had felt threatened by the FBI.

200
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,388
No, that's not what I said. I said he felt the
X-Files were threatened by budget-cutting.

201
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:59,351
Is there anything you're not telling us
about Agent Mulder, or his attitude?

202
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:04,231
Do you think he'd ever
retaliate against the FBI?

203
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:12,156
- Agent Mulder was only after the truth.
- As are we, Assistant Director.

204
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:22,166
Agent Scully tells us she was home last night.
We see from your phone log you were here...

205
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,835
until at least after ten.

206
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:47,691
You think I came in here last night
using Agent Mulder's pass card?

207
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:51,904
You were the last person to see Mulder.
You and Agent Scully.

208
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:16,512
- Skinner is telling the truth.
- I believe him.

209
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,932
It still doesn't tell us
who used Mulder's card to get in.

210
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:24,603
- You think it was Mulder?
- I showed you those car rental receipts.

211
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:29,149
Now I find Agent Mulder's Visa was used
two days ago in Raleigh, North Carolina.

212
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,318
Two days ago?

213
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,737
By who? For what?

214
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:38,408
Flowers. Automatic debit to a mortuary there.

215
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,292
Mulder's mother is buried in Raleigh.

216
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:51,547
That's the reason
he was going every weekend.

217
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,717
It's one reason.

218
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:15,005
I don't know what to think.

219
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:22,179
I don't believe it, Dana.
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

220
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,599
All right. I got some light on this.

221
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:30,562
Maybe you can help me out here,
Agent Scully.

222
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,315
What is it?

223
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,152
Agent Mulder's medical records.
Recent stuff over the last year.

224
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:41,323
Did you know about a medical condition?
Either of you?

225
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,742
No.

226
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:48,455
A year ago, Agent Mulder
was hospitalised. Ring a bell?

227
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,917
- Something to do with his brain?
- His temporal lobe.

228
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,421
An undiagnosable condition, it says.
Irregular brain activity.

229
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,633
But he recovered. There was a full recovery.

230
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,219
Was there?

231
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,099
Mulder would have told us
if there was anything.

232
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,810
Would he?

233
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:13,563
He tell you about this?
About his headstone?

234
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,360
Mulder was dying.

235
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:20,612
What?

236
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:24,741
It's all right here.
For a year he was going to doctors.

237
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,285
There's a clear record of his decline.

238
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,332
How well did you really know him?

239
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:39,297
- How far would Mulder go?
- How far would he go for what?

240
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:44,011
The truth. His truth.
Whatever it was he was trying to prove.

241
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,097
How bad did he need to prove it?

242
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,517
- It was his whole life.
- What are you trying to say?

243
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,354
That Agent Mulder found himself
in a place none of us want to go.

244
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,607
Life threatened, work threatened,
and all for naught.

245
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:00,027
Nothing proven.

246
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,363
The effort in vain. No mark left.

247
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:10,871
Unless he rolled the dice,
took one big last chance to make it.

248
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:20,714
You think that Mulder was here,
that he broke in to steal those files.

249
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:25,385
Broke into your apartment, stole your
computer. Took his own computer.

250
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,804
Gathering it up.

251
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,973
To what?

252
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,933
To prove it?

253
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,895
Or cover it up. Create doubt.

254
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:42,069
I get Mulder, I get him.
I understand obsession, believe me.

255
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:47,240
But the question is, how far would he go?
So far as to stage his own disappearance?

256
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,499
I know what I saw.

257
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,586
I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this.

258
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,421
I watched it happen.

259
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,591
Agent Mulder?

260
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,701
Please don't report that.

261
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,168
I don't know what good it would do me.

262
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,839
It doesn't help me find Mulder.

263
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,391
That's not good enough.

264
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:08,488
These are records of microburst activity,
UFO activity since Mulder's abduction.

265
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,825
- I think this is a waste of time.
- Just look at them.

266
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:15,287
I see activity all over the southwestern states.

267
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,830
That's right.

268
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,416
Mulder disappeared in the Pacific Northwest.

269
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,419
And if Mulder is on that ship,
this is where he is now.

270
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:25,547
Here? In the Arizona desert?

271
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,054
This is what we have.

272
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,021
OK. Say this is true.

273
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:45,442
Then how do we even begin
to start finding him?

274
00:33:55,493 --> 00:34:00,624
Maybe with whoever it is
they're looking to abduct next.

275
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:04,920
- We're only trying to help.
- We're only trying to find Mulder.

276
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,130
That's it.

277
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,679
- It just came to me.
- What?

278
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:20,060
What you saw. Why they took Mulder. Why
they're in Arizona now. It all makes sense.

279
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,273
(Scully) Why do people refuse
to believe in aliens and UFOs,

280
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:30,153
after all these years of sightings
and eyewitness accounts?

281
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:32,572
Why?

282
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,658
Because there's no real proof.

283
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,826
Because maybe, if there are aliens,

284
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:41,790
they're simply going around and removing
all the evidence before it becomes proof.

285
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:47,087
This isn't Mulder going around
and collecting this stuff, it's them.

286
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,838
(Skinner) Then why Arizona?

287
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:54,094
Because they are looking to find that which is
not in my computer, or Mulder's computer,

288
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:57,264
or in the files that were removed from the FBI.

289
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:01,184
They are looking to find
the whereabouts of good hard proof,

290
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,938
that in this case exists in a person.

291
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,857
In a boy named Gibson Praise.

292
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,304
This photograph's a few years old,
but take a look.

293
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:41,266
The objective in this case has been reframed.

294
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,060
The subject's name is Gibson Andrew Praise.

295
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,146
A child prodigy.

296
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:51,276
A pint-size chess champion, who Mulder
and Scully first investigated in

297
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,404
after a failed attempt on the boy's life.

298
00:35:54,571 --> 00:36:00,118
His files were the ones we now believe
were stolen from this office.

299
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:03,580
In his investigation,
Agent Mulder came to believe

300
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:07,876
the boy was experiencing
abnormal brain activity.

301
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,378
Unexplained activity.

302
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:15,592
In his field notes here, he says
Gibson Praise could, and I quote:

303
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:18,094
"read people's thoughts".

304
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:26,061
Agent Mulder went so far in one report to
claim that the boy may have alien physiology.

305
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:31,566
Agent Mulder may be looking for the boy
who was last seen in Arizona.

306
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:37,113
So maybe to find Mulder
we first have to look for Gibson Praise.

307
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,868
Let's go, people. Let's move.

308
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:45,038
How do you want this handled?

309
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:51,544
I want you to put that on every TV station,
post office and fax machine in the Southwest.

310
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:54,214
I wanna make that face famous.

311
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:53,648
(yells)

312
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:01,739
Feel better?

313
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,535
I need some navigation.

314
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:12,459
To start looking for a 12-year-old kid
in the middle of the Arizona desert.

315
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,421
Well, there aren't a whole lot of choices.

316
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:20,675
I got a turn-off in five miles.
Do I take it or keep going straight?

317
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:26,347
Gibson Praise was last seen here, at a power
plant about 60 miles outside of Phoenix.

318
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:32,353
Though the satellite data shows activity here,
about a hundred miles to the north.

319
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,564
What's out there?

320
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:39,194
According to this map, a whole lot of nothin'.

321
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:05,845
This is Special Agent Crane
calling for Task Force Leader.

322
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:09,182
- John Doggett.
- Just confirmed a location on this kid.

323
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:12,727
He's at a school for the deaf
in a place called Flemingtown.

324
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,855
A dot on the map about 90 miles
from where I am now.

325
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,857
I talked to the school principal.

326
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:20,527
- Is the kid in school now?
- He lives there.

327
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:25,823
Have the principal put him someplace where
you can keep an eye on him until we arrive.

328
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:28,368
Gonna take me an hour or more get there.

329
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,579
I'm gonna see if I can cut some time off that.

330
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:13,288
There's a school 20 minutes from here.

331
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:24,090
Yes, sir. In his science class.

332
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:29,470
Is it important enough
to take him away from his studies?

333
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:32,098
