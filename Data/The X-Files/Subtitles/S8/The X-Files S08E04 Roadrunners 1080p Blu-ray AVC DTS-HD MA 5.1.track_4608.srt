1
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:30,032
(music through headphones)

2
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,971
Hey, now we're talking.

3
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,574
Hey, right here, man! Right here!

4
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:16,161
Stop, you son of a...

5
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:33,679
You got highway hypnosis or something.
You didn't see me yellin' and wavin'?

6
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:36,556
You better watch that.

7
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,983
(air brakes hiss)

8
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,861
Come on. What now?

9
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:44,041
Where's everybody goin'?

10
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,015
Is the toilet broken? What?

11
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:21,411
Can someone please tell me
what's goin' on here?

12
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,402
No.

13
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,779
No!

14
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,115
No!

15
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,724
(beep)

16
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,549
Damn.

17
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:47,557
(ringing tone)

18
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,769
- John Doggett.
- Hey. It's Scully. Good morning.

19
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:54,731
- Afternoon. I've been trying to reach you.
- Actually, I'm out of town.

20
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,567
I'm north of Sugarville, Utah, roughly.

21
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,986
Utah? What are you doing there?

22
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,365
The local coroner wants
a consultation on a murder victim.

23
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:06,201
A man who was found
beaten to death in the desert.

24
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:10,372
Apparently, his corpse shows
some anomalous characteristics.

25
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:13,959
- Anomalous? How?
- From what they're telling me,

26
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:19,589
he is a 22-year-old backpacker last seen by
his family six months ago in perfect health.

27
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:23,343
However, his body is now showing
advanced signs of osteoporosis,

28
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,513
arthritis and kyphosis of the vertebrae.

29
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:30,684
- He's got a spine of a 90-year-old woman.
- Sounds anomalous, all right.

30
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:36,481
- You didn't need me to tag along?
- It was just a simple consultation.

31
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:41,903
And he called me over the weekend,
and I figured I wasn't going to bother you.

32
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:46,783
- Well, if there's anything I can do from here.
- Actually, there might be, if you don't mind.

33
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:51,830
Somewhere in our files
there is an unsolved murder case.

34
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:56,835
Unfortunately, I don't remember any of the
particulars, like where or when it took place,

35
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:02,090
but I do remember that there were some
glycoproteins found at the crime scene.

36
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:05,343
- Glycoproteins.
- Yeah. Mucus.

37
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:08,054
But it was unable to be identified,

38
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:13,935
and, as you recently read through all of our
files, I thought it might ring a bell with you.

39
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,563
I don't have a great memory for mucus...

40
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,482
but I'll be happy to look.

41
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:22,277
Remember anything else?

42
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,447
Agent Scully?

43
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,826
- Agent Scully?
- I'm sorry?

44
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:34,372
- Do you remember anything else?
- No, no. Just... just mucus.

45
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:39,127
When you find that file, will you fax it over
to the Juab County Sheriff's office?

46
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,631
That's the best place to reach me.
My cellphone isn't working.

47
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:45,717
- All right. You got it.
- Thank you.

48
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,715
Hello?

49
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,760
(honks horn)

50
00:08:56,663 --> 00:09:00,625
- How're you doin'?
- Good. Thanks.

51
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:06,005
I, uh... I was wondering...
A bus came through here a little while ago.

52
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,592
Do you happen to know
where it might have gone?

53
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,803
I was around back.

54
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,601
- Do you know what's up that road?
- Eventually Salt Lake, if you're not in a hurry.

55
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:21,187
Can I ask what happened to your hand?

56
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:25,024
I was... changing the blade on my bowsaw.

57
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,444
It's kind of gross.

58
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:29,696
Yeah.

59
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:35,410
There was a murder out here last week,
about 15, 20 miles off the state road.

60
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,537
Did you hear about it?

61
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:39,664
Yes, I did.

62
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:41,833
- It's scary.
- Yeah.

63
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:46,880
You should wash this out,
put iodine on it so it won't get infected.

64
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:51,009
- You sound like my mother.
- I also sound like a doctor.

65
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:54,012
- A medical doctor?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:57,557
Can you sell me some gas?

67
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:00,560
I'd love to, but I'm all out.

68
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:05,607
The tanker was supposed to be here
yesterday but... I'm hoping for this afternoon.

69
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,820
- How low are you?
- I got a quarter tank, I think. I'll make it.

70
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:14,532
- I'd feel awful bad if you didn't. Hang on.
- Thanks.

71
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:34,969
- Should be enough in here to tide you over.
- That's great. Thank you.

72
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:36,971
Do me a favour.

73
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:42,060
Don't go tellin' people that
I'm givin' away free gas back here.

74
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:47,065
Where is "here", exactly? Because
I can't seem to find this town on the map.

75
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,108
We're not really a town.

76
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:54,197
Just a few like-minded people
tryin' to keep the modern world at bay.

77
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:02,789
- You're good to go.
- Thank you very much.

78
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,609
Help is coming.

79
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,332
(engine splutters)

80
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,842
OK.

81
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,900
Hey! Excuse me.

82
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,570
You put something in my tank
that killed my engine.

83
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:17,780
What?

84
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:22,911
Where's that gas can?
I'd like to see it, please.

85
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:36,799
That's water. I barely even smell any gasoline.

86
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:39,135
Oh, God. You're right.

87
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:44,182
I'm sorry. I... I left it out.
It must have gotten rain in it.

88
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:47,852
It rains a lot here, does it?
As it's basically the desert.

89
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:51,064
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

90
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:53,775
I'm going to use your phone.

91
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,944
I don't have one.

92
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:00,531
You don't have a phone.

93
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:07,246
So how did you call up the tanker
that was supposed to come here yesterday?

94
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:13,211
There's a phone up the street.
Mr Milsap's place. He'll help you out.

95
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,191
Hello?

96
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,907
Hello?

97
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,204
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,748
- Mr Milsap?
- Can I help you?

99
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:56,546
Yes. I hope so. My car's stalled up the street.
I was wondering if I could use your phone.

100
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,133
Sure. It's in here.

101
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:12,770
- The line's dead.
- Oh, no.

102
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,774
Let me see.

103
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:21,571
Damn phone company.

104
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:26,993
They're updating the lines, so the service
gets interrupted. It'll come back on.

105
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,705
- How long?
- Ten minutes. Two hours.

106
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:34,542
I could say, but I'd just be guessing.

107
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:41,466
You're welcome to wait here.

108
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,639
I could even give you a room, if you like.
This was a boarding house.

109
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,892
I won't be here that long.

110
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:57,315
- What the hell is going on here?
- Sorry?

111
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,402
I get the distinct impression that
somebody doesn't want me to leave.

112
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:06,282
- I don't know anything about that.
- A bus came through here about an hour ago.

113
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,409
- Where did it go?
- A bus?

114
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,953
Don't tell me you didn't see it.

115
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:14,999
I think I'd have known
if a big bus came through.

116
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,297
Are you sure I can't
help you out with a room?

117
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,896
It's 18 miles to the state road.
Another 20 to Sugarville.

118
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:40,233
You don't want to walk it.

119
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:50,952
Excuse me!

120
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,121
Ma'am, excuse me.

121
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,542
Ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am.

122
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,971
Hello?

123
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:12,181
Ma'am, I need some help.

124
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,778
Hello?

125
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:55,641
Hello?

126
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,080
(sighs)

127
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:18,015
(knocking)

128
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:25,064
(Milsap) Doctor, can I speak to you?
It's... it's an emergency.

129
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:38,369
I'm sorry to bother you.
There's a man downstairs that needs help.

130
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,205
Please.

131
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,212
Let go. Don't hold him down.

132
00:18:54,427 --> 00:18:58,389
- How long has he been seizing?
- Three... four minutes.

133
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:02,018
It's OK. You're all right. You're OK.

134
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:07,231
- What's his name?
- He's a stranger. He needed help.

135
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:13,696
- What's wrong with him?
- He had a grand mal seizure.

136
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:19,702
As far as I can tell, he's in status.
It's a continuous seizure state.

137
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:27,501
He doesn't smell like acetone, which
would indicate that he's hyperglycaemic.

138
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:31,255
He doesn't appear to have any head injuries.

139
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:36,677
He could be epileptic
and just ceased taking his medication.

140
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,773
How did this happen?

141
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,612
Uh-huh.

142
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,532
At any rate, we need to get him to a hospital.

143
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,993
Immediately.

144
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,208
I assume that your phone's still not working.

145
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,793
Sorry.

146
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,546
Do you or one of your friendly neighbours
happen to have a car?

147
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,466
- No one here has a car.
- No cars.

148
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:19,970
We could send someone
to the state road on foot.

149
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:24,517
All right? We could get them
to bring back help.

150
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:28,813
In the meantime, please,
anything you can do for him.

151
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:38,614
All right. Do you... Do you have
any Karo syrup? Any corn syrup?

152
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,783
Yeah.

153
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:50,251
(ringing tone)

154
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:53,421
Juab County Sheriff's office.
Sheriff Ciolino speaking.

155
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,340
Hi. This is Agent John Doggett with the FBI.

156
00:20:56,465 --> 00:21:00,511
My partner, Agent Scully, requested
some material. What's your fax number?

157
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:06,684
Agent Doggett, when's your partner gonna
get here? The victim's family wants the body.

158
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,269
Agent Scully's not there?

159
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:12,440
- She was supposed to be there yesterday.
- That was our understanding.

160
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,818
Sheriff, could you send a car out?
Agent Scully is in Utah.

161
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,864
She called me yesterday
somewhere north of Sugarville.

162
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:26,203
- You got it. I'll get someone right out there.
- OK, thanks. I'll be in touch.

163
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:42,219
Danny, this is John Doggett.
I need you to trace a call for me.

164
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:46,015
It came to this office yesterday
about 1.30 in the afternoon.

165
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,741
Am I doing this right?

166
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,245
Yeah. You can hold off now.

167
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,957
- Nothing's happening.
- I'm sorry but...

168
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,169
I'm just winging it here.

169
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:21,133
Raising his blood sugar only helps if he has
hypoglycaemia. But it could be other things.

170
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,428
So what do we do?

171
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:27,556
I'm afraid that I have done all that I can do.

172
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:31,310
Unless you know how to get ahold of
diazepam or phenobarbital,

173
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:36,690
other than the nearest hospital -
which is where we should be, of course.

174
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,109
(coughs)

175
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,611
Hey.

176
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,072
Hey.

177
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,616
Can you hear me?

178
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,160
How are you feeling?

179
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:51,288
- OK.
- Thank God.

180
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:53,374
Thank God.

181
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,543
We were all so scared.

182
00:22:56,502 --> 00:23:00,381
- What can I do?
- I think I just need rest.

183
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,508
We should leave him alone.

184
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,094
Can you stay?

185
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,975
I'll go tell everybody.

186
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:18,065
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes, I am.

187
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:22,236
Thank you... for helping me.

188
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,199
I'm not sure if I've actually done anything.
In fact, I don't even know...

189
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:30,327
I don't even know
what's going on with you right now.

190
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,955
Do you know what your name is?

191
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,832
Um...

192
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,794
You don't remember, do you?

193
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:42,172
How about how you got here?

194
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:49,805
What about these people who have taken
you in? Do you know anything about them?

195
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:55,060
- They take good care of me.
- I'd say they take very good care of you.

196
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:57,605
The sun seems to rise and set on you.

197
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:02,109
In fact, they seem to have stranded me here
in order to nurse you back to health.

198
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,528
Why would they do that?

199
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:14,705
A murder took place about 20 miles
from here. A man was stoned to death.

200
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:18,709
His head was so badly crushed,
they couldn't identify him from his teeth.

201
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,338
It looks like upwards of a dozen people
may have participated

202
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,049
due to the footprints at the crime scene.

203
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:29,762
But it's a very tightknit group of people
who would murder together.

204
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,264
A cult, in a word.

205
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:36,310
And I'd say that these people qualify.

206
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,105
What are you? A detective?

207
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:42,816
FBI.

208
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,986
And I need to get you out of here,
but I don't know how.

209
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,447
Do you think that you can walk?

210
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,325
I don't know. I'm kind of weak.

211
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,494
I understand.

212
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,041
Hang on a second.
Let me just look at something, OK?

213
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:01,669
(Scully sighs)

214
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,922
(Squishing sound)

215
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,257
(groans)

216
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:10,511
That's starting to hurt.
Maybe you shouldn't do that.

217
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,638
Hold on.

218
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,935
(guttural grunting)

219
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:12,197
(ringing)

220
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,491
- Doggett.
- It's Ciolino.

221
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:18,245
The number you gave us is a payphone
a half-mile from the crime scene.

222
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:22,332
- Agent Scully must've just come from there.
- Looks like.

223
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,585
I'm sorry, still no sign of her.

224
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:28,297
- Are you canvassing neighbours?
- There's nobody to canvass.

225
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,091
It's a desolate area. There's nobody out there.

226
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:35,262
Help is coming from our Salt Lake City office.
I'm heading out there, too.

227
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,890
- There's a new angle to look at.
- What's that?

228
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:43,896
That payphone. Before Scully's call to me,
the last call on it was the night of the murder.

229
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:47,816
It was placed to a Juliette Gulatarski
of Fort Collins, Colorado.

230
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,862
She tells me it was her brother Hank.
He was on his way for a visit.

231
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:55,115
Said he was stuck in the desert
but would be there in two days.

232
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,660
He never showed.

233
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,997
Something's happening.

234
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,959
He's coming to.

235
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:09,379
Hey. Can you hear me?

236
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:12,049
How are you feeling?

237
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,135
I'm alive. That's a start.

238
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,390
- Oh, praise God.
- Praise him. Praise him!

239
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,854
What's wrong with me?

240
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:35,531
I just need some rest.
She can take care of me.

241
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,757
It's lucky they're still listening to you
for the time being.

242
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,014
This wound in your back?

243
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:07,604
It seems to be a point of entry
for a parasitic organism

244
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:12,526
that has taken up residence along your spine.

245
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,947
This is something
that I am completely unfamiliar with.

246
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,490
Oh, boy.

247
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:21,869
I don't know how far this extends

248
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:25,956
or how to get it out of you
without harming you.

249
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:33,547
- Does that mean I'm dying?
- You will die, if we cannot treat you properly.

250
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,800
These people don't seem
to want to let you go.

251
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:41,638
I think that they put this thing inside of you.

252
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:46,143
I have no idea
what the motives of these people are -

253
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,938
whether it's some bizarre
religious activity.

254
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:52,983
But they killed the last person
in your condition,

255
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:57,321
and I'm afraid that
they're going to try and kill you, too.

256
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:02,367
- This is a lot to take in.
- No kidding.

257
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:08,248
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna try and get us the hell out of here.

258
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:13,921
These people tell me that they have no cars.
I don't believe 'em.

259
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:19,092
They've got to have transportation
hidden around here somewhere.

260
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:23,972
- I'm gonna take a look around, OK?
- You're not gonna be gone long, right?

261
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,394
- You know how to use a gun?
- Pretty much.

262
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:36,068
- I'll be back soon.
- The sooner the better.

263
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,161
(knocking)

264
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,876
Where did she go?

265
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,711
She says I'm dying.

266
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,926
We need another swap.

267
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:20,654
- Sheriff? Agent John Doggett.
- You made good time.

268
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:23,073
Agent Brian Mayfield, Salt Lake office.

269
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:26,910
- We're at your disposal.
- Appreciate it.

270
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:30,580
Sheriff, does this wound look familiar?

271
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:35,293
- It's the victim in our morgue.
- That's not your murder victim.

272
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,922
That's a photo of a John Doe
found off a West Texas highway in .

273
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:43,051
- Our guy has the same wound.
- Yeah, I thought you were gonna say that.

274
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:45,178
Arizona, '93.

275
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,597
New Mexico, '97.

276
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,808
Nevada, '99.

277
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:55,230
All four had their brains beaten out and were
dumped in remote areas. All unsolved cases.

278
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:59,276
- How'd you run these down?
- Agent Scully had me trace this first one.

279
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,530
It noted glycoproteins at the crime scene,
which is what she found.

280
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:06,283
This same wound kept showin' up.

281
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,496
These murders ranged throughout
the Southwest, zigzagging all over the desert.

282
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,082
The more remote the better.

283
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:23,652
Hey. How'd you...

284
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:35,038
You had me convinced.

285
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,226
(Scully grunts angrily)

286
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:03,066
I'm a federal agent! At this moment,
the FBI is searching for me!

287
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,443
They won't find you.

288
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,405
(Hank) Doctor.

289
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:13,076
Your life... is about to take a wonderful turn.

290
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,873
You're going to become a part of something

291
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:21,084
much, much greater than you are.

292
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:28,425
You're going to be... so loved.

293
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,971
Amen. Amen!

294
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,599
(QTOUD) Amen.

295
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,778
No!

296
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,531
You son of a bitch!

297
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:53,950
- Amen!
- You just murdered him!

298
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,577
- Amen!
- (group) Amen!

299
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,537
- Amen!
- (group) Amen!

300
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,664
- Amen!
- (group) Amen!

301
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,470
No.

302
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,138
No!

303
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,307
I'm pregnant!

304
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,602
No! No, don't do this!

305
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,812
I'm gonna have a baby!

306
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,982
No! Don't do this!

307
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,484
No!

308
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,903
I'm gonna have a baby!

309
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,780
No!

310
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,991
No! No!

311
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,285
No!

312
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,753
(Scully crying out with pain)

313
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,221
What did you put in me?!

314
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,974
I'm gonna get
every last one of you bastards!

315
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,142
No.

316
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,019
<i>(SCUM groans)</i>

317
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:09,734
You'll love us. You'll protect us.

318
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:12,779
You'll teach us,
make us better than we are.

319
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:17,117
We're taught not to envy,
but I do envy you so.

320
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,786
That you'll soon be one with him.

321
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,496
Him?!

322
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,748
That thing in my spine is a "him"?!

323
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,751
(cries out with pain)

324
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:31,006
Please.

325
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:36,261
This is such a wonderful, wonderful thing

326
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,388
for you...

327
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:41,182
and your unborn child.

328
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:46,104
That last man just wasn't
a suitable tabernacle.

329
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:52,736
The thing of it is,
there's always the chance

330
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:56,197
that your body won't fail him,

331
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,201
that he'll be in you for ever.

332
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,707
(vehicle approaching)

333
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,711
Help!

334
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,671
Help!

335
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,549
Help!

336
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,176
(muffled) Help!

337
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:30,106
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

338
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:35,278
- You lost?
- Maybe. I'm way off the main road, for sure.

339
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:39,074
- Can we help you?
- I hope so. I'm...

340
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:43,036
looking for this woman.

341
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,663
Have you seen her?

342
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:50,627
No. Can't say I have.

343
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,658
Help!

344
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,994
Help!

345
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,915
She would have been driving
a rental car like mine.

346
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:31,709
- You sure she hasn't been through here?
- No.

347
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:36,131
We get so few visitors,
we remember each one pretty well.

348
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:39,259
All right. Thanks for your time.

349
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,564
Help!

350
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:55,525
Help!

351
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:58,236
(vehicle leaves)

352
00:37:58,361 --> 00:37:59,779
(grunts)

353
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:17,881
- Sheriff, this is Doggett.
- I read you, Agent Doggett. Where are you?

354
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:22,635
20 miles off the state road, just north
of the crime scene. Some kind of outpost.

355
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,929
I'm gettin' a definite vibe from it.

356
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:29,184
I talked to a guy who had a gun in his pocket-
and I don't mean he was happy to see me.

357
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,227
I'll send everybody I've got.

358
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,730
Hurry. I can't wait for you.

359
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,113
(moaning)

360
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:45,700
(loud groaning)

361
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,748
Hey.

362
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,919
(grunting)

363
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:03,635
God Almighty. Agent Scully.

364
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:09,516
- Agent Scully.
- (muffled moans)

365
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,685
(gasps for breath) Agent Doggett.

366
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:15,271
Get me the hell out of here.

367
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,283
- Can you walk?
- I don't know.

368
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:32,914
- How far is your car?
- It's about a half-mile up the road.

369
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,624
I know something closer.

370
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,887
(Scully cries out)

371
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,272
- Can you hot-wire it?
- Can I hot-wire it?!

372
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:01,192
Gone in 60 seconds, Jack.
We're gonna strand these lunatics.

373
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,989
- (groans)
- Agent Scully.

374
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,991
- Talk to me.
- You gotta cut it out.

375
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,994
Cut it out. (groans)

376
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:15,957
Now it's gonna come to my brain.
Cut it out of me now!

377
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,127
(Scully screams with pain)

378
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,631
(Scully pants)

379
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:29,345
(Scully screams)

380
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,651
Just do it, Doggett!

381
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:47,238
(pounding on walls)

382
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,949
Why?

383
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:05,900
(approaching sirens)

384
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:47,734
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm ready to go.

385
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:55,241
Grand jury convenes today.

386
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:59,162
All 47 cult members are sticking together.

387
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:06,002
Their defence is that they're being persecuted
for their religious beliefs.

388
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:10,965
They believe they worshipped Christ.

389
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,345
That that thing was the Second Coming.

390
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:27,190
Look, I... I wanted to apologise.

391
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:31,903
I left you out of this case,
and that was a mistake on my part.

392
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:34,113
It was almost a fatal mistake.

393
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:38,034
It was. You screwed up.

394
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:45,625
- And I won't do it again.
- I appreciate it.

395
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:37,260

396
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:39,345
(Child) I made this!
