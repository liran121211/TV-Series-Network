00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:19,855
OK, sweetheart, we're just
going in for a few things.

2
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:21,940
We won't be long, OK, Polly?

3
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:26,945
Mommy needs some groceries, OK?

4
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:15,077
- I don't like this store, Mommy.
- We're only gonna be a minute.

5
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,246
I wanna go home.

6
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,626
<i>(doll) Let's have fun.</i>

7
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,008
Help, Melissa.

8
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:42,437
We're going home, Polly.
Please, don't do this to Mommy.

10
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:28,483
It's Dave, down at the Super Saver.
Send whoever you got on duty.

- Scully.
- Hey, Scully. It's me.

16
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:32,941
<i>Mulder, we agreed we were
both gonna take the weekend off.</i>

17
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:37,612
Right, I know. But I just received
some information about... about a case.

18
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:41,199
A classic X-Files. Classic.
I wanted to share it with you.

19
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,453
Mulder, I'm on vacation.
The weather is clear.

20
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:48,707
I'm looking forward to breathing in
some of this fine New England air.

21
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,043
- You didn't rent a convertible, did you?
- Why?

22
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,380
Are you aware of
the statistics of decapitation?

23
00:04:56,548 --> 00:05:01,803
Mulder, I'm hanging up. I'm turning off my
cellphone. I'm back in the office on Monday.

24
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,891
Don't talk and drive at the same time.
Are you aware of the statistics?

25
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:08,059
<i>- (Scully hangs up)
- Hello?</i>

26
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,758
Sir?

27
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,097
- Sir, what happened?
- I... I think we need a doctor.

- I'm...

30
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:18,296
My name is Scully. I'm an FBI agent.
What happened to you?

31
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:22,592
I don't know. But Dave, the butcher,

32
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:25,136
I think he's dead.

33
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,322
<i>(panting sounds on TV)</i>

<i>- Mulder.
- (Scully) Mulder, it's me.</i>

36
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:59,087
- I thought you were on vacation.
- <i>I</i> am. I'm <i>up</i> in Maine.

37
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,008
You said you wanted to
get out of your head for a few days.

38
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,594
<i>I don't... I mean, I do.</i>

39
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,596
<i>(panting and groaning continue)</i>

40
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,182
- What are you watching, Mulder?
- The <i>World's Deadliest</i> Swarms.

41
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:15,604
Um... you said you were gonna be
unreachable. What's goin' on?

42
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:19,316
I, uh... I'm at a market here.

43
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:24,613
- I'm trying to give the local PD a handle.
<i>- A</i> handle <i>on what?</i>

44
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:28,867
I'm not quite sure how to describe it,
Mulder. I didn't witness it myself,

45
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:34,539
but there's some kind of an outbreak of
people acting in a violent, involuntary way.

46
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:38,710
<i>- Towards who'?
- Toward themselves.</i>

47
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,630
- Themselves?
- Yeah. Beating at <i>their faces,</i>

48
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:45,884
- clawing at their eyes. One man is dead.
- <i>Dead?</i> How?

49
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,969
Self-inflicted, it appears.

50
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:54,643
Huh. It sounds to me like it's witchcraft, or
maybe some sorcery that you're looking for.

51
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:57,729
No, I don't think it's witchcraft,
Mulder, or sorcery.

52
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:02,484
I've looked around. I don't see any evidence
that warrants that kind of suspicion.

53
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:06,905
- Maybe you don't know what to look for.
- Like evidence of the black arts,

54
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:12,744
or shamanism, divination, wicca,
or any kind of pagan or neo-pagan practice?

55
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:16,164
Charms, cards, familiars,
bloodstones or hex signs,

56
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,084
or any ritual tableau
associated with the occult?

57
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,587
Santeria, Voudoun, Macumba,
or any high or low magic?

58
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,674
<i>- SCUM'?
- Yes'?</i>

59
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:31,012
- Marry me.
- I hoped for something a little more helpful.

60
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:34,516
Short of looking for a lady
in a pointy hat riding a broomstick,

61
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,228
- I think you've pretty much got it covered.
- Thanks, anyway.

62
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:49,698
- Who's that woman right there?
- Melissa Turner.

63
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:55,370
- She's the only one who looks unaffected.
- What's your point?

64
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:59,582
You might want to talk to her.

65
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,382
Miss Scully...

66
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:13,054
- You staying in town?
- Yes. I'm on vacation. Why?

67
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:18,059
What you said about Melissa Turner put
a spin on this whole business here today.

68
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,980
- How's that?
- Melissa's caused some stir.

69
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,899
People here say she's a witch.

70
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:28,069
It's not the first time for that
accusation in these parts.

71
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,904
Yeah.

72
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:35,076
To be honest with you, Captain Bonsaint,
I'm not much of a believer in witchcraft.

73
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,995
I'm not either.

74
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,249
I used to just think it's cos
Melissa's pretty and single.

75
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,669
- Threatenin', you know?
- But now you're not convinced?

76
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:48,089
Well, you know...
I appreciate the trouble you went to,

77
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:52,010
and I sure do hope there's
a reasonable explanation, like you said.

78
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:56,598
Just this one thing gonna make it hard
to persuade folks to your thinkin'.

79
00:09:56,681 --> 00:10:01,519
- What one thing is that?
- Who she's been carryin' on with.

80
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:07,650
- Who she's been carrying on with?
- Uh, yeah. With Dave, the butcher.

- I'm not involved in anything.
- I know that. Would you listen to me?

92
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,820

- <i>What?</i>

95
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:04,666
- Something bad.
- What is it, Buddy?

96
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:11,256
- Dave's dead.
- Oh, my God!

97
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,009
<i>I gotta see you right away. Melissa?</i>

98
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:18,596

<i>- Why? Tell me why.</i>

101
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,855
I can't explain it to you now.

<i>I'm coming over there, Melissa.
You shouldn't be alone.</i>

The sheets are still wet.

Chief?

107
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,441
Take a look at this.

108
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,114
What the devil's this for?

109
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,450
Looks like she was afraid of somethin'.

110
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:08,331
Whatever it is, she's run off in a hurry.
Laundry's out, door's unlocked. Beats me.

111
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,297
- You know her?
- Melissy? About as local as you can get.

112
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:20,218
Born and raised here.
Married a fisherman.

113
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:24,555
Widowed last year, after a boating accident.

114
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:30,019
Don't know if the little girl, Polly,
ever really understood. Toys in the attic.

115
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:33,648
- The daughter's autistic?
- That's what they say.

116
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:38,152
Last year at the daycare centre,
proprietor slapped Polly across the face.

117
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,571
Slapped her? What for?

118
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:44,826
She said Polly threw a tantrum so fierce,
there was nothin' else she could do.

119
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,663
Next thing, she's on the ground.
The little girl knocked her silly.

120
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,999
- The little girl did?
- That's her story.

121
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:54,085
Polly never touched her,
as far as I could figure.

122
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,839
It was a real drama.
Lady who ran the school lost her licence.

123
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:02,385
People calling the kid all manner of names,
saying Melissa's a witch.

124
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,514
Polly never went back to school a day since.

125
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:10,601
This, uh... this affair that the mother
was having with the butcher...?

126
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:15,189
Dave. Oh, I might've given you the wrong
impression. That wasn't really an affair.

127
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:18,526
Although Dave did make
quite a fool of himself, and his wife.

128
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,030
- So, it was unrequited?
- You could say that.

129
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:25,283
To the extent that she'd have to
nail her windows shut?

130
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,744
Oh, he wasn't that big a fool.

131
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:33,458
You know, maybe she wasn't afraid
of somethin' getting in.

132
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,044
Maybe she's afraid of somethin' getting out.

133
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,212
Like what?

134
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,591
Just a thought.

135
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,140
What do you think of that, huh?

136
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:07,408
- Why don't you leave town?
- I've got nowhere to go, Buddy.

137
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:10,745
- I live on a shoestring as it is.
- Listen to me.

138
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,998
- I've got some money put away.
- Buddy, I can't.

139
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,836
I've had my eye on you for more years
than I care to remember.

140
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:22,840
I missed my chance the first time round,
and I'm waiting in the wings.

141
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:28,471
Now, I'm sorry about things, truly I am,
but you need somebody who can provide.

142
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:32,600
- Don't, Buddy, please.
- "Don't", because you don't want to?

143
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,937
- Or just because you're too proud?
- You don't understand!

What don't I understand?

146
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:47,782
What happened in the Super Saver,
what happened to Dave.

147
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:51,327
- I couldn't stop it.
- What do you mean?

148
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,956
I've seen things.

149
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,292
- I want more cherries.
- What's that, sweetie?

150
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:01,212
I want more cherries!

151
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:05,550
I saw Dave dead. <i>Before</i> he was dead.

152
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:09,720
I saw him in Frozen Foods,
all out and bloody.

153
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:14,475
And it's not the first time.

154
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,019
My husband...

155
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:23,067
I saw him... in a window... dead, before it
happened - you know, with the hook?

156
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:27,321
You're gonna have to go ask your mommy
for more money.

157
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,073

Let's have fun.

160
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:48,009
- Mommy, I want more cherries.
- We gotta go now, Polly.

161
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,607
Take this, Melissa. It's to a place we use
for hunting, up near Schoodic Lake.

162
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,026
- Mommy!
- Or else there's gonna be trouble.

163
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,278
<i>(POI/y) Mommy!</i>

164
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,115
Mommy!

165
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,242
<i>(screaming)</i>

166
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,767
- Is that you, Jack?
- Yeah, it's me, Jane. Come in?

167
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:47,652
- Who've you got with you?
- My name's Dana Scully. I'm with the FBI.

168
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:51,822
- I just happen to be here on vacation...
- So?

169
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,826
So, I just... I'm helping out the chief here.

170
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:58,663
- Did you talk to her?
- Who?

171
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,832
Oh, please. Melissa Turner.

172
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,670
That whore's a witch,
sure as I'm standin' here.

173
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:09,924
She's descended from the Hawthornes
in Salem. The Englishes, too.

174
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:14,762
She comes from a cursed lineage,
and now she's passing it on to the whelp.

175
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:20,434
God save that little girl if somebody
don't do somethin'. Lord knows, I tried.

176
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:24,605
Jane, if we could just come in
for a few minutes and talk...

177
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:28,442
I found out last year how much good
talking to you does, Jack.

178
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:31,862
I explained everything, and the city
closed me down anyway.

179
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:34,782
Our great-great-grandfathers
knew about witches.

180
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,618
They would've driven the demon
out of that girl,

181
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:41,706
and given that slattern of a mother
just what she's got coming.

182
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,710
New England hospitality.

183
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:50,298
Heard about it my whole life. Finally got
a chance to experience it for myself.

184
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,727
You see what I'm up against,
public sentiment an' all.

185
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,147
- This family tree of Melissa Turner's...
- Yep?

186
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,235
- It's all talk, isn't it?
- I never really asked. Why?

187
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:14,822
Well, I think you need to bring her in
to straighten this out.

188
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:19,827
- Under what pretext?
- That she might know something.

189
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,079
About what?

190
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:26,667
About what I'm sure is a perfectly
reasonable explanation for all this.

191
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,253
Uh, yeah.

192
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:35,092
Well, I wish I could help you out.

193
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,347
You know, I'm just...

194
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,600
on vacation.

195
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,631
- Hi.
- Where you headed this time of night?

196
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:18,094
We were invited up to a place near the lake.
A friend gave us the key.

197
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:21,806
- You got gear? Food and water?
- We'll be all right.

198
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:27,728
I just want to make sure of that, ma'am.
Winter's in full force up there. Power's iffy.

199
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:30,815
- Just you and the little one?
- For now.

200
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:35,569
- I wanna go home, Mommy.
- We're gonna go camping, Polly.

201
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:39,907
- I want my bed, I want my records.
- Let's have fun.

202
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:43,828
(ranger) I'll just take
your licence number, then.

203

Thank you.

254
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:48,465
Hey, I was thinking about this case.
Maybe it's not witchcraft after all.

255
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,552
Maybe there's a scientific explanation.

256
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:57,307
- A <i>scientific explanation?</i>
- <i>Yeah, medical cause. A</i> thing <i>called chorea.</i>

257
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:58,559
Dancing sickness.

258
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:02,563
St. Vitus's dance.
It affects groups of people,

259
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:07,234
causing unexplained outbursts
of uncontrollable jerks and spasms.

260
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,487

- How a grappling hook went in his skull.

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,561
I want to play.

327
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,026
"What happened?"

328
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:04,448
You ask that question around here,
you get as many stories as... as fishermen.

329
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:09,202
You were on board the night
that he died. What do you think?

330
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,872
I told my story to the chief.

331
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,710
People's stories change.

332
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:24,134
- Folks blame the widow.
- Who do you blame?

333
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:29,639
He was wild for her.

334
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:32,726
<i>He worked very hard
to build that little house for her.</i>

335
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:37,731
<i>When that daughter came, you'd need
a mop to wipe the smile off his face.</i>

336
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:41,068
<i>We'd set out to sea
on the girl's last birthday.</i>

337
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,488
<i>He was counting the hours
before he'd be home again.</i>

338
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:49,326
Hey, look what Davy Jones
sent my little Polly.

339
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,998
Catch of the day.

340
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,668
Yeah.

341
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:06,301
- Three clays later, he was dead.
- And you know what killed him.

342
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,680
The eyes play tricks at night.

343
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:14,017
Water up against the hull, making noises.

344
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,146
<i>(fisherman) Sometimes you hear things.</i>

345
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:24,611
<i>- (muffled) Let's have fun.
- What the hell was that?</i>

346
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:39,960
What is it?

347
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:48,218
<i>(doll) I want to play.</i>

348
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,985
<i>(fisherman) Oh, my Goth!</i>

349
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,487
Like I said, the eyes play tricks.

350
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:11,658
But you saw something
in that grocery store.

351
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:17,414
- That little girl and her dolly.
- Moment I saw them, I knew.

352
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:23,587
<i>(cellphone rings)</i>

353
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,176
Scully.

354
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:30,844
Thought you weren't answering your phone.

355
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,763
- Then Why'd you call?
- I, uh...

356
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:36,349
I had a new thought about this case.

357
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,186
<i>There's a viral infection
spread by simple touch.</i>

358
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:43,273
Mulder... are there any references
in occult literature

359
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:48,945
to objects that have the power
to direct human behaviour?

360
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:54,743
- What types of objects?
- Um... like a doll, for instance.

361
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,079
- You mean, like Chucky?
- Yeah, kind of like that.

362
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:03,627
The talking-doll myth is well-established
in literature, especially in New England.

363
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,379
The fetish orjuju

364
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:10,550
is believed to pass on
magical powers to its possessor.

365
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,304
<i>Early witches were condemned
for little more than proclaiming</i>

366
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,972
<i>that these objects existed.</i>

367
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:20,560
The supposed witch having
premonitory visions and things...

368
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,897
- Why do you ask?
- I was just curious.

369
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,401
- You didn't find a talking doll, did you?
- No, no, of course not. Uh...

370
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:35,325
I would suggest that you check the back of
the doll for a plastic ring with a string on it.

371
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,411
That would be my first... Hello?

372
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:42,832
Let's go talk to Melissa Turner.

373
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:47,837
<i>(corn popping)</i>

374
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,006
Where's my popcorn?!

375
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,012
It's coming, Polly.

376
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,944
- <i>(Polly)</i> Where's my popcorn?!
- It's coming.

377
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,467
<i>(hammering)</i>

378
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,243
<i>(POIIy) Mommy'?</i>

379
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:09,252
- I can't sleep.
- You go back to bed, Polly.

380
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:11,421
It's way past your bedtime.

381
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,675
- No more pounding.
- Go back to bed, sweetheart.

382
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,263
Let's have fun.

383
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,850
Help me.

384
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:35,612
Everything's gonna be all right, sweetie.
Just go back to bed.

385
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,756
That's Buddy's car.

386
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,006
Melissa!

387
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:45,181
- <i>(Bonsaint) Do you</i> see <i>anything?</i>
- <i>(Scully) Uh-uh.</i>

388
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,354
Melissa?

389
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,700
<i>(Bonsaint) Melissa!</i>

390
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,161
Mommy...

391
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,709
Don't play with matches.

392
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,629
Go back to bed, Polly!

393
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,715
(Bonsaint) Melissa?

394
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:22,010
Go on now!

395
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,223
<i>(hammering)</i>

396
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,904
(SCUHY) Melissa?

397
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,574
Melissa! Bonsaint!

398
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,748
Don't play with knives.

399
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,500
Mommy!

400
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:57,670
She's got the door nailed shut.
She's trying to kill herself.

401
00:38:58,254 --> 00:38:59,923
Melissa!

402
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:14,103
Mommy! Mommy, no more pounding!

403
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,695
Let's play with the hammer.

404
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,113
(SCUHY) Melissa!

405
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,881
Get away from me!

406
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,719
Put it down, Melissa.

407
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,392
I don't like you any more.

408
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:01,484
- Give me the doll, Polly.
- I want to play.

409
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:04,571
<i>(Melissa) No!</i>

410
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:08,074
- Polly, give me the doll.
- I want to play.

411
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,828
Polly, give me the doll.

412
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:14,330
I want to play.

413
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,750
I want to play. I want to play.

414
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:23,256
I want to play. I want to play.
I want to play. I want to...

415
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:29,178
I want to play. I want to play.

416
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:33,766
I want to play. I want to play.
I want to play. I...

417
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:14,849
<i>(door opens)</i>

418
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,394
Oh, hey! Scully, how you doin'?

419
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:23,358
- Uh, how you feelin'? Rested?
- I feel fine.

420
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:30,865
- What?
- That poster. Where'd you get it?

421
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:35,745
Oh, I got it down on M Street
at some head shop about five years ago.

422
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,831
- Hm.
- Why?

423
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:43,252
No, I just... wanted to send one
to somebody.

424
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:45,755
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

425
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,757
Ooh!

426
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:52,261
- Who?
- Oh, just... some guy.

427
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,140
Jack.

428
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:57,225
M Street?

429
00:41:57,308 --> 00:42:00,103
Yeah. Is this somethin' to do with that case?

430
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:04,023
"That case"... Um, yeah. Yes, it is. Yeah.

431
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,275
- Did you solve it?
- Me? No.

432
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:11,906
No, I was, uh... I was on vacation. Just...
getting out of my own head for a few days.

433
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:16,619
What about you? Did you, um... get
anything done while I was gone?

434
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:19,038
It's amazing what I can accomplish

435
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:24,252
without incessant meddling or questioning
into everything I do. It's just...

436
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:39,809
There's... got to be an explanation.

437
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:45,440
Oh, I don't know. I think some things
are better left unexplained.

438
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:28,441
I want to play.
