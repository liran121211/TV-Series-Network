00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:09,970
<i>In nothingness.</i>

3
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:18,645
<i>A nightmare born from deepest fears
coming to me unguarded.</i>

4
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:25,569
<i>Whispering images unlocked
from time and distance.</i>

5
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,039
<i>The soul unbound, touched
by others but never held,</i>

6
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,043

8

00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:03,232
<i>Facing a truth I can no longer deny.</i>

10
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:09,738
<i>Alone, as ever.</i>

11
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,466
Excuse me. I'm looking
for the special-needs ward.

12
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,385
Second door in the main hall.

13
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,554
Thanks.

14
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,916
Emily,

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,711
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

16
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:51,798
His name is Mulder.
Remember I told you about him?

17
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:53,383
Hi.

18
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:59,181
She's a little shy.

19
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:02,809
What are you colouring?

20
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,269
A potato.

21
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,192
Have you ever seen Mr Potato Head?

22
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:14,112
He looks like this.

23
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,785
Doesn't he?

24
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,711
I'll be right back. OK?

25
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:39,304
Thank you for coming.

26
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,768
Something's wrong, isn't it?

27
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,354
I found Emily's surrogate mother.

28
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:52,609
I had Frohike hack into the California
Social Services adoption database.

29
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,528
You got a name?

30
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,447
Her mother of record is one Anna Fugazzi.

31
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:02,494
- Fugazzi.
- Yeah, as in slang term for "fake".

32
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,914
I don't understand.
Why create a false record?

33
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,958
Because there are no true records.

34
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,670
Emily didn't come into this world
through any system that keeps them.

35
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,464
Well, how did she come into this world?

36
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,884
Have you asked yourself that?

37
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:24,182
Well, she was born to someone.
She had to belong to someone.

38
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,227
Someone who's proven that
they'll do anything to protect her

39
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,354
or their interest in her.

40
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:38,947
- I can protect her too.
- Yeah, but who's gonna protect you?

41
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,534
Emily's adoptive parents
are both dead by no accident.

42
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:45,162
I know. I...

43
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,873
I've considered that,
but I've also considered that

44
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,333
there's only one right thing to do.

45
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,714
Emily.

46
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,594
Why didn't you call me sooner?

47
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,429
Because I couldn't believe it.

48
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:08,351
But I need you now to be a witness
on my behalf in this hearing.

49
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,396
And I should have declined...

50
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,733
if I never want to see you
hurt or harmed in any way.

51
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,904
Then why are you here?

52
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,449
Because I know something
that I haven't said.

53
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:26,870
Something that they'll use against you
to jeopardise your custody of Emily.

54
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,335
No matter how much you love this little girl,
she's a miracle that was never meant to be.

55
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,278
They're ready for you.

56
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,078
Agent Mulder, help me out here.

57
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:11,581
Does FBI stand for
"Federal Bureau of imagination"?

58
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:17,879
Am I to understand that your partner, with
a dozen women in Allentown, Pennsylvania,

59
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:21,883
was abducted by employees
of our federal government?

60
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,928
She was missing for four weeks.
That's documented.

61
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,806
And you found evidence
that during this time

62
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,058
she was subjected
to a series of experiments

63
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:33,603
where, you say, they extracted her ova?

64
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:38,108
- Yes. All of them.
- Can that be done?

65
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,735
I believe it can, and was,

66
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:44,406
and that Emily Sim was conceived
as a result of the experiments.

67
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:48,201
- And that can be done as well?
- I don't know how else to explain it.

68
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:51,746
A medical exam of Ms Scully would show
that she hasn't given birth.

69
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:58,128
You know, under normal circumstances
this petition would be fairly simple.

70
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:04,050
But I'm having a hard time wrapping
my brain around this... Michael Crichton bit.

71
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:07,262
I included this information
in anticipation of your reaction

72
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,849
and how it might look if you received
this without explanation.

73
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,976
Can you give me an explanation?

74
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:17,022
Why anyone would kidnap Ms Scully
to conceive this child,

75
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:18,857
then put it up for adoption?

76
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:22,569
No, but the fact remains that
Ms Scully is the mother of this child.

77
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,696
Not in any legal definition.

78
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:28,825
If you can show me a legal precedent
for this case, I'd like to see it.

79
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:33,204
Dana has known for some time that she
can't bear children. She hasn't known why.

80
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:35,290
Now, however that happened,

81
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:39,961
that she can adopt this child is something
I don't feel I have the right to question

82
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:43,590
and I don't believe anybody has
the right to stand in the way of.

83
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:59,939
It takes two of us just to get
my sister-in-law into bed these days.

84
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:03,151
- When's she due?
- Two weeks ago.

85
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,327
Why didn't you tell me, Mulder?

86
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,790
I never expected this.

87
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,753
I thought I was protecting you.

88
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:26,883
Why would they do this to me?

89
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:30,637
I only know that genetic experiments
were being done.

90
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,597
That children were being created.

91
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:34,724
Children being created for who?

92
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,519
For who, for what, I don't know.

93
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,525

Hello. ls anybody there?

97
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:12,345
I need a call traced.

98
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:16,808
An incoming call to
a residential line, 550-0380.

99
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:21,438
- Mulder, it's...
- Don't hang up.

100
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:28,278
OK, thanks. I got a trace.

101
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,657
County Children's Center.

102

<i>(banging on door)</i>

103
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,625
What is it?

104
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,838
- Has anyone been here in the last half-hour?
- No. What's going on?

105
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:30,465
- She's burning up.
- I'll call 911.

106
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:42,393
Scully? There's something on her neck.

107
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,402
Oh, my God.

108
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,996
OK. Now, that doesn't hurt.
I'm gonna turn this little thing on.

109
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,791
All right. I'll try back later.

110
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,709
I just spoke to the social worker.

111
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:10,255
She hasn't been able
to reach Emily's doctor.

112
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,257
Hi.

113
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:15,093
How is she?

114
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:19,514
We've put her on a saline drip to rehydrate
her. She's running a fever of about 102.

115
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:22,559
- It's good you got her here.
- Do you know what's causing it?

116
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:25,854
Some infection, probably related
to the cyst on her neck.

117
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,565
- Do you know what it is?
- No. I'll have it biopsied.

118
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:31,442
I'll get it off to the lab right away.

119
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:34,112
Now, are you two the parents?

120
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,285
- I'm her mother.
- Oh. OK.

121
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:43,121
Well, can you give me
any history that might help?

122
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:46,749
- I know she was being treated for anaemia.
- Do you know what type?

123
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,169
I was told it was some kind of
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.

124
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,631
- Her treatment is experimental.
- Who's her doctor?

125
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:56,926
- His name is Calderon.
- I don't know him.

126
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:00,346
Emily, I'm gonna roll you
onto your side, sweetie.

127
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,700
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

128
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,162
Move away from her!
Move away from her! Get away!

129
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:28,333
- (doctor) Sir, I need to get in there.
- Get away from her! Get away!

130
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,667
<i>(gasps)</i>

131
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,795
- Don't go in there.
- I have to get in the room!

132
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:36,132
<i>(nurse coughs)</i>

133
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:04,702
Is she still sleeping?

134
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,040
They have her on a mild sedative.

135
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,543
The ER doctor is
in and out of consciousness.

136
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,339
How did you know?

137
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,302
If Emily is someone's creation,

138
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:25,640
it occurred to me that she might share
the same body chemistry we've seen before.

139
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,059
So I had them put the ER doctor
in a cooling bath

140
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,311
like you did when I was exposed to this.

141
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:35,650
So what now? I mean,
she's still just a little girl.

142
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:40,655
You say that I can't protect her,
but I can't let this be her life.

143
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,575
Just a few days ago she was fine.

144
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:48,621
She was also being treated.

145
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,336
I just need some advice. With everything
that's happening here, I'm a little at sea.

146
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,297
This Dr Calderon you say is her physician.

147
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:00,758
He's refusing to transfer
her medical records.

148
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:02,635
He can't do that.

149
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:06,264
- He's endangering her life.
- He said Emily was in his care,

150
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,767
and if you're stopping that,
you're endangering her.

151
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,936
It's an ethical violation.

152
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,650
He says she was in a double-blind medical
trial and that he's spoken to you about it.

153
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:24,365
He also says you have
no authority over this child.

154
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,081
Authority or not, I'm not leaving her side.

155
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,002
It's beyond me, I'm afraid.

156
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,505
Yeah, but it's not beyond Dr Calderon.

157
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:45,261
I'd like to say right up front
that I know Emily Sim personally,

158
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,222
as your partner probably told you, and...

159
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,852
my God, I never met a sweeter,
more courageous little girl.

160
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,730
I'm so sorry to hear about her downturn.

161
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,983
My hope is that these
custody issues can be resolved

162
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,778
so that she can resume her treatment here.

163
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,948
But I can't release any information
abouther

164
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:09,619
as relates to our company's
experimental drug trials.

165
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:13,790
- What can I say to convince you?
- It's not about convincing me.

166
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:18,211
I mean, this is something that...
well, that we simply cannot do.

167
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,047
It's purely a business reality.

168
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:26,135
It has to do with Prangen's exposure to
litigation and our need to protect research,

169
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:31,349
which, frankly, represents
a significant dollar investment.

170
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,855
So, I'm wasting your time. This is not
worth the life of a three-year-old girl.

171
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,651
I wouldn't frame it like that.
That's not it at all.

172
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:45,822
Look, I'm truly sorry but
there's really nothing I can do.

173
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,452
However, I do wish you the very best.

174
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:52,954
OK, then.

175
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:58,251
How are you feeling now?
A little more helpful?

176
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,879
Condescending liar.

177
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:03,339
Help!

178
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:07,343
Why don't you tell me what your company
is really in business for? Huh?

179
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:11,931
Abducting women and stealing their unborn
children. Medical rapists. That's all you are.

180
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,726
Now you're gonna let that little girl die?
She's just a lab rat to you!

181
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:21,065
Why don't you tell me whose life
is worth saving, yours or hers?

182
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:26,571
- I want everything to help that little girl!

We're ready.

185
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,759
Can you give me a minute with her?

186
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,649
Hi.

188
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,827
Sweetie,

00:17:58,454 --> 00:18:01,999
in a minute a nurse is gonna
take you to do some tests.

190
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:06,337
Mommy said no more tests.

191
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:13,469
We just want you to get better.
That's what these tests are about.

He came to see me. He knows I'm involved.

195
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,526
And now you've brought him to see us.

196
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,075
- What do you want me to tell him?
- Nothing.

197

<i>(car remote control beeps)</i>

198
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,314
I hope you know what this is.

199
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,362
A neoplastic mass. A tumorous infection.

200
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:23,534
The cyst in the back of Emily's neck
seems to be the point of origin,

201
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:27,246
and from her blood test last night
and her sed rate this morning,

202
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,707
it also seems to be growing rapidly.

203
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,835
- <i>(Susan Chambliss) Is it</i> cancer?
<i>- No.</i>

204
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,879
Cancer grows out of control.

205
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:39,383
These are anaerobic channels following
the path of the central nervous system.

206
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,719
They kill the surrounding tissue,

207
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,971
depriving it of the oxygen
it needs to survive.

208
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:48,225
Its point of origin is proximal
to the brain and the central nervous system.

209
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,436
It couldn't be in a worse place.

210
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,862
Can you put her on antivirals?

211
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,782
She's on a Levophed drip
to keep her blood pressure up

212
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:08,496
and she's getting steroids intravenously
to bring down inflammation.

213
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:13,751
- We could attempt radiation therapy.
- You can't. Her immune system's too weak.

214
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,920
<i>(Chambliss) What can you do'?</i>

215
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,341
Has anyone spoken to
Dr Calderon about this?

216
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,738
Dr Calderon?

217
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,168
Get Dr Vinet in there and call the police.

218
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:59,171
(nurse) Dr Vinet to Isolation.

219
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,267
Halt! Dr Calderon!

220
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,727

222
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,130
Yeah.

- <i>(Scully) Where are you?</i>
- <i>I'm following</i> Dr <i>Calderon.</i>

224
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,095
What do you mean? I just saw him.
There was a scare here.

225
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,179
<i>Where?</i>

226
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:53,934
He was here. He came into Emily's room.
It appears he injected her with something.

227
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,561
Is she all right?

228
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:59,023
Seems to be,
but we're running a tox screen.

229
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,942
Whatever it was, I don't think
he meant to harm her.

230
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:05,946
- What are you talking about?
- I think he went there to try to treat her.

231
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,700
Why would he endanger her before,
only to protect her now?

232
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,579
As a bluff. I don't think they want her
dead either, for different reasons.

233
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,206
Look, I'm gonna catch up with you, all right?

234
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,171
- Detective.
- Happy New Year.

235
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:26,008
- Thanks for coming down.
- I'm posting two cops outside her room.

236
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,260
That may not be necessary.

237
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,764
What if this guy Calderon
is thinking about coming back?

238
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:35,601
There seems to be some indication
that he came here to help her.

239
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:39,938
I don't understand. You said he was
connected to the death of Emily's parents.

240
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:43,442
Because Emily's mother wanted
to stop the tests, just like I did.

241
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,694
And I guess that's why he came here.

242
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:49,114
As much as they will do anything
to remove what gets in their way,

243
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:52,534
it seems that they need Emily
to continue the tests.

<i>(TV playing)</i>

245
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:54,179

Hello.

Anna Fugazzi?

248
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,520
Yes.

249
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,522
Your name is Anna Fugazzi?

250
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,400
Yes. Are you the new doctor?

251
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:10,863
No, I'm not. Is that your real name?

252
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:14,074
Yes, for the last 71 years.

253
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,412
Were you looking for me?

254
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,539
Not until now.

255
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,504
I don't understand. Just an hour ago
you said that she was getting better.

256
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:32,801
That's right. Her fever's down.
Her vital signs are nearly back to normal.

257
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:37,931
But these latest MRls are telling me
that this growth has continued to spread.

258
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:43,353
In her arms I'm now seeing
what looks like a necrotising of the tissue.

259
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,440
It's killing her.

260
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:51,612
Whatever it is, it may have already
been present in some amount.

261
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:56,909
Basically, it's shut down her body
while it continues to grow.

262
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,621
We should be thankful she's not in any pain.

263
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:19,598
I presented all this information to the court.

264
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:25,521
And I have to tell you there is great concern
that you are making decisions for this child.

265
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,898
They're having no small effect on her health.

266
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:30,692
Ms Chambliss, I am a medical doctor,

267
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,863
and the decisions that I make
are reasonable and right.

268
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:40,160
But I have it in this report that Dr Calderon's
treatment has resulted in a turnaround.

269
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:41,829
No, that's not true.

270
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:46,416
The injection that Dr Calderon gave her
is actually making her worse.

271
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,920
Ms Scully, I want to say something to you,

272
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:53,340
and I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

273
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:58,720
But I don't think that you are capable right
now of responding with any clinical ability.

274
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,266
Do you think I don't want
what's best for this child?

275
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,769
Do you think I'm not trying to save her life?

276
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:09,147
I'm saying that I'm getting
wildly differing reports.

277
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:13,235
I have a job to do. I'm not
the ultimate authority here.

278
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:17,656
But you don't have the authority
either over this child or her future.

279
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:21,451
You can get a court order
and you can try and enforce it.

280
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:26,582
But I suggest that if your job is
to do what's best for this child,

281
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,167
you do all you can to tell the authorities

282
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:34,423
that if they take Emily out of this hospital,
they are going to hasten her illness.

283
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:38,093
And I will make it known
that all of you are responsible.

284
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:45,183
What do you want me to tell them
you're doing for her?

285
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,729
I don't know yet.

286
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,565
But I will.

You OK, sweetie?

319

00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,155
<i>(hissing sound)</i>

337
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:14,799
I'm an FBI agent. I have an emergency
situation. I need an ambulance and backup.

338
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,351
I don't know where I am.

339
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,520
- Mulder! I got him inside.
- Do you have your weapon?

340
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,440
- He's on the floor, cuffed.
- I got backup coming.

341
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:35,195
- They need a location, though.
- I'll take care of it. Just watch the guy.

342
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:41,076
- <i>Detective Kresge</i> will radio <i>in the location.</i>
- <i>(car remote control beeps)</i>

343
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,560
She's gone into a coma.

344
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,067
I'm OK, Mulder.

345
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:17,570
It's what's meant to be.

346
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,032
But if you could treat her?

347
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:24,744
I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it to her.

348
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,917
Are you sure?

349
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,383
Mulder, whoever brought this child
into this world... didn't intend to love her.

350
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:43,930
I think she was...
she was born to serve an agenda.

351
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,562
I have a chance to stop that.

352
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,569
You were right.

353
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:03,575
This child was not meant to be.

354
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,126
I'll stay with you.

355
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,629
I think I'd like to be alone.

356
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,909
Are you ready?

357
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,538
I think I'll get a ride back with Mulder.

358
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:44,027
Bye-bye, Matthew.

359
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,702
We'll see you at home, OK?

360
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:56,140
Who is the man who would create
a life whose only hope is to die?

361
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,560
I don't know.

362
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,691
But that you found her...

363
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:08,236
and you had a chance to love her...

364
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,531
maybe she was meant for that too.

365
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,076
She found me.

366
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,954
So you could save her.

367
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:28,423
- How's Detective Kresge?
- He's doing better. He's out of the ICU.

368
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,050
And the men who did this to him?

369
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:34,512
They already cleaned up the nursing home.

370
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,223
All the women have been
placed in new homes.

371
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:42,603
There's no evidence that anyone else
at Prangen knew of Calderon's work.

372
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,903
There is evidence of what they did.

373
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:46,727
