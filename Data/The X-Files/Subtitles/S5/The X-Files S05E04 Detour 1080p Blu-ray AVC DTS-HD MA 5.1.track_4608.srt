1
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:21,940
All right, let's shoot this, Marty.

2
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,361
Hold it still.

3
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:27,946
<i>(fly buzzing)</i>

4
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:31,366
Hold it still, Sloan.

5
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:36,538
<i>I'd like to see you hold it still. The sooner
they pave over this swamp, the better.</i>

6
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:39,124
It's not a swamp. You're standing in a forest

7
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:43,879
with indigenous plant and animal species
you're obviously too ignorant to appreciate.

8
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,632
<i>Mark it. Gimme another position.</i>

9
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,804
Shoot this one real carefully, Marty. This is
where they're gonna put the Blockbuster.

10
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:55,891
You're a real moron, Sloan, you know that?

11
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:57,309
Tree-hugger.

12
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:01,438
You should be sad to see the demise
of an ecosystem that's lasted 1,000 years.

13
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:06,109
We all should be.
Gimme four feet to your left.

14
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:10,781
- <i>I</i> can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

15
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,577
<i>I mean I can't, because it's stuck.</i>

16
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,121
Then unstick it.

17
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,972
This is weird.

18
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:41,520
Argh!

19
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:45,148
Sloan! Sloan!

20
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,693
Argh!

21
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,543
Louis, let Bo do the work.

22
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,718
- How's he know how to find a possum?
- Sh.

23
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:40,555
Animals sense things that we can't.
That's how they survive.

24
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,808
So... is that how Bo knows how to hunt?

25
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:47,479
Yep. Our ancestors were hunters, too.
But most of us have lost those instincts.

26
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,731
That's why we need a little help.

27
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,733
Dad, what's that?

28
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:58,615
Surveyor's equipment.
Someone left his stuff out here.

29
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:01,827
<i>(Bo barks)</i>

30
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,458
Stay close, Louis.

31
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,592
What is it, Dad?

32
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,679
- Dad?
- Bo. Come here, Bo.

33
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,267
- What...
- Quiet!

34
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,519
<i>(rustling)</i>

35
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:34,609
Listen to me. I want you to take Bo,
and I want you to run straight home.

36
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:35,652
What's the matter?

37
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,613
Run straight home. Don't stop for anything.

38
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:45,996
- Louis. You understand?
- I just...

39
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,625
Go.

40
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:58,717
<i>(rustling)</i>

41
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,219
Come on, Bo. Come on.

42
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,473
<i>(gunshot)</i>

43
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:08,143
<i>(gunshot)</i>

44
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,146
Bo, no! No! Come on, Bo. Come on!

45
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,565
Come on! Come on!

46
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:25,994
(man) Last year was something
of a personal revelation.

47
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:29,414
We were doing an exercise
called Team Builders,

48
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:35,170
where we were given two minutes to build
a tower out of ordinary office furniture.

49
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,005
When I stood on Mike's shoulders

50
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:41,760
and I put that electric pencil sharpener
on top of the pile...

51
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:44,888
We both knew...
we could never have done it alone.

52
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:47,265
Kill me now.

53
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,436
You ever been to one of these
team seminars, Agent Scully?

54
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,525
Um... I think I went to
a constructive problem-solving course

55
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,860
when I first joined the Bureau.

56
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:02,280
Did you play that game
where you can't use any negative words?

57
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:06,952
I couldn't believe how hard it was
not to use the word "but".

58
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:10,455
I'm having that same problem right now.

59
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,375
- Have <i>you</i> ever been to a team seminar?
- No.

60
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:18,129
Around this time of year I always develop
a severe haemorrhoidal condition.

61
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:21,299
Well, it builds muscles
you didn't even know you had.

62
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:24,386
Communication. That's the key.

63
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:37,816
- Sorry, folks. It'll be a few minutes.
- What's goin' on, Officer?

64
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,943
Got a little situation is all.

65
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,242
Thank you, Jesus.

66
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,120
Where's he going?

67
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,587
Oh! Excuse me.

68
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,257
- Are you from Search and Rescue?
- No, I'm just stretching my legs.

69
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,094
They said they'd have word for us
about what happened to my husband.

70
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:08,930
Slow down. I don't know
what you're talking about.

71
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:12,100
My husband Michael,
he was teaching our son to shoot.

72
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,936
He said the dog got spooked,
then he heard gunshots.

73
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,274
They've found a jacket with blood on it,
but they won't tell me about my husband.

74
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:23,528
- I'll try to find out who's in charge, all right?
- Oh, thank you.

75
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:34,956
Now where's he going?

76
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,180
Hey, Stonecypher! Take a look at this.

77
00:07:57,562 --> 00:08:01,316
This tree was here 20 years
before Ponce de Leén landed.

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,404
We're gonna be late
for the wine-and-cheese reception.

79
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,036
- Officer Fazekas?
- Yes?

80
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:18,416
- Can I help you?
- My name is Fox Mulder.

81
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,504
- I'm an agent with the FBI.
- FBI? Who called you guys out?

82
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:26,257
Nobody. We got stopped at your roadblock.
Sounds like you had a shooting.

83
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:30,095
Shots were reported, but we have
no evidence of anyone being shot.

84
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:34,766
- Well, what do you have evidence of?
- A survey team didn't report in last night.

85
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,936
We found one man's bloody jacket,
pretty torn up.

86
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,772
And this morning, a boy
got separated from his father.

87
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,357
Separated by what?

88
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,860
It looks maybe like
some kind of animal attack.

89
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:50,031
- What kind of animal?
- I'm not sure yet.

90
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:54,536
I followed good tracks for the two
surveyors, but the trails became confused.

91
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:59,290
There was a third set of tracks
leading away I... I couldn't identify.

92
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,795
- Couldn't identify as the surveyors'?
- As man or animal.

93
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,381
Mulder?

94
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:09,718
Oh, just, uh... Hold on a second.

95
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:14,139
- What about the boy's father?
- I tracked him to where he fired the shots.

96
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:17,976
The ground's rocky, but from
the depressions in the underlying soil

97
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,729
I can tell that he entered
the bushes over there,

98
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,982
where I pick up another set of tracks,
two different sets,

99
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:28,486
that, from the way the ground's upset,
is probably where the man was attacked.

100
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,613
But no other sign of him?

101
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:34,659
- Do you have panther in these woods?
- Panther. Bear.

102
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,413
- But these tracks look like neither of those.
- No, sir.

103
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:40,957
You know of a good motel in the area?

104
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,795
Excuse me. I think we can handle this
very well on our own. Thanks.

105
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:50,842
Mulder, we've got this conference.

106
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,179
- They're waiting.
- Yeah.

107
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:57,515
How do I say this without using
any negative words, Scully?

108
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,769
You want me to tell them
you're not going to the seminar.

109
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:02,270
You see? We don't need that conference.

110
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:06,107
We have communication
like that - unspoken.

111
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:20,038
<i>(sinister laughter)</i>

112
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:24,209
<i>Look! He's all eaten away.</i>

113
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,461
<i>How d'you like that, eh?</i>

114
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,226
<i>(switches off TV)</i>

115
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:45,021
He's not coming back, is he?

116
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,071
- Why would you say that?
- Dad's a good shot.

117
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:57,992
If he hit what he was aiming at,
he'd be home by now.

118
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,370
You gotta be brave, Louis.

119
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:04,082
We both gotta be brave.

120
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,752
We'll find out more about it in the morning.

121
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:12,423
You get some sleep now.

122
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,076
<i>(whines)</i>

123
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,299
<i>- (knocking)
- It's open.</i>

124
00:11:58,261 --> 00:11:59,470
Who cut the cheese?

125
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,932
Since we won't be
making it to the conference...

126
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,311
<i>Mm... Par-Kay.</i>

127
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,731
However, I must remind you
this goes against the Bureau's policy

128
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:13,234
of male and female agents
consorting in the same motel room.

129
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:18,072
Try any of that Tailhook crap on me, Scully,
I'll kick your ass.

130
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:23,578
Pop quiz. What animal will attack the
strongest, leaving the weakest to escape?

131
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:28,750
The answer is none. Not one of the
over 4,000 species native to North America

132
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,170
will attack the strongest
when the weak is vulnerable.

133
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:37,508
- What does that have to do with anything?
- We're dealing with no ordinary predator.

134
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:41,346
- I thought this was just a ploy.
- I think what we've stumbled upon here

135
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:45,433
is more than local authorities realise.
The scenario described by that boy?

136
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:50,521
- It sounds like a primitive culling technique.
- Mulder, we're in western Florida.

137
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:54,442
The closest to primitive here
is living in a beachfront retirement condo.

138
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,946
Those woods are as old
as anything in the South.

139
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,865
There's no telling what's alive out there.

140
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,953
- Where are you going?
- I gotta check something out.

141
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:09,207
Some work on your communication skills
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

142
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,461
I'll be back soon, and we can
build a tower of furniture. OK?

143
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,396
What is it, BO?

144
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:37,151
- Mom?
- It's all right, Louis. You go back to sleep.

145
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,840
Bo?

146
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,926
Bo?

147
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:06,597
Bo, where'd you get to?

148
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,944
Bo, is that you?

149
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,946
<i>(snarls)</i>

150
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,950
Come on, boy. Let's go back in.

151
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,910
<i>(growls)</i>

152
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:33,291
All right, all right.
You... stay there the night.

153
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,555
Louis. Louis!

154
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,726
Louis! Louis!

155
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,728
Louis!

156
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,315
- Louis!
- Mom!

157
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,151
Louis!

158
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:18,836
Argh!

159
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,672
- What is it, Louis?
- It's in the house.

160
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,217
- How's the boy?
- Still freaked out.

161
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:10,555
I might have some insight into this
invisible creature he said was chasing him.

162
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:15,893
The Invisible Man was invisible.

163
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:20,982
- Right.
- He said the creature had glowing red eyes.

164
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:25,486
Let me show you something. Mrs Asekoff
said she went outside with the dog,

165
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,990
but when she came back,
the door was locked from the inside.

166
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:32,243
- And?
- Look at this. We got some tracks here.

167
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:36,414
- Where?
- Here. And here. Dried mud against the tile.

168
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,916
Tracked in from the outside.

169
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,459
That could have been brought in by the dog.

170
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:43,004
No. See the ball of a foot here?

171
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:46,924
- A large foot. And I count five toes.
- I thought you said it wasn't human.

172
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:49,510
I'm not saying it is.
The weight distribution's all wrong.

173
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,429
People walk heel to toe.

174
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:55,099
Whatever this thing is,
it walks on the ball of its foot.

175
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:57,351
You're putting me on.

176
00:16:57,435 --> 00:17:00,688
No. My dad and I were Indian Guides.
I know these things.

177
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:04,442
So if it's not man and it's not animal,
what the hell is it?

178
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:08,738
- Guess I'm a little late to this dance.
- I found some tracks. Right here.

179
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:13,534
- Same as I saw before.
- Where was that?

180
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:17,705
In the woods.
The weight distribution's strange.

181
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,751
They appear to be human, but whoever
left these uses the balls of his feet,

182
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,127
like an animal.

183
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,798
Whatever it is, it's attacked three
grown men, presumably in broad daylight,

184
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:30,051
disposing of its prey without detection.

185
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:33,387
And it wasn't shy about
coming out of the woods to try again.

186
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:37,642
What we've got is a predator with low
visibility and a high degree of motivation.

187
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:42,647
And it's got one advantage we don't have:
the entire Apalachicola National Forest.

188
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:46,400
- Then how do you stop it?
- By identifying it.

189
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,903
Finding it before it finds somebody else.

190
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:55,076
It's called a FLIR,
for Forward Looking Infra-Red.

191
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,830
It was developed for chopper pilots in
Vietnam. Detects body heat at 300 yards.

192
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:02,667
That's pretty sophisticated
for government issue.

193
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:07,838
I see you've met Jeff, our local tech-head.
Some people prefer searching with dogs,

194
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:12,093
I prefer an extra pair of hands
if I get in trouble. Are we ready to go?

195
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:16,597
You can put away your cellphones.
Communication is with short-wave radios.

196
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,517
So stay close, maintain visual contact.

197
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:22,853
If you get lost, initiate aural contact.
That means holler.

198
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:26,440
If nobody responds, sit down.
I'll find you. Don't go looking for me.

199
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:29,777
I know it sounds obvious,
but folks still get lost.

200
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,529
OK.

201
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,032
I got you. Thank you. All right.

202
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,870
The local PD has all their resources
looking out for a transient,

203
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:44,834
a drifter who's wanted for a double
homicide in Gadsden, Alabama.

204
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:49,213
- They're amused by what we're doing.
- I don't think it's a drifter.

205
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:52,633
- We may be looking for two individuals.
- Why do you say that?

206
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:56,554
That thing lured that woman out of
the house to separate her from her son.

207
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,307
- But for what purpose?
- Divide and conquer.

208
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,061
If your enemy is greater in numbers,
you divide and conquer to diminish them.

209
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,564
What enemy would that be?

210
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:11,569
Encroaching development. That's what
I suspected when I went to check on Louis.

211
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,571
This is about a housing tract?

212
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:17,491
That survey team was staking out
a new 100,000-acre plot.

213
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:20,995
Civilisation is pushing very hard
into these woods.

214
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:24,582
Maybe something in these woods
is pushing back.

215
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:57,406
- Anything?
- No. Nothing at all. Not even wildlife.

216
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,951
- Isn't that a little strange?
- Yeah.

217
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:04,038
This forest is usually alive with sound.
I'm not an expert,

218
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,791
but I've never seen it like this before.

219
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:11,212
- It sure is beautiful, though.
- That's what happens.

220
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,881
People get to looking around,
something eats 'em.

221
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,633
What killed those men?

222
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:19,470
Nature is full of creatures trying to kill
something they need to survive,

223
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:23,474
or trying to avoid being killed
by something that needs them to survive.

224
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:27,728
If we become blinded by the beauty of it,
we may fail to see its cruelty and violence.

225
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:29,230
- Walt Whitman?
- No.

226
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:32,149
<i>When Animals Attack on the Fox network.</i>

227
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,685
Wait. I've got something.

228
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,771
It's about 20 yards ahead.

229
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:14,942
- Where? I don't see it.
- It's just sitting there.

230
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,038
It's on the move!

231
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,215
It's moving fast! It's going to the right!

232
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:45,681
Wait! There's two of them now.
They're moving in opposite directions.

233
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:48,476
There, and there.

234
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,489
Where is it?

235
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,074
About 40 yards ahead of you.

236
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,918
I don't see it.

237
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:17,046
Now it's gone. I don't know where it went.

238
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,603
- What is it?
- I don't know.

239
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:38,067
They're trying to separate us,
pull us away from the others.

240
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:44,615
Let's go back.

241
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,114
Michele?

242
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,992
<i>- Michele?
- (rustling)</i>

243
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,583
Mulder, I need help!

244
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,798
Mulder!

245
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,346
- Scully!
- Over here!

246
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,144
- Scully!
- Over here!

247
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,273
- What happened?
- I don't know.

248
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:03,360
- Where's Fazekas?
- She was walking ahead of me, right here,

249
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:06,196
- and then she was just gone.
- I'm getting no reading.

250
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,867
- What the hell's happening here?
- They separated us.

251
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,453
That was on purpose,
so they could go after her.

252
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:16,123
She was in the lead, presumably
the strongest. They take them first.

253
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,376
Take them where?
You can't just disappear out here.

254
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,129
- You're right. We gotta find her.
- How do we do that?

255
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:26,216
I don't know. We'll form a line and beat
the bushes. Maybe you'll pick up a signal.

256
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,802
No, we need help. We need manpower.

257
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,888
That's not gonna work out here!

258
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,891
We need to get outta here. Listen to me!

259
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,895
The longer we wait,
the less chance we have of finding her.

260
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,314
This is nuts! This is looney tune, man.

261
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,067
We gotta get out of these woods
before it gets dark.

262
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,403
OK, you're right. You go back.

263
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,740
You leave me the FLIR, and you go back.

264
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,578
- We gotta go together.
- We have to find her.

265
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,207
Yeah, but if we stay here,
they may not find any of us.

266
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,836
Mulder, he's right.
We weren't prepared for this.

267
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,005
We have no way of telling them
where we are,

268
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:08,342
we have no food,
Michele had our only water.

269
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:13,430
I'd like to find her too, but I think
the risks of that are way too foolish.

270
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,270
All right. We all go, then.

271
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,942
You lead the way.

272
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,700
I don't have that much faith that
this device will do us any good.

273
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:35,369
So far, all it's done is split us up.

274
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,539
Whatever it was we were chasing
did show up on the screen.

275
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,791
- What does that tell you?
- Nothing.

276
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,961
Except that
we're going in the right direction.

277
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:47,965
Maybe it can regulate its temperature.
You don't know of any animal that can?

278
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,053
Ticks. They can halt their metabolism
for up to 18 years,

279
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:57,808
going into suspended animation until
something warm-blooded comes along.

280
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,310
That's interesting.

281
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,313
Why is that interesting?

282
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:06,483
30 years ago, the town
of Point Pleasant, West Virginia,

283
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:11,155
was terrorised for over a year by something,
killing livestock, terrorising the people.

284
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,658
They were described as primitive-looking
men with red, piercing eyes.

285
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:20,247
Became known as the "moth men".
I got an X-File dating back to 1952 on it.

286
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,084
What would that be filed next to?
"The cockroach that ate Cincinnati"?

287
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:28,589
No, "the cockroach" is in the C's.
"Moth men" is over in the M's.

288
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,926
- This isn't the way.
- What do you mean?

289
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,679
Michele always marks her route
with white stones.

290
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,766
This is the same path.
This is the way we came.

291
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,934
I haven't seen a stone for 20 minutes.

292
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:45,856
- You've had your nose glued to that screen.
- I'm telling you, we're on the wrong trail!

293
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:49,276
Somehow we got off-track.
Oh, man! This is not happening.

294
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,111
This is not happening.

295
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,697
Everybody stand still.

296
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:58,660
There's something out there.

297
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,333
- Where?
- About 40 or 50 yards out.

298
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,460
Jeff?

299
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:12,716
- Nothing.
- I saw it.

300
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,976
The woods have gone silent again.

301
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,982
<i>(rustling)</i>

302
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:31,568
- I got it! I got it on my screen.
- Where?

303
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,905
About 30 yards ahead. It's just sitting there.

304
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,992
- What is he doing?
- Talk to him.

305
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:42,079
- This is not a good idea.
- Talk to him, Jeff!

306
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,665
Go to your right.

307
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,934
- It just disappeared.
- Mulder, it's not on the screen.

308
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,965
Scully, I lost it!

309
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,968
I got it.

310
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:49,479
- Did you hit it?
- I don't know.

311
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,982
- It just stopped.
- Where's Glaser?

312
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,959
- How many shots did you fire?
- Six, maybe seven.

313
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,005
- Is that your only clip?
- Yep.

314
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,257
Don't fire unless you're sure
you're gonna hit it.

315
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,010
It may be trying to spend our advantage.

316
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:23,847
- What the hell is it, Mulder?
- I don't know.

317
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,433
But whatever it is, it's smarter than us.

318
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:30,187
At least out here.

319
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,358
Mulder? Mulder!

320
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,193
Scully!

321
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,367
Mulder!

322
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,037
Scully!

323
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,509
You OK?

324
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,532
You were an Indian Guide. Help me out here.

325
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:28,745
Indian Guide says maybe you should
run to the store and get some matches.

326
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,581
I would, but I left my wallet in the car.

327
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,884
- What are you doing?
- Trying to open my gun.

328
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:51,351
If I can separate the shell from the casing,
maybe I can get the powder to ignite.

329
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:55,856
And maybe it'll start raining
weenies and marshmallows.

330
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,108
- Do I detect a hint of negativity?
- No!

331
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,527
Yes, actually. Yeah.

332
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,284
Mulder, you need to keep warm.
Your body's still in shock.

333
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,786
I was told the best way
to regenerate body heat

334
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:14,958
is to crawl naked into a sleeping bag
with somebody else who's already naked.

335
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,962
Maybe if it rains sleeping bags,
you'll get lucky.

336
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,970
Have you ever thought
seriously about dying?

337
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,766
Yeah, once, when I was at the Ice Capades.

338
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:38,148
When I was fighting my cancer,

339
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,985
I was angry at the injustice of it.

340
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,782
Its meaninglessness.

341
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,663
And then I realised that
that was the struggle.

342
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,959
To give it meaning.

343
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,838
To make sense of it.

344
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,258
It's like life.

345
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:09,262
I think nature is supremely indifferent
to whether we live or die.

346
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:13,266
If you're lucky, you get 75 years.
If you're really lucky, you get 80 years.

347
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:19,314
If you're extraordinarily lucky, you have
50 of those years with a decent head of hair.

348
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:24,653
I guess it's like Las Vegas.
The house always wins.

349
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,989
Oh!

350
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,866
Ta-da.

351
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:33,370
Go, girl.

352
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:42,712
Hey, who did you identify with
when you were a kid, Wilma or Betty?

353
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:46,716
- I identified with Betty's bustline.
- Yes, I did, too.

354
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:53,140
Could never have been
married to Barney, though.

355
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,392
Their kids were cute.

356
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,228
Yeah. But where are they today?

357
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,864
Moth men? Really?

358
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,409
Yeah. But there seem to be
only two of them.

359
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,838
(Mulder) I don't wanna wrestle.

360
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:28,341
Get over here. I'm going to
try and keep you warm.

361
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,599
- Ow.
- Sorry.

362
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:39,102
One of us has got to stay awake, Scully.

363
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:41,062
You sleep, Mulder.

364
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:44,191
If you get tired, you wake me.

365
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,903
I'm not gonna get tired.

366
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:52,115
- Why don't you sing something?
- No, Mulder.

367
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,868
If you sing something,
I'll know you're awake.

368
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:59,956
- Mulder, I can't carry a tune.
- It doesn't matter. Just sing anything.

369
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:13,094
Jeremiah was a bullfrog

370
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,265
Was a good friend of mine

371
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,480
Never understood a single word he said

372
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,650
But I helped him drink his wine

373
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,071
<i>(Mulder) Chorus.</i>

374
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,908
Joy to the world

375
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:39,162
All the boys and girls

376
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,251
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea

377
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,921
Joy to you and me

378
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,816
Scully?

379
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,277
Over here.

380
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:12,946
What are you doing?

381
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:15,824
Looking for food. I found some wild berries.

382
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,286
I wouldn't go far.

383
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:22,289
Mulder, you never left my sight.

384
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,499
<i>(cracking)</i>

385
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,711
Scully?

386
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:33,133
Scully?

387
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,385
Scully!

388
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,306
Scully!

389
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,393
- Down here.
- Where?

390
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:46,229
<i>I fell</i> down a <i>hole. (coughs)</i>

391
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,816
You all right?

392
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:53,903
Yeah. I landed on soft earth... kinda.

393
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,661
What's down there?

394
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,667
I don't know. It's pretty dark.

395
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:13,256
Oh!

396
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:17,510
Scully, what's going on? Are you OK?

397
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,351
- I found Michele.
- Is she alive?

398
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,525
Not for much longer.

399
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:36,029
- Mulder, we have to get her out of here.
- Is there a way out?

400
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,032
I don't know. l...

401
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:43,620
I'm in some kind of a chamber. There's...

402
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:49,459
It's like... some kind of network.

403
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,383
- Mulder...
- Yeah?

404
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,969
I'm not alone.

405
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:05,141
I don't have my weapon.

406
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,603
- Mulder!
- Hold on. I'm gonna drop my gun down.

407
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:21,950
Jeez! Mulder, are you OK?

408
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:25,245
Don't mind me.

409
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,248
Scully!

410
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:47,934
Mulder, look.

411
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:06,327
There has to be
a scientific explanation for this.

412
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,888
(Mulder) Too bad we don't
have any office furniture.

413
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,223
<i>(Scully)</i> If they could see us now.

414
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,642
Go, team.

415
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:36,399
20 more bodies and we'll win
the honey-baked ham.

416
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,069
(man) Agent Mulder!

417
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,906
- We're down here!
- We're down here!

418
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,330
What are you doing down there?

419
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:53,833
- We've got injured people down here.
- We need a ladder.

420
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,211
Right away.

421
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,842
Hey! Over here!

422
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,562
Dad's gonna be OK.

423
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:58,398
He's gonna be OK.

424
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,233
He's gonna be fine.

425
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:02,318
I'm just going to say goodbye.

426
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:18,334
Well! We just got all the thanks,
when you did all the work.

427
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:22,505
On the contrary, Agent Kinsley.
We'd never have got involved if not for you.

428
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,424
- Really?
- Yeah. You see this?

429
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,427
Oh, yeah. I pointed that out
to Agent Stonecypher.

430
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,180
There was something in the cave
that Scully fell into, an inscription.

431
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,516
<i>- Ad noctum.
- That's Latin.</i>

432
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,268
It means "into darkness".

433
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,937
The Spanish conquistadors used to carve it

434
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,774
on the posts that they would
lash the natives to, as a warning.

435
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:44,861
So who are you saying wrote this?

436
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:48,948
Ponce de Leon came here 450 years ago,
looking for the Fountain of Youth.

437
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,868
You mean you think that these...
that that... body,

438
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:56,205
the one that Agent Scully shot...? No!

439
00:40:56,331 --> 00:41:00,043
After 400 years, don't you think they'd
have adapted to their environment?

440
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:03,463
- You're just making this up.
- Why do you say that?

441
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:09,177
Cos... you work on the X-Files,
and you just want to write off your motel.

442
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:12,847
Search and Rescue
are still unable to find Jeff Glaser,

443
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,308
or the second predator you reported.

444
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:18,061
I wouldn't be surprised
if they couldn't find them.

445
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:20,271
Agent Mulder, I'm confused.

446
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,149
Why would they come after the boy
in the house that night?

447
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,902
These predators have been
in these woods a long time.

448
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:30,573
They would perceive any encroachment on
their territory as an enemy, even a little kid.

449
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:31,991
But... that would mean

450
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:36,704
that they'd come after any one of us
that had gone into the woods, wouldn't it?

451
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:45,254
- Where's Agent Scully?
- She got a lift back to the motel

452
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,341
- to pack up both your things.
- She did? Excuse me.

453
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:05,066
My jacket's in that car.

454
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,828
Scully!

455
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,665
Scully!

456
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,918
Mulder, what's going on?

457
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:12,759
- Let's get outta here.
- OK.

458
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:15,344
- Pack everything?
- Yeah.

459
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:39,173
