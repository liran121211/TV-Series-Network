Charles Figus. Ten-year veteran
of the US Marshals Service.

35

Multiple gunshot wounds,
high-speed Teflon rounds.

36
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:58,151
His partner, Boyce,
was DOA at Mercy General.

37
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:02,906
- Tried to catch a 9mm slug in his teeth.
- Looks like they crashed the wrong party.

38
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:04,908
Figus and Boyce had radioed in
that they were coming here

39
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,452
to apprehend Pico Salazar.

40
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:10,914
- Pico Salazar?
- The Colombia cartel's banking liaison.

41
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:14,042
Salazar escaped from
federal custody three months ago.

42
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,087
Boyce and Figus were on
the transport squad that lost him.

43
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,256
They took his escape personally.

44
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,176
A phone tip told them that Salazar
was gonna be here tonight.

45
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,012
A foreign national
with his kind of connections?

46
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,306
What would he be doing here?

47
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,645
I don't think he is. Or was. But there were
a lot of photogenic gentlemen who were.

48
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:43,280
Mulder, these are street-level coke dealers.
Minor wholesalers at most.

49
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:46,199
Not the type to associate with a cartel boss.

50
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:49,536
- What would they be doing here?
- Maybe it was for the pie.

51
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:57,586
It's 2.45 in the morning. You mind telling me
what it is we're supposed to be looking for?

52
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,590
- Donald Gelman.
- Who?

53
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:06,303
Donald Gelman. Silicon Valley software
pioneer. He's been missing since 1979.

54
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:09,556
- And you recognise him?
- He invented the Internet.

55
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,309
He didn't invent it, but he's a folk hero.

56
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:15,395
He ran Internet software
before there was an Internet.

57
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,149
- Why have I never heard of him?
- On the eve of making a huge deal,

58
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:22,944
he went hiking and said he'd think about it.
He never came back.

59
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,989
I still don't see the connection.

60
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,535
Maybe that's the point.

61
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,920
Folks, I'm gonna have to
ask you to stay back.

62
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,006
So, why was Gelman in there?

63
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:47,052
- I think somebody wanted him dead.
- Do you think this was a hit on him?

64
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:52,223
Eight unconnected dealers all at
the same place, all tipped off by phone.

65
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:55,894
Last call goes to the marshals.
They arrive, the place explodes.

66
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:59,564
- Gelman dies in the crossfire. It's genius.
- Did you look at him?

67
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:02,275
Why kill a man who's dying?
His body is a bag of bones.

68
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:07,656
When you're talkin' about Donald Gelman,
you want to kill the brain, not the body.

69
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,920
- Mulder, that's evidence.
- Gee, I hope so.

Now they're powerbrokers and billionaires.
Back then they were just inspired nerds.

79

- All except Gelman.
- Gelman was not one of them.

80
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:16,099
At 28, he was "the old man".
Some say the brightest of all.

81
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:20,437
- He wrote some of the earliest viruses.
- And was under investigation by the NSA.

82
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,856
- Is that why he disappeared?
- Gelman?

83
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:26,317
Gelman was a visionary,
not a capitalist. A subversive.

This is a one-off.
I've never seen anything like it.

85

- Gelman built this?
- That may be what got him killed.

You've assaulted a federal agent,

00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:13,414
When you said it was targeting us back
there, you meant an artificial intelligence.

00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:16,292
Donald Gelman was tryin'
to create a sentient Al,

145

a program with its own consciousness.

146
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,423
He succeeded, didn't he?

147
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:25,802
Donald wrote an interlocking sequence

148
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,554
- It got loose on the Net.
- What do you mean?

149
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:34,060
He let it loose, so it could evolve in its
natural environment: Urschleim in silicon.

150
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,313
- Urschleim in silicon?
- The primordial slime.

151
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,607
The ooze out of which all life evolved.

152
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,027
Except this time it's artificial slime,
artificial life.

157
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,336
Then Donald showed up

00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,298
- A better offer to do what?
- You wouldn't understand.

00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,525
You believe this load of crap?

160
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:27,113
You saw what happened back there.
You saw the container blow.

00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,992
She could've rigged an explosive charge.
There are no weapons platforms.

162
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:34,871
- There is no such DOD satellite.
- What about Star Wars? Brilliant Pebbles?

163
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:38,583
They were never built. We don't
even have that kind of technology.

164
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,628
I mean, even if an Al was targeting us
with an armed satellite,

165
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,380
why isn't it doing it now?

166
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:47,300
Because it doesn't know where we are.

167
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:50,428
If I so much as made a phone call
right now, it would nuke us.

168
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,555
- How?
- Recognises my voice.

169
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:57,018
Monitors all communication.
I haven't used a phone in over a month.

170
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,645
How did it know to target the container?

171
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,023
I think some idiot got on Donald's computer

172
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:06,277
and tried to contact me over the Net.
Only Donald knew where I was. And David.

173
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,280
- Who's David?
- David Markham. He was hardware.

174
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:14,118
Donald and I were software.
We'd been caring for the Al. Weaning it.

175
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:18,998
Then Donald warned us that
the system started to display intention.

176
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,459
- But by then it was gone.
- Where?

177
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,669
I don't know.
One day, David was on the system

178
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,130
and it wouldn't come when we called.

179
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:29,675
We knew it was out there
on the global Net, but it wouldn't answer.

180
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,386
- And Donald was getting sicker.
- You can't find it?

181
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,265
Well, it's not a program any more.
It's wildlife loose on the Net.

182
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:39,268
And either we kill it...

183
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,731
- Where's Donald?
- Donald Gelman is dead.

184
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:47,193
He was killed in a café -
what looks like a hit.

185
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,907
That's the Al protecting itself.

186
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,869
It'll find David and me.

187
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,038
It's only a matter of time.

188
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:06,254
Donald was writing a series of viruses
to find and immobilise the rogue system.

189
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:10,716
The file name was Kill Switch.
Without it, nobody can catch it.

190
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,552
- We have his computer.
- He'd never leave it on there.

191
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,973
No, we have... this. It's "Twilight Time".

192
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,892
That's it. That's the Kill Switch.

193
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,025
It can't be. It is.

194
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:32,321
Esther Nairn. You programmed the
autonomous bots in Ninjitsu Princess.

195
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:34,615
The gnarliest piece of software ever.

196
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,702
Are these the brain donors
that nearly got us incinerated?

197
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:42,832
- (Mulder) Don't let their looks fool you.
- Your name is Esther Nairn?

198
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:47,545
She is so hot.

199
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:51,882
Are you gonna take off these cuffs
or do I have to do this with my tongue?

200
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,135
You don't wanna take a vote.

201
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,355
Gimme the Kill Switch.

202
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:11,360
Aren't you worried it's going to track you?
Hunt you down with another particle beam?

203
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:16,282
Not unless somebody else makes
another boneheaded Internet connection.

204
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:23,831
- What is this?
- It's the sharp end of the stick.

205
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,084
Donald probably tried to feed this in,
but it took too long,

206
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:31,213
- so the system took countermeasures.
- Why didn't it just zap him too?

207
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,718
Its creator? It needed to impress him.
A particle beam would've been overkill.

208
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:40,681
- Unlike a dozen crack dealers.
- No, you see, that's its sense of humour.

209
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:45,853
Oh. But if you load the Kill Switch, what's
to stop it from playing a funny joke on us'?

210
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:50,399
Well, obviously we can't inject Kill Switch
over the Net. There's only one way now.

211
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:53,486
We must find it and physically
feed it the poisoned apple.

212
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,697
- Physically?
- Right into its eager little CD drive.

213
00:19:56,781 --> 00:20:01,202
It knew it couldn't hide over the Net for
ever. Not until it learned to disguise itself.

214
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:05,831
It requires a physical nexus of hardware,
so it's built itself a little safe house.

215
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,000
- David went looking for it.
- Did he find it?

216
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:11,837
- There's no way to know.
- Why don't you just call him?

217
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,424
Oh, right. Death from above.

218
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:20,304
- It would need bandwidth.
- It's a pig for bandwidth.

219
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:22,681
- It'd need a T3 at least.
- T3?

220
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,684
A hard line - 45 megs a second.

221
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:28,521
Major research labs
and service providers use 'em.

222
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:32,525
But the government keeps
those records secret for fear of sabotage.

223
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:37,029
Gee, you guys know anyone
that works for the government?

224
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,778
<i>Buenos dias, muchacha.</i>

225
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:17,713
- Scully?
- Yep.

226
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,758
Yeah, I found something
down in Fairfax County.

227
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,260
A derelict chicken farm
with a T3 connection,

228
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:26,138
paid for by Elof Industries, Palo Alto,

229
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,517
<i>- of which there's no other record anywhere.
- Dandy.</i>

230
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,229
<i>- Where are you? Sounds like you're driving.
- You are correct, sir.</i>

231
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:37,983
- You have Esther with you?
- In a manner of speaking.

232
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:40,486
Left up here. Give me that.

233
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,323
<i>- Where are you going?
- (disguising voice) To find David.</i>

234
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,909
Where?

235
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:51,330
Scully?

236
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,666
Scully?

237
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,895
Go ahead. Put me out of my misery.

238
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,150
Take it.

239
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,705
<i>(siren goes off)</i>

240
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,046
<i>(distorted) FBI. I'm</i> a <i>federal agent.</i>

241
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,964
I lied to you. I wasn't working with Donald.

242
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,842
I mean, I was,
and then he found out about us.

243
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,929
- About you and who?
- David.

244
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:58,517
- About our plans.
- What plans did he find out?

245
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,395
Uploading.

246
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:05,649
The transfer of memory, of consciousness

247
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:08,861
to the distributed system
maintained by the Al.

248
00:26:10,738 --> 00:26:14,408
Imagine being mingled
so completely with another,

249
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:17,703
you no longer need your physical self.

250
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,038
- You're one.
- So you were gonna...

251
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,666
Enter the Al.

252
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,422
Give up our inefficient bodies so that our
consciousness could live together for ever.

253
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,344
- But Donald Gelman forbade it.
- He was afraid of his creation.

254
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:38,474
He was afraid of what would happen
if other people followed us.

255
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,980
I loved him so much.

256
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:50,110
Well, maybe he wasn't here
when this happened.

257
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,072
Maybe he's somewhere else.

258
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,864
David Markham.

259
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:43,140
- The electric burns are real bad.
- What's goin' on?

260
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:47,561
- We got ourselves a real crispy critter here.
- Alert the burn unit.

261
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,232
- Unit 23, request burn unit.
- He's comin' up on us.

262
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:55,277
- Surgical team, stat.
- What's that smell?

263
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,407
- Easy. Come on, easy.
- Jesus.

264
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,242
Just relax, relax.

265
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,040
...120. BP 130 over 80.

266
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:15,255
Frank charring at contact site,
along path of current, and at exit point.

267
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,424
The charge grounded through both arms.

268
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,594
- We got a lot of work to do to save him.
- Is it bad?

269
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,096
- You're in good hands.
- My arms hurt.

270
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,850
That's a good sign.

271
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,080
No, wait. Call my doctor.

272
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,875
You have to call my doctor. Call Dr Scully.

273
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,837
Please call Dr Scully.

274
00:29:56,463 --> 00:30:00,092
Call her. No, no.

275
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:02,260
No. What are you doing?

276
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,931
Prep the patient.

277
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,312
No.

278
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,857
No. No, no, no, no.

279
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,290
I can't get through to Mulder.

280
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:37,045
It's the Al. It's had time to analyse my voice.
It knows I was using your phone.

281
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,216
It can interfere with my phone?

282
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:45,053
Give it enough information,
it'll sue you for palimony.

283
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,806
Wait a minute.

284
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:52,894
Mulder said that he found the system in an
abandoned chicken farm in Fairfax County.

285
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,523
Then we can cut off the T3
and kill its communication capabilities.

286
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:00,360
- You can do that?
- There's only one way to find out.

287
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,886
- I feel sick.
- That's the anaesthetic, Agent Mulder.

288
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:29,014
You were injured and they had to operate.

289
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,225
I remember wires and, uh...

290
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:37,147
Yes, you were doing something dangerous.
Something very, very foolish.

291
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,859
The good news is they were
able to save the right one.

292
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,821
What do you mean?

293
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,785
Oh, my God.

294
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,706
What did you do with my arm?
What did they do with my arm?

295
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,126
Shh. Or they'll come back.

296
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,670
- Will come back for what?
- They're evil, Fox.

297
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:04,174
- But...
- They want something from you.

298
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,760
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

299
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,679
But if you don't tell them,
they'll take your other arm.

300
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:12,599
This is crazy. You...

301
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:15,769
You have to help me.
You have to get me out of here. Please.

302
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:19,064
Help me. Help me. Please help me.

303
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:22,400
- Shh.
- <i>(muffled cries)</i>

304
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:25,028
- <i>Or they'll</i> hear <i>you.</i>
- <i>(muffled cries)</i>

305
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,796
Something's wrong.

306
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,967
I didn't do anything.
I didn't even get on the Net.

307
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,136
I think it found us.

308
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,851
It's zeroing in.

309
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,147
Esther.

310
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,401
Get away from the tanker truck!

311
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:11,908
Sir, you need to get out of the truck!
Move it!

312
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,579
It's gonna explode!

313
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,379
Dump it, Esther!

314
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:28,508
- Get rid of it!
- It's got the Kill Switch.

315
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,219
Esther! Dump it!

316
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:36,266
Esther!

317
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,894
Get rid of it!

318
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,148
Get rid of it, Esther!

319
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,297
Oh, I had this terrible dream.

320
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:12,260
- And then I had a good dream.
- Those weren't dreams, Fox.

321
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,598
I believe that's enough for now.

322
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:23,271
You poor thing. But I warned you.
Nurse Nancy warned you.

323
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:26,107
You have to tell them, Fox. You have to.

324
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,653
- Tell them what?
- About the Kill Switch.

325
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:33,448
- Nobody asked me anything.
- You've just forgotten, Fox.

326
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,825
- No.
- I was there.

327
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,747
The doctor asked and he was
very cross when you refused to answer.

328
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,875
But he'll be here in a few minutes
and you can tell him then.

329
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:49,631
- But...
- Otherwise... whoops, there go your legs.

330
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:54,928
N-o-ooo! Aaargh!

331
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,431
- Mulder, these women are spies!
- Scully!

332
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,790
Mulder, they want the Kill Switch virus.

333
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,584
- What did you tell 'em?
- Nothing.

334
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,962
- I need to know.
- Look.

335
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,798
Do we have it?

336
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,801
Do we have the Kill Switch?

337
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:38,513
Of course we do.

338
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,282
Scully.

339
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,286
Scully?

340
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,081
Scully, help!

341
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,709
Help!

342
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:10,587
Help!

343
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,423
Scully!

344
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:39,741
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

345
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:00,887
<i>(siren goes off)</i>

346
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:10,563
- Scully.
- Mulder?

347
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,484
<i>(distorted)</i> Mulder, are you all right?

348
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,112
I'm in here.

349
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,697
Scully.

350
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,623
Mulder?

351
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,918
<i>(distorted) Mulder?</i>

352
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,838
<i>(distorted) Mulder, can you hear me?</i>

353
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,006
(eChQ)

354
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,024
Mulder?

355
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,472
Mulder?

356
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:35,815
Help me out here, Esther.

357
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,610
What's its next move? What is it thinking?

358
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:42,280
I don't know.

359
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:45,283
- Who built this?
- It did.

360
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,870
There.

361
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:57,754
Oh! David.

362
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,008
Oh, God.

363
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,514
Mulder?

364
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,728
Mulder?

365
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,442
Mulder, can you hear me?

366
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,569
Mulder, talk to me.

367
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,075
It wants the Kill Switch.

368
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:31,287
But we don't have it. You threw it
in the water with the computer.

369
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:40,380
- But that's gonna kill it?
- Not if it can vaccinate itself against it.

370
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:42,715
<i>(electrical charges)</i>

371
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,596
Give it what it wants, Esther.

372
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,016
Put it in, Esther.

373
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:54,519
It's targeting us.

374
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,856
Put it in.

375
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:05,280
<i>( "Twilight Time" by the Platters)</i>

376
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,784
<i>Heavenly shades of night are falling</i>

377
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:12,287
<i>It's twilight time</i>

378
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:16,040
You're gonna be OK.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

379
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,960
OK.

380
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:22,589
<i>When purple-coloured curtains
mark the end of the day</i>

381
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,216
It's OK.

382
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:34,642
<i>Deepening shadows gather splendour</i>

383
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,312
<i>As day is done</i>

384
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:41,065
<i>Fingers of night will soon surrender</i>

385
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,276
<i>The setting sun</i>

386
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:47,655
- What are you doing, Esther?
- Get outta here.

387
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,742
- What are you doing?
- Go!

388
00:40:56,497 --> 00:41:02,045
<i>And in the afterglow of day</i>

389
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:05,256
<i>We keep our rendezvous</i>

390
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,468
<i>Beneath the blue</i>

391
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:11,220
<i>And in the sweet...</i>

392
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:14,390
- Esther?
- You don't listen, do you?

393
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:18,269
- Where are you?
- Get out of here now.

394
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:24,567
<i>Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me</i>

395
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,986
<i>Like days of old</i>

396
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,533
<i>Lighting the spark of love that fills me
with dreams untold</i>

397
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:34,744
Upload.

398
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:39,582
<i>...I pray for evening just to be with you</i>

399
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:44,295
<i>Together at last at twilight time</i>

400
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:54,222
<i>Together at last at twilight time</i>

401
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,689
<i>(computer bleeps)</i>

402
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:31,384
Well, if Esther wanted to leave
her body, she got her wish.

403
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:34,429
At least that part of it.

404
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,479
I wonder.

405
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:46,774
Mulder, she's dead.

406
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,905
What if she managed to establish an uplink,
Scully? A satellite transmission?

407
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:57,034
<i>(Scully) Mulder, are you telling me
you believe that Esther may not be dead?</i>

408
00:42:57,118 --> 00:43:02,331
<i>(Mulder) Artificial life. It could exist.
It could be here among us, evolving.</i>

409
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:07,503
<i>(Scully) Electrons chasing each other
through a circuit? That isn't life, Mulder.</i>

410
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,589
<i>(Mulder) But what are we but impulses,</i>

411
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:12,341
<i>electrical and chemical,
through a bag of meat and bones?</i>

412
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:15,136
<i>You're the scientist. You tell me.</i>

413
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,907
You did it now, Harley!

414
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:45,082
- You get it.
- Uh-uh.

415
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,668
They'll get ya if you go in there!

416
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,631
Momma says no one lives in there.
