No, it had something
called hypertrichosis lanuginosa.

It's a rare hereditary condition,

in some South American families.

00:05:55,857 --> 00:06:00,195
Uh, Mrs Berkowitz,
you said that you also had a son?

68
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,614
Mm-hm. Izzy. That's him there.

69
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:09,371
And Izzy is the product of
your union with some kind of intruder?

70
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:13,041
I don't know about no "union",
but I sure woke up in a condition.

71
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,378
- Did you report this to the police?
- Of course I did.

72
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,630
Was there an investigation?

73
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:21,841
Not really.
Nobody here ever locks their doors.

74
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:25,262
And it took me a month or two
to figure it out - that I was pregnant.

75
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,347
And now you're pregnant again?

76
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,435
Uh-huh. But as I told Agent Mulder
on the phone, that's what takes the cake.

77

Mrs Berkowitz had
a tubal ligation two years ago.

00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:47,242
Took me two days
of scrubbin' to clean the skillet.

00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:52,539
I don't know how many
of 'em there were. I only saw one,

82
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,666
but they ate a whole jar of peanut butter.

83
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,377
You were gone three days,
but nobody missed you?

84
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,964
- I know what you're thinkin'.
- Do you drink, Mrs Berkowitz?

85
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:05,635
No. But I'm not so sure my intruders,
as you call 'em, didn't have a few.

86
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:10,765
Somebody set a tumbler here
and didn't use no coaster.

87
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,477
That's a family heirloom, too.

88
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:17,188
Is there no chance
your son could've put it there?

89
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:21,401
Izzy's got more brains than that.
Not much more, but he values his life.

90
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,154
That pigsty there's his room.

91
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:30,619
You know what this thing is,
don't you, Agent Mulder?

92
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:34,372
- Why do you say that?
- Because. You're all quiet and stuff.

93
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:39,002
And you know somethin'
you're not sayin' - about alien abductions.

94
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:42,130
They said on <i>Jerry</i> Springer
you're, like, an expert.

95
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:45,967
Well, I don't think this has
anything to do with alien abductions.

00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:49,888

- Oh, come on!

- Really?
- Mrs Berkowitz?

98
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,435
You gave a description of the intruder,

99
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:58,104
saying he had a gross face
and lumps on his head?

100
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,815
And two mouths.
I don't know if I mentioned that.

That's the Great Mutato.

You've seen the Great Mutato?

112
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:46,986
Yeah. A lot of people around here have.

113
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,240
Has it crossed neither of your minds
that what you say you saw

114
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:53,660
fits perfectly with
this creature that your son created?

115
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,829
Well, yeah, but...

116
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:59,290
that don't mean it didn't happen.

Why are you humouring them, Mulder?

121
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,816
I'm not, Scully. This is a very serious crime.

122
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,696
So is perjury. So is calling out
FBI agents under false pretenses.

123
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,657
- For the purpose of what?
- Isn't it obvious?

124
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:36,995
I think what we're seeing here
is an example of a culture

125
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,123
for whom daytime talk shows
and tabloid headlines

126
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:43,752
have become a reality
against which they measure their lives.

127
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:47,547
A culture so obsessed by the media
and a chance for self-dramatisation

128
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,966
that they'll do anything
to gain a spotlight.

129
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,720
I am alarmed that you would reduce
these people to a cultural stereotype.

Not everybody's dream

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,144
Psychologists often speak of
the denial of an unthinkable evil

132
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,855
or a misplacement of shared fears.

- What achievements are those?
- What makes you think you'd understand?

160
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,251
Well, I'm a scientist, for one.

Then you probably know that once
in a generation, perhaps once in a lifetime,

as a visionary leader of men, yes?

167
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:57,070
What do you want me
to do with these, Dr Polidori?

168
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:03,493
Never mind.

169
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:06,663
What is the homeotic hox gene?

170
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:11,459
She's a scientist. Ask her.

171
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:18,591
I, uh... I believe that it has something
to do with, um... growth and development.

172
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:21,678
If you two will excuse me,
I don't have time for this.

173
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:25,556
I have to travel to the University
of lngolstadt to deliver an address.

174
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,851
Sir, unless you want
your scientific achievements

175
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:31,229
to end up as a footnote
on the <i>Jerry</i> Springer Show,

176
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:34,232
I suggest that you make the time.

177
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,778
<i>Jerry Springer Show?</i>

178
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:42,907
Witness the morphogenesis of drosophila.

179
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:46,452
The fruit fly.

180
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:50,123
What you are watching
has been going on for millennia -

181
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:53,793
since the Cambrian period
some 580 million short years ago,

182
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,712
when drosophila was first born.

183
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,423
See the elegant symmetry
with which the pupa grows

184
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:01,426
into a series of beautiful segments.

185
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:06,014
What we have found...

186
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:08,474
what I have found

187
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:11,894
is that these segments
represent a linear model

188
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:15,023
for the genetic development
of our friend the fly.

189
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,608
Each gene is responsible

190
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,694
for the development
of its corresponding segment-

191
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:22,947
the legs, the mouth,
the body, posterior and anterior -

192
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,454
but which I, through my genius,
can alter into a creation of my own.

193
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:34,042
Behold, proboscopedia.

194
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,219
This fly has legs...

195
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,513
Growing out of his mouth.

196
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,853
Why would you do that?

197
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,439
Because I can.

198
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,567
Could that be done in humans?

199
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,403
That would go against
every scientific convention.

200
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:04,947
But could it be done?

201
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,116
Theoretically.

202
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:19,962
Good night, Dr Frankenstein.

203
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:24,050
Despite what you might think, Mulder,

204
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,637
designer mutations like these
are virtually impossible on humans.

205
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,973
- That's not what I just heard.
- Mulder, even if they could,

206
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:35,144
no scientist would even dare to perform
these kind of experiments on a human.

207
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:39,398
- Well, then, why do them at all?
- To... unlock the mysteries of genetics.

208
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,318
To understand why,
even though we share the same genes,

209
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,737
we develop arms instead of wings,

210
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:48,741
we become humans instead of flies,
or monsters.

211
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,913
But given the power, who could resist the
temptation to create life in his own image?

212
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:58,376
We already have that ability, Mulder.
It's called procreation.

213
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,128
And first thing tomorrow morning,

214
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:03,631
I'm gonna verify the pregnancy
of Shaineh Berkowitz.

215
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:22,900
- When are you 00min' home again?
- Huh?

216
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:25,486
- When are you 00min' home again?
- What?

217
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,364
- We were gonna have that talk.
- Soon.

218
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,951
- Soon. We'll have our talk soon.
- That's what you always say.

219
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:35,079
Elizabeth, you know
how I feel about children.

220
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:40,418
- They're mewling little monsters.
- But I want children.

221
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,296
What happened to our dream?

222
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,425
Of getting out of this place,
getting away from this hick town?

223
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,844
I think that's your dream.

224
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,723
Elizabeth, what do you want?
A baby? Or a Nobel prize?

225
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:58,811
See you on Thursday.

226
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,879

Biscuits, fritters, grits, flapjacks,
eggs - boiled, scrambled, poached and fried.

229
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,030
We got some monster grapefruits
on the way.

230
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:34,949
Bigger than your head, almost.

231
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,618
I'd... I'd just like some coffee, thanks.

232
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:40,329
On the house. Compliments of JJ.

233
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,957
That's with two Js.

234
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,179
Is it true Jerry Springer's comin' to town?

235
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,650
We've been had.

236
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:12,028
I'll save you the trouble of reading it.

237
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:16,657
It has everything that
we talked about last night. Word for word.

238
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,493
Izzy Berkowitz!

239
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:23,706
- Get your butt front and centre!
- What did I do?

240
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:28,127
All I can say is, I hope
the answer to that question is nothin'.

241
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,173
We believe you or one of your friends
recorded our conversation last night

242
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,884
- and gave it to a newspaper reporter.
- Me?

243
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,262
In order to promote your
comic-book monster that you created.

244
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,890
- Do you own a tape recorder, Izzy?
- Uh...

245
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,434

Something recorded its voice on this.

265
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,607
What, do you think that Dr Polidori
had something to do with it?

266
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:17,570
When Victor Frankenstein asks
"Whence did the principle of life proceed?"

267
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:21,699
and as the gratifying summit to his toils
creates a hideous phantasm of a man,

268
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:25,453
he prefigures the postmodern Prometheus,
the genetic engineer,

269
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:29,165
whose power to reanimate
matter, genes, into life, us,

270
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,959
is only as limited as his imagination is.

271
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:36,005
Mulder, I'm alarmed that you would
reduce this man to a literary stereotype.

272
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,007
A mad scientist.

273
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,511
Who else would go to such trouble
to impregnate Shaineh Berkowitz?

274
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,820
I mean, I have to admit, Mulder,
everything looks in order.

275
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:03,240
Mrs Berkowitz had a tubal ligation in 1993,

276
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:08,412
and two months ago she had two
pregnancy tests, both with positive results.

277
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:12,541
What are you doing?

278
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,589
Mrs Berkowitz said
that when she saw her intruder,

279
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,258
there was a gaseous white cloud.

280
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:25,387
Then, when she woke up three days later,
nobody knew that she'd been gone.

281
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,556
Yeah. So?

Here's your monster.

352
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:40,572
His name... is Izzy Berkowitz!

- String him up!

354

Get your hands off him!

00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:49,164
- You let him go.
- I intercepted a package.

Your kid's a monster!

That is my son you're talkin' about!

359
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,514
What if somebody talked about you
like that?

360
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:08,141
- Mulder?
- You may have been right, Scully.

361
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:11,103
What, that they
can be reduced to cultural stereotypes?

362
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:14,022
- They unmasked the monster.
- Don't start that with me.

363
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:16,483
I may have found
something saying otherwise.

364
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:19,778
The residue on the frying pan
was an agricultural product,

365
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,781
used to anaesthetise herds of animals.

366
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,825
- Used by who?
- Farmers,

who must register with the FDA
even to have it in their possession.

368

- Mm-hm.

But I would like to explain myself.

428
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:12,810
Despite my appearance, which you see
is quite horrible to the human senses,

429
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:16,898
I... have never acted to harm another soul.

430
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:20,693
- These are fiendish lies.
- Quiet.

431
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,076
25 years ago,

432
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,954
my father, having only one son -

433
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:37,877
a spiteful, hateful man of science,
incapable of the deeper sentiments -

434
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:45,385
he came to realise that this son
had been conducting secret experiments,

435
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:49,264
of which I was the most
unfortunate product.

436
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,766
<i>(crowd gasps)</i>

437
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:59,065
A simple man, he rescued me
and loved me in spite of my deformities.

438
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,070
But as time passed,
I grew restless for friends of my own.

439
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:08,825
Because I couldn't
go to school or play sports,

440
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:12,245
or even show my face outside this farm,

441
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,708
my father set out to learn his son's science,

442
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:21,045
so that before he died
he might create for me a mate.

443
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,007
Uh-oh.

444
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:27,468
Alas, my father was a simple man,

445
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:34,267
his heart close to the soil
he worked, the animals he tended.

446
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:40,189
The experiments he attempted,
too advanced.

447
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:43,776
The science, too complex
for his understanding.

448
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,864
The results of his experiments,
unsatisfactory.

449
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:00,585
I still... You mean lzzy...?

450
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,963
But who's the father?

451
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:11,512
Suffice to say, his experiments failed.

452
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:15,308
My father is dead.

453
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:24,275
I am alone and miserable.

454
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,946
But one as deformed and horrible as myself
would not deny herself to me.

455
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:35,495
If this being you can create,
then I will take blame as a murderer.

456
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,166
I don't know how to recreate you.

457
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:46,005
You were a mistake.

458
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,138
What we did was wrong.

459
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:58,017
But in our trespasses,
we gave you a loving son.

460
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:02,980
And in your homes,

461
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:06,067
I went places I'd never dreamed of.

462
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:12,198
With your books and your records and your
home media centres, I learned of the world,

463
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,911
and of a mother's love that I'll never know.

464
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,086
Cher loved that boy so much.
