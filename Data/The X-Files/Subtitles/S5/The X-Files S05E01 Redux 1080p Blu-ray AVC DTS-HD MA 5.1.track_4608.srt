1
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:05,591
- <i>Last season on "The X-Files":</i>
- <i>We</i> have <i>the complete corpus</i>

2
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:10,262
of an extraterrestrial biological entity.
The ice-core samples I took can't be faked.

3
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:12,514
(Mulder) I refuse to believe it's not true.

4
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:16,852
- So you're saying it's all been a hoax.
- Which you've been used to perpetuate.

5
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:21,773
- (gunshot)
- He said that the men behind this hoax

6
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:24,359
gave me this disease to make you believe.

7
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:27,863
Early this morning,

8
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:32,826
I got a call from the police, asking me
to come to Agent Mulder's apartment.

9
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:36,955
The detective asked me...

10
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,502
He needed me to identify a body.

11
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:45,589
Agent Scully...

12
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:57,976
Agent Mulder died late last night

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,897
from an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.

14
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,613
<i>(man) When we speak of life beyond Earth,</i>

15
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:15,202
<i>what we generally mean is intelligent life,
something resembling our noble selves.</i>

16
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,538
<i>It is highly probable</i>

17
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:24,378
<i>that there are such intelligent forms
of life in other galaxies in the universe.</i>

18
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:27,839
<i>And it is even more probable
that many of these forms</i>

19
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,884
<i>are vastly more intelligent than we.</i>

20
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:35,097
<i>(Mulder) I have held a torch in the
darkness to glance upon a truth unknown.</i>

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,808
<i>An act of faith begun
with an ineloquent certainty</i>

22
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,980
<i>that my journey promised the chance
not just of understanding but of recovery,</i>

23
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:48,402
<i>that the disappearance of my sister
23 years ago would come to be explained,</i>

24
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:52,281
<i>and that the pursuit of these greater
truths about extraterrestrial life</i>

25
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:54,700
<i>might even reunite us.</i>

26
00:01:54,783 --> 00:02:00,247
<i>A belief which I now know to be false,
and uninformed in the extreme.</i>

27
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,004
<i>My folly revealed by facts which illuminate
both my arrogance and self-deception.</i>

28
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,548
<i>If only the tragedy had been mine alone,</i>

29
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:13,844
<i>it might have been more easy tonight
to bring this journey to its end.</i>

30
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,516
<i>(Phone)</i>

31
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,443
<i>(man) Agent Mulder?</i>

32
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:33,655
<i>Agent Mulder?</i>

33
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:34,781
Yeah.

34
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:39,119
<i>There's a matter of security I hadn't
anticipated. Just after I left your...</i>

35
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:43,832
- Who are you?
- Just after our last conversation I was...

36
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:48,503
<i>- Who are you?
- Are you listening? Are you hearing me?</i>

37
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:50,922
<i>We can't speak right now. I believe...</i>

38
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:55,886
Did they give Agent Scully this disease?
Did they do this to her because of me?

39
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:58,597
They may be listening, Agent Mulder.

40
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:02,976
<i>They may be watching
everything you do and say.</i>

41
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,397
<i>Are you listening, Agent Mulder?</i>

42
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,275
<i>Agent Mulder?</i>

43
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:13,236
<i>Agent Mulder?</i>

44
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,381
Put that out! Back away!

45
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,550
Get away.

46
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,766
<i>(gunshot)</i>

47
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:55,755
<i>(Dew)</i>

48
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,594
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

49
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:13,148
(man) Keep going, FBI woman.

50
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:19,863
Mulder? What are you doing? Why are
you sitting in my bedroom in the dark?

51
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,617
It was too crowded in my
apartment. I couldn't sleep.

52
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,245
- I'm not kidding, Mulder.
- Good, cos neither am l.

53
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,372
There's a dead man in my apartment.

54
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:32,292
It's only a matter of time
before he stinks the place up.

55
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,504
What are you talking about,
Mulder? What's going on?

56
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:40,008
Somebody thinks my life
is interesting enough to video.

57
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:44,930
My apartment's been under surveillance
for at least two months. Look at this.

58
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,225
Courtesy of the US government.

59
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:52,103
- That's the dead man in your apartment?
- Yeah. He works...

60
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,898
He worked for the Department of Defense.

61
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:58,360
How did he die, Mulder?

62
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,988
Gunshot wound to the face.

63
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:03,907
Have you contacted anybody at the Bureau?

64
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,160
I can't do that. I can't go to the authorities.

65
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:11,289
- What are you talking about?
- This man Ostelhoff worked for the military.

66
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:15,377
Are you getting the picture?
Do you see what's happening here?

67
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,213
That the hoax is connected to the military.

68
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,924
This hoax, your cancer, everything.

69
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:25,428
It just doesn't lead back to the military,
it leads right back to the FBI.

70
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,640
What?

71
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:32,519
This man Ostelhoff was set up
in the apartment directly above mine.

72
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,437
I caught him destroying phone records

73
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,857
on which the same number
was called 17 times.

74
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,569
This is a PBX operator at the Bureau.

75
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,612
Yeah.

76
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:45,365
- Who would he be calling at the FBI?
- I don't know.

77
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:50,745
- Mulder, how long has this been going on?
- Maybe since you joined me on the X-Files.

78
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:54,374
That would mean that for four years
we've been pawns in a game,

79
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,377
that it was a lie from the beginning.

80
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:02,007
Mulder, these men...
You give them your faith,

81
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,884
and you're supposed
to trust them with your life.

82
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:09,639
There are those who can be trusted. What
I need to know is who among them is not.

83
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:14,102
I will not allow this treason to prosper,
not if they've done this to you.

84
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,813
We can't go to the Bureau
making these accusations.

85
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:19,608
No. But as they lie to us, we can lie to them.

86
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,695
A lie to find the truth.

87
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:37,250
<i>(Mulder) Let the truth be known
though the heavens fall.</i>

88
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:40,253
<i>The web of lies entangling us
can now be connected back</i>

89
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:43,214
<i>to the very institution
which brought us together.</i>

90
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:48,553
<i>The facts supported by a Byzantine plot,
executed by someone inside the FBI,</i>

91
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:52,641
<i>who, if named, could be tied
to the hoax meant to destroy me...</i>

92
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:57,395
<i>and to the terminal disease
inflicted on Scully.</i>

93
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,192
<i>In four years I have shared my
partner's passionate search for the truth,</i>

94
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:04,611
<i>and if my part has been a deception,</i>

95
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:09,074
<i>I have never seen her integrity waver
or her honour compromised.</i>

96
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:12,869
<i>But now, I ask her to lie...</i>

97
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,455
<i>to the people lying to us.</i>

98
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:18,041
<i>A dangerous lie to find the truth,</i>

99
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:22,754
<i>to find the man who would be
revealed as its enemy, as our enemy...</i>

100
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:27,842
<i>as the enemy within.</i>

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,388
Agent Scully,

102
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,057
is it true?

103
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,476
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,896
- Are you all right?
- I'm, uh...

105
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,734
I don't know what to say. They asked
me to come down and identify the body.

106
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:48,029
Well, how'd you make the ID?

107
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:52,867
The word from Alexandria PD is it was
self-inflicted. A shotgun blast to the face.

108
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:58,581
I saw Mulder earlier this morning.
He was wearing the same clothes.

109
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:07,048
Well, I'm very sorry.

110
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,387
Agent Scully.

111
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,393
Section Chief Blevins
wants you in for questioning.

112
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:23,148
He believes you have information
that you haven't come forward with.

113
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:39,205
<i>(Mulder) The military connection to the
conspiracy we had pierced was undeniable.</i>

114
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:42,500
<i>The man in my apartment worked
for the Department of Defense,</i>

115
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,170
<i>at its Advanced Research Facility.</i>

116
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:48,006
<i>What I might find here I was uncertain of,</i>

117
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,468
<i>but my crime had provided me access.</i>

118
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:56,055
<i>As long as they believed Scully's lie,
that it was me lying on that floor,</i>

119
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,600
<i>I might learn truths here.</i>

120
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:03,438
<i>But if our lies were discovered, both
Scully and I would be discovered with them.</i>

121
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,861
<i>(Dew)</i>

122
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,664
Agent Scully. Please have a seat.

123
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,088
Some time has passed
since you were first here.

124
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,924
Four years.

125
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:35,512
From our reports, your work on the X-Files
brought you very close to Agent Mulder.

126
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:40,225
- Yes, sir.
- We're all sorry about what's happened.

127
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:46,481
- But that's not why I'm here.
- We've been informed by the DOD

128
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,817
that prior to Agent Mulder's accident

129
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,195
you may have been contacted
by a DOD employee.

130
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,406
Yes. That's right.

131
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,326
And that he gave you classified information.

132
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:04,999
He had information about the discovery of
what Mulder believed to be an alien corpse.

133
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,628
He, uh... he said the body
was part of a hoax.

134
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,422
He provided evidence of this?

135
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:14,759
No hard evidence, no.

136
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:20,265
Agent Scully, I suggest you
tell us everything you know.

137
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:24,602
If you have any knowledge of this man,
you should speak up now.

138
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:27,397
- What knowledge?
- His name.

139
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:37,657
Whatever you're withholding,

140
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,369
you'll be asked to explain yourself tonight

141
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:45,248
at a joint FBI panel I've asked
assembled on this matter.

142
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,211
Is this the man? Michael Kritschgau?

143
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,845
Yes.

144
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,623
Hey.

145
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:29,792
- How'd you get in here?
- Through the front door.

146
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,088
- You can't bypass security.
- You can when you have the card.

147
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,342
Put that away. Put it away.

148
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:41,179
You knew my apartment
was being surveilled. How?

149
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:46,017
Come with me.

150
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:59,155
I was followed from your apartment
the night we spoke.

151
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:03,242
Someone at the FBI is involved.
This man Ostelhoff was the contact...

152
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,536
How did you get his card?

153
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,624
I found it on a dead man.

154
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,252
You know what that is?

155
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,923
What you have in your hand?
It gives you level-four clearance.

156
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:20,259
Level-four clearance? I get
to dine at the Officers' Club?

157
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:24,180
You have access to everything.
Things that I can only tell you about.

158
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,934
- I need to know who did this to Scully.
- Which you can have.

159
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:31,062
- What you may find is much more than that.
- What?

160
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,607
What you want most desperately of all.

161
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,903
The cure for Scully's cancer?

162
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,167
<i>Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>

163
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,337
- Communication Center, please.
- One <i>moment.</i>

164
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:24,092
<i>- Communications. Holly.
- It's Dana Scully.</i>

165
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:27,178
Dana, I'm so sorry about
what's happened. I just heard.

166
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:32,892
I need your help on something. I was hoping
that you could help with some information.

167
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:37,647
- Sure. What do you need?
- I have some calls placed to the Bureau,

168
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,484
on the sixth, seventh, eighth,
ninth and tenth.

169
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:43,986
They came in to the PBX operator.

170
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:47,698
<i>The first was at 11:21.</i>

171
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:51,369
<i>The next at 11:14, 3:07,</i>

172
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,330
2202 and 5212.

173
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:57,750
<i>They would have all gone
to the same extension.</i>

174
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:01,504
- And you're looking for that extension?
- Yes.

175
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:08,427
I got five calls matching the times and dates
transferred to an executive-level extension.

176
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,806
- Whose?
- It could be anyone at that level.

177
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:17,645
Would Assistant Director Skinner
be at that extension?

178
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,696
Yes.

179
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,494
- Thank <i>you.</i>
<i>- OK. You take care now, Dana.</i>

180
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,751
<i>(Phone)</i>

181
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,796
Yes?

182
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,882
<i>- (man) Special Agent Scully?
- Yes.</i>

183
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:50,261
This is Dr Vitagliano at the Paleoclimatology
Department at American University.

184
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,931
You'd asked me to look into
these ice-core samples for you.

185
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,851
Right. I'm sorry that I
haven't gotten back to you.

186
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,395
You might wanna come down to the lab.

187
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:03,024
<i>There's something I know you're
gonna want to see for yourself.</i>

188
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:09,780
- What am I looking for?
- Level four is a biological quarantine wing.

189
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:12,491
It houses a series of labs
and medical facilities

190
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:16,787
in an elaborate system for the
storage of vast quantities of DNA.

191
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:20,958
- DNA from whom?
- Virtually every American born since 1945.

192
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:26,047
Every immigrant, every indigenous person
who's given blood to a government doctor.

193
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,675
This is what I told you. This is the
hoax into which you've been drawn.

194
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,637
The roots go back 50 years
to the end of World War ll.

195
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,556
Playing on a national
appetite for bogus revelation

196
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,768
and a public newly fearful
of the atom bomb,

197
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:44,232
the US military command fanned the flames
of what were called "flying saucer" stories.

198
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,776
There are truths which can kill a nation.

199
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:50,738
The military needed something to deflect
attention away from its arms strategy:

200
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,784
global domination through the
capability of total enemy annihilation.

201
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,578
The nuclear card was fine
if we alone could play it,

202
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:01,249
but the generals knew they could
not win a public-relations war.

203
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:06,087
Those photos from Hiroshima were not
faces Americans wanted to see in a mirror.

204
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,881
Oppenheimer knew it,
but we silenced him.

205
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:13,761
When the Russians developed the bomb,
the fear in the military was for armistice.

206
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,807
The business of America
isn't business, it's war.

207
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,977
Since Antietam nothing has
driven the economy faster.

208
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,396
We needed a reason
to keep spending money.

209
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,691
If there wasn't a war,
we called it war anyway.

210
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:30,152
The Cold War was essentially
a 50-year public-relations battle,

211
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:33,823
a pitched game of chicken against
an enemy we only called names.

212
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:36,075
The Communists called us
a few names, too.

213
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,661
"We will bury you", Khrushchev said.

214
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:43,165
The public believed it. After what McCarthy
had done, they ate it with a big spoon.

215
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:46,294
We squared off a few times,
in Cuba, Korea and Vietnam.

216
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:51,215
- Nobody dropped the bomb. Nobody dared.
- What has this to do with flying saucers?

217
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,094
The US military saw a good thing
in '47 when the Roswell story broke.

218
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:59,348
The more we denied it, the more people
believed it was true. Aliens had landed:

219
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:03,936
a made-to-order cover story for generals
looking to develop the national war chest.

220
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,108
They opened investigations called Grudge,
Twinkle, Project "Blue Book", Majestic 12.

221
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,402
They brought in professors, congressmen,

222
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:16,490
fed them enough bogus facts, fuzzy photos
and eyewitnesses that they believed it, too.

223
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:19,535
They'd even hooked
Doug MacArthur, for God's sake.

224
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,288
I can't tell you how fortuitous
the timing was.

225
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,459
You know when the first
supersonic flight was? 1947.

226
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:30,296
Soon every experimental aircraft
being flown was a UFO sighting.

227
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,466
When the abduction stories
started up, it was too perfect.

228
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,970
We'd almost gotten caught in Korea,
a misstep. China and the Soviets knew it.

229
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:39,889
The UN got heated up.

230
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,976
Germ warfare. We were
accused of using it on the Koreans.

231
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:51,442
It was developmental, nothing like
what we and the Russians have now.

232
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:55,988
The bio-weapons used in the Gulf War were
so ingenious as to be almost undetectable.

233
00:19:56,072 --> 00:20:00,659
- Developed right in this very building.
- And these abductions, they've been lies?

234
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:05,247
Not lies, exactly. But citizens
taken unsuspecting and tested.

235
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:09,210
A classified military project
above top-secret and still ongoing.

236
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:13,214
You've heard the recent denials about
Roswell by the military and the CIA?

237
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,759
What's been the effect? Even
wilder and more widespread belief.

238
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,929
The American appetite
for bogus revelation.

239
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,974
But I've seen aliens.
I've witnessed these things.

240
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,977
You've seen what they wanted you to see.

241
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,238
The line between science and science fiction
doesn't exist. This is about control,

242
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:41,033
of the very elements of life - DNA.
Yours, mine, everyone's.

243
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:42,576
Then why a hoax?

244
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,996
Why create hard evidence,
an alien body that could be disproved?

245
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,749
The body you found
was so good, so believable,

246
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,586
that only a scientific examination
would have proven the fraud.

247
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,172
Scully would have known.

248
00:20:55,256 --> 00:21:00,261
The hoax was planned so that Agent Scully
wouldn't be alive to do an examination.

249
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:05,224
You went along with all this.
You let them do this to Scully.

250
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,603
I paid the price, Agent Mulder.

251
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:13,274
When my son came back sick from
the Gulf War, that was my retribution.

252
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,193
I'm helping you now, but not unselfishly.

253
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:19,321
Do you believe there's
a cure for him in here, too?

254
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,949
I have to think there is.

255
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,878
<i>(Dew)</i>

256
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,891
Michael Kritschgau, may we talk to you?

257
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,894
- What about?
- DOD is detaining you for questioning.

258
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,646
Would you come with us, Mr Kritschgau?

259
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,649
Sir?

260
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,888
I was told that you needed to see me.
That there was some urgency.

261
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,143
- It seems I've been left out of the loop.
- Left out?

262
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:36,440
You were watching Mulder.
You had a man on him.

263
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,611
No one bothered to inform me of this.

264
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,448
I know nothing about a man.

265
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:47,826
I will not be cut out like this!

266
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,538
You need my expertise.

267
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,918
Is this being run from DOD?

268
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,004
If it is, I'm unaware of it.

269
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:04,343
I've always kept Mulder in check.

270
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,346
I put this whole thing together.
I created Mulder.

271
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,682
Agent Mulder is dead.

272
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,227
Our FBI source confirmed it this morning.

273
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,649
Mulder killed himself.

274
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:24,321
Mulder was an asset. Without his partner,
we may have underestimated his fragility.

275
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:27,074
I've never underestimated Mulder.

276
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,746
I still don't.

277
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,597
As you'd asked, I've tested
some of the cellular material

278
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,683
found in the ice-core sample.

279
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,270
Because we couldn't identify it
as either plant or animal,

280
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,356
only as some kind of chimeric hybrid,

281
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,235
I put some of the cells in media
containing foetal bovine serum.

282
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,029
The cells began to divide.

283
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,906
Then they were animal cells that you found.

284
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:13,287
- They are not classifiable.
- You said there was mitotic cell division.

285
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,290
When the cells began to divide
they didn't just multiply.

286
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:21,462
They began to go through the
stages of morula, blastula, gastrula.

287
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:26,008
- They began somatic development?
- The beginning of a life form.

288
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:36,101
Growing into what... I don't know.

289
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:45,152
<i>(Mulder) I had come here
looking for answers,</i>

290
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:49,823
<i>hoping not only to lay bare this conspiracy
against the country and the men behind it,</i>

291
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:55,329
<i>but to finally learn the truth about the
possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life.</i>

292
00:24:55,412 --> 00:25:00,793
<i>Now, with what I've heard, my beliefs
seem more and more improbable.</i>

293
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,295
<i>The possibility of a cure for Scully</i>

294
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:06,048
<i>somewhere inside these walls,
my only hope.</i>

295
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,928
<i>But if I might find it and somehow save her,</i>

296
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:15,015
<i>the very existence of this cure
would mean with certainty</i>

297
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:18,394
<i>that I have believed in a lie from the start.</i>

298
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,502
<i>(Click)</i>

299
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:39,683
<i>(Scully) I had no way to reach Agent Mulder,
to tell him what I had discovered:</i>

300
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,227
<i>an unidentified microscopic life form,</i>

301
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:46,690
<i>whose very existence held
the possibility of revelation.</i>

302
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:51,737
<i>Was this organism, extracted from the ice
which had entombed the alien corpse,</i>

303
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,533
<i>the germ cell that might give
proof of extraterrestrial life?</i>

304
00:26:56,617 --> 00:27:02,498
<i>Or was it just the opposite: the scientifically
engineered creation of a chimera,</i>

305
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:08,170
<i>an unclassifiable biological product
designed to set up a hoax,</i>

306
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:12,633
<i>manufactured to create the false beliefs
that have long driven Agent Mulder?</i>

307
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,638
<i>I now began to realise
that the answer to this question</i>

308
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:21,141
<i>might exist within the life form itself.</i>

309
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:25,979
<i>Biological proof of its connection
to the cancer invading my body,</i>

310
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:29,024
<i>to a virus living inside this organism</i>

311
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:32,986
<i>to which I had been exposed
during my abduction three years ago.</i>

312
00:27:57,135 --> 00:28:00,472
- I'm not sure what you hope to find.
- I need to do a Southern blot,

313
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:04,142
to run the culture that you
showed me against my own DNA.

314
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:07,771
You said that the unclassified cells
you saw were full of virus.

315
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,524
Right. What are you looking for?

316
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:14,695
A match. And I need it before seven.

317
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,572
Tonight?

318
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:21,285
Not gonna happen. Not unless
we have a blazing-hot probe.

319
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,704
It's got to happen.

320
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:27,457
Everything in my life depends on it.

321
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,936
- What are you doing?
- I was gonna ask you the same.

322
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,439
No, you weren't. You followed me here.

323
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:54,610
Why are you following me? Is this more
dirty work you're doing for the DOD?

324
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,571
Why don't you tell me
what you're doing here?

325
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:00,198
- I want an answer from you.
- I want an answer from you!

326
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:03,493
- This isn't your job!
- My job is to direct the agents under me.

327
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:07,497
To question their motives when
they're lying about investigations.

328
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:11,001
To take steps to cease
or censure those actions.

329
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:16,131
- Your lying is on record.
- And what about yours?

330
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:21,094
I have the pathology and forensics reports
for the body found in Mulder's apartment.

331
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:27,392
Now, you have to answer
for yourself in five hours.

332
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:31,313
As you compound the lies, you
compound the consequences for them.

333
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:34,191
All lies lead to the truth. Isn't that right?

334
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,736
And what about your lie, Agent Scully?
What does it lead to?

335
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:41,865
The truth. About the men
behind what happened to me.

336
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,242
About my abduction and the tests.

337
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:47,079
About being exposed to
something against my will.

338
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:51,208
About being put on a table and
having something implanted in me,

339
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,793
then having my memory stolen,

340
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,254
only to have it returned along with
a disease I was given.

341
00:29:56,338 --> 00:30:00,676
Is that yourjustification? Is that
what you'll tell the joint panel tonight?

342
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,471
- Are you afraid of that?
- Well, considering the dead man

343
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:09,142
was murdered in cold blood and you
wilfully misidentified him, yes, I am afraid.

344
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:14,272
- But I'm only afraid for you.
- You're gonna use that against me.

345
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:19,111
You're gonna use me as I've been
used all along, to preserve the lies.

346
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,279
Where is Agent Mulder?

347
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,787
Your silence won't save you.

348
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:35,085
Not with these people. And if you lie,
I don't know if anything can.

349
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,088
Except proof.

350
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:47,222
<i>(Scully) The cruellest ironies are those
consecrated by the passage of time,</i>

351
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:51,059
<i>chanced and occasioned
by shocking discovery.</i>

352
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:57,691
<i>I had joined Mulder on the X-Files because
of my background in the medical sciences.</i>

353
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,319
<i>My assignment was to question his work,</i>

354
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:06,867
<i>to debunk his investigations and
rein him back into the FBI mainstream.</i>

355
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:12,622
<i>Now, as fate would have it,
I am calling on these very same skills</i>

356
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,709
<i>to prove that he has been
the target of a scheme</i>

357
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:19,546
<i>orchestrated by someone
close to us in the FBI.</i>

358
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,592
<i>Someone we have trusted above all others,</i>

359
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:29,056
<i>involved in a highly organised plot to keep
a dangerous secret from the light of day.</i>

360
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:35,020
<i>I could only guess at what Agent Mulder
may have uncovered on his own,</i>

361
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,647
<i>what he may have found to confirm or deny</i>

362
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:41,610
<i>what he has long held to be a conspiracy
to control the public inquiry</i>

363
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:46,823
<i>into the government's knowledge
and contact with an alien race or races.</i>

364
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,534
<i>If he had hoped, as I do,</i>

365
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:53,497
<i>to learn the identity of those
who sought to destroy us,</i>

366
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,793
<i>I had, with the discovery of
this unidentified microorganism,</i>

367
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,504
<i>what could amount to forensic evidence.</i>

368
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:07,511
<i>Hard and undeniable genetic evidence
of a connection between the conspirators</i>

369
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:12,432
<i>and the cancer which has now
metastasised in my bloodstream.</i>

370
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,730
<i>(Dew)</i>

371
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,123
<i>I have few short hours
to conduct these tests</i>

372
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:40,377
<i>before I must appear before
an FBI panel to explain myself.</i>

373
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:45,549
<i>And as I am ready to lie to them
about Agent Mulder,</i>

374
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:49,094
<i>I am also ready to confront them with proof.</i>

375
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:52,055
<i>Proof extracted from this tiny organism</i>

376
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:56,434
<i>that could blow open a conspiracy
of global consequence.</i>

377
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:02,566
<i>(Mulder) If Scully and I were led to believe
that the conspiracy meant to destroy us</i>

378
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,235
<i>has its roots in the Department of Defense,</i>

379
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:08,530
<i>that fact seems all but irrefutable now.</i>

380
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:14,119
<i>I had entered a storage facility by a hallway
connecting underground to the Pentagon.</i>

381
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:17,789
<i>On hundreds of shelves are materials
that reveal nothing</i>

382
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:20,208
<i>of the cure for Scully's cancer.</i>

383
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,420
<i>And now, as I have reached
the terminus of this space,</i>

384
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,922
<i>what appears to be an old filing system</i>

385
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:31,261
<i>seems my only hope of finding what this
man Kritschgau has assured me exists.</i>

386
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,848
<i>If his own desperate hope for
his son's cure has eluded him,</i>

387
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,601
<i>I now share his desperation.</i>

388
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,478
<i>But among these drawers
is a sign, a glimmer,</i>

389
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:44,941
<i>some small confirmation that
the journey which has brought me here</i>

390
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,527
<i>has not been in vain.</i>

391
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,516
<i>(Phone)</i>

392
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,021
Yes?

393
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,900
I had orders to contact you if
Scott Ostelhoff entered the building.

394
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,072
- Is he there?
- His key card was scanned at level four.

395
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:36,159
He used the subterranean access
to breach the Pentagon.

396
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:40,705
- <i>Are you sure</i> it's him?
<i>- I can't ascertain that.</i>

397
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:44,584
- <i>Do you want me</i> to <i>apprehend him?</i>
- <i>Don't do or say anything.</i>

398
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,170
I'm on my way.

399
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:58,098
<i>(Scully) If my work with Agent Mulder
has tested the foundation of my beliefs,</i>

400
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:02,352
<i>science has been, and continues
to be, my guiding light.</i>

401
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:09,025
<i>Now I am again relying on its familiar and
systematic methods to arrive at a truth,</i>

402
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:12,737
<i>a fact that might explain
the fate that has befallen me.</i>

403
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:17,659
<i>An investigation that began without,
now turning within.</i>

404
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,414
<i>Taking cellular material
from the unidentified life form</i>

405
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:25,166
<i>and isolating a virus contained within it,</i>

406
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,335
<i>then matching the DNA from this virus</i>

407
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,463
<i>against that which I believe
has caused my cancer,</i>

408
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,757
<i>I hope a picture will develop.</i>

409
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,593
<i>A picture that might confirm
my darkest suspicions</i>

410
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:39,139
<i>about the source of this
disease invading my body,</i>

411
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:43,059
<i>in hope of providing evidence
that its cause is not without blame,</i>

412
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,645
<i>even though its cure remains unknown.</i>

413
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:49,190
<i>If science serves me to these ends,</i>

414
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:54,487
<i>it is not lost on me that the tool which
I have come to depend on absolutely</i>

415
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,490
<i>cannot save or protect me,</i>

416
00:35:57,574 --> 00:36:01,536
<i>but only bring into focus
the darkness that lies ahead.</i>

417
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,026
There it is.

418
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,278
I don't understand.

419
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:39,032
My DNA hybridised with the
viral DNA from the cell culture.

420
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:45,372
But that means the material
from the ice-core sample...

421
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:49,626
You'd have to have DNA from the
unclassified chimera cells in your own body.

422
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,837
- I know.
- But how? And how did you know?

423
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,718
I believe that I was exposed to this material
and it is responsible for giving me an illness.

424
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,179
What kind of illness?

425
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,016
One which cannot be cured.

426
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,044
<i>(Mulder) If I had the cure for Scully's cancer,</i>

427
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:36,548
<i>I was now as dependent
on her as she was on me.</i>

428
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:41,052
<i>As I had breached this facility,
I needed to find my way out to safety,</i>

429
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,805
<i>depending on Scully to weave her story,</i>

430
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:48,226
<i>to tell her tale, to make them believe the lie.</i>

431
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:54,232
- <i>(Blevins)</i> Agent Scully, please have a seat.
- Thank you.

432
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:04,617
Agent Scully, we've had a brief discussion,

433
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,288
but will you restate the matter
we're here to put to rest?

434
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,457
Yes, sir.

435
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,502
Four years ago,

436
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:19,299
Section Chief Blevins assigned me
to a project you all know as the X-Files.

437
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:24,637
As I am a medical doctor,
with a background in hard science,

438
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:28,600
my job was to provide
an analytical perspective

439
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:31,978
on the work of Special Agent Fox Mulder,

440
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:36,357
whose investigations into the paranormal

441
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:39,110
were fuelled by a personal belief

442
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:43,865
that his sister had been abducted
by aliens when he was 12.

443
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,620
I come here today, four years later...

444
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:54,959
to report on the illegitimacy
of Agent Mulder's work.

445
00:38:56,794 --> 00:39:00,465
That it is my scientific opinion

446
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:05,094
that he became, through the
course of these years, a victim...

447
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:10,475
a victim of his own false hopes

448
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:14,103
and of his belief in the biggest of lies.

449
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:18,775
You were contacted by a man who claimed
he worked for the Department of Defense,

450
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:23,780
a Michael Kritschgau, who told you
that Mulder had been taken in by a hoax.

451
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:25,448
Yes, sir.

452
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:29,244
<i>He told me a story
which detailed, point by point,</i>

453
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:34,666
<i>the systematic way in which Agent Mulder
had been deceived and used.</i>

454
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,796
<i>And how I, as his partner,
had been led down the same path,</i>

455
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,049
<i>losing a family member
due to my allegiance</i>

456
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,343
<i>and contracting a fatal disease,</i>

457
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:51,307
<i>which I was being told was engineered by
the men responsible for Mulder's deception.</i>

458
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,977
<i>(Blevins) Could you
convince Mulder of this?</i>

459
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:58,606
<i>What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder,
what I had only just learned myself,</i>

460
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,821
was that the cancer, diagnosed in me
several months earlier, had metastasised.

461
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,575
And the doctors told me, short of a miracle,

462
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:13,037
it would continue to
aggressively invade my body,

463
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:17,917
advancing faster each day
towards the inevitable.

464
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,003
<i>(door opens)</i>

465
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,032
<i>(Dew)</i>

466
00:40:57,123 --> 00:41:01,085
- I'll have Security stop him at the entrance.
- No, it's OK. Let him go.

467
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:11,387
Early this morning,

468
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:16,225
I got a call from the police, asking me
to come to Agent Mulder's apartment.

469
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,563
The detective asked me...

470
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:25,985
He needed me to identify a body.

471
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:29,072
Agent Scully...

472
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:41,501
Agent Mulder died late last night

473
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:45,421
from an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.

474
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,593
<i>(door opens)</i>

475
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:04,023
<i>(Blevins)</i> Agent Scully, these
accusations that you've made...

476
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:07,193
- You've been given a disease...
- Yes, sir.

477
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:09,612
They're extremely serious charges.

478
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:12,990
Yes, sir, but I have proof...

479
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:16,619
against the men behind this,

480
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,539
of the lies that I believed.

481
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:25,753
What I have here is proof undeniable

482
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:29,757
that the men who gave me this disease
were also behind the hoax:

483
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:34,303
a plot designed to lead to
Agent Mulder's demise, and to my own,

484
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:38,349
planned and executed
by someone in this room.

485
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,397
What I have here

486
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,566
is scientific evidence...

487
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,082
You.

488
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,251
