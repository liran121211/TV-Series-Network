1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,884
Can you help me?
I'm looking for a woman...

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,387
Excuse“.

3
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:20,105
Excuse me, I'm looking for a Dana Scully.
Was a Dana...? Sc...?

4
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:25,694
Excuse me, I'm looking for Dana Scully.
Is she a patient here? Dana Scully?

5
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:28,780
Is there an admitting nurse here?

6
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:31,867
- Can somebody help me?!
- You'll have to calm down, sir.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,039
I will calm down when somebody gives me
a reason to! I'm looking for a patient.

8
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:40,042
- Dana Scully. I heard you the first time.
- Where is she?

9
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,211
- In the ICU.
- Where is that?

10
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,296
- Tell me who you are.
- Where is she?!

11
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,798
Agent Mulder.

12
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:51,220
- Where are you going?
- ICU.

13
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:53,388
- You move good for a dead man.
- I'm half dead.

14
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,433
You got a lot to answer for, Agent Mulder!

15
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:00,646
- You guys hold here.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,995
What happened to her?

17
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,999
She went into hypovolemic shock.
She's lost a lot of blood.

18
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,669
Due to what?

19
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:27,422
- Due to what?
- She's dying.

20
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,261
- Let's go.
- Let go of me.

21
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:34,179
- There's nothing you...
- Get off!

22
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:38,100
Don't do this! Don't make me
put you under arrest! Don't!

23
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:40,078
I'm somewhat at a loss here
in going forward.

24
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:46,918
This situation developing unexpectedly
during a formal inquiry

25
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:49,588
into your reported death, Agent Mulder -

26
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:55,010
the fact of your being here today,
very much alive, gives the effect

27
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:59,264
of reshaping this investigation
into something altogether different,

28
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:00,682
as we are now put upon

29
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:04,019
to verify the identity of this body
found in your apartment

30
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,355
and the circumstances which led to this.

31
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,857
Care to enlighten us
on these circumstances?

32
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,776
Are you suggesting I can?

33
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,072
Agent Mulder, we're here informally
to give you the chance to help yourself.

34
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,615
Help myself how?

35
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,617
By allowing any facts or details

36
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,744
which might serve to let us go forward

37
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,246
with this inquiry
in a more informed manner.

38
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:26,291
- That helps you. How does that help me?
- Agent Mulder,

39
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,044
this is going to become
a murder investigation.

40
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,880
Criminal charges are going to be made.

41
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,548
We have only one other suspect.

42
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:36,551
She may no longer be able to testify
on her own behalf.

43
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:39,137
Agent Scully lied to us. Why?

44
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:44,726
Who's protecting whom, Agent Mulder?

45
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,898
Your choice is your own but your failure
to answer will reflect poorly on the record.

46
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,319
Are we finished, then?

47
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:10,502
Word of advice from a friend.
Keep playing it the way you are.

48
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,755
- Thanks, buddy.
- Now you need all the help you can get.

49
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:16,842
Should have mentioned that
when you hauled my ass off.

50
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,428
I saved your ass, Agent Mulder.

51
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:23,265
I've withheld forensic evidence
about the body found on your floor.

52
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:26,101
Until you showed up <i>I</i> was
the one keeping your secret.

53
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:30,147
I had no choice but to bring you in.
Scully'll verify all of that.

54
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:33,525
That's a good place to lay it
considering her condition.

55
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,528
You want me to lay it
where it belongs, Agent Mulder?

56
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,865
Pathology turned up two
gunshot wounds to the dead man,

57
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:42,284
one fired point-blank
through the left temple,

58
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,038
the second a postmortem wound to
the face to remove the man's identity.

59
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:50,792
Now, I'd be happy to verify
the ballistics on that first shot.

60
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,882
How can you help me?

61
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,677
Tell me why Scully lied for you.

62
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:12,063
The disease she has was given to her
by somebody connected to the FBI.

63
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,691
To a mole working here.

64
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:17,986
Who?

65
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,572
I failed to find that out, sir.

66
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:31,416
You don't want to forget who
your friends are, Agent Mulder,

67
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,752
to remember who you can trust.

68
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:42,093
<i>(man) What are the appropriate
limits of human knowledge?</i>

69
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:45,597
<i>(2nd man) I don't think there are any
appropriate limits to human knowledge.</i>

70
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:50,936
<i>As long as science is done
openly and with free will,</i>

71
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:53,104
<i>then I don't think there are any limits.</i>

72
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,440
<i>- Senator Kennedy.
- Dr Beaumont,</i>

73
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,693
<i>you've stated that the cloning of humans</i>

74
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:02,113
<i>would be ill-considered
and difficult to accomplish.</i>

75
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,200
<i>Can you expand on</i>

76
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:09,120
<i>what you see as the biggest
technical obstacle to human cloning?</i>

77
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,461
I trust you've heard.

78
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,129
Mulder is alive.

79
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:23,051
As I said, he's not to be underestimated.

80
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,971
Yes, as you said.

81
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:29,558
Though I hear he has you to thank
in some part for his new freedom.

82
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,851
Using a stolen ID,

83
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,313
Mulder was able to get into
the Advanced Research Projects Facility.

84
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,900
- And you allowed him to escape.
- Yes.

85
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:44,573
We're too vulnerable.
Our man in the FBI is exposed.

86
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,243
What Mulder may have seen
could expose our plans.

87
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,079
What Mulder's seen only serves us.

88
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,332
Serves to insure our plans.

89
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:03,425
Mulder is in trouble.
He needs help. We can give it to him.

90
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,262
In exchange for...?

91
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:11,016
His new loyalty. To us.

92
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:18,940
As I've said all along, Mulder's
much more valuable to us alive.

93
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,034
You can proceed now.

94
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,964
What are you doing here?

95
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,468
I heard you were being moved out of ICU
and you were feeling better.

96
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,012
- Somebody's gonna see you.
- It's OK.

97
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,350
I'm officially among the undead.

98
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,977
What happened?

99
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:58,146
I didn't come here to talk about that.

100
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,649
Mulder, don't try and protect me.

101
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:04,402
- I need to know.
- There's not much to talk about anyway.

102
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:07,989
I'm gonna testify everything I know
in front of the FBI assembly.

103
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:11,826
The conspiracy, the men behind it,
what I believe is its purpose.

104
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,915
- Did you find out who in the FBI is involved?
- No. But that doesn't matter now.

105
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,502
- Yes, it does.
- Hey, Scully. How about those Yankees?

106
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,755
Mulder, Skinner has evidence against you.

107
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,758
He knows you killed that man
they found in your apartment.

108
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,219
Yeah. Skinner is withholding it.

109
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,347
Mulder, Skinner's dirty. He's not your friend.

110
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,433
I'm almost certain that
he's the man inside on this.

111
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:41,064
- I don't believe that.
- If you testify he will use it to ruin you.

112
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,943
No, not Skinner.

113
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:50,532
He's been in a position to know everything
that we've done over the past four years.

114
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:54,786
But if I don't testify now
they'll start to bury the truth.

115
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,628
Well, then you have to lay it on me.

116
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:06,631
You have to tell them
I was the one who killed that man.

117
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:12,554
I can't. I can't do that.

118
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,764
Yes, you can.

119
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,308
Mulder, if I can save you, let me.

120
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,939
Let me at least give some meaning
to what's happened to me.

121
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:30,155
- Dana? Hi, Fox.
- Hi, Mrs Scully.

122
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,242
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- No, I was just on my way out.

123
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:46,004
Hi, I'm Fox Mulder.
I don't think we've ever met.

124
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,173
I'm Bill Scully.

125
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,761
I'm sorry about your sister.

126
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,306
- Mr Mulder?
- Yeah?

127
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,768
I know something about you.

128
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:05,273
About what Dana's been through with you.
So let's leave the work away from here, OK?

129
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,944
Let her die with dignity.

130
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:04,582
Please tell me you're here
with severe chest pains.

131
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,919
You should be glad for why I'm here.
To pay you some respect.

132
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,256
- Go to hell.
- For your cleverness and your resource.

133
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,093
- What you've managed to do for Scully.
- What are you talking about?

134
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:19,597
Well, breaching the security
at the Defense Department facility.

135
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,601
- Finding a cure for her disease.
- What I found was useless.

136
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:28,064
On the contrary.
It's essential to her survival.

137
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:35,196
If you like, we could step outside
and I might explain myself.

138
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,201
I'm here tonight as a friend, Agent Mulder.

139
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,385
He promised me that it'd be in here.

140
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,733
<i>(Frohike)</i> I'll <i>be damned.</i>

141
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,736
I never thought what
the de-ionised water might be for.

142
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,946
Who knew we were looking for a microchip?

143
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,824
This is a cure for cancer?

144
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,993
It may be for Scully's.

145
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:24,662
- How?
- Shortly after she was abducted

146
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:29,417
she discovered a small metallic chip
implanted subcutaneously in her neck.

147
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,421
It was just a short time after she had
it removed that she developed cancer.

148
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:36,007
- It's unreal.
- Too freakin' amazing.

149
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:39,427
Watch your language, Frohike.
Grab me some tweezers.

150
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,787
Mr Kritschgau, thank you for being here
and for cooperating with this investigation.

151
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,375
We hope you can provide information
that will allow us to make formal charges

152
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,295
for the murder of Defense
employee Scott Ostelhoff.

153
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,422
Mr Kritschgau, we have learned

154
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:19,217
that you were in contact
with Agents Mulder and Scully

155
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,552
just prior to this man's death.

156
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:22,887
That's correct.

157
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:27,350
And that you may have given
them classified information.

158
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,477
What motivated this?

159
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,437
My knowledge of government involvement

160
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:35,233
in a conspiracy against
the American people.

161
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:43,658
Now, before... before we go
into any specifics on that subject,

162
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:50,915
I'd like to ask you a more pointed question.
Do you know who killed Scott Ostelhoff?

163
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,251
No, I don't.

164
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:58,214
Do you know of any connection between
his death and Agents Mulder or Scully?

165
00:13:58,673 --> 00:13:59,924
No.

166
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:04,846
I'm aware of one death
in connection, though.

167
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,767
My son, who died early this morning.

168
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:19,944
Mr Kritschgau, you are employed by
the Department of Defense. Is that correct?

169
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,529
Technically.

170
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:26,200
Part of my remuneration
has come from another source.

171
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:31,039
A congressional lobbying firm.
Something called Roush.

172
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:35,460
Roush. Any idea what that is?

173
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:37,462
No, sir.

174
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,304
This is crazy. Just crazy.

175
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:49,307
In what sense? In that it might
save your sister's life?

176
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,895
You're not a doctor. You have no place
even suggesting this science fiction.

177
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:56,647
- It's not science fiction.
- He's never heard of it!

178
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,816
Bill.

179
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,070
Have you?

180
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:03,946
No, I haven't.

181
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:07,450
I think there's an obvious
difference of opinion here.

182
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:13,664
I think... that everybody here
has their heart in the right place.

183
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,921
- But I need it to be my decision.
- Dana...

184
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:26,260
I know you're only looking out for me, Bill.
But I don't think you have all the facts.

185
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,848
Shouldn't you listen to your doctor?

186
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,768
Yes. I am.

187
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,687
Would she have to stop
the conventional treatment?

188
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,356
To be honest, at this point,

189
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:43,820
the only approach I have left with her
particular cancer is quite unconventional.

190
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,994
I'd like to try this.

191
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:49,844
You really believe this crap, don't you?

192
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,054
Yes, I do.

193
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,850
See, she's your big defender

194
00:16:55,933 --> 00:17:00,688
but... I think the truth is,
she just doesn't want to disappoint you.

195
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:08,112
If it works, I don't care
what you think she thinks.

196
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:10,865
You're a real piece of work. You know that?

197
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,701
Why's that? Because I don't
think the way you think?

198
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:18,206
Because I won't just sit passively back
and watch the family tragedy unfold?

199
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,416
You're the reason for it.

200
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:26,631
And I've already lost one sister
to this quest you're on.

201
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,967
Now I'm losing another.

202
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:36,641
Has it been worth it?

203
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:41,646
To you, I mean. Have you found
what you've been looking for?

204
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,984
- No.
- No.

205
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,988
You know how that makes me feel?

206
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:53,824
In a way, I think I do.

207
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,411
I lost someone very close to me.

208
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:01,666
I lost a sister. I lost my father.

209
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,754
All because of this thing I'm looking for.

210
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:10,758
These what? Little green aliens?

211
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,933
Yeah.

212
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,935
Little green aliens.

213
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,188
You're one sorry son of a bitch.

214
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,195
Not a whole lot more to say.

215
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,954
<i>(phone rings)</i>

216
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:48,796
One sorry son of a bitch speaking.

217
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,881
How's our patient?

218
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,426
<i>You did find the chip,
didn't you, Agent Mulder?</i>

219
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,510
Yes.

220
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:58,889
I can imagine there was some question
as to its medical value.

221
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,850
Well, there still is.

222
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:06,063
And so I have yet to earn your trust,
in spite of my gesture.

223
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,400
<i>You could say that, yeah.</i>

224
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,652
I have something else to offer you.

225
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:17,658
<i>I've arranged a meeting I think
you'll want to attend, Mr Mulder.</i>

226
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:31,255
Tabasco. Cures anything.

227
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,592
I'll keep that in mind.

228
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:01,035
You know him or something?

229
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,955
I think that's my sister.

230
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,306
Samantha?

231
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:40,157
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

232
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:46,330
He always told me something
had happened to you that night.

233
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,792
Who? Who told you that?

234
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,336
My father.

235
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,104
I never really knew what happened.

236
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:15,985
I could never put the...
memories all back together.

237
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:21,949
But as much as I tried to remember,
I tried more to forget.

238
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,869
- Why?
- I was eight years old

239
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,499
and frightened to death...
and they told me that I was an orphan.

240
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:35,212
But you call that man your father.

241
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:39,884
Some time later - I don't know how long -

242
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,806
my foster parents took me to a hotel room
and said that I was gonna see my father.

243
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,059
- But you knew who your father was.
- I thought I knew.

244
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,648
But... he told me that it had all been a secret

245
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:59,236
and that he and Mom hadn't
told anyone, to protect the family.

246
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:04,408
- And you believe that?
- He was so kind to me.

247
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:10,498
And he was the only one I could
remember from before what happened.

248
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:13,667
You don't remember
anything about that night?

249
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:17,505
I remember... you.

250
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,179
I remember something...

251
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,725
Men and... and then nothing.

252
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,270
I can help you.

253
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,610
You were abducted, Samantha.
I can help you to remember.

254
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,613
I don't want to, Fox.

255
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,365
I don't.

256
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,618
Then why come here at all?

257
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:53,958
My father told me that he'd found you
and you wanted to see me very badly.

258
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:58,420
That you'd been looking
for me for a long time.

259
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,300
Is that true?

260
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,770
I'm so sorry, Fox.

261
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:18,899
And I wish that I'd known how to find you.

262
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,826
What you've been told...
I want you to listen to me, OK?

263
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,622
What you've been told by
that man... may not be true.

264
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,332
Why do you say that?

265
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:39,753
Because the man that brought you here has
known where I've been for a very long time.

266
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,673
I don't understand.

267
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,926
- Why wouldn't he tell me?
- I don't know.

268
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,346
But I think he's kept a lot of things from you.

269
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:53,684
I don't believe you.
He's been a good father to me.

270
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,980
He's given me a life and he cared
for me when there was no one else.

271
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:02,318
I want you to come with me.
Come with me to see Mom.

272
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,532
- Mom is alive?
- Yes.

273
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:14,371
And I know she'd like
to see you very, very much.

274
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:22,046
- I can't.
- Why not?

275
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:26,383
This is too much.
I didn't wanna come here at all, Fox.

276
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,636
I was afraid to see you.

277
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:32,222
- I have another life now. I have children.
- No. Please don't go.

278
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:34,642
- I can't stay here.
- Tell me how I can find you.

279
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,061
- I need some time.
- Tell me where to find you.

280
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,854
Please don't, Fox.

281
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,486
We will do this on your time. Just...

282
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,738
Then please...

283
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,324
please let me go.

284
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,590
I promise you I'll think about it.

285
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:47,881
You doing OK?

286
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,301
Mm. Either it's my head
or I'm a long way from med school

287
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,388
but I can't remember what
you're injecting me with.

288
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,557
Fluorodeoxyglucose.

289
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,726
Deoxyglucose.

290
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:03,897
If you're making any progress I'm hoping
it might show up first in a PET scan.

291
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,066
You're not holding your breath, are you?

292
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,154
I'm going after your cancer
as aggressively as I know how, Dana.

293
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,157
If I can jump-start your immune system,

294
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,163
if I can get your cytolytic cells to recognise
your tumour as something to attack,

295
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,957
then there's a chance.

296
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:27,254
Have you ever witnessed
a miracle, Dr Zuckerman?

297
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,507
I don't know that I have.

298
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:33,010
But I have seen people make recoveries,

299
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:36,305
come back from so far gone
I can't explain it.

300
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,767
Isn't that a miracle?

301
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:46,106
Maybe they are miracles,
but I don't dare call them that.

302
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,195
Thank you.

303
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,563
My apologies for the... rather
hasty departure last night.

304
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,733
- What do you want from me?
- Want from you?

305
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:34,238
You give me these things,
the only things I ever wanted

306
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,324
and I can't think of any
reason for you to do so.

307
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,577
That's true. No act is completely selfless.

308
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:45,541
But I've come today not to ask but to offer.

309
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:50,504
To offer you the truth that
you've so desperately sought.

310
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:54,758
About the project and about the men
who've conspired to protect it.

311
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,761
I know the truth.

312
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,597
- Do you?
- I spoke to one of your men.

313
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,684
- You know he's not lying?
- I've seen enough to know he's not.

314
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:08,105
- You've seen but scant pieces of the whole.
- What more can you show me?

315
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,234
This man you spoke to,
Michael Kritschgau...

316
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,446
He has deceived you with beautiful lies.

317
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,532
He's told you everything you believe

318
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,326
about the existence of extraterrestrial life
is untrue.

319
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,290
And what are you saying?

320
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:33,088
As I said, I'm offering you
a chance to know the truth.

321
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:38,635
- In exchange for what?
- Quit the FBI. Come work for me.

322
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,223
I can make your problems go away.

323
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,064
No deal.

324
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,068
After all I've given you.

325
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,905
What have you given me?
A claim of a cure for Scully?

326
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:01,158
Is she cured? You show me
my sister only to take her back.

327
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,244
- You've given me nothing.
- I intend to keep my promises.

328
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:08,248
- I just need something from you.
- You murdered my father.

329
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:12,336
You killed Scully's sister
and if Scully dies I will kill you.

330
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:17,007
I don't care whose father you are.
I will put you down.

331
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:22,512
You're certainly capable, so I've been told.
I understand you have a hearing tomorrow

332
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:27,267
where you'll have to testify to
these murderous impulses of yours.

333
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:37,152
When you reconsider, the offer still stands.

334
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,165
Dana?

335
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,961
Dr Zuckerman called. He...

336
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,047
he said that you wanted to see me.

337
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,634
What is it?

338
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,805
I'm so sorry.

339
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:10,310
I fight and I fight and I fight

340
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,481
but I've been so stupid.

341
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:17,067
What? What is it?

342
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:24,074
I've come so far in my life on simple faith.

343
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:29,746
And now when I need it
the most I just push it away.

344
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:34,751
I mean, why... why do I wear this?

345
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,422
Why do I wear this, Mom?

346
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:44,594
I put something that I don't even know
or understand under the skin of my neck.

347
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,264
I will subject myself
to these crazy treatments

348
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:51,935
and I keep telling myself that I'm doing
everything I can but it's a lie.

349
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,939
You have not lost your faith, Dana.

350
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,609
But I have, in a way.

351
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:07,117
When you asked... when you asked Father
McCue to dinner to minister to my faith

352
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:12,289
I just closed off to him.

353
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:19,129
What's important now...
is that you save your energy.

354
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,052
I'm not getting better, Mom.

355
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,471
You don't know that yet.

356
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,265
The PET scan showed no improvement.

357
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,489
I know you're afraid.

358
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:52,662
I know you're afraid to tell me
but you have to tell someone.

359
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:01,630
<i>I'll make a statement right here.
Cloning will continue.</i>

360
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,760
<i>The human mind will continue
to inquire into this.</i>

361
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,014
<i>Human cloning will take place
and it'll take place in my lifetime.</i>

362
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:15,102
<i>I think it's right and proper
that we continue this kind of inquiry.</i>

363
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:19,940
<i>I think there will be untold benefits
for humankind in the future.</i>

364
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,527
Turn on your television.
Are you watching the hearings?

365
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,198
Do you see who's there? He's
gathering information for who?

366
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:31,618
<i>I just wanna make that statement.
I came to ask a question.</i>

367
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:35,705
Our colleague was supposed
to have fixed the FBI problem.

368
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:43,713
He will fix it now. Do you understand me?
Then I will fix it for good.

369
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,164
Agent Mulder, please take a seat.

370
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:03,126
Something urgently important
has come to the fore.

371
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,555
As you're set to testify
on your own behalf later,

372
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,895
I have received alarming forensic evidence
from the body found in your apartment.

373
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:27,567
I have in my hand ballistic data matching
your service weapon, Agent Mulder.

374
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:31,071
- Where did you get that?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

375
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,908
But unless you can offer up someone else
who might have fired the kill shot

376
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:38,495
everything points to you
as this man's murderer.

377
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:43,792
Are you prepared to give testimony
you're not the man who fired the shot?

378
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,670
Why am I here?

379
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,172
The man worked for
the Department of Defense.

380
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:51,758
The man was spying on me.

381
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,344
Do you know for whom?

382
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:58,932
Agent Scully was prepared
to name the man at the FBI

383
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:02,185
who was involved in this plot
against you and her.

384
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,106
We believe she was going
to name Assistant Director Skinner,

385
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:11,611
whom we have learned has been working
inside the FBI with a secret agenda.

386
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,280
I refuse to believe that.

387
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,491
We've accumulated substantial
evidence against him.

388
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,830
- Can you show it to me?
- Agent Mulder,

389
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:28,795
if you name this man today in your
testimony, we can file charges against him.

390
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,798
Charges which may very well
exonerate you.

391
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:35,552
Name Skinner and save myself.

392
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:40,015
That's what I called you here
to recommend, as a friend.

393
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,156
I'll see you at the hearing.

394
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,879
Morning.

395
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,923
What are you doing here?
You have a hearing.

396
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:18,386
Yeah. I came by last night but
I didn't have the heart to wake you.

397
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:22,098
Came by for what?

398
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,269
Mulder, what is it?

399
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,608
I was lost last night.

400
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:36,529
But as I stood here
I thought I'd found my way.

401
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,449
I've been, uh...

402
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:44,204
I've been offered a deal. A deal
that could save my life, in a way.

403
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,373
Though I'd refused the deal earlier,

404
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,376
I left here last night with my mind
made up to take it.

405
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,795
A deal with who?

406
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,466
It doesn't matter. I'm not taking
the deal. I'm not taking any deal.

407
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,885
Not after what happened this morning.

408
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,970
What happened this morning?

409
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:05,141
Section Chief Blevins directed me
to implicate Skinner.

410
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:09,646
To name him as the man inside at the FBI
who may have deceived us both.

411
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,442
And if I name him they'll protect me.

412
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,654
Are you going to name him?

413
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,739
No.

414
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:23,326
Then they'll prosecute you.

415
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:28,164
Yeah. They have evidence against me.
They know I killed that man.

416
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:31,167
Even with the ballistics evidence,
I can still be the...

417
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:34,337
Scully, I can't let you take the blame.

418
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:38,341
Because of your brother,

419
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:42,345
because of your mother,

420
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,431
and because I couldn't live with it.

421
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:49,769
To live the lie, you have to believe it,
like these men who deceive us,

422
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,856
who gave you this disease.

423
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:58,278
We all have our faith
and mine is in the truth.

424
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:04,451
Then, why did you come here if
you'd already made up your mind?

425
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:09,456
Because I knew you'd talk me out
of it if I was making a mistake.

426
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,724
You'll be in my prayers.

427
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:32,395
Have your father say
a few Hail Mulders for me, OK?

428
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:52,081
If he's a no-show I'm gonna
ask for a bench warrant.

429
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,544
Sorry I'm late.

430
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,594
Agent Mulder,

431
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,767
the members of this review panel first
convened to address your reported death

432
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,187
only to find shortly
that this report had been a lie,

433
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,023
that you were indeed very much alive

434
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:21,611
and that the body found in your apartment,
believed to be yours, was a murder victim,

435
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:25,532
killed with a weapon issued by
the FBI and registered to you.

436
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:28,618
Respectfully, sir, I have come
to set the record straight

437
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:33,206
so that this process you've begun can be
completed and the guilty parties named.

438
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,458
I'd like to ask for a short break.

439
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,044
I'm ready to proceed, please, sir.

440
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,135
Go on, Agent Mulder.

441
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:50,056
Four years ago, while working on an
assignment outside the FBI mainstream,

442
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,225
I was paired
with Special Agent Dana Scully,

443
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,644
who I believed was sent to spy on me,

444
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,981
to debunk my investigations
into the paranormal.

445
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,692
That she did not follow these orders

446
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:03,570
is a testament to her integrity
as an investigator,

447
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:08,408
a scientist and a human being.
She has paid dearly for this integrity.

448
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:09,867
Agent Mulder,

449
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:13,580
Agent Scully lied straight-faced
to this panel about your death.

450
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:17,917
She lied because I asked her to,
because I had evidence of a conspiracy.

451
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,503
A conspiracy against the American people.

452
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:23,089
We've heard testimony to these allegations.

453
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:29,012
A conspiracy intended to destroy the lives
of those who would reveal its true purpose:

454
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:33,016
to conduct experiments on unwitting
victims to further a secret agenda

455
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:38,021
for someone within government operating
at levels without restraint or responsibility,

456
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:43,610
without morals or conscience, men who
pretend to honour as they deceive,

457
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:48,281
the price of this betrayal - the lives
and reputations of those deceived.

458
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:54,996
Agent Scully... is lying in a hospital bed
right now diagnosed with terminal cancer,

459
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:01,711
a victim of these same tests, conducted
without her knowledge or consent

460
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:05,214
by these men who, as they try
to cover their tracks,

461
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,675
who suborn and persecute the people

462
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:10,219
they've used in their plot,
I will now call by name.

463
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:14,307
Agent Mulder, did you or did you not shoot
the man found dead in your apartment?

464
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,892
I will answer that question.

465
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:19,228
Did you shoot Scott Ostelhoff,
employee of the Department of Defense?

466
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,230
<i>I will</i> answer that question, sir.

467
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,232
<i>(Senior Agent) Answer the question.</i>

468
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,653
- I will answer after I name the man.
- Agent Mulder.

469
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,280
I will answer that question
after I name the man

470
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,157
who is responsible for Agent Scully,

471
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,494
the man who directed that my
apartment be surveilled by the DOD,

472
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:39,415
a man I want to see prosecuted for his
crimes, who is sitting in this very room.

473
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,419
The section chief has asked you
a question. You are going to answer.

474
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:46,339
- I can't do that, sir.
- You can and you will.

475
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:51,427
I can't do that, sir, because the section chief
is the man I'm about to name.

476
00:42:57,577 --> 00:43:00,288
The Smoking Man is dead.

477
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:04,417
- How?
- Shot through his window.

478
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,763
Forensics found it at the scene.

479
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:22,852
- We're assuming it's his blood.
- Assuming?

480
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:24,604
No body was found,

481
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:28,691
though there was too much blood loss
for anyone to have survived.

482
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:37,033
This afternoon when you named
Blevins... how did you know?

483
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:41,370
- I didn't. I just guessed.
- That's a hell of a guess.

484
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:45,625
Blevins had been paid for four years by
a biotechnology company called Roush,

485
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,377
which is somehow connected to all this.

486
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:52,715
I'm sure whatever connections
there were are being erased.

487
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,468
They're cleaning up,
taking everything away.

488
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,639
Not everything.

489
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,394
Scully's cancer's gone into remission.

490
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,691
That's unbelievable news.

491
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:17,490
- It's the best news I could have ever heard.
- What turned it around?

492
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:20,660
I don't know. I don't think we'll ever know.

493
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:25,998
- Can I see her?
- Yeah. She's with her family.

494
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:28,751
But I'm sure she'd love to see you.

495
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:51,918
