00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,939
(woman) Hello? Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,025
Hello.

3
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:26,028
- Hi!
- Oh, my God! Look at you!

4
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:29,823
- How am I gonna get my arms around you?
- It's not gonna be long now.

5
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:32,492
- You're huge!
- Dana... I know.

6
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:36,246
Welcome, welcome. Hi, sweetie.

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,498
Well, let's get you two settled.

8
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:42,419
Sorry, Mom. I know you hoped you'd
never spend another night in base housing.

9
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,254
Are you kidding? This is wonderful.

10
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,174
It's the exact same layout as our old house.

11
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:49,927
- That's the navy for you.
- Bill tells me, Mom,

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,431
that you're staying in your old room and
the nursery's in Dana and Melissa's room.

13
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:56,600
That's right.

14
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,772
- I got it.
- Thanks.

15
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,402
Mom? You OK?

16
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,407
Yeah. Just thinking about your dad.

17
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,328
And Melissa. How much I miss 'em.

- Scully residence.

21
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,559
Yes. I'm sorry, who is this?

22

<i>Dana, she needs your help.</i>

23
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,857
<i>She needs you, Dana.</i>

24
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:48,402
<i>Go to her.</i>

<i>(Click)</i>

27
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,794
- (man) <i>FBI,</i> San <i>Diego.</i>
- This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

28
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:09,381
My badge number is 2317-616.

29
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:13,218
Can you transfer me to
your sound agent, please?

30
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:17,472
I'd like to trace the last number
that was dialled into this phone.

31
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,175
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who are you?

32
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:56,386
Scully. FBI. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

33
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:59,848
Well, uh, no of fence, Scully FBI.
What's it to you?

34
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:04,227
I received a phone call from this address.
It was a woman's voice.

35
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:07,689
- She said that somebody here needed help.
- When was this?

36
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,484
- About 20 minutes ago.
- I been here 30 minutes.

37
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:15,697
I guarantee you, no one's called out to
you or anyone else. Phone's off the hook.

38
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:23,121
Please, can you tell me
what happened here?

39
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,770
This is Mrs Roberta Sim.

40
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,189
Age 40. Suicide.

41
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,900
She's been dead at least three hours.

42
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:56,780
You got a call from her, she must have
dialled 1-800-The Great Beyond.

43
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:09,501
What's going on? They're joking about
you getting a call from a dead woman.

44
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:12,796
I thought it was a dead woman,
just not the one in there.

45
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,549
- What are you talking about?
- It's not possible,

46
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,552
- but it sounded just like her.
- Who?

47
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,805
Our sister.

48
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,349
Melissa.

49
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:46,014
I don't know what to tell you. Pac Bell does
confirm that there was an incoming call

50
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:50,352
from this address to your brother's house,
but from here they show no outgoing call.

51
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,522
They confirm the phone's been
off the hook for three hours.

52
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:56,733
- What was their explanation?
- A mix-up. Software glitch.

53
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:59,861
Obviouslyjust some kind of mistake.

54
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:02,531
Anyway, I gotta wrap things up.

55
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:05,116
Talk with the husband.

56
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:11,039
Listen, weird phone calls aside,
this is looking pretty straightforward.

57
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:15,710
A lot of people check themselves out
around Christmas time.

58
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:46,825
<i>(Bill)</i> No, this is... you know, it's fine.
It's just old. It's very, very old.

59
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,578

- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

67
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,917
Oh!

68
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,003
- That was a good one.
- Is he kicking?

69
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:42,505
He's kicking. Kick boxing.

70
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:46,176
You had boys and girls.
Which one kicked more?

71
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,845
I had some pretty tough little girls.

72
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,349
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

73
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:55,101
big and fat as I am right now.

74
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:58,813
I can't wait to have more.
This is our baby, our son.

75
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,733
Kinda gives everything new meaning.

76
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:06,279
I can't help but think that
life before now was somehow... less.

77
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,907
Just a prelude.

78
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,543
What's the matter?

79
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,130
Nothing.

80
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:34,140
Mom, I'm very happy for Bill and Tara.

81
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,518
You don't seem to be.

82
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,397
Mom...

83
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,446
Several months ago,

84
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,492
I learned that, as a result of my abduction,

85
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,453
of what they did to me,

86
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,498
that I cannot conceive a child.

87
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,004
I'm so sorry.

88
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,132
It's OK.

89
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:15,932
I just never realised how much
I wanted it until I couldn't have it.

90
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:53,386
- Dana, where is it? Where is that rabbit?
- I'm not telling.

91
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:56,890
I'm gonna find that rabbit
and cook it. Turn it into stew.

92
00:09:57,098 --> 00:10:00,018
- No, you're not!
- Rabbit stew, here I go.

93
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,354
You're not gonna find him!

94
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:05,231

- and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour...
- What do you want?

103
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:57,010
I received a phone call
less than an hour ago.

104
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:01,264
I was addressed by name and told that
I needed to help someone. A woman.

105
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:06,311
- I traced the call. It came from your house.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

106
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:10,231
This is the second time this has happened.
I'd like to get to the bottom of it.

107
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,233
- You were here earlier.
- Yes.

108
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:15,069
The detective told me
about a screw-up with the phones.

109
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,905
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

110
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:21,075
No one's called you from here. Not
earlier today, and certainly not tonight.

111
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,662
You can't imagine how bad a day
this has been for my daughter and myself.

112
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:29,584
Well, if you understand, you'll stop coming
around upsetting me with this nonsense.

113
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,338
Please.

114
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:12,585
Scully FBI. What can I do
for you at this ungodly hour?

115
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:15,546
I'd like everything you have
on the Roberta Sim case.

116
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,132
<i>The Roberta Sm case'?</i>

117
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:21,594
There is no Roberta Sim case.
It's a simple suicide.

118
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:27,058
- We went through this before, didn't we?
- Whatever you wish to call it,

119
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,353
I'd appreciate seeing
everything that you have.

120
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:33,815
In the spirit of the season?

121
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,169
So what are you looking for?

122
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,547
Can you even tell me?

123
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:02,969
It says here your precinct
visited the Sims two weeks ago.

124
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,846
A domestic disturbance call?

125
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:08,641
The neighbours were complaining.
They were screaming at each other.

126
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:13,021
It wasn't a happy household.
Happy people don't kill themselves.

127
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,987
They ran a tox screen?

128
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,364
Yeah. It's just procedure.

129
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:31,164
- Says they found high levels of doritriptan.
- Some kind of new migraine medicine.

130
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:34,584
Apparently, you take enough,
you're wearing a cloud for a hat.

131
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,336
I figure she anaesthetised herself,
and then...

132
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,883
Found a bunch of empty sample
packets in the bathroom trash.

133
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,176
Couple more in her purse.

134
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,534
I'd like to borrow this.

135
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:29,323
She's adopted.

136
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:54,015
Danny? Hi, it's me, Dana.

137
00:16:54,849 --> 00:17:00,062
Yeah. Merry Christmas to you too. I, uh,
I'm wondering if you can do me a favour.

138
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,903
I need the complete case files
on my sister, Melissa Scully.

139
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,489
Yeah, crime scene and... and autopsy,

140
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:13,409
along with the PCRs that we ran.

141
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:18,039
Right, but I need you to send them
to the San Diego field office.

142
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:20,416
As soon as possible.

143
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,960
OK.

144
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,129
Thanks, Danny.

145
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,835
Dana?

146
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,218
- Is this where you stayed the night?
- Yeah.

147
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:56,387
Some of it.

148
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,473
It's supposed to be a vacation.

149
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,393
What you workin' on that's so important?

150
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,023
- Just some unfinished business.
- Are you up for joining us this morning?

151
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:11,152
I've got a little work to do.
Can ljoin you guys later?

152
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:16,157
- Well, how are you gonna get around?
- I'll... I'll rent a car.

153
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:20,119
All right. Lunch.

154
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,956
We'll hold you to that.

155
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:38,846
Agent Scully. It's been, what,
four hours? I was gettin' worried.

156
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,849
I'd like to order an autopsy on Roberta Sim.

157
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,311
There's a possibility she was murdered.

158
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,692
What, you got another phone call?

159
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,237
I think it may have been the husband.

160
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:58,574
Where'd you get that idea? Want a coffee?

161
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:02,203
- No, thanks.
- He's got an ironclad alibi.

162
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,956
Mr Sim was at the doctor's
office with his daughter.

163
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,542
He was there all morning. I checked.

164
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,129
I took another look at
the police photos this morning.

165
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:15,549
There were no hesitation cuts
on Roberta Sim's wrists.

166
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,636
Suicide victims seldom make
the fatal cut on the first try.

167
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,513
Seldom, but not always.

168
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:21,972
- Is that all you got?
- No.

169
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,727
Why was the phone off the hook
when you got to the Sims' house?

170
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:30,272
The wife took it off. I guess
she didn't wanna be interrupted.

171
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:34,735
Your incident report says the husband
called the police after finding his wife dead.

172
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,861
Yeah.

173
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:39,407
But if the phone was off the hook,
how did he call you?

174
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,785
Did he find the phone
off the hook, call you,

175
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:46,330
and then have the presence of mind
to return it to the way he found it?

176
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:49,417
- Does that make sense to you?
- What are you suggesting?

177
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,422
I'm suggesting that there are questions
which beg further investigation.

178
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,049
Order an autopsy.

179
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:04,181
Stomach contents appear to include coffee,
whole-wheat toast and cantaloupe.

180
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:10,104
No medicine tablets.

181
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,940
Empty packets of doritriptan were found,

182
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,568
but I see no evidence
that pills were ingested.

183
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:20,322
Well, obviously there were.
Doritriptan showed up on the tox screen.

184
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,450
Then why didn't it show up in her stomach?

185
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,493
It was absorbed into the bloodstream.

186
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:29,457
No. I don't believe the absorption would be
that complete. Not that close to her death.

187
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,627
Then how did the doritriptan
get in her system, Ms Scully?

188
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,630
- A needle puncture?
- On the heel of her right foot.

189
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:40,885
Extremely tiny and easy to miss.
It was meant to be overlooked.

190
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:46,474
I believe this woman was injected,
anaesthetised so she wouldn't fight back,

191
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,059
then her suicide was staged.

192
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,687
- What do you think?
- It's a possibility.

193
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,107
And then again it's possible
this woman stepped on a tack

194
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:57,276
and the rest is blue-sky conjecture.

195
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,197
I'd say itjustifies opening
a murder investigation.

196
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,836
This is your doing.

197
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,172
You didn't have the decency to leave me
and my daughter alone...

198
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,299
Mr Sim, please.

199
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:25,054
Now, you're gonna want to calm down
and let us do our business, OK?

200
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:28,098
- Mr Sim, where's your daughter right now?
- Why?

201
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:35,356
She's at a friend's house.
Thank God she's not here to see this.

202
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,359
Detective? This was in the trash out back.

203
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,952
- You got an explanation for this?
- Yes.

204
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:52,831
My daughter has a severe form of anaemia.
She requires daily injections.

205
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,085
We'll check that out.

206
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:00,548
I want you to analyse this.
Get a PCR on the blood.

207
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,800
We need to identify whose it is.

208
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,633
Dana?

209
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,552
Are you all right?

210
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,265
It's two o'clock in the morning.
Where have you been all day?

211
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,934
We were expecting you for lunch.

212
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,938
Mom...

213
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,733
Sit down.

214
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:53,661
The woman who committed suicide
has an adopted daughter.

215
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:58,165
A three-year-old named Emily.
I got a sample of Emily's blood

216
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,919
and I had the lab run a test on her DNA.

217
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,546
It's called a PCR test.

218
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,508
This is Emily's.

219
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,845
And this...

220
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,807
is Melissa's,

221
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,102
which we ran during
her murder investigation.

222
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,231
They match.

223
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:25,859
- What does it mean, "They match"?
- It means...

224
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,488
that this little girl Emily...

225
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:34,618
is Melissa's daughter.

226
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,591
It's not possible.

227
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,511
You can't deny the remarkable resemblance.

228
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:56,598
Melissa was three years old when this
picture was taken. Practically a baby.

229
00:25:56,682 --> 00:26:01,019
- All kids can look the same at that age.
- Mom, it's uncanny.

230
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,647
Emily looks exactly like Melissa.

231
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,358
That's why I ordered the PCR test.

232
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:10,696
- Her face may change, but her DNA can't.
- And that test is accurate?

233
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,491
There is a 60% chance that
Melissa is Emily's mother.

234
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:18,328
I'm going to order a more
comprehensive test, an RFLP.

235
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,706
It'll take a couple of clays,
then we'll be sure.

236
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,586
I am already sure your sister did not
have a baby. She would have told me.

237
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,924
Remember about four years ago
Melissa took off?

238
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:34,052
She travelled the West Coast.
We didn't know where she was.

239
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,555
She was pregnant and
didn't want us to know?

240
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,057
That was 1994.

241
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,477
Emily was born that November.

242
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,355
She could have given her up for adoption
and none of us would have ever known.

243
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,901
Dana, listen to me. I know
what you're going through.

244
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:53,489
Mom, this has nothing to do with
anything that I'm going through.

245
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:56,450
It has happened to me.

246
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:00,370
When your father died, it was
a long time before he left me.

247
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,957
I saw him in my dreams.
The phone would ring

248
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,877
and just for a moment
I was sure it was his voice.

249
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,840
And you're doing the same thing with
Melissa. You're seeing her in this child.

250
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:15,302
But that does not make
this child my granddaughter.

251
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,056
We're still connected to them, Dana.

252
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,142
Even after they're gone.

253
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:35,447
- Look at all the presents!
- Dana, quiet. They'll hear us.

254
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:47,292
- This one's for me.
- You wish. That's for Billy, you dope.

255
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:52,422
This has gotta be it!
It's gotta be <i>Hotel</i> California.

256
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,925
Shh! You'll wake everybody.

257
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:00,180
- I wonder what this is.
- I don't know, but I got one too.

258
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:05,060
<i>(Mom)</i> You don't have to shake it, Dana.
You can open those now.

259
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,951
Thanks, Mom.

260
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:25,789
Your grandmother gave me a cross
just like that when I was about your age.

261
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,132
It's pretty.

262
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:39,720
It means God is with you.
He'll watch over you wherever you go.

263
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,273
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

264
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,192
Dana?

265
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,487
Hi. Sorry.
There's a detective here to see you.

266
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,240
I'll be right down.

267
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,539
- I know it's early.
- Not a problem.

268
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,918
- Interesting tidbit on Mr Sim.
- What?

269
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:14,796
Bank deposits. Large ones. $30,000 a pop.

270
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:18,634
Three in the last 18 months. All the cheques
have been made out to his wife.

271
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:22,137
The last one was deposited
yesterday, apre's <i>mon'.</i>

272
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,934
- Where'd the cheques come from?
- A pharmaceutical firm in Chula Vista.

273
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,940
- Dr Calderon?
- Yes?

274
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,154
I'm Agent Scully with the FBI and this is
Detective Kresge with the San Diego Police.

275
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:43,867
- What can I do for you?
- We're investigating Roberta Sim's death.

276
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:46,328
<i>- When (M Ms happen?
- You knew Mrs Sm'?</i>

277
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:50,082
- Her daughter is a patient at our clinic.
- What were you treating her for?

278
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,376
She's a subject in a clinical trial.

279
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,796
We're developing gene therapies
for several blood disorders.

280
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,800
Emily's suffering from a rare type of
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.

281
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,928
She's a very sick little girl.

282
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,973
- What's her prognosis?
- I really couldn't say.

283
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:10,352
These are ongoing double-blind trials.
It could be years before we have results.

284
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,271
You've been paying
the Sim family compensation?

285
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,857
Emily's a special case.
We were lucky to find her.

286
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,611
- How did you find her?
- Her father brought her to our attention.

287
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:22,864
Then why are the cheques
made out to her mother?

288
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,616
How shall I put this?

289
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,453
These payments are a gesture
of goodwill towards Mrs Sim.

290
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:31,957
She wasn't convinced that
our treatment was the way to go.

291
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,126
She wanted Emily out of the programme?

292
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:38,088
She filed the paperwork
but her husband later withdrew it.

293
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:43,427
Dr Calderon, did you ever prescribe
doritriptan injections to Emily?

294
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:49,182
No. I prescribed them for the husband when
he mentioned he suffered from migraines.

295
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:52,394
<i>(knock at door)</i>

296
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,405
Marshall Sim, you're under arrest
for the murder of Roberta Sim.

297
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,282
- What?
- Where's Emily?

298
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,952
- Are you out of your mind?
- You have the right to remain silent.

299
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,078
This is crazy!

300
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,414
Anything you say can be used against you...

301
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,625
- I wouldn't kill my wife!
- You have the right to an attorney...

302
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:28,263
Let's get you right in there.

303
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:39,107
Let's just get you buckled
in here nice and safe, OK?

304
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,413
You like that, huh?

305
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,733
I'll see you soon, OK?

306
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,017
<i>( "Silent Night")</i>

307
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:13,326
Every year my husband insisted on putting
the angel on top of the tree by himself.

308
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,495
- Man's work.
- Yes.

309
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:22,002
Dana, can you give me
a hand in the kitchen?

310
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:24,004
Yeah.

311
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,724
What's up?

312
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,935
- I need you to tell me what's going on.
- What do you mean?

313
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:43,607
Dana, you're a million miles away.
I thought you came to see the family.

314
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,734
I did.

315
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:50,197
I thought this thing was resolved, that you
caught the guy that murdered that woman.

316
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,199
We did.

317
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,285
Then it's about the girl, isn't it?

318
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,747
Mom told me.

319
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,542
- You really think Melissa had a baby?
- Yes, I do.

320
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:06,713
She called you from
beyond the grave to tell you that?

321
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,299
Sounds like something
your partner would say.

322
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:12,302
It does not matter where
that phone call came from.

323
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:15,138
What matters is
that little girl needs my help.

324
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:18,975
This isn't about any little girl,
Dana. It's about you.

325
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:23,104
It's about some emptiness, some void
inside yourself that you're trying to fill.

326
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:26,733
I don't expect you to understand,
but I'm not going to justify my...

327
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,693
Dana?

328
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,529
There's a telephone call for you.

329
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,417
- Hello?
- <i>Merry Christmas, Agent Scully.</i>

330
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,046
Got a little present for you.
Marshall Sim just confessed.

331
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,799
He admitted to being
at the house that morning?

332
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,093
<i>I got a signed statement right here.</i>

333
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:56,513
What about the witnesses that
placed him at the doctor's office?

334
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,182
I guess they were mistaken.

335
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,851
Maybe they weren't.

336
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,479
- Where is he now?
- County lockup.

337
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,189
- Did they identify themselves?
- They said they were his lawyers.

338
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:51,359
- How long were they here?
- 10, 15 minutes, tops.

339
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,531
Dammit.

340
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:31,608
When did you get back?

341
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,611
- Just now.
- You're just in time.

342
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:38,490
I was on my way over to the neighbours'.
Mom and Tara are already there.

343
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:41,117
What? What happened?

344
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:48,208
Marshall Sim, Emily's adopted father,
is dead.

345
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:51,419
They made it look like suicide, like his wife.

346
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,046
Oh, my God.

347
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:56,257
- Do you know who did it?
- No.

348
00:36:56,716 --> 00:37:00,428
Do you think it has something
to do with that little girl?

349
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,807
I think it might.

350
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:07,018
Dana, I have to show you something.

351
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,542
Look at the date on the back.

352
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,133
Does Melissa look pregnant
to you in that picture?

353
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:43,638
- It's four weeks before the girl was born.
- Bill, that doesn't prove anything.

354
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:46,933
Melissa didn't have to
get pregnant to have a baby.

355
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:50,186
There's in vitro fertilisation,
surrogate motherhood...

356
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,440
Dana, listen to yourself.

357
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:57,652
You're creating this whole
scenario to fulfil a dream.

358
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:00,447
- What dream?
- To have a child.

359
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,576
Look, I understand. I know the need.

360
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:07,745
God knows, Tara and I tried for years.

361
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:12,208
But making this girl into
Melissa's daughter is not the way.

362
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,795
You're only going to end up
hurting yourself.

363
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,133
<i>(door bell)</i>

364
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:28,349
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm here to see Dana Scully.

365
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:31,352
- May I ask...?
- I'm Susan Chambliss from the county.

366
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,855
It's about the adoption.

367
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:37,609
Hi. Thanks for coming out on Christmas Eve.

368
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:39,777
Not at all.

369
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,083
I don't understand.

370
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:58,546
I think I have a right to know
why you're rejecting my application.

371
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,007
It's not mine to accept or reject, Dana.

372
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,968
We only make recommendations
to the judge.

373
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:08,306
But at this point I'd advise against
you becoming an adoptive parent.

374
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:13,603
You're a single woman who's never been
married or had a long-term relationship.

375
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:18,691
You're in a high-stress,
time-intensive and dangerous occupation.

376
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:22,737
One that I sense
you're deeply committed to.

377
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,074
And one which would overnight
become the secondary priority

378
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,452
to the care and wellbeing of this child.

379
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,581
I'm not sure this is a sacrifice
you're prepared to make.

380
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:38,461
Well, it's one that I've given
a great deal of thought to.

381
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:43,258
I mean, to be honest,

382
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:49,138
I've started to question my priorities
since I was first diagnosed with cancer.

383
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:53,726
And I feel like I've been
given a second chance.

384
00:39:54,727 --> 00:40:00,275
Ever since I was a child I've never
allowed myself to get too close to people.

385
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,280
I've avoided emotional attachments.

386
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:07,657
Perhaps I've been so...

387
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:11,286
afraid of death, and dying,

388
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:14,581
that any connection just
seemed like a bad thing.

389
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,003
Something that wouldn't last.

390
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,759
But I don't feel that any more.

391
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:32,682
I know you're a trained physician and
are aware of Emily's medical condition.

392
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:37,353
I wanna stress to you, Dana,
Emily is a special-needs child.

393
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:41,357
According to her doctors
her condition is incurable.

394
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:45,361
She requires constant care,
both medical and emotional.

395
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:49,616
The good news is you have
first-hand experience of grave illness.

396
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:54,871
The bad news is you'd have to
relive it through the eyes of a child.

397
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:58,041
I realise that.

398
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:03,129
And I feel like I'm ready.

399
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:09,135
We'll review your final application
and make our recommendations.

400
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:12,263
I wish you luck.

401
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,142
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

402
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:18,728
I'll show myself out.

403
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:37,997
Dana?

404
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:41,042
- Melissa?
- Didn't know anybody else was up.

405
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,211
I couldn't sleep.

406
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:49,550
How come? You worried about Quantico,
or who gets the most presents this year?

407
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:56,641
I guess I'm afraid of making a big mistake.

408
00:41:57,892 --> 00:42:00,728
I could tell Dad sure thinks I am.

409
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:05,316
Well, it's not his life, Dana.

410
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:08,319
Yeah, I know that.

411
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:12,115
But, you know, when I started
med school it felt so right.

412
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:16,369
It just seemed like that's
where I was supposed to be.

413
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:22,375
And then by the time I graduated
I just knew it was wrong.

414
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,420
And now the FBI feels right, and...

415
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:29,882
- what if that's wrong too?
- There is no right or wrong.

416
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:35,847
Life's just a path. Just follow your heart and
it'll take you where you're supposed to go.

417
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,683
God, you sound like a greeting card.

418
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,937
I don't believe in fate.

419
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:46,065
I think we have to choose our own path.

420
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:50,945
Well, just don't mistake the path
with what's really important in life.

421
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:54,741
- Which is what?
- The people you're gonna meet on the way.

422
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:58,995
You don't know who you're
gonna meet when you join the FBI.

423
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:01,622
You don't know how
your life is gonna change,

424
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:05,376
or how you are gonna
change the life of others.

425
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,920
(Tara) Hey!

426
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,089
Good morning!

427
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,886
Hey, sleepyhead. Merry Christmas.

428
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:17,263
- Did Santa come?
- Santa's still here.

429
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:21,517
She always had to be first up at Christmas.
Couldn't wait to get at those presents.

430
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:25,146
OK, enough pleasantries.
I'm dying to know what's in this box.

431
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:27,899
I've waited for a month. Let me open it.

432
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:30,276
<i>- (door bell)
- This one's from Charles.</i>

433
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,196
Don't open anything. I'll be right back.

434
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,868
(man) FBI courier.
Agent Dana Scully, please.

435
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:42,371
No, I'm afraid I need
Agent Scully's signature, sir.

436
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,001
Sorry, ma'am. They make you
sign for everything these days.

437
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:50,046
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

438
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:09,023
<i>(Mom)</i> What is it?

439
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:11,818
It's the DNA test on Emily Sim's blood.

440
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:14,195
What does it say?

441
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:18,074
It says definitively that
Melissa is not Emily's mother.

442
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:24,080
But they found striking genetic similarities
between them, so many that they...

443
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:28,000
ran a test against another
sample that they already had.

444
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:31,587
- What sample?
- What are you trying to say?

445
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:33,965
According to this,

446
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:42,139
I am Emily's mother.

447
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:54,360
