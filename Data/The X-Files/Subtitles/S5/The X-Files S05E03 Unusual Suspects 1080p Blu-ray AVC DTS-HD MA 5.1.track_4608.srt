1
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:06,550
(man) Do it!

2
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:23,358
- Hey. How you doing?
- Quite a little party.

3
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:26,361
- What do you know?
- Reports of at least a dozen shots.

4
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,198
Door looks jimmied,
but the alarm wasn't tripped.

5
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:34,077
- Did you see anybody come out?
- No. Whoever it is, they're still in there.

6
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,469
Move. Move.

7
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:03,982
Lieutenant. Over here.
It looks like someone got hit.

8
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,818
So where'd he go?

9
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:11,448
Stay low. Keep looking.

10
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:19,289
<i>(groaning)</i>

11
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,544
<i>(groaning continues)</i>

12
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,964
Davis. Gonzalez.

13
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:29,174
Yeah.

14
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,511
<i>(groaning)</i>

15
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,813
- Easy, buddy. Take it easy. Are you hurt?
- They're here.

16
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:47,276
- Who's here?
- They're here. They're here. They're here.

17
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,530
Talk to us. Who's here? Come on.

18
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,574
They're here. They're here.

19
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:01,331
- Stop! Police!
- Don't shoot.

20
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:04,042
- Turn around slowly.
- We didn't do it.

21
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,211
- Do what?
- Whatever.

22
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:09,047
Face down on the floor. Now!

23
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:13,218
- Get down. Get down. Get down.
- Cuff 'em.

24
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,387
- Spread 'em.
- Oh, man.

25
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,765
They're here!

26
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,893
They're here! They're here!

27
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,938
They're here!

28
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,357
They're here!

29
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:30,027
They're here!

30
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,490
We're screwed.

31
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:19,868
Thank you for getting me
involved in this, Doohickey.

32
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:23,121
- Frohike, you hippie jerk.
- Doohickey.

33
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:27,042
You know, with that long blond hair,

34
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,545
you'll be the first one in here
that gets traded for cigarettes.

35
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,673
I'm gonna be laughing my ass off.

36
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,593
<i>Oh, yeah'? You wanna aha-aha'?</i>

37
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,679
- Any time, any place.
- Both of you, relax.

38
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:43,308
- Shut up, you narc.
- It's your fault we're here.

39
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,645
You in the suit. You first.

40
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:54,486
- Detective Munch, Baltimore Homicide.
- Did they find her?

41
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:58,073
And a good evening to you.
Sorry. No sign of your mystery lady.

42
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,784
She is real. The FBI agent saw her.

43
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:04,079
Yeah, well, Special Agent... Mulder

44
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,415
is currently being held
in five-point restraints

45
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:10,293
and jabbering like a monkey,
and the FBl's not talking either.

46
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:14,214
So, what I'm looking at is
a warehouse break-in with nothing stolen,

47
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:18,844
a shoot-out but no guns,
lots of blood but no bodies,

48
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:24,224
and an FBI agent who likes to take off
all his clothes and talk about space aliens.

49
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:28,770
Fill me in from the top.
Start with your name and birth date.

50
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:33,066
John Fitzgerald Byers. 11/22/63.

51
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,486
- Seriously.
- I was named after JFK.

52
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,031
Before the assassination
my parents were gonna call me Bertram.

53
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:42,534
Lucky you. Occupation?

54
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:46,079
I work for the government, for the moment.

55
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:48,248
And what do you do for the government?

56
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:52,669
I'm a public-affairs officer for
the Federal Communications Commission.

57
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,796
It was in that capacity that I was attending

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,550
the computer and electronics show
in Baltimore.

59
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:02,596
It was where this whole thing
started, just this morning.

60
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:07,184
<i>(Byers) We at the FCC enjoy forging
positive ties with the American public.</i>

61
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:11,771
<i>It's our way of saying "Communication
is just another word for sharing."</i>

62
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:15,609
- Hi, guys. Would you like a button?
- Up yours, narc.

63
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:21,239
<i>Of course, some people
don't see it like that.</i>

64
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,785
<i>At any rate, that was where I first saw her.</i>

65
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,938
Would you like a button?

66
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:02,072
<i>I'm still not sure why I did what I did next.</i>

67
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:07,410
<i>It was so unlike me.
There was just something about her.</i>

68
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:12,832
Ken, I'm gonna take a short break, OK?

69
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,001
Whatever.

70
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,276
Hello, pretty lady.

71
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:46,449
Picture this. Crystal-clear television, 33
channels' worth, with no monthly cable bill.

72
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:49,494
- Excuse me?
- I know what you're thinking:

73
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,163
"Melvin, are you out of your mind?
No cable bill?"

74
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,167
But that's exactly what I'm saying.
I'm talking premium channels, too.

75
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,504
You got your HBO, you got your Cinemax,
you got your Showtime,

76
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:04,926
all courtesy of this marvel designed and
built by the Frohike Electronics Corporation.

77
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,054
(man) There's a name that
inspires consumer confidence.

78
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,348
Shut up, punk. Where were we?

79
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:15,395
Hey, lady. If you wanna watch Matlock
all blue and squiggly, buy from this guy.

80
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,064
If you want quality bootleg cable,
talk to me.

81
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:22,444
If you want a converter that'll short out
and burn your house down, talk to this guy.

82
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:25,530
That was a one-time fluke.
I heatsink every breadboard.

83
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:29,993
Yeah? And what about coax loss?
Do you use the RG6/U or the 52-ohm RG8?

84
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:34,205
- Trick question. It's the 9913.
- Big man.

85
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,041
<i>(fakes sneeze)</i> A narc.

86
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:52,515
- Oh!
- God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

87
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,403
She's very cute.

88
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,865
Yes, she is.

89
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,247
Thank you.

90
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,876
Wait.

91
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,092
Um... Uh...

92
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:32,806
You just look like you could use some help.

93
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:45,276
So, my daughter turned
three years old last week.

94
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:51,282
Last Tuesday was her birthday.
I hope he remembered that.

95
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:55,120
Her... her father took her from you?

96
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:59,999
My former boyfriend. He kidnapped her.

97
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,754
It's a long story.

98
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:09,926
Basically, I got involved with a man who
turned out to be a complete psychotic.

99
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,845
Yeah?

100
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,140
We were only together a few months.

101
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:18,935
I was attracted to him because
he was dark and mysterious.

102
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:22,147
And then he just kept getting
darker and more mysterious.

103
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,482
I got pregnant and he left.

104
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,450
And then he suddenly came back
and took her about six months ago.

105
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:36,286
That's terrible. Did you call the police?

106
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:40,165
Of course. The police,
and then private investigators.

107
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:45,420
- They were surprisingly unhelpful.
- That's unbelievable.

108
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,630
Yeah. Well.

109
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:52,218
At least I managed to get a couple of leads.

110
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:57,265
I was told he's in the Baltimore area,
so here I am.

111
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:00,059
- Well, that's a start.
- Yeah.

112
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:04,773
Except he now knows
that I'm looking for him,

113
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:07,984
and the closer I get,
the more dangerous he becomes.

114
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:11,905
Are you worried he might
harm your daughter?

115
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,534
Let's just say I wanna find her, not him.

116
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:28,963
This is the only other lead I've got.
That's why I'm here today.

117
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,675
This has something to do with
computers, doesn't it? The Internet?

118
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,054
Actually, the ARPAN ET.
It's a government network

119
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,141
created by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

120
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:43,102
You can access it through
the Internet, though.

121
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:46,940
Somehow this means
something to my ex-boyfriend.

122
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:52,445
I was hoping it might be
a means of finding my daughter.

123
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:02,413
If you want... I can go online.

124
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,376
Try and find out for you.

125
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,586
Would you? That...

126
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,802
I would really, really appreciate that.

127
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:20,932
By the way, my name's John.

128
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:24,102
Holly. It's nice to meet you.

129
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,646
Holly. Just like the sugar.

130
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:29,983
Yeah.

131
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:33,611
- Just like the sugar.
- That's funny.

132
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,748
Ken, could you maybe go
take a short break?

133
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,589
Whatever.

134
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:57,176
OK. Let's see.

135
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,141
So, your ex-boyfriend is into computers?

136
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,477
I don't really know.

137
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:11,316
I knew very little about him.
Except that he's psychotic.

138
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:19,490
Somehow this kicked us
into the Defense Data Network.

139
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:23,995
I'm sorry. I think this is the end of the line.

140
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,292
Isn't this something you could -
how do you say it - hack into?

141
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,878
Hack into? No.

142
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:38,051
Technically, yes, I probably could, but
this belongs to the Department of Defense.

143
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:44,390
This is a secured site. I work for the FCC.
This is the kind of thing we're trying to stop.

144
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,729
Thank you, John. I appreciate your time.

145
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,233
Wait.

146
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,914
You didn't see this.

147
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,629
- What did you do?
- It's a government system.

148
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:18,591
I know a couple of loginout tricks
with VMS Version 5.

149
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,760
Never mind.

150
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:30,228
- Look up Susanne Modeski, my daughter.
- I'll try. But there's just no way of telling...

151
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,606
Oh.

152
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,526
- What is that?
- It's an encrypted file.

153
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:40,613
Why would she have an encrypted file
in a secret Defense Department database?

154
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,991
- Can you decode it?
- I'd need some help.

155
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:45,785
Can you print it out for me?

156
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,428
- Oh, my God. Hide.
- What?

157
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,393
- My ex-boyfriend is out there.
- The psychotic?

158
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:14,188
He must have tracked me here.
He's looking for me.

159
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,399
Dammit.

160
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:23,614
There he is.

161
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:40,298
You look like a man who'd appreciate
33 channels of crystal-clear TV.

162
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:43,801
- No thanks, handsome.
- A man of distinction.

163
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,970
Punk ass.

164
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:54,937
<i>(Byers) It was at this point

165

We told him the entire story.

170
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:12,622
I hoped he could assist me
in deciphering the encrypted file.

171
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:20,922
<i>(Byers) it was at this point, however, that
Mr Frohike raised an interesting question.</i>

172
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,925
I don't understand.
Why don't you just kick his ass?

173
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,094
- What?
- No.

174
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,721
I just want these pages decoded.
Can you do that?

175
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:33,684
Sure, baby. My kung fu is the best. But
it could take hours. I say cut to the chase.

176
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,022
If pretty boy can tell us where your daughter
is, we just need to beat it out of him.

177
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:40,441
Bad idea. He's very dangerous.

178
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:44,946
Lady, I'm dangerous.
All right, so we'll just follow him.

179
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,783
- For all we know, he's got the girl here.
- Holly, it makes sense.

180
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,245
No. Just stay away from him.

181
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,623
We'll stay back a ways.
Just wait for us here.

182
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,043
- Come on, FCC.
- But...

183
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:07,552
- (Frohike) What's he doing?
- <i>(Byers)</i> Talking to somebody.

184
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,267
This dude doesn't look so tough.

185
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,435
Act casual.

186
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:20,690
<i>(recorded voice) They're here.
Alien invaders are among us.</i>

187
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:24,902
<i>Detect their presence
with high-tech modern products.</i>

188
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,071
- <i>(beeping)</i>
- Sorry.

189
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,744
(Byers) He's moving.

190
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,311
What's up, fellas?

191
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,566
- You looking for somebody?
- Just, um... the bathroom.

192
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,236
I don't think it's down here.
Hey, are you with the FCC?

193
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,032
- What's it to you?
- I think we share the same credit union.

194
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:14,911
Special Agent Fox Mulder.
I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

195
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:17,705
I was hoping you could help me.
I'm looking for a girl.

196
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:22,293
I was wondering if you'd seen her.
This is her here. Have you seen her?

197
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:27,632
Sorry.

198
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:31,302
- What did she do?
- What's it to you?

199
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,806
- Thanks, guys, all right?
- (phone rings)

200
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,311
Yeah, Mulder. Hey, Reggie. What's up?

201
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:45,107
- What the hell was that all about?
- Her ex-boyfriend is with the FBI?

202
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:50,238
- Where'd she go?
- OK, stand back, folks.

203
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:53,074
- Excuse us here.
- Come on.

204
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,284
- Ken?
- You don't understand.

205
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:59,705
All I did was play Dig Dug.
I didn't hack into anybody's computer.

206
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,501
- Excuse us, please.
- Seriously. I've got a circulatory problem.

207
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:07,088
- I have a tendency to fall down a lot.
- Wait. It was me.

208
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,508
- What are you doing?
- I hacked into their computer.

209
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,890
You wanna turn yourself in? Are you crazy?
A hacker never turns himself in.

210
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,268
- I am not a hacker.
- Listen.

211
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:23,729
We got FBI agents running around,
military police...

212
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,691
Whatever the hell is going on
around here, it's big,

213
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:29,527
and your lady friend is at the centre of it all.

214
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:33,447
She needs my help.
How can we learn what's going on?

215
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:37,076
The FBI are looking for her.
Hack into the FBI mainframe.

216
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,997
I know just the guy who can do it.

217
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,626
You are talking about a premeditated crime
against the United States Government.

218
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,715
Your second one today.
Welcome to the dark side.

219
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,176
<i>(Langly) OK, ladies.</i> Who's down <i>for 50?</i>

220
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,221
50 bucks.

221
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,598
Anyone?

222
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:02,560
50 bucks. Oh, man.

223
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:07,023
My diaper-wearing granny would bet 50.

224
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,233
Come on.

225
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,945
There's no game here.

226
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:16,324
All right. 50.

227
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:19,535
Elron the Druid bets 50.

228
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:24,874
Cash only, Elron. I don't take no personal
cheques from the Bank of Middle Earth.

229
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,546
Come on, natural 20.
Daddy needs a new Sword of Wounding.

230
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,385
What's the big idea
bringing the narc in here?

231
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:39,430
Me and the narc have a proposition for you.

232
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,391
What proposition?

233
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:46,187
The coolest hack in the world.

234
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,397
Lord Manhammer?

235
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,109
Say it.

236
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,782
Say it.

237
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,498
Your kung fu is the best.

238
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,297
Here. Make yourself useful.

239
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,721
What does this do?

240
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,432
Besides overheat and burn the hotel down?

241
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,226
It's a loop line shunt.

242
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,395
Anyone who tries to trace us
will get bounced around

243
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,772
by C&P's call-forwarding software.

244
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,691
- My personal invention.
- Oh, God.

245
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:36,654
I'm gonna get fired. I'm gonna go to jail.

246
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,865
- I deserve to go to jail.
- Shut up already.

247
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:44,829
- What do you need me to do?
- Just watch and learn.

248
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,166
Bingo.

249
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:54,547
Government hack is a snap.
Last week I got into the Maryland DMV.

250
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:58,008
Changed my endorsement
so I could handicap park.

251
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:02,972
I got tinnitus.

252
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,516
- What now?
- Look up the FBI agent.

253
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,477
- What did he say his name was?
- Mulder.

254
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,150
(Lang/y) Is that your boy?

255
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,945
(Frohike) Fox William Mulder.
Born 10/13/61.

256
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:22,908
Degree in psychology from Oxford
University, top of his class at Quantico.

257
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,911
Commendations out the yin-yang.

258
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:29,707
Currently attached to
the Violent Crimes Unit. Single.

259
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:35,546
There's nothing in here about him
being a psycho or having a daughter.

260
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,216
Try, under "active cases", Holly Modeski.

261
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:46,223
- <i>Nada.</i> No case file.
- Try the daughter, Susanne Modeski.

262
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,563
She's Susanne Modeski?

263
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:59,361
"Employee at the Army Advanced Weapons
Facility at Whitestone, New Mexico."

264
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:00,488
Whitecorps.

265
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:04,283
Oh, man. Look at this.
It says here she blew up one of their labs,

266
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:08,370
killed four people, including the MP
who tried to stop her at the gate.

267
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:11,749
"Subject Modeski is considered
unstable and delusional."

268
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:16,086
"intellectually brilliant yet prone
to confabulation and violent behaviour."

269
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:18,881
"Psychotic and profoundly paranoid."

270
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,218
"Armed and extremely dangerous.
Do not approach."

271
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,637
"Call immediately for backup."

272
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:30,768
<i>(clicking)</i>

273
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,257
You've been reading about me.

274
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:16,313
My name is Susanne Modeski, not Holly.

275
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,984
I'm...

276
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:24,613
I was an organic chemist
for the Advanced Weapons Facility.

277
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:30,244
But I never blew up any lab
and I certainly never killed anybody.

278
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:35,457
All I did was try to quit.
I don't have a job you just quit.

279
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,460
What about your daughter?

280
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,007
I don't have one.

281
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,054
I'm sorry.

282
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:53,851
- The photo?
- It came with the wallet.

283
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:58,063
You wouldn't have believed
the truth, obviously,

284
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,233
and I desperately needed your help.

285
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,652
For what, exactly?

286
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,741
To get this.

287
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:13,954
I still need it deciphered.
This has in it everything I need

288
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,335
to expose the United States Government's
plot against its own people.

289
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:24,298
One I unwittingly helped to forward by
developing the ergotamine-histamine gas.

290
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,092
- Ergotamine-hista...
- E-H for short.

291
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:34,516
It's an aerosolised gas, which in small doses
causes anxiety and paranoia in its subject.

292
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,935
Paranoia. Gotcha.

293
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:38,854
Secret forces within the government

294
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,357
plan to test this gas
on the American people,

295
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,360
right here in Baltimore.

296
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:50,032
I am not making this up.

297
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:53,077
Don't you get it? Nobody is safe.

298
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:58,582
- Look what they did to JFK.
- What did they do to JFK?

299
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:02,294
Dallas? 1963? Hello?

300
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:08,300
They want to control every aspect of
our lives from the cradle to the grave.

301
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,636
They practically do already.

302
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,773
Hotel Bible. Who do you think put this here?

303
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:27,611
- The government?
- One in every hotel room in America.

304
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:31,907
It's the perfect vessel
for electronic surveillance.

305
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,993
No one ever questions its presence.

306
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,747
Now, I'm sorry. You're telling
me that the US Government,

307
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:42,793
- the government that gave us Amtrak...
- And the Susan B Anthony dollar.

308
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:46,797
...is behind some of the darkest, most
far-reaching conspiracies on the planet?

309
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:51,093
- That's just crazy.
- I mean, this guy works for the government.

310
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,763
I'll prove it to you.

311
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,599
Just help me decipher this.

312
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,658
What do you say, guys?

313
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:19,329
<i>(Byers) Of course, at that point,
we didn't feel like we had much choice.</i>

314
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,376
Get it off me. Langly, what's taking so long?

315
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,795
It should be up any second.

316
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,722
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

317
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,145
<i>(Laflgly) Far out.</i>

318
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:50,152
(Frohike) Thank God for supercomputers.

319
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:53,781
"The surprise defection of Dr Modeski
is a blow to the programme,

320
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,992
though not a fatal one.
The timetable remains unchanged."

321
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,328
"The first EBO Will occur

322
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:03,582
in the Baltimore-Washington corridor
within one week's time."

323
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:08,253
- What's an EBO?
- Engineered Biological Operation.

324
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,548
Toxic organic agents used on humans.

325
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,429
"Security risks are being attenuated."

326
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:22,726
"Dr Modeski's team has been processed,
and plausible denial constructed."

327
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:26,271
Another way of saying
they've murdered my research associates

328
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,066
and placed the blame on me.

329
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,070
Now do you understand?

330
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,783
Wait. Here it is.

331
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:42,704
"E-H product is presently warehoused
at 204 Fells Point Road,

332
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:47,209
lot number A-9000, awaiting EBO." This is it.

333
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,878
"Subject Modeski monitored

334
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:56,051
"Covert electronics installed per Dr Michael
Kilbourne, 11/6/88." Who's Dr Kilbourne?

335
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,391
My dentist.

336
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,731
Excuse me.

337
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:30,627
- What do you think?
- That thing about her dentist...

338
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,757
Dr Modeski?

339
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,972
Get in here.

340
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,808
Oh, my God. What did you do?

341
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,769
Look at it.

342
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,314
Look at it!

343
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,618
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

344
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:13,879
What's the address of that warehouse?

345
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,761
- Where's the tooth?
- We flushed it.

346
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:24,014
We were afraid it would
give away our location.

347
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,685
So... we broke into the warehouse.

348
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,355
Here it is.

349
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,029
A-9000, right?

350
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:09,851
- Asthma medicine.
- This is how they plan to distribute the gas.

351
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,312
In asthma inhalers.

352
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:17,442
This is their random test.
Now we've got proof.

353
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:22,364
Stay where you are. I'm a federal agent.
Susanne Modeski, you are under arrest

354
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,951
for the murders of four people
at Whitestone army base.

355
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,829
- She didn't do it.
- She's innocent.

356
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:32,165
You three are under arrest also.
Ma'am, stay where you are.

357
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,918
There's more going on here
than meets the eye.

358
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:40,590
You three get on the ground now. Ma'am,
stop moving. I'm not gonna ask you again.

Byers, I swear to God, I'll shoot you myself.

It's all true, what Susanne said
about you people, isn't it?

392
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,796
About John F Kennedy? Dallas?

393
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,927
I heard it was a lone gunman.

<i>(Byers) And that was the last
we saw of him.</i>

395

Almost immediately, the police got there.

396
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,212
We panicked and hid.

397
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,882
You know the rest.

398
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:42,303
Do I look like Geraldo to you?

399
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:46,182
Don't lie to me like I'm Geraldo.
I'm not Geraldo.

(Langly) Oh, man. It's not all a bad dream.

401
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:02,115
- I am in hell.
- Women.

402
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,534
Ain't it the truth?

403
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:07,787
- What do you mean, "women"?
- You know what he means.

404
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:11,624
Your molar-pulling girlfriend
roped us in then left us.

405
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,918
Is that what you meant?

406
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:16,671
Look, she <i>is</i> hot.

407
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:19,632
But you gotta admit,
we're here because of her.

408
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:25,388
I'm here because I wanted to learn the truth.
I assumed that was the same for you.

409
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:32,896
Susanne opened my eyes to it.
She doesn't owe me anything.

410
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:37,567
If there was some way I could help her still,
I'd do it in a second.

411
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:50,538
Agent Mulder came to
and verified your warehouse story,

412
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:53,750
at least, what little he seems to recall of it.

413
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:59,714
Three cheers for the FBI.
You guys are free to go. Come on. Let's go.

414
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:06,262
Here's a tip.
Aluminum foil makes a lovely hat

415
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,140
and blocks out the government's
mind-control rays.

416
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,935
Keep you guys out of trouble.

417
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:23,112
One green nylon wallet
containing $38 in cash.

418
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,990
One... whatever in the hell this is.

419
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,911
Detective?

420
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:37,168
A stolen car turned up at the train station.
It's the one the FBI agent was driving.

421
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,337
OK.

422
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:48,638
Susanne must have taken Mulder's car.
She left it at the station.

423
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,807
- So?
- So maybe we can catch up with her.

424
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:54,060
- Where? She took a train.
- No, she's too smart for that.

425
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:57,355
Don't you see?
She just meant to throw them off.

426
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,149
She said she wanted to go public.

427
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:06,614
The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple
of blocks down from the train station.

428
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,299
<i>(Byers) Susanna!</i>

They didn't believe my story.

431
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:42,317
Not a word of it.
Who in their right mind would?

432
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:48,740
- What are you gonna do now?
- Try other newspapers, TV stations.

433
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:52,827
Not give up. Keep trying to
find people who will listen.

434
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:55,663
People like you.

435
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:59,542

What kind of ideas?

00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:11,090
- Weird ones.
- You gonna bust us?

451
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:13,551
I'm not sure yet. I just spoke with my ASAC

452
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:18,473
and he tells me that Dr Susanne Modeski
is no longer wanted by the FBI.

453
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:22,059
She's still missing,
but the case is suddenly closed.

00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,983
What I need from you guys is to tell me
what the hell happened last night.

You want the truth?

456
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:35,782
Yeah, I want the truth.

You might wanna sit down.

The truth is, none of us is safe.
