00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:18,540
Thank you, Sky Commander.

Yes, Captain Dare will show you

00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:22,206
what a dumb ass he really is.

10
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,747
But be forewarned,
only a <i>stupid</i> dumb ass

11
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:27,511
would neglect to take
every safety precaution

12

28
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:16,188

I've never seen anything
quite like this before.

142
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,536
Well, something killed this kid.

143
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:29,470
Well, judging from the amount
of insect feces

144
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:31,404
in the ear and nasal cavities

145
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:34,500
it appears that they fed
at such a furious rate

146
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:38,411
that it caused the boy's skull
to collapse from the inside.

147
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:42,383
His helmet protected his
head during the crash.

148
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,683
There is no impact trauma here
whatsoever. None.

149
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:48,314
You're saying flies killed him.

[Doggett]
All the kids at the scene...

151
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,259
and the flies choose
to attack this boy?

152
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:59,767
Why?

153
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,802
Maybe they were attracted

154
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:02,030
for reasons we're not seeing.

155
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,774
What if somebody put
something in his helmet?

156
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,605
Insect pheromone.

157
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:08,905
You know, "Spanish Fly"...

158
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:10,274
that stuff you see advertised

159
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,404
in the back of magazines

160
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:13,346
that guys use to attract girls.

161
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:17,620
I glance at them for amusement.

162
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:19,416
I may have to brush up
on my "Spanish Fly"

163
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:23,118
but I don't think the science
works that way.

164
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,991
Anyway, before we start
looking for an M.O.

165
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:28,291
I want to find out
what kind of fly

166
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:30,161
would act that aggressively.

167
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,633
[Man]
The <i>Musca vetustissima Walker.</i>

168
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:34,897
The Australian bush fly.

169
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:37,303
It craves protein so much

170
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,739
it will actually crawl into
your open nose, mouth, ears

171
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:40,901
even your eyes

172
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,002
to feed on nutritious
blood and moisture.

173
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,980
Though the New Zealand
screw-worm fly

174
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,109
often kills its victims
in mere moments

175
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:52,245
by burrowing into
an open wound or cut.

Excuse me?

379
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:38,098
Pheromones, Dr. Scully.

380

Heavy in the air.

381
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:42,032
Nature's natural attractants.

Driving the insect world
to go forth and pollinate.

383
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,375
I'm aware of how pheromones work.

384
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,705
But according to this device

385
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,142
there isn't a single pheromone

386
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:51,213
to be found out here.

387
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:53,373
Well, that can't be right.

388
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,575
The bio-sensor

389
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,618
we use is an actual fly antenna

390
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,584
over which the pheromones pass.

391
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:01,589
But I modified the EAG
to measure in picograms

392
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:02,783
which makes it sensitive

393
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,621
to traces a mile
in any direction.

394
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:06,524
But I'm still not sure
why you think

395
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:09,393
that pheromones might cause
an otherwise harmless fly

396
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,626
to attack a human
so violently, Doctor...

397
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,429

Rocky.

399
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:20,237
Bugs are small-minded creatures,
and therefore very predictable.

400
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,106
They don't have moods, per se.

401
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:24,577
They react to
circumstance and stimuli

402
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,308
as they have been doing
for millennia.

403
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,250
So what do you suppose
they're reacting to out here?

404
00:20:33,423 --> 00:20:36,415
It may be the bugs are being

405
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,393
somehow driven crazy with desire.

406
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,896
You know, they say we humans

407
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:45,331
