[Radio Dispatcher]
This is Sector Station to Unit One.

3
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,723
Unit One, please report.

4
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:34,552
Unit One reporting.

5
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:36,785
No traffic or unusual activity,
Sector Station.

6
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:38,156
Tell her my ass is freezing off...

7
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:39,456
and I need someone out here...

8
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:41,588
to get the blood circulating.

9
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,831
Sector Station, Agent Daley here...

10
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,460
has a very special request.

11
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,265
The mike's off, man.

12
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,366
Don't scare me like that, man.

13
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:54,501
Aw, come on.

14
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:56,273
Keeps you awake, don't it?

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,574
Yeah.

16
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:03,319
Something moving.

17
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,513
Where?

18
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:05,919
Coming right through the trees.

19
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:07,354
Straight ahead.

20
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,255
See it?

21
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:16,896
Got it!

[Daley]
Unit One to Sector Station...

23
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:31,775
we are in pursuit...

24
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,645
in pursuit
of an illegal border crossing.

25
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,328
Rabbit's running for the hole.

26
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:22,791
End of the road, buddy.

27
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:07,969
Agent Scully.

28
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:08,970
He's expecting me.

29
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:10,335
Go right in, Agent Scully.

30
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,705
They're all waiting for you.

31
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,038
"They"?

32
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:16,044
Mm-hmm.

33
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,591
Sorry to keep you waiting.

34
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:34,721
Have a seat, please, Agent Scully.

35
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,935
May I ask what this is about?

36
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,970
You can take a seat, please.

37
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,388
[Follmer] Deputy Director Kersh...

38
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,752
has called you here today...

39
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,258
to ask you a few questions,
Agent Scully.

40
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,624
All right, just a few...

41
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,924
routine questions.

42
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,227
[Kersh] Do you know what this is?

43
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,307
Should I?

44
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,010
It's a simple question, Agent Scully.

45
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,148
Do you know what this is?

46
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,065
I'm not sure.

47
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,464
But you've seen it before.

48
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:46,263
Am I under suspicion here?

49
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,397
Assistant Director Skinner...

50
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,996
led us to believe...

51
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,576
that you'd be able to identify
this piece of evidence.

52
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,304
And why is that?

53
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,380
Well, you once worked on the X-Files.

54
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,778
Well, if this is an X-File...

55
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:01,043
then why don't you ask somebody
who's working on the X-Files?

56
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,813
Because we're asking you.

57
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,819
Where did you get these?

58
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:10,826
They were found during
an illegal border crossing...

59
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,190
in North Dakota.

60
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:14,025
Canada to the U.S.

61
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,732
An illegal border crossing by whom?

62
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,860
As I said, we're asking...

63
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,801
the questions here today, Agent Scully.

64
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,038
What A.D. Follmer is saying is...

65
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:27,735
your cooperation is important...

66
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,541
to this investigation, Agent Scully.

67
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,179
I'd like to cooperate.

68
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:37,913
L-I'd be happy to cooperate.

69
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,916
I just wish that you would tell me...

70
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:45,756
who or what you are investigating.

71
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,764
[Elevator Bell Rings]

72
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,829
[Scully] Were you called about this?

73
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:00,607
Has A.D. Follmer been down here?

74
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,769
Brad Follmer?

75
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,643
Yeah. Going through the X-Files.

76
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:05,772
I doubt Agent Follmer...

77
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,043
even knows where we are...

78
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:08,379
down here, Agent Scully.

79
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:14,683
Why? What are you looking for?

80
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:22,632
These.

81
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,498
[Reyes]
What are they?

82
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:27,467
Rubbings.

83
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,766
Taken from the surface
structure of a craft.

84
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,340
A craft?

85
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:32,772
A spacecraft.

86
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:33,865
Agent Doggett...

87
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:36,172
if you can wrap your
brain around that.

88
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,713
[Sighs]

89
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:40,648
They were found by fishermen
off the western coast of Africa.

90
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,777
Two years ago, I traveled there
to study it and I took these.

91
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,219
What does this have
to do with Follmer?

92
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:47,449
This morning I was called...

93
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:49,150
into the Deputy Director's office...

94
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,887
and I was shown an exact
copy of that rubbing.

95
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,987
I was asked by senior staff
to identify it for them.

96
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,588
And where did they get them?

97
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,168
A guy running
the North Dakota border from Canada.

98
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,497
Or so they say.

99
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,801
What did you tell them about these?

100
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:06,705
Nothing.

101
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,075
And what aren't you telling us?

102
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:15,508
That they're powerful.

103
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:19,111
We're talking about pieces of paper
with marks on it.

104
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:21,657
They're not just marks, Agent Doggett.

105
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:25,455
It's writing.

106
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:28,190
Words.

107
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:31,028
Powerful words.

108
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,534
And if the FBI has them...

109
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:37,038
and they're keeping their
investigation of them a secret...

110
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,167
then they have a sense
of their power as well.

111
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:05,463
Special AgentJohn Doggett
out of Washington.

112
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,470
I'm looking for
the agent in charge out here.

113
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:13,065
Anybody point me to the ASIC?

114
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:38,628
Agent Doggett...

115
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,396
Assistant Director.

116
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:41,698
I don't recall asking...

117
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:44,069
for your help or assistance
on this case.

118
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:45,436
Well, the way it looks...

119
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,942
I'm the only agent outside
of D.C. You didn't ask.

120
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:52,141
What's the big attraction?

121
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:54,740
Last night, a man...

122
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:57,911
made an illegal border crossing
from Canada.

123
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:00,785
A chase ensued: Ended here.

124
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,222
You know anything about him?

125
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,089
About what he might
have been doing?

126
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:05,491
We're endeavoring to learn...

127
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,256
as much as we can, Agent Doggett.

128
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:09,832
Was he carrying anything interesting?

129
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,958
Like what, for example?

130
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:16,830
I don't know. Like, uh...

131
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,272
maybe something you'd find in an X-File.

132
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:21,867
If that's what you came looking for...

133
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,879
you came a long way for nothing.

134
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:27,848
Then what's with the cavalry?

135
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:30,249
Excuse me?

136
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:31,582
Lot of good shoes out here...

137
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,622
Iooking for what's got to be a dead man.

138
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,652
Guy was killed, right?

139
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:41,322
Man survives a fall like this, on fire?

140
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:43,991
Not very likely.

141
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,591
You got a body?

142
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:48,967
We <i>will,</i> Agent Doggett.

143
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:52,599
Like you say,
I got the cavalry out here.

144
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,469
You find that funny?

145
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,309
Dead man up and disappearing?

146
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,848
Happens every day, right?

147
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:04,720
At least it does on the X-Files.

148
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,381
Trust me, Mr. Doggett.

149
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,289
This has nothing to do with you.

150
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:14,763
Nothing to do with you or the X-Files.

151
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,832
Stick your nose in this case...

152
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:22,632
I promise you, you'll live to regret it.

153
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,759
[Coughs]

154
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,698
[Grunting]

155
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,510
[Grunting]

156
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:30,568
Hi.

157
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:32,232
Thanks for coming.

158
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:37,312
I needed to talk to you
about this in person.

159
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:38,881
Well, what is it?

160
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:47,155
[Reyes] What I'm reading in your
field report on these rubbings, Dana...

161
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:49,384
there's something I didn't understand.

162
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:52,656
You say these were
taken off a spacecraft.

163
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:56,254
You determined they were words...

164
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,197
writings.

165
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:01,998
You didn't tell us
you knew what they said.

166
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:04,198
What little I read...

167
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:06,673
was through the help of an interpreter.

168
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:09,643
But you interpreted them as text...

169
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:12,909
from the Bible, from the Koran...

170
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:16,417
scripture from religions
around the world.

171
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,353
And science, too.

172
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:23,756
The periodic table of elements.

173
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,760
Yes.

174
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:29,024
And you wrote in your report...

175
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,623
they were millions of years old.

176
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,669
Based on radiometric readings...

177
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,000
from fossils that were encrusted...

178
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,971
on the surface of the ship.

179
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:42,277
Agent Scully, I know you've become...

180
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,177
more open-minded about these things...

181
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,946
but do you know what
it is you're saying here?

182
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:55,221
If it were true...

183
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:59,819
these symbols wouldn't
just be words...

184
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,797
they'd be the very word of God...

185
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,630
on the surface of an alien spacecraft.

186
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:13,335
It'd mean that everything
mankind believes in...

187
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:15,604
is in question.

188
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,839
And you believe this?

189
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:21,611
I didn't.

190
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,913
I mean, l-I refused...

191
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,217
to believe it.

192
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,918
But now I think...

193
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,655
I think there may be answers there.

194
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:36,755

195
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:40,859

196

I have no one else to say it to.

198
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:58,250
That I was meant to find these...

199
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,085
somehow.

200

These were meant for me.

201
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:08,127

keep that from you?

202
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:09,721

Well, I've been tied up, Agent Doggett.

213

everyone's calls but ours.

00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:03,316
who answers to whom here.

217
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,650
Oh, I think
you owe me an answer, sir...

218
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,485
and if you don't owe it to me,
you owe it to Agent Scully...

219
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,583

220

The one they're working so hard
to keep us from investigating.

221
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:18,624
You ready for my answer, Agent Doggett?

222
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:20,703
It's not an X-File case.

223
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:23,705
That's why you have 40 agents
combing the Canadian border...

229
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,388

230
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,516
why you're keeping their secrets...

231
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:46,026
why you're keeping quiet.

232
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,963

the Canadian border last night.

246
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:47,232
Special Agent Robert Comer.

247
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:49,208
He's FBI.

248
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:50,506

once in New Orleans.

Well, according to his file...

252
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,785
last six months
he's been deep undercover.

253
00:19:56,886 --> 00:19:58,217

254
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,221

258
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:10,290
A.D. Skinner gave you these?

259
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,459
I sort of got it on loan.

260
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,631
We better call Agent Scully.

I know you're worried about him...

277

that there are things about him
that you just can't explain...

but even if you were
to get those answers...

what would it change?

280
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:02,978
Mom, he's my child.

281

and raise him...

293
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,549
on the man that was carrying them.

294
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:19,212
He's one of ours...
working deep undercover.

295
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:21,256
Infiltrating a religious group.

296
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,484
Some kind of wacked-out UFO cult.

297
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:25,288
A case they never told us about.

298
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:27,157
Where's this cult supposed to be?

299
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:28,628
North Dakota.

300
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:31,165
And at some point,
they up and disappear into Canada.

302

this guy was doing...

304
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:38,664
running across the U.S. Border
carrying these rubbings on him?

305
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:40,970
The FBI thinks he went over
to the dark side.

306
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:42,339
Became wacked-out himself.

307
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:43,673
And that's the secret...

308
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,305

to keep from everybody.

309
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:48,940

Not about an FBI agent...

316
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:08,601

317
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,602

the FBI is aware of it.
