00:36:25,173 --> 00:36:28,006
I've never seen her
before this morning.

537
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,737
Now I've seen
her twice.

538
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,115
<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

539
00:36:44,526 --> 00:36:46,687
Excuse us.

540
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:48,387
Where's Agent Doggett?

541
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,930
What are you
doing, Brad?

542
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,260
What am <i>I</i> doing?

543
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:52,856
I'm doing my best
to cover your ass.

544
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:54,094
What are you
talking about?

545
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:55,100
This, this.

546
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:56,363
I'm talking
about these.

547
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:57,403
Let go of me.

548
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,598
What's going on here?

549
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:13,120
Okay, where'd
he go?

550
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:16,315
Who?

551
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,925
Where'd who go?

552
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,495
Where did Doggett
take the body?

553
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,033
You're not making
any sense, Brad.

554
00:37:26,134 --> 00:37:29,365
Agent Doggett didn't take
any body anywhere.

555
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:31,302
What, you're
looking at me...

556
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:33,271
like you don't believe me.

557
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,603
Ask Agent Scully.

558
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:38,176
I'm going to go now.

559
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,646
I've got a child at home.

560
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:51,927
Body or no body, you were
here doing an autopsy.

561
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:53,619
Doggett was here...

562
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,424
without authorization.

563
00:37:57,532 --> 00:38:00,592
Without authorization?

564
00:38:00,702 --> 00:38:03,330
He's out of control,
you know, Monica.

565
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:04,996
Forget the X-Files.

566
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:07,041
He'll take you
down with him.

567
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:11,442
This was you, wasn't it?

568
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:13,810
You floated
that obituary to me...

569
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:15,746
to set Agent Doggett up.

570
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:16,909
Using me?

571
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,179
What obituary?

572
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,379
I don't know what
you're talking about.

573
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:23,117
You came to me
for help, remember?

574
00:38:23,225 --> 00:38:25,557
I'm only trying to help
you help yourself.

575
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:27,788
I know exactly what
you're doing, Brad.

576
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:31,059
Don't forget to piss on all
the corners before you leave.

577
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:35,861
I didn't float
any obituary.

578
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:37,666
What is she
talking about?

579
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,742
<i>[Doorbell Ringing]</i>

580
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:43,972
Son of a...

581
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,740
Yeah?

582
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:47,644
Oh. Hello.

583
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:50,741
Considering the recent violence
attempted on Agent Doggett...

584
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:52,911
you might want to know
who's at the door...

585
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:55,285
before you
actually open it.

586
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,156
Next time I'll get a chair.

587
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:01,195
Agent Doggett's gone.

588
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:03,355
What do you mean gone?

589
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:04,796
He and
Assistant Director Skinner...

590
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,060
split for Maryland together.

591
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:07,430
Show her what we found...

592
00:39:07,536 --> 00:39:09,868
before she makes
any nasty remarks.

593
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,269
It took some
real hacking...

594
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:14,638
but Carl Wormus,
the man from...

595
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:16,301
the Environmental
Protection Agency...

596
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:17,537
who drowned in his car?

597
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,546
He'd been receiving
encrypted e-mail data...

598
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,582
from a water reclamation plant
in Maryland.

599
00:39:21,683 --> 00:39:25,551
From a worker there
named Roland McFarland.

600
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,747
Encrypted data on what?

601
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:28,823
Don't know.

602
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:30,551
But whatever it is,
may have gotten...

603
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,786
both these
men killed.

604
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:52,874
There are
no nameplates.

605
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:56,314
Yeah, I see that.

606
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:57,476
This is madness.

607
00:39:57,586 --> 00:39:58,678
Even if you're right...

608
00:39:58,787 --> 00:40:00,914
and this guy connects
to your investigation...

609
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,013
we don't know we're in
the right area.

610
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,753
This has got to be
McFarland's area.

611
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,275
This might be his desk.

612
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,679
Let's just grab
the computer hard drive...

613
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:28,750
and get out of here.

614
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,112
We're not sure
if it's his.

615
00:40:30,218 --> 00:40:32,311
Somebody's going to come
walking through...

616
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,514
one of these doors any minute
and it's not going to matter.

617
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:36,716
Just keep an eye out.

618
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:45,190
What's chloramine?

619
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,460
What?

620
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:48,297
Why are you asking
me about chloramine?

621
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:49,802
Because
this is McFarland's desk...

622
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,430
and he's got tons of files
on chloramine in it.

623
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,634
I'm betting it figures
into all this somehow.

624
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,641
Agent Doggett.

625
00:40:58,146 --> 00:40:59,613
Grab the files and go.

626
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:18,557
Shh.

627
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,624
