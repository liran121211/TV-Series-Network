359
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,658
from one parallel world
to the other?

360
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:17,221
Like... like he's opening a door.

361
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:25,301
<i>And what if somehow you</i>
<i>followed him through that door...</i>

362
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,308
<i>without even knowing it?</i>

363
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:34,014
Maybe when you followed
Lukesh into this world, my...

364
00:26:35,918 --> 00:26:39,410
my Doggett got forced out.

365
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:51,457
My Doggett would have
called that crazy too...

366
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:54,866
but give me another
theory that fits.

367
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:05,746
I'm kind of confused
as to why I'm back.

368

I already told you

369

uh... inconsistencies...

370
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:14,751

Well, that's surprising.

376
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:35,700
I can't imagine
who would have said that.

377
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:36,800
Agent Doggett.

378
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:39,881
Yeah, he's regained consciousness.

379
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:42,212
He's very chatty.

380
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,843
Among other things,
he says that...

381
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,148
you're a murderer.

382
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:50,749
That you enjoy killing women
with a straight razor.

383

387

would you consent to a GSR test?

388

GSR? What is that?

389
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:13,879
It can reveal
whether or not someone...

390
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,917

to my lawyer about that.

My heart goes out
to your Agent Doggett...

396
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:36,603
but he's confused.

397
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,605
It's clear to me...

398
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:40,834
that your female agent,
Ms. Reyes, is responsible...

399
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:42,843

400
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:46,813

corroborate your story?

No.

Well, still, maybe

Would she be willing to come
down here and talk to us?

408

one of your people did this.

412
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:19,004
Now, if you're going
to arrest me...

413
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,312

When did it start?

424
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:31,210
Was it after your
breakdown in '95?

It's buttoned up so tight...

426
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:37,926
