Agent Scully! Agent Scully!

182
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,232
Agent Scully, do you know this man?

183
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:29,977
I wouldn't think so.

184
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,811
Not with him trying to
pick his way into your place.

185
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,985
Start with who you work for.

186
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:47,188
I'm not at liberty to say.

187
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,822
Is this your wife?

188
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,098
Maybe she's at liberty.

189
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,363
Maybe she don't want
to accompany you to prison.

No.

No, no.

196
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,951
I want to protect William.

197
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,315

You want to get us killed?

199

You said...

200

You said that they could help us.

201
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:16,823
You told me that.

the National Security Agency.

The name on my driver's license
is false.

If you were to call the police...

210
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:03,329
I would be detained
only long enough...

211
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,408
for another NSA agent
to authorize my release.

212
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:08,671
I don't exist as a citizen,
nor does anyone I work with.

213
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:10,370
So what are you doing here?

214
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,074
As you can see, my wife is upset.

215
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:16,914
I was coming to get her
to stop this very event.

216

217

different with her son William.

227
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,487
you saw your son...

228
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,789
effect the movement
of the mobile over his crib.

229
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:01,193
He spun it as if with this mind.

230
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:05,427
It happened to us the same way.

231
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,628
[Reyes] So you've been
looking in this apartment...

232

with what, cameras?

233

who's been contacting us.

I only look at what they tell me to.

238
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:24,414
But I have a supervisor
who I've told everything...

239
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,581
I'm telling you about
my daughter and your son...

240
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,783
and he started to look into it.

241
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,691
He learned things
about a Super Soldier program.

242
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,854
Things he won't tell us.

243
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:38,491

against innocent people.

What does he want with Mulder?

245
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:49,044
Mulder's the only one capable of
making the connections, he says.

Maybe we can help you.

Yes.

how to reach Agent Mulder.

00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:40,535
Because you can reach Mulder.

367
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:44,010
Mulder needs to know what I know
or he may have no future.

368
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,239
Perhaps no one will.

369

the main road, half a mile out.

370

Mulder in the next 24 hours...

371

Excuse me.

Yeah.

all over town last night...

he says he wants to
talk to Mulder, right?

381
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,177
Why does he need you?

382
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:55,250
Why not go to Mulder directly?

383
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,285
'Cause this guy knows
Mulder resurfaces...

384
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:59,684
only if the one person
he trusts asks him to.

385
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:02,052
That guy didn't come to me,
Agent Doggett...

386
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:03,216
he came to you.

387
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,520
That woman that I took in
blew his cover.

388
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:06,856
He had no other choice.

389
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,088
Did you ever stop to think...

390
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,562
that this woman and her husband...

391
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:10,757

I don't believe that.

being used by this shadow man...

397

To kill him?

398
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:26,309
'Cause that couple doesn't even
necessarily trust the shadow man.

hope to ensure for Mulder
a safe passage home?

405
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,098
Mulder and I
already considered that...

even before he left.
