00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:36,553
From the footprints in the mud...

39
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,525
best guess is, we're looking
for two perps.

00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,324
Nothing stolen from the house.

It all fits the profile, right?

43
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:44,860
This thing is staged...

44
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:46,435
to look like some kind of
satanic ritual.

45
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:51,099
Placing victims in a murder-
suicide posture is ritualistic...

46
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:55,042
and this word
is undoubtedly satanic.

47
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,512
"Daemonicus."

48
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:00,810
It means Satan in Latin.

49
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,149
Or "daemoniacus": Demon possession.

50
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:06,620
And it's worth 50 extra points.

51
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:09,852
That's why they were posed like this...

52
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,693
so we'd think that these folks
were possessed, right?

53
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:17,289
That would be
the textbook explanation.

54
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:20,667
I'll let them know.

55
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,329

about satanic ritual...

but don't tell me
you think the devil did this...

59
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,150
'cause we got prints
on the lawn out there.

60
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:41,690
This case ain't even close
to being an X-File.

61
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,692
Something strange happened in here...

62
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,193
just before you came in.

63
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,353

00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:15,654
Dr. Dana Scully.

67
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,257
I have just been assigned
to the Academy...

68
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:22,855
as a forensic investigator.

69
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:26,868
For the past eight years...

70
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,734
I was part of a unit
known as the X-Files.

<i>[Chuckling]</i>

72
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,470
Some of you may have
heard of it.

73
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,442
Ever slay a vampire?

74
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:40,078
Sorry to disappoint you...

75
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:43,517
but this is a course
in forensic pathology.

76
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,214
Hard science.

77
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:47,688
An X-File is a case...

78
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,249
that has been deemed unsolvable
by the bureau.

79
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:54,159
Because such a case
cannot be solved...

80
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,664
it may beg other explanations.

81
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,361
A vampire, perhaps.

82
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:05,634
Science, however, tells us that
evil comes not from monsters...

83
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:07,573
but from men.

84
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:11,239
It offers us the methodology
to catch these men.

85
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:14,784
And only after we have exhausted
these methods...

86
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,786
should we leave science behind...

87
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:21,585
to consider more extreme
possibilities.

88
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,018
What did you find?

89
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,723
I asked Agent Scully
for her expertise on this.

90
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,595
Looks like we can rule out
the Exorcist after all.

91
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:03,859
And why is that?

92
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,764
There's adhesive residue...

93
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,463
on Mrs. Mountjoy's
wrists and face.

94
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,105
Can you see that?

95
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,108
She was taped and bound...

96
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,668
and then shot at a range
of ten to 12 feet...

97
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,044
with her husband's handgun.

98
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,380
The husband shot her.

99
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,751
He was tricked into it.

100
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,380
That's what we were thinking.

101
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:28,719
Some kind of sick game.

102
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:32,352
Well, there's also evidence of...

103
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:35,795
fingerprint bruising
along his collarbone.

104
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:40,066
They held him down.

105
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:43,001
Shot him in his chair.

106
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,370
Again, we're looking
for two guys.

107
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:48,273
The snakes appear
to be purely symbolic.

108
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:51,779
They're a nonvenomous species
collected locally.

109
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,113
They were sewn postmortem
into the body cavity...

110
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,685
with household thread...

111
00:09:56,787 --> 00:10:00,450
by someone who appears
to have surgical skill.

112
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,923
You've made a lot of headway.

113
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:07,588
But there's something else.

114
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,859
There's something
that you're not saying.

115
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:14,637
When I was alone
in that house this morning...

116
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:18,674
I had the strong feeling
I was in the presence of evil.

117
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,077
Look, Monica...

118
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,238
the only reason we were
called in on this thing...

119
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:25,440
is you've investigated...

120
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,982
hundreds of these kinds of cases.

121
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,608
And not once
did I find anything...

122
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:31,153
to support evidence
of genuine satanic activity.

123
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:32,983
I'm saying.

124
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,388
I've never felt this before.

John Doggett.

128
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:49,605
Agent Scully, have you ever
sensed what I'm talking about?

129
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:53,802
I've felt things
that I couldn't understand.

130
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,074
Things I was afraid
to admit even to myself.

131
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:00,445
And what did you do?

132
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,417
I learned not to ignore it.

133
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,751
To trust my instincts.

134
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:09,983
[Doggett]
Yeah, thanks.

135
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:12,618
What is it?

136
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,323
Mental hospital,
a hundred miles from here.

137
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:18,026
They think one of
their patients did this.

138
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,011

We're pretty shaken up.

140
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,110
[Doggett] Why do you think
this escaped patient Kenneth Richman...

141
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,413
was involved in these murders?

142
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,919
Dr. Richman was committed here...

143
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,580
because he killed
three patients.

144
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,021
He had sewn strychnine tablets...

145
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,717
into their stomach lining
in surgery.

146
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,021
When I heard
about the snakes...

147
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,117
The police believe two men...

148
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:22,221
committed this crime, Dr. Sampson.

149
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:23,594
Two men?

150
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,895
Do you have any idea
who the second man might be?

151
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:28,994
No, he didn't exactly
keep pen pals.

152
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:32,075
Did Dr. Richman display
any knowledge of satanic lore...

153
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,109
or speak of demonic possession?

154
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,906
No. He was perfectly cogent.

155
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,879
He didn't suffer from
those kinds of delusions.

156
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:41,883
I'm not really asking
about delusions.

157
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,884
When you last spoke to him...

158
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:46,546
did he seem himself?

159
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:48,715
Seem himself?

160
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:51,521
I mean, did he display
a personality other than his own...

161
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:52,560
speak in tongues...

162
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:54,755
or in a language
he didn't know?

163
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,459
You're asking me
if he was possessed?

164
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,865
This is the 21 st
century, Ms. Reyes.

165
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,665
We stopped looking
a long time ago...

166
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,705
for demons to explain
mental illness.

167
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:07,265
I'm not really talking
about mental illness.

168
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:11,736
[Guard]
Dr. Sampson?

169
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:15,941
Excuse me a moment.

170
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:21,717
You know, Monica,
a room here just came open.

171
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:26,018
You heard what she said.

172
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,030
Dr. Richman didn't know
anything about satanic ritual.

173
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,929
And that proves he was possessed?

174
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,400
You explain to me
how else he commits a crime...

175
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:35,095
that's a perfect
example of it.

176
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:38,003
Let's try the obvious:
It was his accomplice.

177
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,598
[Sampson]
Agents?

178
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:42,109
I, uh, think the man
you're looking for...

179
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,077
might be Paul Gerlach.

180
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:45,170
Is he a patient here?

181
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,944
No. He's a guard.

182
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,313
He's been with us 12 years...

183
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:50,579
and no one can find him.

184
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:53,554
Who would be the last person
who saw them together?

185
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:09,492
Mr. Kobold,
my name is John Doggett.

186
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,590
This is Monica Reyes.

187
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,498
We're with the FBI.

188
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:21,942
The patient in the cell
next to yours escaped last night.

189
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,740
Did you see or hear anything?

190
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,743
You shared the same guard,
Mr. Kobold.

191
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,412
Do you know anything
about their relationship...

192
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:36,754
why he would've
helped him to escape?

193
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,229
You mean, did the guard
force the patient to escape...

194
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:44,300
or did the patient force
the guard...

195
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,701
or are they both
of one mind...

196
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:53,640
like a snake...
eating its own tail?

197
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:58,874
You know something
about this, Mr. Kobold?

198
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:01,416
If you do, we need your help...

199
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:06,080
to stop them before they
hurt more people.

200
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:07,781
You're too late for that.

201
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:10,883
If you're afraid
to help us, Mr. Kobold...

202
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,427
we can protect you.

203
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,463
No harm will come to you.

204
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:17,226
Do you believe in the power
of the devil, Mr. Doggett?

205
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:26,665
I believe that
the devil's a story...

206
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:30,678

207
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,544
Then, how can you
possibly protect me?

208
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:40,580

the devil possessed the surgeon...

Dr. Sampson!

360
00:26:42,425 --> 00:26:43,414
John.

361
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,833
Dr. Sampson?

362
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:46,047
The syringes contain droperidol.

363
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:47,918
That's the same
anti-psychotic medication...

364
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:49,548
that she was giving
to Dr. Richman.

365
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:52,092
He's not the one calling the shots.

366
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,752
You still think
that it was Kobold?

367
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:56,529
This is not about demons.

368
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,532
It's not about demonic possession.

369
00:27:58,634 --> 00:27:59,896
It's about men.

370
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:01,902
Agent Doggett,
have you considered...

371
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:04,495
that something else
might be going on here?

372
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:06,234
I heard you say it, Agent Scully.

373
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:08,810
I heard you tell a classroom
full of FBI cadets.

374
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:11,675
Most evil in the world
comes from men.

375
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:15,239
But I also said that
when science fails...

376
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:18,252
we have to consider
extreme possibilities.

377
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:32,291
I know what you're feeling.

378
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:36,132
I know your frustration.

379
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:38,798
But you can't let it
cloud your objectivity.

380
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:40,466
Agent Reyes is thinking...

381
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,670
just what this guy Kobold
wants her to think...

382
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:46,475
and now you are, too.

383
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:58,458
<i>[Whispering Voices]</i>

384
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,596
Professor, you done
with this meal?

385
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:32,186
I brought you something,
Professor.

386
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:34,319
Something to read.

387
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:40,527
It's a monograph
you wrote six years ago.

388
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:43,730
You know the one
I'm talking about, Professor?

389
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,036
About the influence of Satan
in Renaissance thinking.

390
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:58,910
So, you've found your proof...

391
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:02,286
circumstantial though it may be.

392
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:05,951
You planned this whole thing.

393
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:07,085
I want to know why.

394
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,033
I've been thinking a lot
about you, Agent Doggett.

395
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:15,899
You're not answering
my question, Professor.

396
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:17,734
About why someone so ill-suited...

397
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,000
would draw this duty.

398
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,099
Clearly, you have
feelings for her.

399
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,336
You ordered Dr. Richman...

400
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:24,105
to kill these people, didn't you?

401
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,738
But you can't compete with
the long-lost Agent Mulder.

402
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:29,113
His easy good looks...

403
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,310
his Oxford education...

404
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,886
This is about you, Professor!

405
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:33,978
Mulder has what you can't have...

406
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:36,182
but you stumble forward,
the flat-footed cop...

407
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,886
thinking he can put
handcuffs on a demon.

408
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:40,791
Answer the question!

409
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,090
You want her...

410
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:44,826
but she feels sorry for you.

411
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,767
They both do.

412
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,747
Guard!

413
00:31:07,856 --> 00:31:09,414
Guard, we need a medic!

414
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,959
Guard!

415
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:15,326
We need a medic! Guard!

416
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:45,793
She's coming.

417
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:49,891
As far as I can tell,
physically he's fine.

418
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:52,024
Of course he is.

419
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:53,499
What brought this on?

420
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:56,730
The guy's an expert
in Satanic history.

421
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,500
I confronted him on it.

422
00:31:58,607 --> 00:31:59,904
Which proves what?

423
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,271
Come on, Monica.

424
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,210
You wanted to know who could
stage a textbook example.

425
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:06,008
This guy wrote the damn book.

426
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:07,343
I can't explain...

427
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:09,917
those voices we heard
in his room, or this.

428
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,213
It's a trick.

429
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,480
What if it's ectoplasm?

430
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:13,748
Ectoplasm?

431
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:15,915
You've heard of it,
Agent Scully?

432
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,459
Agent Mulder used to refer
to it as "psychic plasma"...

433
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,892
a residual byproduct of
telepathic communication.

434
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:23,658
In theory, it would have...

435
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:24,733
inorganic properties...

436
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,528
that couldn't be
explained otherwise.

437
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:28,569
So what are we talking now,
the Ghostbusters?

438
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:29,695
If I'm right, an analysis...

439
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:30,965
of this sample could prove...

440
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:32,233
whether he's telling
the truth or faking it.

441
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,740
You can throw that crap away...

442
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:36,436
'cause I can tell you
right now, this guy's a liar.

443
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:37,739
He's playing a game.

444
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:40,781
Well, then, let's just see
how well he plays that game.

445
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:43,511
Why, so you can get
suckered in even more?

446
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:44,517
Listen to you two!

447
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,110
Agent Doggett...

448
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:47,313
Listen, I'm telling you...

449
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,118
this guy threw this stuff up
for our benefit.

450
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:50,521
He knew exactly what you'd say.

451
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:51,854
He knew exactly what I'd say.

452
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,052
He even knew that
the two of you...

453
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:54,561
would be so blinded by
this hocus-pocus...

454
00:32:54,663 --> 00:32:57,223
that you wouldn't see
what's in front of your faces!

455
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:01,030
Agent Reyes is just trying
to get to the truth, okay?

456
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:03,536
What are you doing?

457
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:14,274
Maybe this is a hoax.

458
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,214
Maybe you're right.

459
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:17,376
But now you're saying...

460
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:18,976
we should turn away
from evidence?

461
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:20,385
That's not like you, John.

462
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:21,683

00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,554

Agent Scully, I tried

I'm on my way back to DC.
What is it?

473
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:19,172
Kobold... he told the guard...

00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:21,572
he knows where we can find
Dr. Richman to end this thing.

475
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:23,110
Where?

00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:24,873

00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:50,136
But we know all this already.

540
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:51,205
It was a game.

541
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:53,536
Every move was played out perfectly...

542
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:54,836
except the last one.

543
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:56,934
Not unless that was
part of the game, too.

544
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:58,603
What, to get shot in the back?

545
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:02,479
No. Kobold's body
still hasn't been found.

546
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:03,676
Kobold's dead.

547
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,616
Agent Doggett shot him.
We all saw that.

548
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:09,314
[Doggett]
Did we?

549
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:12,552
Think back
to Agent Reyes's question.

550
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:15,755
Why didn't Kobold escape
with the others...

551
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,593
when he had the chance?

552
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:20,566
Why? Because he wanted to escape...

553
00:41:20,669 --> 00:41:22,694
without anyone knowing
that he'd escaped...

554
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:24,738
so that by the time
it was discovered...

555
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,240
he'd be too far away
for anyone to find him.

556
00:41:27,342 --> 00:41:28,934
Satan.

557
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:33,811
<i>[Doggett] Daemonicus</i>...
<i>the beginning and end of our case.</i>

558
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:36,645
<i>A snake eating its own tail.</i>

559
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:40,016
<i>We lost. Kobold told me so.</i>

560
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:41,281
<i>He wanted us to see...</i>

561
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:43,983
<i>how brilliantly</i>
<i>he played the game.</i>

562
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:47,459
<i>How thoroughly we lost.</i>

563
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:57,900
<i>The first victims,</i>
<i>Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy.</i>

564
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:02,833
Chosen from the phone book.

565
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:03,933
For what reason?

566
00:42:04,045 --> 00:42:06,411
No reason,
other than their names.

567
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,680
And the third victim?

568
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:14,084
The doctor, Monique Sampson.

569
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,486
And the last...

570
00:42:18,593 --> 00:42:22,495
<i>the man whose body</i>
<i>is at the bottom of that river.</i>

571
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:28,566
It's not Kobold.

572
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,662
<i>[Doggett]</i>
<i>The guard we assigned him</i>...

573
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:35,903
<i>the guard he knew he'd have</i>
<i>once we transferred him.</i>

574
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,740
Custer.

575
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:41,843
Checkmate.

576
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:05,165
Something still bothering you,
Agent Reyes?

577
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,510
You don't believe
his explanation?

578
00:43:09,611 --> 00:43:13,274
It all makes sense to me
as far as it goes...

579
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:16,839
but there's something else.

580
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:19,716
Something he's afraid to explain.

581
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:24,383
You mean that you felt
the presence of evil?

582
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:25,754
No.

583
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:32,197
I mean that he felt it, too.

584
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:42,005
<i>[Whispering Voices]</i>

585
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:30,722
<i>[Child]</i>
<i>I made this.</i>
