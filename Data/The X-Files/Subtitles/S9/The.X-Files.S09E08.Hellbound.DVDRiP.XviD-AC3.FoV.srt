what happened.

I'm with the FBI.

176
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,784
I want to ask you some questions
about a John Doe...

177
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:53,727
you did an autopsy on in 1960.

178
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,492
You honestly expect me to recall...

179
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,160
some case from way back when?

180
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,703
I'm 84 years old.

181
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:05,468
Sir, this particular victim
was skinned alive.

182
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:21,313
In all my days, I never saw
anything as inhuman as this.

183
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:26,225
Sir, I haven't located police records
from the investigation.

184
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:29,321
Was there ever a suspect
who was charged or arrested...

185
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:31,332
in this case as far as you know?

186
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:35,200
No suspects, no investigation
for that matter.

187
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,068
I don't understand.

188
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:41,634
The victim was a John Doe...
a nobody.

189
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:45,181
Carl Hobart, the county sheriff,
figured he was a drifter.

190
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,410
Hobart said he didn't want
to stir up the community.

191
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:50,281
And no one called him on that?

192
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:55,188
I tried. The sheriff had other
things on his mind, I suppose.

193
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,953
Why do you say that?

194
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,257
Well, it wasn't long after that
he put a bullet through his head.

195
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,233
What are you thinking, Doctor?

196
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:11,205
This is some copycat murder
40-odd years later?

197
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:15,745
If so, it's the most perfectly
executed that I've ever seen.

198
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:18,040
And why copy an obscure murder...

199
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,446
that nobody's ever even heard of?

200
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,211
A string of murders.

201
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:26,881

- I thought you knew.

202

203
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,857

- Somebody cut 'em.

- Yes.

He had a premonition of his death.

Not the men, but their souls.

386

It doesn't strike you...

392
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:41,522
that these men were all born on the
dates of the previous victims' deaths?

393
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,031
Yeah, it strikes me.

394

the killer is clever.
