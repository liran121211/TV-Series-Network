00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:12,422
Mulder, why are they
doing this to you?

188
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:14,492
They think they're
preparing me for my trial.

189
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:15,582
For my testimony.

190
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:17,389
Your testimony's
not going to matter.

191
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,985
Not with the case
they're building.

192
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:20,359
Not building. Rigging.

193
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,456
Yeah, I don't think
you understand...

194
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,398
the seriousness
of the charges.

195
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,130
This isn't some routine
wrist slapping.

196
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,571
You're on trial for your life.

197
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,039
My trial's
a forgone conclusion.

198
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:32,404
What they really want...

199
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,375
is for me to admit my guilt
and help them out.

200
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,413
What's really on trial
here is the truth.

201
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,948
Mulder, they're saying
you killed a man.

202
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,450
Have they produced a body?

203
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:45,450
You can't produce a body...

204
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:47,047
because you can't kill
the man who won't die.

205
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:49,456
Well, body or not,
they've got...

206
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,620
30 witnesses from
that government facility...

207
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,129
ready to testify
against you.

208
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:55,722
Mulder, we'll get you
the best lawyer.

209
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:59,203
To defend a man
who believes in aliens...

210
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,033
against the FBI
and the military?

211
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,972
It's never going to happen.

212
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:06,066
Skinner can defend me.

213
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:07,872
I can't represent you.

214
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,581
You know all the facts,
the details...

215
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:12,149
the whole government conspiracy.

216
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,512
More than that, I trust you.

217
00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:16,248
Mulder...

218
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:18,720
They can't try me without
exposing themselves.

219
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:21,348
I know what I'm doing.

221
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,457
Whoo, now it's a party.

222
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,562
Agent Mulder.

223
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,137
What's the matter?

224
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,899
We've been working off
what little we have...

225
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:36,496
but the military
just got back to us.

226
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,667
You ready for this?

227
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:41,439
I know this
is impossible...

228
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:44,106
but they're saying they
got Knowle Rohrer's body.

229
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,241
[Scully]
Mulder, it's me.

230
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,538
Is it time to go?

231
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:19,083
No. That's why I'm here.

232
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,146
[Sighs]

233
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:27,088
Mulder, I need you
to talk to me.

234
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:30,957
Confide in me...

235
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:34,259
or we'll lose.

236
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:36,163
We can't win, Scully.

237
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:40,033
We can only hope
to go down fighting.

238
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,505
You're scaring me.

239
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,135
Mulder, I'm so scared that
I've just got you back...

240
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:50,407
and now I'm going
to lose you again.

241
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,814
I know what I'm doing.

242
00:19:58,023 --> 00:20:00,958
Well...

243
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,586
whatever you're doing...

244
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:10,657
you have no idea how much
has already been lost...

245
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,205
what I've had to do.

246
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,705
I do know.

247
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,971
Skinner told me.

248
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:26,811
Our son, Mulder...

249
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:29,182
I gave him up.

252
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:42,393
I'm so afraid you could
never forgive me.

253
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,128
I know you had no choice.

254
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,801
I just missed
both of you so much.

255
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,114
God, where
have you been?

256
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,119
Where have you been hiding?

257
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:07,015
In New Mexico.

258
00:21:09,494 --> 00:21:11,189
Doing what?

259
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:13,821
Looking for the truth.

261
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,568
[Laughing]

262
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,446
You found something,
didn't you?

263
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:31,776
Huh?

264
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:37,748
What did you find?

265
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,390
I can't tell you.

266
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:46,987
You found something
in that facility?

267
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,192
That's what
you were doing, right?

268
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,303
Mulder, what did you find
out there?

269
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:57,237
Scully, I can't tell you.

270
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,333
That doesn't make sense.

271
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:03,103
You've got to trust me, Scully.

272
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:07,412
I know things
it's better you don't.

<i>[Door Creaking Open]</i>

274
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:42,141

I'm out of the
L.A. Field Office.

278
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:48,751
How did you get this assignment?

279
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,760
I was a federal
prosecutor in D. C...

280
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:52,659
before joining the FBI.
And you?

281
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:55,733
That's a good question.

282
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:23,917
Let's bring in the defendant.

283
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,759
This proceeding
is called to order.

284
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,765
Mr. Kallenbrunner...

285
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,334
you may proceed.

286
00:23:31,436 --> 00:23:34,269
I have no witnesses to call.

287
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,863
I will submit to
the court, however...

288
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,101
the sworn testimony...

289
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,471
of 30 men and women
who saw the crime.

290
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,804
Assistant Director.

291
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:45,109
I move to dismiss these
proceedings on the grounds...

292
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,309
it violates the accused's
rights to a fair trail.

293
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:48,476
I'm not a lawyer.

294
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:49,712
You're not a judge.

295
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:51,721
This is not
a court of law.

296
00:23:51,823 --> 00:23:54,018
[Kersh]
This is a military court of law.

297
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,491
You may want
to familiarize yourself...

298
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:59,392
with Title Ten
of the U.S. Code.

299
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:01,488
But I suggest
you call a witness.

300
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,157
Then I move to delay this trail.

301
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:05,395
My central witness,
Marita Covarrubias...

302
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:07,027
works for the
United Nations...

303
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:08,366
and I can't
locate her.

304
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:09,599
And I've received no help...

305
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:11,470
from the U.S. Government
locating her.

306
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,305
I have to deny that request.

307
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,641
Do you have another witness,
Mr. Skinner?

308
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,907
I'll call a witness...

309
00:24:17,015 --> 00:24:18,983
but I would like to do so
under protest.

310
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,516
Both the panel's judgments...

311
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:22,813

Excuse me?

00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:27,252
This isn't a

315
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:29,087
As you've so kindly...

316
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:30,524

[Skinner]
Please state your name for the court.

322
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,773
My name is Dana
Katherine Scully.

323
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,713
I was assigned nine
years ago to the X-Files...

324
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:53,784
to spy on Agent Mulder...

325
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:58,015
whose methods
the FBI distrusted.

326
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:02,354
Assigned not just as an agent,
but as a medical doctor.

327
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,451
A scientist.

328
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:05,961
And as a serious scientist...

329
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:08,658
you came to believe
in Agent Mulder's theories.

330
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,769
I came to believe...

331
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:14,736
<i>in the existence</i>
<i>of extraterrestrial life.</i>

332
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,363
[Gunshot]

333
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,408
<i>And in a conspiracy</i>
<i>inside the government...</i>

334
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:22,036
to keep their existence
a secret.

335
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,307
[Skinner]
The proof was...

336
00:25:24,415 --> 00:25:26,076
overwhelming.

337
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:28,846
It was even scientifically
undeniable.

338
00:25:28,953 --> 00:25:30,147
I believe...

339
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:33,246
as do many respected scientists...

340
00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:37,818
that life came to Earth
millions of years ago...

341
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:40,921
<i>from a meteor or a rock</i>
<i>from Mars.</i>

342
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:45,059
So, what you're saying is,
life... human life...

343
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,727
is extraterrestrial...

344
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:47,998
by definition.

345
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:49,505
[Kallenbrunner]
Objection. What does this...

346
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,131
nonsense have to do with Mulder...

347
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:52,436
murdering a man
in cold blood?

348
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:53,976
Agent Scully will prove...

349
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:55,943
that a government conspiracy
exists to deny the existence...

350
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:57,207
of extraterrestrials.

351
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:00,409
You are not here

352
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,281
Mr. Skinner.

353
00:26:02,387 --> 00:26:04,446
You are here to defend
Fox Mulder.

354
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:05,852
And I'm trying to do that.

355
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:07,822
It's your case, Mr. Skinner.

356
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:15,459
So, a meteor
crashed to Earth...

357
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:17,830
but along with the biological
building blocks on it...

358
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,835
there was something else...

359
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:21,564
an alien virus.

360
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:22,764
[Scully]
I believe...

361
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:23,863
there was a virus...

362
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:25,670

prehistorically.

363
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:30,305
<i>I believe that virus</i>
<i>infected early man...</i>

364

<i>and transformed his physiology.</i>

365
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:35,376
<i>[Skinner]</i>
<i>Changed him into something else.</i>

366
00:26:35,486 --> 00:26:38,250
<i>[Scully]</i>
<i>Into an alien life-form himself.</i>

367
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:40,483
<i>[Skinner]</i>
<i>And what happened...</i>

368
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:42,252
to these aliens?

369
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,729
They died in the last ice age
35,000 years ago.

370
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:48,389
And the virus?

371
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:53,300
It lay dormant underground
until it surfaced once again...

372
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,838
during our current
geologic period.

373
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,204
And the government knows
of this?

374
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:00,641
The government learned...

375
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:05,011
of this virus in 1947

376
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:08,916
<i>when a UFO crashed</i>
<i>in Roswell, New Mexico.</i>

377
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,420
A UFO crash revealed the virus?

378
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:13,513
The virus thrived underground...

379
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:14,716
<i>in petroleum deposits.</i>

380
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:17,386
<i>In black oil.</i>

381
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:19,224
<i>It has sentience.</i>

382
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,264
<i>It can think.</i>

383
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:22,855
<i>It has the ability</i>
<i>to communicate...</i>

384
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,992
<i>and it communicated...</i>

385
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,399
with the UFOs.

386
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:29,166
And the government knows <i>this,</i>
too.

387
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:38,075
In Roswell, they
captured aliens...

388
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:40,673
from the spacecraft
wreckage.

389
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:44,915
<i>They salvaged various</i>
<i>alien technology from them...</i>

390
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:46,683
<i>and from their data banks...</i>

391
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,625
they learned of the alien plan
to recolonize the Earth.

392
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:52,093
[Kersh]
Is this all...

393
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:53,288
leading anywhere?

394
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:54,455
[Mulder]
Yeah.

395
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:56,430
The destruction of mankind.

396
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:59,025
I'll warn you once,
Agent Mulder.

397
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,207
[Skinner] And what did
the government do with this...

398
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,403
information
of an alien takeover?

399
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,811
They kept it a dark secret.

400
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:12,109
If it had gotten out...

401
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:14,207
there would
have been wild panic.

402
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,081
Mr. Skinner, are we finished?

403
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:18,212
No. There's the matter
of Agent Scully's own abduction...

404
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,414
in 1994.

405
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:20,821
Abduction by whom?

406
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:22,222
By the military...

407
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,988
<i>working with the government</i>
<i>conspirators...</i>

408
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:28,031
<i>to develop a breed</i>
<i>ofhuman-alien hybrids...</i>

409
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:31,465
<i>that the aliens would use</i>
<i>as a slave race.</i>

410
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:34,094
[Skinner]
Thank you, Agent Scully.

411
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:36,070
Your witness, Mr. Kallenbrunner.

412
00:28:41,212 --> 00:28:43,806
All these E.T. S running around.

413
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:46,645
It's hard to keep these aliens straight
without a scorecard.

414
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,742
I myself have never
seen an alien.

415
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,753
Could we call one as a witness?

416
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,686
You're being facetious.

417
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,758
No, I'm not. I'd just like
to see some proof.

418
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,089
There are the Mars rocks...

419
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,287
No. I need something good.

420
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:00,830
Something amazing.

421
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:02,729
Something really cool.

422
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,131
I don't know what you mean.

423
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,965
Well, what I mean is,
you have no proof...

424
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:08,766
to back up one word
you just told us.

425
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,864
Agent Scully,
isn't it true...

426
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:13,705
that you and Mulder were lovers,
and you got pregnant...

427
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:14,903
and had his
love child?

428
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:16,070
Objection!

429
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,272
Thank you. Next witness.

430
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,514
Can you state
your full name?

431
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:02,115
Jeffrey Frank Spender.

432
00:30:06,564 --> 00:30:07,758
Mr. Spender...

433
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,332
I know you didn't hear
Mr. Kallenbrunner...

434
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,867
but he'd like to make
a mockery of the X-Files.

435
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,437
You worked on the
X-Files yourself.

436
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,005
Yes, until three years ago.

437
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:18,735
When you were shot
in the X-Files office.

438
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:20,333
- <i>Shot by your own father.</i>
- [Gunshot]

439
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,207
Can I ask you to please
tell the court...

440
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:23,678
exactly who your father was?

441
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,305
He led the government conspiracy...

442
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,077
to exploit the existence
of aliens.

443
00:30:27,184 --> 00:30:28,276
Objection.

444
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:29,819
There's no government
conspiracy...

445
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,387
that I've seen
established here.

446
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:32,922
I agree with Mr. Kallenbrunner.

447
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,514
I don't see where this is going.

448
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,719
If I can prove this conspiracy,
it will justify Mulder's actions...

449
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:39,853
and you will have no choice
but to acquit.

450
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,125
I hope
this isn't the entire basis...

451
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:44,167
of your defense, Mr. Skinner.

452
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,964
[Sighs]

453
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:53,270
You have a relationship
to Agent Mulder...

454
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:54,844
don't you,
Mr. Spender?

455
00:30:54,945 --> 00:30:56,640
He's my half-brother.

456
00:30:56,747 --> 00:30:59,147
<i>His mother had an affair</i>
<i>with my father.</i>

457
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,842
[Skinner]
But he never knew that.

458
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:03,419
Not until he met you
at the FBI.

459
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:05,250
He didn't know both his father
and mine were...

460
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:06,482
in the alien conspiracy.

461
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,184
<i>His father was</i>
<i>a reluctant member.</i>

462
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:11,557
<i>When Agent Mulder began</i>
<i>to know the truth...</i>

463
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,722
<i>about this connection,</i>
<i>my father had his father killed...</i>

464
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,925
<i>by an assassin</i>
<i>named Alex Krycek.</i>

465
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:19,730
<i>[Skinner]</i>
<i>He killed him to silence him?</i>

466
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,271
Mulder's father lived his life
in shame.

467
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:23,601
<i>Not for the conspiracy...</i>

468
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:27,735
<i>but for a terrible decision</i>
<i>he made.</i>

469
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,676
<i>[Skinner]</i>
<i>Involving Agent Mulder's sister.</i>

470
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,145
<i>[Spender]</i>
<i>The aliens distrusted...</i>

471
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:33,478
their human collaborators.

472
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:36,348
<i>Members of the conspiracy</i>
<i>were made to surrender...</i>

473
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:38,684
<i>family members</i>
<i>as human collateral.</i>

474
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:42,020
So, Mulder's father gave up
Mulder's sister.

475
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:45,186
His own
eight-year-old daughter.

476
00:31:45,296 --> 00:31:46,957
[Spender]
Mulder witnessed his sister...

477
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:48,656
<i>being abducted by aliens.</i>

478
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:51,200
<i>It haunted him to no end.</i>

479
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:54,203
<i>It's why he pursued</i>
<i>the X-Files.</i>

480
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:56,102
What became of her? Samantha?

481
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,868
She was returned.

482
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:01,001
She was sent to California
where we were raised together.

483
00:32:03,948 --> 00:32:08,681
She was taken many more times
and suffered horrible tests.

484
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:11,619
[Skinner]
Mulder spent years looking for her...

485
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,849
several times
thinking that he'd found her.

486
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,448
But he was tricked.

487
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,960
<i>[Spender] Samantha was part</i>
<i>of the cloning experiment...</i>

488
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,395
<i>done by the conspiracy.</i>

489
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:23,694
She herself died in 1987.

490
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:30,898
[Skinner]
By your own father's hand...

491
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:33,033
essentially.

492
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:34,975
[Spender]
When I went to work for the FBI...

493
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,274
I didn't know
of my father's crimes.

494
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:39,281
When I stood up to him,
he shot me.

495
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:40,680
When I didn't die...

496
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:43,117
<i>he subjected me</i>
<i>to the same horrible tests.</i>

497
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:51,954
Your witness.

498
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:03,064
[Kallenbrunner] Mr. Spender,
I'm sorry for your suffering.

499
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:07,201
I'm sure none of us can really
imagine what it's like.

500
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:10,178
Your father must be brought
to justice.

501
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,839
I believe my father
is dead.

502
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:20,755
Mr. Spender, you're here...

503
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:23,452
to speak for the character
of Agent Mulder.

504
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:26,689
In reports you filed
while an FBI agent...

505
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,595
I see here you describe Mulder
as "arrogant...

506
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,260
difficult,
a control freak...

507
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:34,098
widely disliked
by his peers."

508
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,400
Those reports were written
before I knew the truth.

509
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:37,769
This report calls him "unstable...

510
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,844
<i>prone to violent outbursts. "</i>

511
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,207
<i>I have the report right here...</i>

512
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,406
if your memory
needs refreshing.

513
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:54,952
Thank you, Mr. Spender.

514
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:28,882
[Young Man]
You found out about Mulder?

515
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:32,923
You found out he's in trouble.

516
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:44,339
I'll get ready now.

517
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:06,422
[Mulder] I know why you're
here and what you want.

518
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,431
I can't give it to you.

519
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:10,830
Make them a deal, Mulder.

520
00:35:10,935 --> 00:35:12,266
Guilty on a lesser charge.

521
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:13,563
Maybe they'll go for it...

522
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:15,605
and they'll let you
walk out of here.

523
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:18,004
I'd rather die, Scully.

524
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:19,302
How can you say that?

525
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,038
How can you say that, Mulder,
to me?

526
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:25,081
Because this is greater
than you or me.

527
00:35:25,182 --> 00:35:27,810
This is about everything
we worked for for nine years.

528
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,909
The truth that we both
sacrificed so much...

529
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,214
to uncover and to expose.

530
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:33,290
Well, then, expose it, Mulder!

531
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,516
Take the stand.

532
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,286
Whatever it is that
you're withholding...

533
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:38,361
take the stand
and hit them full force.

534
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:40,020
I can't.

535
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,064
Why?

536
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,760
I just can't.

537
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:50,266
You say this is greater than us,
and maybe it is...

538
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:54,640
but this is <i>us</i> fighting
this fight, Mulder, not you.

539
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:56,406
It's you and me.

540
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:57,912
That's what
I'm fighting for, Mulder.

541
00:35:58,015 --> 00:35:59,175
You and me.

542
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:27,374
[Man]
Get up.

543
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:29,275
Who's that?

544
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,314
Who's there?

545
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:39,613
What are you doing here?

546
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:41,816
That's what I'm here to ask you.

547
00:36:45,362 --> 00:36:48,058
I'm putting the truth on trial.

548
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,065
What truth?

549
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:53,000
Whose truth?

550
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:55,697
You think these men
will even hear it?

551
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:57,239
They're afraid to hear it.

552
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,502
They're not afraid.

553
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,704
They have too much power
to be afraid.

554
00:37:02,813 --> 00:37:06,305
You're going to learn that
just like I did.

555
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:08,442
You'll die learning it.

556
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:10,520
I'm not afraid of that.

557
00:37:10,621 --> 00:37:12,111
There's a truth...

558
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:14,053
even you're afraid to speak now...

559
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:15,819
because you know it's futile.

560
00:37:15,926 --> 00:37:17,052
No.

561
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:19,595
Because I refuse to accept it.

562
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,960
Then you're going to need help.

563
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:24,796
How can you possibly help me?

564
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:50,526
They said this is where I could
find the body, at Fort Marlene.

565
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:53,187
Right.

566
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:55,857
The deceased's name
is Knowle Rohrer, former Marine...

567
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:57,991
last employed
by the D.O.D.

568
00:37:58,102 --> 00:37:59,763
No, I don't want
to call back.

569
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,861
I want to talk to
your superior...

570
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:03,963
[Phone Disconnects]

571
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,065
Son of a bitch hung up on me!

572
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:07,541
Shh.

573
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:10,878
There's somebody in your yard.

574
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,281
Where is he?

575
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:19,048
He was at
the back door.

576
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,297
I got him.

577
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,527
He's coming around.

578
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:43,440
Stay where
you are!

579
00:38:43,547 --> 00:38:45,071
Federal agent!
Hands in the air!

580
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:55,022
Who are you?

581
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,558
What are you doing
skulking around my house?

582
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,355
I didn't want
to be seen.

583
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,054
I don't want to endanger him.

584
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:01,791
Who are you talking about?

585
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,833
Someone who wants
to help Mulder.

586
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:23,078
State your full name
for the court.

587
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:25,451
Marita Covarrubias.

588
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:27,854
And your
former government title?

589
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:31,894
Special Representative to the
Secretary General of the U.N.

590
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,622
The United Nations.

591
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,325
<i>Aposition giving you</i>
<i>unrestricted access...</i>

592
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,026
<i>to countries and leaders</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

593
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:40,398
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

594
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:41,801
Yes.

595
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,897
How did you
use this power?

596
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,704
Basically, to further
the interests...

597
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:49,210
of a secretive group of men...

598
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:51,281
who called themselves
the Syndicate.

599
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:53,542
What were their interests?

600
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,551
Developing an
alien virus vaccine...

601
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:59,247
before the Russians
developed one.

602
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,517
And how'd they
go about that?

603
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,991
By testing innocent civilians...

604
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:05,493
<i>all over the world.</i>

605
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:08,394
<i>Test subjects were tracked</i>
<i>through DNA identifiers...</i>

606
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:10,625
in their smallpox
vaccination scars.

607
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:13,731
Without the subjects'
knowledge?

608
00:40:13,837 --> 00:40:14,997
Mostly.

609
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:16,106
<i>Some developed suspicions.</i>

610
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:17,038
<i>Some developed suspicions.</i>

611
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,505
<i>I saw Russians...</i>

612
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,770
<i>who cut off their arms</i>
<i>to prevent being tracked.</i>

613
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,435
<i>[Skinner]</i>
<i>As they did to an American man...</i>

614
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,173
<i>that you worked</i>
<i>quite intimately with.</i>

615
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:26,408
<i>[Covarrubias]</i>
<i>Yes. Alex Krycek.</i>

616
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:30,344
Did you believe
in the Syndicate?

617
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:32,615
In their
international conspiracy?

618
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:33,747
No.

619
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:35,791
I was paid for my access.

620
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,019
In fact, you came
to hate them.

621
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:39,117
Yes.

622
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,423
It's why I helped Agent Mulder...

623
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,519
when he approached me.

624
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:43,759
But you were
found out.

625
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:46,062
And the Syndicate
punished you for this.

626
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:53,636
They turned me into a...

627
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:57,942
<i>a test subject.</i>

628
00:40:58,048 --> 00:40:59,743
<i>[Skinner]</i>
<i>Testing what?</i>

629
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:03,313
They were pretending to work
with the aliens...

630
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,150
to infect the entire population
with an alien virus...

631
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:09,191
but the conspirators
were trying to save themselves...

632
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:12,660
by secretly and selfishly
developing a vaccine.

633
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,129
The conspirators believed
all life in the universe...

634
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:17,029
had been infected
with the virus...

635
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:20,126
<i>including a race of shape-shifting</i>
<i>alien bounty hunters...</i>

636
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:22,467
<i>who policed the conspiracy</i>
<i>for the aliens.</i>

637
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:23,869
But they were wrong...

638
00:41:23,974 --> 00:41:26,033
and it led to the destruction
of the conspiracy.

639
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:28,407
And who destroyed it?

640
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:32,209
A group of renegade aliens
who had avoided infection...

641
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:34,978
<i>with the virus</i>
<i>through self-disfigurement.</i>

642
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:37,246
And the conspirators
themselves...

643
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:38,821
What happened to them?

644
00:41:38,922 --> 00:41:41,083
They're all dead now...

645
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:43,921
<i>killed by these same</i>
<i>faceless aliens.</i>

646
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:48,158
Then what are you afraid of now?

647
00:41:51,368 --> 00:41:54,860
Why resist testifying
here today?

648
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,642
Because the conspiracy continues...

649
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:06,307
just in another form
by other men.

650
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,747
Objection.

651
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:10,285
Mr. Skinner can't ask questions
and give the answers.

652
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:11,376
Sustained.

653
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,012
Fox Mulder's on trial
for murder here.

654
00:42:13,123 --> 00:42:14,784
The man he's
accused of killing...

655
00:42:14,891 --> 00:42:16,153
is one of these
new conspirators.

656
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:17,783
An alien replacement
for a human being.

657
00:42:17,894 --> 00:42:19,919
What they're calling
a Super Soldier.

658
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,396
You can prove this,
can't you?

659
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,935
You know who these men are,
don't you?

660
00:42:26,036 --> 00:42:28,061
Ms. Covarrubias?

661
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:35,238
They'll kill her.

662
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,210
Ms. Covarrubias,
I asked you a question.

663
00:42:37,314 --> 00:42:38,246
I need an answer.

664
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,906
No.

665
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:48,991
It's okay.

666
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,218
Let her go.

667
00:42:50,327 --> 00:42:51,726
What the hell
are you doing, Mulder?

668
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:53,625
She's the last best
witness that we have.

669
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,254
Doesn't matter.

670
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:07,771
Thank you, Ms. Covarrubias.

671
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:12,306
I got nothing else.

672
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,631
Assistant Director.

673
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:48,447
I have an unscheduled witness
that I'd like to call here today.

674
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,815
- No, not him.
- Mulder, sit down.

675
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,719
You don't understand.
I'm trying to protect that boy.

676
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:55,792
Well, now he's here
to protect you.

677
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:58,991
[Kersh]
Mr. Kallenbrunner...

678
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,360
do you have any objections
to this... witness?

679
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:04,229
Not like Mr. Mulder here does.

680
00:44:09,806 --> 00:44:12,070
[Skinner]
Can you tell us your name?

681
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:13,836
Gibson Andrew Praise.

682
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,809
Do you know this man?

683
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:17,903
Yes. He's my friend.

684
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:21,442
I hid him in the desert
for the last year.

685
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:24,076
Mulder met you
as a chess prodigy.

686
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:26,712
<i>Your life was endangered because of</i>
<i>your highly unusual brain activity.</i>

687
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:29,792
Cut to the chase, Mr. Skinner.

688
00:44:29,893 --> 00:44:33,260
Gibson Praise
can read people's minds.

689
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:35,422
Mulder and Scully
proved this scientifically.

690
00:44:35,532 --> 00:44:40,196
There's a certain junk DNA
which all humans share...

691
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,237
but has no apparent function.

692
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:45,035
Gibson's junk DNA
is functional...

693
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,132
DNA which is believed
to be alien.

694
00:44:47,244 --> 00:44:49,041
You're trying to tell us
this boy can read minds?

695
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,204
Yes.

696
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,407
He's reading your mind
right now.

697
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:57,243
And the minds
of the judges, too?

698
00:44:58,255 --> 00:44:59,882
Yes.

699
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:07,428
Even his.

700
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:14,067
And what makes him so special?

701
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:17,931
He's not human.

702
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:21,534
He's one of them.

703
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:23,112
One of them!
I want that man examined!

704
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:24,612
Mr. Skinner, control him.

705
00:45:24,714 --> 00:45:26,238
- Mulder!
- You're afraid!

706
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,647
You're afraid of what I know!
You're afraid of the truth!

707
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,240
Where's Gibson?

708
00:45:58,348 --> 00:46:00,714
He's with Scully:
In good hands.

709
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:02,910
[Doggett]
We spent the night talking to him.

710
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:04,077
Gibson knows
you're concerned.

711
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:05,279
We're protecting him now.

712
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,912
He shouldn't have done
what he did...

713
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:08,320
exposing himself like that.

714
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:09,858
Well, the boy was
trying to protect you...

715
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,359
and it looks like
it may have worked.

716
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:12,951
He says three judges
are wavering.

717
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:14,394
They're leaning
in your favor.

718
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:17,398
It's going to take a little more
than that...

719
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,933
the way things
are going.

720
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:20,832
We were never going to win.

721
00:46:20,937 --> 00:46:23,269
Take the stand, Mulder.

722
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:24,670
Testify.

723
00:46:24,774 --> 00:46:25,832
No.

724
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:27,239
Then we'll testify,
me and Monica.

725
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:29,107
No.

726
00:46:29,212 --> 00:46:30,611
Both of us have seen too much...

727
00:46:30,714 --> 00:46:32,238
Listen to me,
they'll destroy you.

728
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:33,941
They'll put you out
on the street.

729
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,915
What's left for us
on the X-Files?

730
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:37,646
We came to this job...

731
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:38,743
to give it our best.

732
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:39,844
It's the way we're going
to leave.

733
00:46:41,691 --> 00:46:44,182
It's not about how good you are.

734
00:46:44,294 --> 00:46:45,989
They control the game.

735
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:47,120
They own it.

736
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,528
Then let's shove it up
their ass.

737
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:53,498
Mr. Skinner?

738
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:57,664
I'd like to call
John Doggett.

739
00:47:07,584 --> 00:47:09,677
[Skinner]
Agent Doggett...

740
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:13,017
you've been on the X-Files
for two years.

741
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:15,489
And with all that you've seen...

742
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:19,619
how do you feel about this term
"paranormal"?

743
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:22,698
Well, the way I look at it,
calling something paranormal...

744
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,165
is just a way of avoiding
a real explanation.

745
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:27,566
You're a skeptic.

746
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:29,332
But I see here in your own
case reports...

747
00:47:29,439 --> 00:47:31,134
some very detailed descriptions
of things...

748
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,902
that a skeptic would never
believe in...

749
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:34,374
these so-called Super Soldiers.

750
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,001
Well, that's a whole
different deal.

751
00:47:36,112 --> 00:47:38,171
[Skinner]
In what way?

752
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:39,509
'Cause I've seen 'em...

753
00:47:39,616 --> 00:47:42,176
<i>with my own eyes, ;</i>
<i>shot... drowned...</i>

754
00:47:42,285 --> 00:47:44,014
<i>even ground up</i>
<i>in a garbage truck.</i>

755
00:47:46,122 --> 00:47:48,590
And they just come right back
to life.

756
00:47:51,895 --> 00:47:53,123
What are they?

757
00:47:53,229 --> 00:47:54,856
Well, the best I can figure...

758
00:47:54,964 --> 00:47:57,694
they're some kind
of secret military project...

759
00:47:57,801 --> 00:47:59,564
ordinary men made invincible.

760
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,466
Objection.

761
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:04,039
What does this science fiction
have to do with anything?

762
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,539
[Skinner]
Agent Doggett is going to tell you...

763
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:07,576
that the man that Mulder
is accused of killing...

764
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,042
is a Super Soldier.

765
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:11,545
A man that Agent Doggett
served with in the marines.

766
00:48:11,648 --> 00:48:13,775
Name of Knowle Rohrer.

767
00:48:13,883 --> 00:48:15,111
Objection.

768
00:48:15,218 --> 00:48:16,913
Agent Doggett was not
present at the murder...

769
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,817
nor has he seen or
examined the victim.

770
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:20,116
That's because I've been getting...

771
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,520
the bum's rush
from the government.

772
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:22,921
Objection sustained.

773
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:29,121
Well, then, let me ask you,
Agent Doggett...

774
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:32,497
if a Super Soldier
is invincible...

775
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:36,163
how could Mulder possibly
have killed this man?

776
00:48:36,272 --> 00:48:37,261
He couldn't.

777
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:40,435
The way I
understand it...

778
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,909
they only way to kill
a Super Soldier...

779
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:44,741
<i>is with some rare metal.</i>

780
00:48:44,848 --> 00:48:47,908
<i>Agent Scully says it's a form</i>
<i>of magnetite from some meteor...</i>

781
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:49,348
that fell to Earth.

782
00:48:49,452 --> 00:48:51,613
And Mulder's not accused
of doing that, is he?

783
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:53,416
No, sir.

784
00:48:56,326 --> 00:48:57,987
Your witness.

785
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:06,501
Agent Doggett...

786
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:09,504
in going over
your files...

787
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:12,200
I must say... it's an
honor to speak to a man...

788
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:14,003
whose record is distinguished...

789
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,543
by such duty
to his country.

790
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:16,669
Now, I'm not going...

791
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,111
to doubt a man
of your integrity...

792
00:49:18,214 --> 00:49:19,875
Agent Doggett,
even if he tells me a story...

793
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:21,883
I find too incredible
to believe.

794
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:24,681
Thank you.

795
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:26,949
Just as you must not doubt
the integrity of Fox Mulder...

796
00:49:27,056 --> 00:49:29,456
on whose behalf
you're here to testify.

797
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:31,527
Correct.

798
00:49:31,628 --> 00:49:33,255
Even if Mulder...

799
00:49:33,363 --> 00:49:37,322
believes these so-called
Super Soldiers are aliens?

800
00:49:43,206 --> 00:49:45,504
He believes they're aliens,
you know.

801
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:48,405
You said you were a skeptic.

802
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:49,443
That's right.

803
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:51,070
So an alien conspiracy...

804
00:49:51,181 --> 00:49:53,615
which Mulder has built
his defense on...

805
00:49:53,716 --> 00:49:56,514
must be entirely unbelievable
to you, too.

806
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:06,188
[Sighs]

807
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:15,930
My name is Monica Reyes.

808
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:17,597
I've been with the FBI
since 1990.

809
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:20,107
Before coming onto the X-Files,
Agent Reyes...

810
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,542
you worked in the New Orleans
field office...

811
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:25,136
investigating cases
of satanic ritual abuse.

812
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:26,579
I did.

813
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:28,981
Did you ever prosecute
any of these satanic cases?

814
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:30,416
- No.
- For God's sake...

815
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,852
Mr. Skinner, we're
trying a man for murder...

816
00:50:32,956 --> 00:50:35,186
not taking a trip
down memory lane.

817
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,725
I'm showing the court
that Agent Reyes...

818
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,727
is levelheaded and objective...

819
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,126
on strange
and extraordinary cases.

820
00:50:41,231 --> 00:50:42,129
That her belief in aliens...

821
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:43,756
comes from firsthand
experience.

822
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:45,562
And she can offer
you hard proof...

823
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,499
that there is an
alien conspiracy!

824
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:50,937
I was called on last year
to protect Agent Scully...

825
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,974
who was pregnant
and whose life was in danger...

826
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:54,202
because of her pregnancy.

827
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,608
What does this have
to do with aliens?

828
00:50:56,713 --> 00:50:58,943
I drove Agent Scully
to a secluded location...

829
00:50:59,048 --> 00:51:00,481
<i>in Georgia...</i>

830
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,244
<i>where it was believed</i>
<i>she could deliver safely.</i>

831
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:04,786
But we soon discovered
we weren't alone.

832
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:07,254
<i>I was attacked</i>
<i>and had to defend myself...</i>

833
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:09,348
<i>against an assailant,</i>
<i>who was shot...</i>

834
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:11,154
at pointblank range.

835
00:51:11,261 --> 00:51:12,990
Who should have died,
but didn't.

836
00:51:13,096 --> 00:51:15,189
<i>This assailant was then joined</i>
<i>by others like him...</i>

837
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:18,563
<i>who surrounded Agent Scully and me,</i>
<i>and witnessed her...</i>

838
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:20,465
as she gave birth
to her son.

839
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,401
[Kallenbrunner]
Witnessed her?

840
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:24,166
What do you mean?

841
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:26,765
We were confused as well.

842
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,537
But we came to understand
that her son...

843
00:51:28,645 --> 00:51:29,703
<i>was a kind of miracle child.</i>

844
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:31,939
<i>Its birth was all important...</i>

845
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,710
to these people:
These so-called Super Soldiers...

846
00:51:34,817 --> 00:51:39,413
who I believe are humans
replaced by aliens.

847
00:51:39,522 --> 00:51:40,853
Why would Scully's child...

848
00:51:40,957 --> 00:51:42,948
be important to aliens,
Agent Reyes?

849
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:45,118
<i>[Reyes]</i>
<i>We came to learn that Scully...</i>

850
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:47,025
<i>was one of a number</i>
<i>of random women...</i>

851
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,722
<i>who had miraculous childbirths.</i>

852
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:51,061
And these women
all had been abducted...

853
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,135
as part of a government program...

854
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,431
to secretly manipulate
their biology...

855
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:56,971
<i>operating offshore</i>
<i>on a navy ship...</i>

856
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,871
<i>using these women</i>
<i>as surrogates.</i>

857
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:01,409
Surrogates?

858
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:03,069
For alien babies.

859
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:05,579
To create a slave race.

860
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:06,580
Yes.

861
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:08,082
A program...

862
00:52:08,184 --> 00:52:12,052
conducted by the navy,
on a ship which is where?

863
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:13,486
<i>The ship housing this program...</i>

864
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,420
<i>was exploded</i>
<i>on a Baltimore dock.</i>

865
00:52:15,525 --> 00:52:18,289
So, in other words,
we have no true evidence...

866
00:52:18,394 --> 00:52:19,588
past your good word.

867
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:29,026
You claim Scully gave birth
to one of these alien babies.

868
00:52:29,138 --> 00:52:31,265
How can you be sure of this,
Agent Reyes?

869
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:32,602
I saw her child
do things...

870
00:52:32,709 --> 00:52:34,540
that could be explained
no other way.

871
00:52:34,644 --> 00:52:37,977
<i>I saw him display</i>
<i>amazing powers.</i>

872
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:39,173
<i>He'd move objects...</i>

873
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:40,715
- with his mind.
- Really?

874
00:52:40,817 --> 00:52:41,715
Do you think
we could arrange...

875
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:43,046
a demonstration for the court...

876
00:52:43,152 --> 00:52:44,551
that we could
see that ourselves?

877
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:45,712
No.

878
00:52:45,822 --> 00:52:47,847
The child was given up
for adoption...

879
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,447
to an anonymous family.

880
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:52,119
She gave up...

881
00:52:52,228 --> 00:52:53,820
the miracle child?

882
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,557
The proof
of everything...

883
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:58,429
that she and Mulder claim
that they've risked their lives for...

884
00:52:58,534 --> 00:53:00,468
over the last
nine years...

885
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,800
she just sent it off
to some strangers?

886
00:53:02,905 --> 00:53:04,270
Yes, to protect him!

887
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:06,001
Thank you, Agent Reyes.
That's all.

888
00:53:10,713 --> 00:53:13,147
You don't care about that child...

889
00:53:13,249 --> 00:53:15,444
or what Scully
had to sacrifice.

890
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:18,076
You're only too happy she had to
give it up so there's no proof.

891
00:53:18,187 --> 00:53:18,915
Agent Reyes.

892
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:20,011

over the past nine years...

00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:33,635
to pretend
that my victories mattered...

976
00:58:33,736 --> 00:58:36,136

that no one was keeping score.

do not fear the truth...

if there are enough liars.

979
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:44,503
That the devil
is just one man with a plan...

00:58:44,613 --> 00:58:48,014
but evil, true evil,
is a collaboration of men...

have here today.

If I am a
guilty man...

983
00:58:53,522 --> 00:58:58,960
my crime is in daring to believe
that the truth will out...

984

and that no one lie
can live forever.

985

Why don't you just finish

we'll talk?

We're very worried

Why risk perfect

1087

Why risk your lives?

1088
01:08:00,802 --> 01:08:02,599
Because I need
to know the truth.

My name is Fox Mulder.

Do you understand me?

1106
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:19,206
Mulder,
what is this?

1107
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:21,637
I was sent a message...

1108
01:10:21,743 --> 01:10:25,008
and a key to the government
facility at Mount Weather.

1109
01:10:25,113 --> 01:10:27,013
The Indians said
it was from a wise man...

1110
01:10:27,115 --> 01:10:28,548
who lived in the ruins.

1111
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,208

What's the matter,

1115
01:11:05,153 --> 01:11:06,711
You come to see the wise man...

1116
01:11:06,822 --> 01:11:09,017
but you look as if
you've seen a ghost.

1117
01:11:09,124 --> 01:11:10,648
You're no wise man.

1118

You're a dead man.

01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:44,554
I helped you find it.

1130
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:45,819
You didn't help me.

1131
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:48,225
You sent me
to that government facility...

1132
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,127
knowing exactly what I'd find.

1133

01:11:53,235 --> 01:11:55,999
Not to Scully,
not to anyone.

1135
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,072

saved your life.

The power to do nothing.

with you when we first met...

1216
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:15,592
and I tried to convince
you of the truth.

Not because you were
afraid or broken...

but because you didn't
want to accept defeat.

1228

Well, I was afraid of what
knowing would do to you.

01:24:14,408 --> 01:24:18,037
as part of something
greater than us...

1250
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:22,047
greater than any alien force.

1251
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:26,142
And if you and I
are powerless now...

1252
01:24:26,254 --> 01:24:33,092
I want to believe that
if we listen to what's speaking...

1253
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:36,686
it can give us the power
to save ourselves.

1254
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:43,337
Then we believe the same thing.

1255
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,775
Maybe there's hope.

1256
01:26:31,846 --> 01:26:34,679
<i>[Child]</i>
<i>I made this.!</i>
