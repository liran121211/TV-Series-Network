[Buzzing]

3
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,972
I have an urgent communication
to deliver to Dr. Nordlinger.

4
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,876
I can deliver the communication.

5
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,380
I was asked
to confirm and verify...

6
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,382
he received the communiqué
and report back...

7
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:02,418
That's not
proper procedure.

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,545
Report back
Dr. Nordlinger's acknowledgment...

9
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:05,644
of the communiqué.

10
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,350
What's going on here?

11
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:12,360
There's some confusion...

12
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:13,896
as to the proper procedure...

13
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,761
Dr. Nordlinger.

14
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,997
I have a communication for you.

15
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:42,351
Communication acknowledged
and confirmed, Captain.

16
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:47,290
We're returning to base.

17
00:01:58,943 --> 00:01:59,910
Officer Bamford.

18
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,103
Captain.

19
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,219
Prepare to transmit
to operations commander.

20
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:12,048
Transmit what, sir?

21
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:21,891
Sir...

22
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,297
what is the communication?

23
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,993
We're coming in.

24
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,381
Doggett?

25
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,677
I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,685
Have a seat, Agent Reyes.

27
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:05,992
Agent Reyes...

28
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:08,860
I thought we might have
a little chat.

29
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,630
Mr. Skinner here...

30
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:16,137
has been trying to
help me put together...

31
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,300
the pieces of your
X-Files investigation.

32
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,809
Can we cut the crap, Brad?

33
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,242
I don't know.
Can we?

34
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,211
There's a lot of crap
to cut through.

35
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:26,248
Agent Reyes...

36
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,319
you probably want to zip it
and try to cooperate.

37
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,547
Like it or not...

38
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:33,919
I'm now charged
with the task of reining you in.

39
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:35,514
- Reining us in?
- Uh-huh.

40
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,854
For what?

41
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,986
Unauthorized autopsies:
Breaking and entering...

42
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,621
into a state water facility:

43
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,495
Willful misuse of your positions.

44
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,761
I really don't want
to go into any of this...

45
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:47,166
without my partner here.

46
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,762
Your partner.
Your so-called partner...

47
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:53,502
who's running this circus,
is right now nowhere to be found.

48
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,840
What are you doing, Brad?

49
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:59,677
Giving you and Mr. Skinner
the opportunity to put a nice spin...

50
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,808
on this mess
that Doggett's making.

51
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,216
Agent Reyes...

52
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,845
if you're not going to zip it,
at least recognize...

53
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:08,322
that he's the only one
who can help you.

54
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,928
We were given a tip...

55
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:19,628
we believe leads
to a larger conspiracy.

56
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:21,637
Conspiracy.

57
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,934
Involving the F.B.I.

58
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,338
John Doggett and I...

59
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:28,343
are running a legitimate
investigation into the F.B.I.

60
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:30,606
- Neither one of us feels...
- Agent Reyes...

61
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:35,708
I'm trying to help you
keep your job...

62
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,684
but that's not
going to happen...

63
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,813
if you insist
on chasing shadows...

64
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:42,084
chasing conspiracies.

65
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,558
How do you know
there isn't one?

66
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:47,526
You're taking on...

67
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:51,294
the entire F.B.I. Here, Monica.

68
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:56,563
This witch hunt...

69
00:06:56,673 --> 00:07:00,404
isn't going
to expose anything...

70
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:02,069
but you.

71
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:05,012
That is...

72
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,743
unless you distance yourself
from John Doggett.

73
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,487
What are you doing?

74
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:22,929
I'm distancing myself, Brad,
from you.

75
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,126
From your political games.

76
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:26,964
You just want
to getJohn Doggett.

77
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,198
You're making
a big mistake here.

78
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,606
Yeah, I seem to make one
every time I walk in your door.

Lie back, John. It's okay.

82

What the hell is this?

83
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,228
It's Shannon.
Shannon McMahon.

84
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:03,704
We were together
in Bravo Company, U.S.M.C.

85
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,241
You were trying to contact me.

86
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:10,177
What the hell
are you doing here now?

87
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,646
[Coughing]

88
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:16,446
Your lungs were full of water.

89
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:20,188
You pulled me under.

90
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,850
I did what I had to.

91
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,791
You held me down. I remember.

92
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,556
They would have caught you.

93
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:28,563
They might have figured it out.

94
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:30,895
What you've started
to figure out.

95
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:34,198
What are you?

96
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:37,705
You know what I am.

97
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,902
I'm the product of 50 years...

98
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,569
of military science.

99
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,376
The program your old friend
Knowle Rohrer told you about.

100
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,013
I'm a bioengineered combat unit.

101
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:57,219
I have no weaknesses.
I don't sleep.

102
00:08:57,327 --> 00:09:00,319
I can breathe underwater.

103
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,898
That's how I saved your life, John.

104
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:08,135
How do you know what I know,
what Knowle Rohrer told me?

105
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:10,172
Knowle Rohrer and I were drafted...

106
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:12,936
right out of Bravo Company together.

107
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:17,309
We were... Adam and Eve.

108
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:20,110
The program's first.

109
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:22,185
There are many more now.

110
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:24,311
Knowle Rohrer is dead.

111
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,720
You can't kill us.
We can't be killed.

112
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:30,588
Knowle Rohrer
and I are alike...

113
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:34,425
in almost every way.

114
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,762
The difference is,
I hate what I am.

115
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,326
Why are you here
telling me this?

116
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:45,431
The program's expanding in ways
no one ever dreamed of.

117
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,470
I need your help
to stop it, John.

118
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,015
You need <i>my</i> help?

119
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,016
What can <i>I</i> do?

120
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:58,246
Expose the deaths
of those two men I killed...

121
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,084
what they were doing.

122
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,351
What were they doing?

123
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,518
Preparing the water supply.

124
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:08,155
Preparing it for what?

125
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,211
What are you doing, Captain?

126
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,711
Where are you going?

127
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,476
We're under strict orders
not to leave ship.

128
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,483
Look at us.

129
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:32,146
They've got us tied up
at a civilian dock in Baltimore.

130
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:33,620
Why?

131
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:35,351
I think they may be on to us.

132
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,154
You're only drawing suspicion...

133
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,285
if they're not.

134
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:40,886
You can't leave this ship.

135
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,795
We can't risk waiting.

136
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,925
We can't risk
not making contact now.

137
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,702
I'll be back.

139
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,556
Hi. I'm sorry about the hour.

140
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:17,155
I just put him down.

141
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,064
I couldn't talk on the phone.

142
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:29,273
Well, what is it?

143
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,247
I was told...
to leave this alone.

144
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,378
You and Mulder asked me
to leave it be...

145
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:39,785
to let Mulder disappear.

146
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,188
We were concerned
for the safety of the baby...

147
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:45,887
and for Mulder.

148
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,226
Why am I risking that now?

149
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,265
Why are you?

150
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:54,201
Why are you getting mixed up
with Doggett's investigation?

151
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:57,102
Something happened...

152
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,971
with my baby.

153
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:02,170
What?

154
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:07,239
I can't explain it.

155
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:11,253
It's, uh...

156
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,948
it's unexplainable.

157
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,693
It's, um...

158
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:19,022
it's not normal.

159
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,064
Whatever it is...

160
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,731
I think you've made
a terrible mistake.

161
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,670
Letting Doggett
pull you into this.

162
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:32,503
I mean, he's hell-bent.

163
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:36,636
And Agent Reyes
is following right in his tracks.

164
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,214
I need answers.

165
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:40,749
I need to know.

166
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,751
I can't just sit around...

167
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:45,321
wondering.

168
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,489
If you can't tell me,
then get to Mulder.

169
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:52,289
- Tell him what happened.
- No.

170
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,991
Mulder can't know.

171
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,091
He can't be
brought back into this.

172
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:02,330
He can't be brought back
to the F.B.I.

173
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:05,067
It's just too dangerous
for him right now.

174
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,778
It's too dangerous for everyone.

00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:52,246
<i>One of my men is dead.</i>

363
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:55,408
<i>I think they suspect</i>
<i>what we're up to.</i>

364
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:56,917
<i>Right.</i>

365
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:01,888
<i>What's it you need from us</i>...
<i>me on this end?</i>

366
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:05,119
<i>Just like we talked about.</i>

367
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:06,957
<i>You're going to call the F.B.I.</i>

368
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,565
<i>Right.</i>

369
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,430
<i>You've got to get to the F.B.I.</i>

370
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:17,097
<i>Tell them about the lab</i>
<i>they've got on board...</i>

371
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:19,902
<i>about the horrors</i>
<i>and the inhumanity.</i>

372
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,773
<i>Expose these people</i>
<i>for what they are.</i>

373
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,781
I need to talk to you.

374
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:39,418
I have an appointment.

375
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:41,462
Don't do this to me, Brad.

376
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,198
Give me two minutes.

377
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:55,472
Here you are again, Monica.

378
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:57,478
Walking through my door.

379
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,672
I need your help.

380
00:25:58,781 --> 00:25:59,907
Ah.

381
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,540
I tried to help you.

382
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:04,646
I'm asking you again.

383
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:09,014
Okay. I'm listening.

384
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,959
There's a woman working
at the Department ofJustice...

385
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:14,154
Shannon McMahon.

386
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:16,356
I need her case files.

387
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,592
You say that
like it's something I can just do.

388
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:19,793
It's not.

389
00:26:19,902 --> 00:26:22,996
It's important to me.

390
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:26,165
Important to you and to Agent Doggett,
in other words.

391
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:28,641
You're on the wrong side
of this fight, Brad.

392
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:30,006
- I can show you.
- Trust me.

393
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:32,376
I had it illustrated
by Mr. Doggett himself...

394
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:33,880
in the deputy director's
office today.

395
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,041
Would you listen to me?

396
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:39,617
People's lives are in danger here.

397
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:41,212
He's being set up.

398
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:43,019
We're being set up.

399
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,023
By who?

400
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,354
TheJustice Department?

401
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:47,827
It's why I need those files.

402
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,062
I'd ask you
to just do this for me...

403
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:59,474
but he's a good man.

404
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:02,203
He believes he's in the right.

405
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,139
And you?

406
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:08,739
You always are?

407
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,964
Where's Shannon McMahon?

408
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:25,033
She's back in my house. Why?

409
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,965
She's lying to you.
She's not who you think.

410
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:29,162
Where are you getting this?

411
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:30,738
Everywhere I look.

412
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,899
She works for
the Department ofJustice.

413
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:33,941
Did you know that?

414
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,034
I got a peek at her case files.

415
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:37,339
Those two men she killed?

416
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,846
They'd contacted her at D.O.J.,
as whistle-blowers.

417
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,938
She said they...

418
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,415
conspired with the government.

419
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,008
They were part
of the program.

420
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,985
They were killed
because they wanted...

421
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:47,248
to expose the program.

422
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:48,323
Why is she lying?

423
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:49,391
Why come to me?

424
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:51,016
Because there's
still one man...

425
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,116
she can't pinpoint...

426
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,923
and she wants you
to lead her to him.

427
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,225
How, when I don't even know
who you're talking about?

428
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:57,390
He's captain of a navy ship...

429
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,161
that spends
12 months a year at sea.

430
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:00,701
He had been
in guarded contact...

431
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,532
with both dead men
about a secret lab...

432
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:03,605
on that ship.

433
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,071

Shannon McMahon's...

the only sure thing we have.

435
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:08,173
We cut out on her
and go to this ship of yours...

436
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,869
we risk coming up
with both hands empty.

437
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,139
Agent Doggett, if this is true...

438
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:12,680
about this ship
and about this lab...

439
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:15,273
there may be answers there
that I can't risk not knowing.

A message for you, sir.

444
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:10,299

supposed to be?

00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:44,229
We're supposed to meet him...

449
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,137
at a phone booth at 1:00 a.m.

00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,231

452
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,380
Is he calling or meeting you?

453
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:56,849
I don't know.
It wasn't clear.

454
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,419
He sees us.

455
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,252
Hold up there!

456
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,856
I said hold up there!

457
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:18,502
This ain't no captain.

458
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:21,040

459
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:25,378

Nobody.

00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:51,485
This can't be right.

466
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,061
What happened to the captain?

467
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:26,758

You think I did that?

00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:09,433

On July 4, 1776...

530
00:38:41,743 --> 00:38:44,871

00:39:26,421 --> 00:39:27,752
Mulder's long gone.

542
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:32,722
Say I told Mulder that he
would be killed if he stayed.

543
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,355
Same people who threatened
to kill me if I didn't go along.

544
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:38,592
Would you believe that, John?

545
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,536
No. Mulder wouldn't hear it,
not from you, not from anybody.

546
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,664
I said I told him to go.

547
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:49,300
I didn't say I persuaded him.

548
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,749
Oh, my God.

549
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,785
It was Scully.

550
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,223
Scully made him go.

551
00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:04,417
That's it, isn't it?

552
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,649
Going to the basement?

553
00:40:36,925 --> 00:40:39,621
Heard you got
a stay of execution.

554
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,990
Congratulations.

555
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:43,462
I'm sure you mean that.

556
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:46,898
No, I'm sure
the deputy director...

557
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:50,233
has you just where he wants you.

558
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:52,169
Don't get me wrong...

559
00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:55,471
I'm a friend to the X-Files.

560
00:40:55,577 --> 00:41:00,037
Kind of a comfort
having you down there...

561
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:02,514
Mr. Doggett.

562
00:41:07,522 --> 00:41:08,454
Hi.

563
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:09,990
Hi.

564
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,893
Just so long as you know
where to reach us...

565
00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:19,098
Mr. Follmer.
