the world has ever known.

180
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,832
That's quite an assertion,
Mr. O'Malley.

If I'm putting
my ass out there,

183
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,213
I need to know it's hanging by more
than just a very slender thread.

184

something to show us.

186
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,971
and someone.

this place.

finds himself contacted

I call you.

198
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,272
And how would you
know to do that?

199
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,944
You probably
don't recognize me.

200
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,697
No, I think I'd remember.

201
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,198
You interviewed me
and my family

202
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,621
when I was
just a little girl.

203
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,499

my first abduction.

You both probably recognize
the classic scoop-mark scars.

How many times have you
been abducted, Sveta?

208
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,766
I lost count.

209
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,098
And then there are the
screen memories they implant.

210
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,732
The memories implanted over actual
memories to make abductees forget.

with the syndrome.

to me sometimes.

No.

about this.

What makes you
say that, Sveta?

I'm kind of a mind reader.

242
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:18,112
Is that a personal trait, or is
that what happens with alien DNA?

351
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,967
Because I don't believe it's
aliens who were taking them.

352
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,548
But you said
you were abducted.

353
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,304
This is difficult.

354
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,141
These are
very difficult memories,

355
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,599
and this is very
dangerous answers.

356
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,567
Well, everything stays
between us, Sveta.

357
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:55,069
The things I've experienced,
they've affected my entire life.

They've made it impossible to have
anything like a normal existence.

What are you afraid of?

360
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,619
That it only gets worse.

361
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,499
Sveta,

00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,801
who took your babies?

363
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:24,177
Men.
Men? Humans?

364
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,352
You saw their faces?

365
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,604
Yes.

aboard their ships.

And...

369
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,155
I was afraid
they would kill me

anyone the truth.

371

It's why you didn't
see a doctor.

Who can I trust?

373
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,800
They would call me a liar
when they're the liars.

374
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,502
You can trust me.

375
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,051
You worked
for the government.

Technically,
but not for years.

377
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,806
But you always wondered

378
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,811
if they weren't
lying to you, too.

We've been misled.

to what I'm saying.</i>

talking about?

Can we talk about this soon?

I know why O'Malley
came to us, Scully.

And that girl
is the key, Scully.

Sveta is the key
to everything.

Couldn't you be
jumping to conclusions?

396
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,363
I can't do this over the
phone right now, Scully.

00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,785
I got to go.

00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,559
I don't know
where they are.

You said no one had been down
here, it hadn't been touched.

Can you tell me
what this is about?

406
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,238
It's about controlling the
past to control the future.

It's about fiction

I don't take orders
from you.

412
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,958
No. Who do you
take orders from?

413
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,954
Why do you think
I called you?

414
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,836
Because I was
looking out for you,

415
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,792
like I've always
looked out for you.

416
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,680
A decade of my life
in this office.

No, I'm blaming myself.

422
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,232
I'm sure they lied
to you, too.

still down here.

00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,372

and spy on us,

429
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,749
tell us that makes us safer?

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,263
I couldn't call you because
it's gonna sound crazy.

518
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,939
That's why I'm here, Mulder, as

00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
No, you listen to me, Mulder.

522
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,353

trust me on this.

523
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,030

I don't know
if you saw, but...

And what about Sveta?
Where is she?

706
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,257
I'm sure they scared her
to death.

707

We need to find her, Mulder.

Why?

710
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,386

came back negative.

her entire genome

714
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,187
because I didn't trust
the initial results.

715
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,236
Are you saying
she has alien DNA?

716
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,941
And I sequenced
my own genome

717
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:47,370
because of my history and because
we have a child together.

718

what are you saying?

719
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,124
I'm saying
she's not the only one.

720
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,547

stop these sons of bitches.
