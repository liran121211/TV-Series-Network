overall external examination.

180
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,487
The last couple of weeks,
he was...

181
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,526
He was distant.

182
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,283
He was troubled.

183
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,990
I thought it was me,
you know?

184
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,042
We hadn't gotten together
for a while.

185
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,328
I mean, he'd call me
every night,

186
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,914
but nothing physical.

187
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,833
Did he talk to you
about his problems?

188
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,133
About work?
Yeah.

189
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,262
Yeah, he said he was upset
about his kids.

190
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,632
He said they were dying.

191
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,259
His kids?

192
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,559
He was single.

193
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,636
I didn't push it.

194
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,517
I just tried to
make him feel better.

195
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,107
Well, I saw
where he lived.

196
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,526
There was nothing there.
He lived an antiseptic life.

197
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,696
He lived two lives.

198
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,861
In two separate places.

199
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,818
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Excuse me.

200
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,029
Yeah.

201
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,119
Mulder, you gotta see this.

202
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,499
I had to break his fingers
to pry them open.

203
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,878
But he wrote that on the palm
of his hand before he died.

204
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,959
"Founder's Mutation."

205
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,883
The Founder is what they called Dr.
Goldman at Nugenics.

206
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,468
Is that why you wanted
to talk to him?

207
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,427
I don't think that's the mutation
Sanjay was referring to.

208
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,978
Did you find anything else
on the autopsy?

209
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,102
Well, there were no abnormalities in Dr.
Sanjay's brain.

210
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,479
The opener destroyed
the acoustic nerve

211
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,402
and then went into
the cerebral cortex.

212
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,696
It's weird, because the
opener goes in at 90 degrees

213
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,866
and then it veers off at 60 degrees
up into his brain, like he was

214
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,408
hunting for something.

215
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,454
Yeah. It ended up
in the auditory cortex.

216
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,416
You know,
he blurted something out

217
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,164
at the meeting,
before his suicide.

218
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,087
He said,
"Can't anyone hear that?"

219
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,707
Mmm. But nobody else
could hear a thing-

220
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,130
Well, ultimately,
hearing is just nerve impulses

221
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,210
interpreted by the brain.

222
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,296
What if those same impulses
could be generated

223
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,802
without actual vibrations
striking the ear drum?

224
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,933
Hmm.
Anyway,

225
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,646
if he left a note on his hand,
maybe he left other clues.

226
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,014
But where?

227
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,940
We've checked out every
square inch of his apartment.

228
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,315
Well, he leased a place
that only Gupta knew about.

229
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,613
I think we should go to
where he actually lived.

230
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,450
It's hard to imagine,
in 2016,

231
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,377
that Sanjay had to keep his
lifestyle preferences a secret-

232
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,671
Being gay
wasn't his only secret.

look older than 10.

frequency,

like a steel spike being
driven through my head.

00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,016

into two words,

at his door unannounced.

meet with him in private.

Ask Dr. Goldman
if he'll talk to us

358
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,935
about the Founder's Mutation.

359

00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,116
I got to get out of here.

What's your name?
Agnes.

363
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,126
You got a car?

364
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,623
Do you want to call someone?

365
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,876
You think if I could call
someone I would be asking you?

366
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,798
Just forget it. I knew you
weren't gonna help me.

00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,047
Agnes. Wait.

368
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,548
I'm a doctor.

369
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,133
You can tell me anything.

370
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,593
I don't belong here.

371
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,425
Not with these sheep.
I don't care what I signed.

372
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,010
The hospital
is only concerned with

373
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,561
the health of the mother
and the baby.

374
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,222
My baby.

375
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,894
Of course, your baby.

376
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,643
I changed my mind.

My baby's not right.

380
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,534
They saw it
on the ultrasound thing

381
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,667
and I had a feeling, you know,
ever since I got pregnant.

382
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,086
But everybody here
has the same story.

383

to meet you.

Sister Mary, how are the

390

They're homeless, damaged
in one way or another.

391

Alcohol, drugs,
no fathers in the picture.

392
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,437
Men and their lies.

393
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,064
No offense.

394
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,988
Desire is
the devil's pitchfork.

395
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,870
But as long as there's a
need and an innocent child,

396
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,948
we'll provide for each
and every one.

the founder of a company with deep
ties to the Department of Defense.

400
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,419

of the project,

suspected all along,

but were afraid
to articulate.

408
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,315
Is this what you believe
happened to me 15 years ago?

409
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,489
When I got pregnant,
when I had my baby?

411
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,993
Was I just an incubator?

412
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,873
You're never "just"
anything to me, Scully.

413
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,952
Do you ever
think about William?

414
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,754
Yes, of course I do,

415
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,673
but <i>I've...</i> I feel like I've
had to put that behind me.

416
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,673
He'd be 15 years old now.

417
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,722
And I've missed every
single year of his life.

418

And sometimes

419
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,844
I hate myself
that I didn't have

420
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,099
the courage
to stand by him.

421

You did what you did
to keep him safe.

His adoption is secret,
his location is unknown

423

protect him.

he was an experiment?

on Sanjay's wall,

the impact of the car.

534
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,471
Her right ulna
was broken in two places,

535
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,804
her lungs were lacerated
by broken ribs,

536
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,730
and her skull was crushed.

537
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,348
What about the baby?

538
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,975
Surgically removed.

539
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,565
I couldn't tell
if the fetus was still alive

540
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,941
when it was taken
from her womb,

541
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,738
but they took it, Mulder.

542
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,278
To get rid of evidence.

543
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,076
Agnes wanted to talk.

544
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,153
She left the hospital.

545
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,579
That baby was the only proof

546
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,452
that she was part of
Goldman's experiment.

547
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,746
What if the baby
was still alive?

548
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,795
Mulder, that car hit her
so hard that an adult woman

549
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,043
with the benefit of
a mature skeletal structure

550
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,920
wasn't able to
survive the impact.

551
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,923
It's highly unlikely that
the baby would remain viable.

552
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,262
Unlikely for human fetuses.

553
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,641
In 1973, the Syndicate
was convened to assist

554
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,514
in a project to
colonize the world

555
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,095
by creating
alien/human hybrids.

556
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,272
The project was
ultimately unsuccessful.

557
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,057
I doubt they ever
stopped trying.

558
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,607
But what you're
talking about is

559
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,277
changing the genetic makeup
of a population.

560
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,480
That's the next step
in evolution.

561
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,066
Every new species begins
with a Founder's Mutation.

562
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,368
One child with the correct
combination of DNA

563
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,490
could be a start.

564
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,363
There was a study
published last year

565
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,416
<i>in Nature Communications,
by</i> Batini <i>and Hallast,</i>

566
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,911
that found that Y chromosomes
in the majority of European men

567
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,917
could be traced back
to just three individuals

568
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,043
from the Bronze Age.

569
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,291
I did some digging around
the police archives,

570
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,967
looking for anything
related to Goldman.

571
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,387
Seventeen years ago,
Jackie Goldman was remanded

572
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,885
to St. Elizabeth's hospital
as a forensics patient.

573
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,966
She was adjudicated
criminally insane.

574
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,517
Dr. Goldman's wife?

575
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,638
She was convicted
of murdering her baby.

576
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,974
That body also
was never found.

577
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,746
Mrs. Goldman,
we'd like to ask you

578
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,448
a few questions
about your husband.

579

About his work?

580
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,506

anything in 10 minutes.

What do you want?

584
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,273
Can we ask you
a few questions, Jackie?

585
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,695
Not about my husband.

586
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,066
He is the one
still keeping me here.

587
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,995
Do you miss your daughter?

588
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,870
Molly.

odd about her.</i>

592
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,765
<i>I felt it from the day
she was born.</i>

593
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,511
<i>I didn't know for sure</i>

594
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,683

<i>and nobody noticed.</i>

598
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,900
<i>Molly was underwater
for at least 10 minutes.</i>

599
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,109
<i>She should've been dead.</i>

600
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,204

<i>she was breathing
in the water.</i>

603

thought it was a miracle.

604
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,919
But I knew what it was.

605
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:44,010
My husband did something
to the embryo.

606
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,227
He used our own daughter
for his research.

607
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,680
I was nine months pregnant
at the time.

608
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,515
I was not about to let him
have my son.

609
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,859
I had to get away
from that monster.

No!

He took Molly away.

618

He hid her from me.

619
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,832

and I drove.

Don't take him!

Don't!

714

Please don't take him!

715
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,407
He didn't know
what he was doing!

716
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,493
He was just trying
to protect me!

717
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,627
Is that true, Kyle?

718
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,712
That you don't know
what you're doing?

719
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,805
Why did you kill
Dr. Sanjay?

720
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,975
I didn’t want him to die.

721
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,051
You made him kill himself.

722
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,227
No!

723
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,680
I would never.

724
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,390
He was helping me.

725
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,895
You got inside his head.

726
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,400
You got inside my head.

727
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,648
You can make people
hear things.

728

730
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,154

At the hospital,
where you worked.

734
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,585
You heard Jackie's story.

735
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,376
She told me that he has her.

736
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,665
And Jackie is
my real mother, okay?

737
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,171
I have to find my sister.

738
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,093
Kyle, nobody knows
where she is.

739

Hmm.

if I took some blood?

And what would you do

747
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,426
once you found her?

748
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,092
I don't know.

749
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,400

No.

Molly or Kyle?

You were the last one
to see them, Agent Mulder.

eyes popped out of the sockets.

Some people think it represents
our first contact with aliens.

Other people think it represents
the beginning of human knowledge.
