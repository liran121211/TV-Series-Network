overall external examination.

180
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,484
The last couple of weeks,
he was...

181
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:28,528
He was distant.

182
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,280
He was troubled.

183
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:33,992
I thought it was me,
you know?

184
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,035
We hadn't gotten together
for a while.

185
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:38,329
I mean, he'd call me
every night,

186
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,915
but nothing physical.

187
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,834
Did he talk to you
about his problems?

188
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,127
About work?
Yeah.

189
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,256
Yeah, he said he was upset
about his kids.

190
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,633
He said they were dying.

191
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,260
His kids?

192
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,553
He was single.

193
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,637
I didn't push it.

194
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,514
I just tried to
make him feel better.

195
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,100
Well, I saw
where he lived.

196
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,519
There was nothing there.
He lived an antiseptic life.

197
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,689
He lived two lives.

198
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:07,859
In two separate places.

199
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:09,819
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Excuse me.

200
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,031
Yeah.

201
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,116
Mulder, you gotta see this.

202
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,496
I had to break his fingers
to pry them open.

203
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:23,875
But he wrote that on the palm
of his hand before he died.

204
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,960
"Founder's Mutation."

205
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,881
The Founder is what they called Dr.
Goldman at Nugenics.

206
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,466
Is that why you wanted
to talk to him?

207
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,427
I don't think that's the mutation
Sanjay was referring to.

208
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,971
Did you find anything else
on the autopsy?

209
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:40,099
Well, there were no abnormalities in Dr.
Sanjay's brain.

210
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,477
The opener destroyed
the acoustic nerve

211
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,395
and then went into
the cerebral cortex.

212
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,689
It's weird, because the
opener goes in at 9O degrees

213
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,859
and then it veers off at 6O degrees
up into his brain, like he was

214
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,402
hunting for something.

215
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,447
Yeah. It ended up
in the auditory cortex.

216
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:58,409
You know,
he blurted something out

217
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:00,161
at the meeting,
before his suicide.

218
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:03,081
He said,
"Can't anyone hear that?"

219
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,708
Mmm. But nobody else
could hear a thing.

220
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,127
Well, ultimately,
hearing is just nerve impulses

221
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:09,212
interpreted by the brain.

222
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,297
What if those same impulses
could be generated

223
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:13,800
without actual vibrations
striking the ear drum?

224
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:15,927
Hmm.
Anyway,

225
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:19,639
if he left a note on his hand,
maybe he left other clues.

226
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,015
But where?

227
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,934
We've checked out every
square inch of his apartment.

228
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:26,312
Well, he leased a place
that only Gupta knew about.

229
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,606
I think we should go to
where he actually lived.

230
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,451
It's hard to imagine,
in 2016,

231
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:43,371
that Sanjay had to keep his
lifestyle preferences a secret.

232
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,665
Being gay
wasn't his only secret.

look older than 10.

It was a high-pitched
frequency,

like a steel spike being
driven through my head.

309
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,009

into two words,

at his door unannounced.

I'll agree to relay
a message.

Thank you.

357
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,476
Ask Dr. Goldman
if he'll talk to us

358
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,936
about the Founder's Mutation.

359
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,523
Stay here.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

361
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,117
I got to get out of here.

362
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,952
What's your name?
Agnes.

363
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,120
You got a car?

364
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,621
Do you want to call someone?

365
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,873
You think if I could call
someone I would be asking you?

366
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,792
Just forget it. I knew you
weren't gonna help me.

367
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,044
Agnes. Wait.

368
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,546
I'm a doctor.

369
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,131
You can tell me anything.

370
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:51,590
I don't belong here.

371
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,427
Not with these sheep.
I don't care what I signed.

372
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,012
The hospital
is only concerned with

373
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:57,555
the health of the mother
and the baby.

374
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:59,223
My baby-

375
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:00,891
Of course, your baby.

376
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:03,644
I changed my mind.

377
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,147
I'm not giving it up.
I don't care if he's sick.

378
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:07,606
Sick?

379
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,235
My baby's not right.

380
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:15,531
They saw it
on the ultrasound thing

381
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:19,660
and I had a feeling, you know,
ever since I got pregnant.

382
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,079
But everybody here
has the same story.

383
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,166
Just don't say anything.

384
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,126

kidding around, okay?

385
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,253
If you ever want to talk.

386
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,009
I've spoken to Augustus.

387
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,761
He said he'd be happy
to meet you.

388
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,387
Thank you.

Sister Mary, how are the
patients chosen to be here?

390
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,018
They're homeless, damaged
in one way or another.

391
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:47,063
Alcohol, drugs,
no fathers in the picture.

392
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:48,439
Men and their lies.

393
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:50,066
No offense.

394
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,985
Desire is
the devil's pitchfork.

395
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,864
But as long as there's a
need and an innocent child,

396
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,949
we'll provide for each
and every one.

A ward for pregnant women
paid for by Augustus Goldman,

399
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,210
the founder of a company with deep
ties to the Department of Defense.

400
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,420
This could be another phase
of the project,

in eugenics.

402
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,716
Those women in there
could be incubators.

404
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,054

This is what you
suspected all along,

407
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,016
but were afraid
to articulate.

408
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:28,312
Is this what you believe
happened to me 15 years ago?

409
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,482
When I got pregnant,
when I had my baby?

410

(SIGHS)

411
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,986
Was I just an incubator?

412
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:40,866
You're never "just"
anything to me, Scully.

413
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,953
Do you ever
think about William?

414
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,747
Yes, of course I do,

415
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:49,667
butPveH.lfeel like I've had
to put that behind me.

416
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,670
He'd be 15 years old now.

417
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,715
And I've missed every
single year of his life.

418
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,218
And sometimes

419
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,846
I hate myself
that I didn't have

420
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,097
the courage
to stand by him.

421
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,307
You did what you did
to keep him safe.

422
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,894
His adoption is secret,
his location is unknown

423
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,396
because you had to
protect him.

he was an experiment?

out there somewhere,

on Sanjay's wall,

428

is pull the thread,

00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,542

Most likely from
the impact of the car.

534
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,469
Her right ulna
was broken in two places,

535
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,805
her lungs were lacerated
by broken ribs,

536
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,723
and her skull was crushed.

537
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:21,350
What about the baby?

538
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:22,976
Surgically removed.

539
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,562
I couldn't tell
if the fetus was still alive

540
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:26,939
when it was taken
from her womb,

541
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,732
but they took it, Mulder.

542
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,275
To get rid of evidence.

543
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,070
Agnes wanted to talk.

544
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,154
She left the hospital.

545
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,572
That baby was the only proof

546
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,449
that she was part of
Goldman's experiment.

547
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,743
What if the baby
was still alive?

548
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,788
Mulder, that car hit her
so hard that an adult woman

549
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,040
with the benefit of
a mature skeletal structure

550
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,917
wasn't able to
survive the impact.

551
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,920
It's highly unlikely that
the baby would remain viable.

552
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,256
Unlikely for human fetuses.

553
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,634
In 1973, the Syndicate
was convened to assist

554
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,511
in a project to
colonize the world

555
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,096
by creating
alien/human hybrids.

556
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,265
The project was
ultimately unsuccessful.

557
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,058
I doubt they ever
stopped trying.

558
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:04,601
But what you're
talking about is

559
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,271
changing the genetic makeup
of a population.

560
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,481
That's the next step
in evolution.

561
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:12,067
Every new species begins
with a Founder's Mutation.

562
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,361
One child with the correct
combination of DNA

563
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,487
could be a start.

564
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,364
There was a study
pubfishedlastyear

565
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,409
<i>in Nature Communications,</i>
by <i>Batini and Hallast,</i>

566
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,912
that found that Y chromosomes
in the majority of European men

567
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,914
could be traced back
to just three individuals

568
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,040
from the Bronze Age.

569
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,293
I did some digging around
the police archives,

570
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,961
looking for anything
related to Goldman.

571
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:33,380
Seventeen years ago,
Jackie Goldman was remanded

572
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,883
to St. Elizabeth's hospital
as a forensics patient.

573
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,968
She was adjudicated
criminally insane.

574
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:39,511
Dr. Goldman's wife?

575
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,639
She was convicted
of murdering her baby.

576
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,975
That body also
was never found.

577
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,740
Mrs. Goldman,
we'd like to ask you

578

anything in 10 minutes.

Can we ask you
a few questions, Jackie?

585
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:31,688
Not about my husband.

586
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,068
He is the one
still keeping me here.

587
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:43,992

odd about her.</i>

593

598
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,901
<i>Molly was underwater
for at least 10 minutes.</i>

599
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,111
<i>She should've been dead.</i>

600
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,198

thought it was a miracle.

But I knew what it was.

605
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:44,011
My husband did something
to the embryo.

606
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,221
He used our own daughter
for his research.

607
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,681
I was nine months pregnant
at the time.

608
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,516
I was not about to let him
have my son.

609
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,852
I had to get away
from that monster.

No!

He took Molly away.

618

He hid her from me.

619

Don't take him!

Don't!

714
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,740
Please don't take him!

715
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,409
He didn't know
what he was doing!

716
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,495
He was just trying
to protect me!

717
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:48,625
Is that true, Kyle?

718
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,710
That you don't know
what you're doing?

719
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:55,799
Why did you kill
Dr. Sanjay?

720
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,968
I didn't want him to die.

721
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,053
You made him kill himself.

722
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,221
No!

723
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,681
I would never.

724
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,392
He was helping me.

725
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,893
You got inside his head.

726
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,395
You got inside my head.

727
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,646
You can make people
hear things.

728
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,231

730
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,151
But you can't control it.

At the hospital,
where you worked.

734
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:25,578
You heard Jackie's story.

735
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,373
She told me that he has her.

736
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,667
And Jackie is
my real mother, okay?

737
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,168
I have to find my sister.

738
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,087
Kyle, nobody knows
where she is.

739

I know who knows.

Hmm.

if I took some blood?

00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,046
And what would you do

747
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:19,424
once you found her?

748
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,093
I don't know.

749
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,401
I'm gonna let you meet Molly.

No.

Molly or Kyle?

You were the last one
to see them, Agent Mulder.

I blacked out after Goldman's
eyes popped out of the sockets.

Some people think it represents
our first contact with aliens.

Other people think it represents
the beginning of human knowledge.
