00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,795
which he claims
are due to you.

175
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:50,425
In any case, I was hoping
I might impose upon you

176
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,968
to delay your
trip out to Texas.

177
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,138
You can't just
tell me now?

178
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,515
It requires
some explanation.

179
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,351
You do realize the clock is ticking
on this case, quite literally.

180
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:02,187
I think it could
save lives.

181
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,861
Say no more.
I'm on my way.

182

Ah, come in, Agent Einstein.
Have a seat.

204
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:06,251
I came here in good faith, Agent
Mulder, but lives are at stake.

205
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,294
I'm all about that.

206
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:10,421
If there were another act of
terror, and I'm in here listening

207
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,090
to some woo woo treatise
on the paranormal,

208
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:13,842
I don't think I could
forgive myself.

(STUTTERS)
I don't do woo woo.

210
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,346
Okay, what's
your big idea?

211
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,890
How are we going to talk
with this terrorist?

212
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:23,768
Well, first, can we talk about the
nature of reality, as you perceive it?

213
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,730
My reality is new chatter on the
Internet about more suicide bombs.

214
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:29,816
But do you believe
that thoughts have mass?

215
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,403
That ideas such as faith and
forgiveness have weight

216
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,030
much the same way
this desk has weight?

217
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:37,282
Or any material,
really.

(SIGHS)

219
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,869
You are too much,
Agent Mulder.

220
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:42,245
It's a legitimate
quesflon.

221
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,788
There's a legitimate answer. No.

222
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:45,373
How can you
be so sure?

223
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,834
Because when I stand on the
scale and think cf ice cream,

224
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:48,918
my ass doesn't grow.

225
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,045
Needl
illustrate further?

226
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:53,089
Yes, but I'm sure you believe
that words have weight,

227
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,675
the weight to move people
to go kill other people.

228
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:58,219
People kill people.
Bombs kill people.

229
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:01,389
VVords can incite people to kill
people as instruments of hate,

230
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,266
but are not lethal
in and of themselves.

Ever suck on a lemon,
Agent Einstein?

232
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,186
Do you feel a
sensation right now?

233
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,564
A quasi-measurable
effect?

234
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:14,152
I am getting a taste of what
Agent Scully must suffer.

235
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,571
Neo-Darvvinists believe
that every word spoken,

236
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,574
every thought, every perception,
lest I misperceive,

237
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,117
is a step in the
evolution of mankind.

238
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,369
Yes. A butterfly beats
its wings in China,

239
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:26,915
but that butterfly won't be defusing
explosives in any suicide vests.

240
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:29,500
Agent Einstein, you have a terrorist
lying in a state of existence

241
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,002
somewhere between
life and death.

242
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,212
If he holds valuable intel
on other terrorists,

243
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,882
maybe in order to reach him,
you need to expand your mind

244
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,508
on the so-called
material world.

245
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,852
I got here as fast as I could.
Thank you.

246
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:50,271
Let me say, I'm blown away you
came down here to help me at all.

247
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,856
VVeH,lsensed
your frustration.

248
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,316
I just want to believe
there's some way

249
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,443
of reaching this young man and
learning what he might know.

250
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,904
Well, I believe there may be,
but not the way you think.

251
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,280
What way is that,
Agent Scully?

252
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:01,824
Well, not through an oracle
or a psychic or a seer,

253
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,242
but through science.

254
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,411
I don't know
how you mean.

255
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,374
This may sound heavy, but this is
a bit of a personal quest for me.

256
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,250
My mother was in
a coma recently,

257
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:14,087
and I wasn't able to
communicate with her, either.

258
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,755
I take it she's passed?

259
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,216
I wish I'd had
the presence of mind

260
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,093
to think of this when
she was still alive.

261
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,388
It might've solved a mystery
that I may never know.

262
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,475
Please enlighten me,
Agent Mulder,

263
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,645
how nine years of college, three
degrees, and two years at Quantico

264
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,980
has left me
such a simpleton.

265
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:34,565
Not a simpleton.
A mugwump.

266
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,901
I resent that
characterization,

267
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,403
and I don't even
know what it means.

268
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,862
It means sit down and shut up.
(GASPS)

269
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,240
You talk to Agent
Scully like that?

270
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,283
Only when she's
being a mugwump.

271
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,744
Please have
a seat.

272
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,375
I'll give you two
minutes, Agent Mulder,

273
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,002
and then I'm due
back on Earth.

00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:59,257
<i>Behold.
Psilocybe tampanensis.</i>

275
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:01,300
I'm afraid where
this is going.

which has begun anew

from Columbia University to Oxford.

Highly contested

00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:11,519
Highly uncontested
results.

282
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,312
Test subjects
report experiences

283
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:16,274
that transcended space and time,
confrontations with the dead,

284
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,234
touching the very
face of God.

285
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,029
That's nice, Agent Mulder. You've
got about a minute and counting.

286
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:22,530
Test subjects
have also reported

287
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,616
that once the impediment of
the physical body is removed,

288
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,201
deep and lasting
truths are revealed

289
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,786
that the conscious
mind won't allow.

290
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,166
Feelings of ineffability,
sacredness, peace, unity, joy,

291
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,084
all without altering
brain chemistry.

292
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,045
Are you proposing,
Agent Mulder,

293
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:40,882
that we administer the magic
mushroom to the terrorist?

294
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,133
No. No.

295
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,718
I am proposing that you
administer it to me,

296
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,803
so that I can communicate
with the terrorist, (snens)

297
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,181
learn what he knows, and
prevent future acts of terror.

298
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,932
To a technically
dead man?

299
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,311
Death is now viewed by some as
merely another plane of existence.

300
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,688
I don't think our terrorist
has even achieved that plane.

301
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:57,732
I believe he's still
reachable on this plane.

302
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,487
So you called me back here to
ask me to administer this drug,

303
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,614
this illicit
Schedule 1 substance.

304
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,032
As a medical
professional.

305
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:08,451
Which Agent Scully
is as well.

306
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,913
Agent Scully has recently had her
own life-altering death experience,

307
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,706
and I don't want to
bother her with this.

308
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,041
Oh.

309
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,502
Oh, so you want to just
keep it between us?

310
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,253
I would,
if you don't mind.

311
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,130
No.

312
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,633
No, lwouldn't
mind at all.

absolutely nothing to say,

this lunatic scheme of yours.

about it, exactly?

317
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:32,183
Let me think about that.
Everything?

318
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,478
And rest assured, Agent Mulder,
when I walk out of here,

319
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,897
I will never again darken
your basement door.

320
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,194
So that's a maybe?

(EKG BEEPING)

322
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,700
It's hard to imagine there's someone
in there, when you really see him.

323
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:54,872
Research bears out a surprising
incidence of electro-activity

324

even in the most
severely brain-damaged.

325
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:01,546
What I want to try is a rather
novel but not untested protocol.

326
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:03,631
I'm open
to whatever.

327
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,424
I'm certain that
you are, Agent Miller.

328
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,885
I believe so many answers lie
beyond the pale of the known world

329
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:10,471
in realms of
extreme possibility.

330

that you believe.

331
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:13,975
So what are
you proposing?

332
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,935
Doctors recently achieved
the ability to communicate

333
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:20,148
with a man known as Patient <i>23</i>
through magnetic imaging, MRI,

334
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,067
by prompting his
otherwise inert

335
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,987
and unresponsive
brain with questions

336
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,321
that triggered
electro-activity.

00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,656
What kind
ofquesflons?

338
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,784
Mundane questions about
housekeeping and tennis.

339
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,413
But they unexpectedly lit up
certain regions of his brain

340
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,915
that translated to
yes-and-no responses.

341

00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,723
Mulder, when could he
possibly have spoken to you?

I can explain.
Or I can't explain.

didn't understand, yeah.

778
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,145

Powerful things. I saw deep
and unconditional love.

780
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,072

reconcile the two?

of our times.

Thinking about God.

00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,733
You, Mulder,
thinking about God'?

Well, that lesson didn't stick.
But the anger sure remains.

795
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:01,753
That's the same angry
God as in the Koran,

796
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,963

to the infidels.

797

this God saying?

"Worship me and
my great anger"?

799
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,179
Well, that's a good
question, Mulder.

00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,640
One for the ages.

801
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:15,975
Well, think about the immense
power in those prophecies,

802
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,186
the power in those words
to convince young men

803
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:22,732
to put on suicide vests today
and murder for their angry God.

804

getting at?

swallow the pill.

Yes.

to trump all hatred.

Whoa.

813
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:50,009

mothers are having babies

815
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:54,514
I want to believe that mothers
have a greater purpose

816
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,516
for all of us.
I agree.

817
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,143
A child is not a tool
to spread hatred.

818
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:01,604
But where does the
hatred end, though?

819
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:06,567
Maybe it ends where it began, by
finding a common language again.

820
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,445
Maybe that's
God's will.

really know?

Maybe it's
beyond words.

825
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,667
Maybe we should do
like the prophets

826

and truly listen.
