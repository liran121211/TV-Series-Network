are due to you.

175
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,424
In any case, I was hoping
I might impose upon you

176
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,975
to delay your
trip out to Texas.

177
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,136
You can't just
tell me now?

178
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,522
It requires
some explanation.

179
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,358
You do realize the clock is ticking
on this case, quite literally.

180
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,189
I think it could
save lives.

181
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,864
Say no more.
I'm on my way.

the Constitution, that's when.</i>

00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,841
<i>to protect my

00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,291
Ah, come in, Agent Einstein.
Have a seat.

204
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,254
I came here in good faith, Agent
Mulder, but lives are at stake.

205
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,301
I'm all about that.

206
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,424
If there were another act of
terror, and I'm in here listening

207
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,096
to some woo woo treatise
on the paranormal,

208
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,848
I don't think I could
forgive myself.

209
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,766
(STUTTERS)
I don't do woo woo.

210
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,349
Okay, what's
your big idea?

211
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,897
How are we going to talk
with this terrorist?

212
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,771
Well, first, can we talk about the
nature of reality, as you perceive it?

213
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,730
My reality is new chatter on the
Internet about more suicide bombs.

214
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,814
But do you believe
that thoughts have mass?

215
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,402
That ideas such as faith and
forgiveness have weight

216
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,033
much the same way
this desk has weight?

217
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,284
Or any material,
really.

(SIGHS)

219
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,868
You are too much,
Agent Mulder.

220
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,244
It's a legitimate
question.

221
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,790
There's a legitimate answer. No.

222
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,375
How can you
be so sure?

223
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,836
Because when I stand on the
scale and think of ice cream,

224
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,917
my ass doesn't grow.

225
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,044
Need I
illustrate further?

226
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,095
Yes, but I'm sure you believe
that words have weight,

227
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,674
the weight to move people
to go kill other people.

228
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,226
People kill people.
Bombs kill people.

229
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,396
Words can incite people to kill
people as instruments of hate,

230
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,269
but are not lethal
in and of themselves.

231

Ever suck on a lemon,
Agent Einstein?

232
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,185
Do you feel a
sensation right now?

233
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,570
A quasi-measurable
effect?

234
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,151
lam getting a taste of what
Agent Scully must suffer.

235
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,578
Neo-Darwinists believe
that every word spoken,

236
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,577
every thought, every perception,
lest I misperceive,

237
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,124
is a step in the
evolution of mankind.

238
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,372
Yes. A butterfly beats
its wings in China,

239
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,921
but that butterfly won't be defusing
explosives in any suicide vests.

240
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,499
Agent Einstein, you have a terrorist
lying in a state of existence

241
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,004
somewhere between
life and death.

242
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,211
If he holds valuable intel
on other terrorists,

243
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,888
maybe in order to reach him,
you need to expand your mind

244
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,511
on the so-called
material world.

245
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,858
I got here as fast as I could.
Thank you.

246
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,278
Let me say, I'm blown away you
came down here to help me at all.

247
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,855
Well, I sensed
your frustration.

248
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,315
I just want to believe
there's some way

249
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,446
of reaching this young man and
learning what he might know.

250
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,903
Well, I believe there may be,
but not the way you think.

251
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,283
What way is that,
Agent Scully?

252
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,831
Well, not through an oracle
or a psychic or a seer,

253
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,249
but through science.

254
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,418
I don't know
how you mean.

255
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,376
This may sound heavy, but this is
a bit of a personal quest for me.

256
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,253
My mother was in
a coma recently,

257
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,085
and I wasn't able to
communicate with her, either.

258
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,757
I take it she's passed?

259
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,222
I wish I'd had
the presence of mind

260
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,099
to think of this when
she was still alive.

261
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,391
It might've solved a mystery
that I may never know.

262
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,481
Please enlighten me,
Agent Mulder,

263
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,652
how nine years of college, three
degrees, and two years at Quantico

264
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,979
has left me
such a simpleton.

265
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,564
Not a simpleton.
A mugwump.

266
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,908
I resent that
characterization,

267
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,402
and I don't even
know what it means.

268
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,865
It means sit down and shut up.
(GASPS)

269
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,246
You talk to Agent
Scully like that?

270
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,282
Only when she's
being a mugwump.

271
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,743
Please have
a seat.

272
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,381
I'll give you two
minutes, Agent Mulder,

273
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,000
and then I'm due
back on Earth.

this is going.

which has begun anew

Highly uncontested
results.

282
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,319
Test subjects
report experiences

283
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,273
that transcended space and time,
confrontations with the dead,

284
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,233
touching the very
face of God.

285
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,035
That's nice, Agent Mulder. You've
got about a minute and counting.

286
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,532
Test subjects
have also reported

287
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,616
that once the impediment of
the physical body is removed,

288
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,200
deep and lasting
truths are revealed

289
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,793
that the conscious
mind won't allow.

290
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:33,169
Feelings of ineffability,
sacredness, peace, unity, joy,

291
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,090
all without altering
brain chemistry.

292
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,043
Are you proposing,
Agent Mulder,

293
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,881
that we administer the magic
mushroom to the terrorist?

294
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,135
No. No.

295
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,717
I am proposing that you
administer it to me,

296
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,802
so that I can communicate
with the terrorist, (SIGHS)

297
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,188
learn what he knows, and
prevent future acts of terror.

298
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,931
To a technically
dead man?

299
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,317
Death is now viewed by some as
merely another plane of existence.

300
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,695
I don't think our terrorist
has even achieved that plane.

301
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,738
I believe he's still
reachable on this plane.

302
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,489
So you called me back here to
ask me to administer this drug,

303
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,616
this illicit
Schedule 1 substance.

304
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,038
As a medical
professional.

305
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,450
Which Agent Scully
is <i>as</i> well.

306
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,912
Agent Scully has recently had her
own life-altering death experience,

307
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,712
and I don't want to
bother her with this.

308
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,047
Oh.

309
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,500
Oh, so you want to just
keep it between us?

310
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,260
I would,
if you don't mind.

311
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,133
No.

312
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,635
No, I wouldn’t
mind at all.

absolutely nothing to say,

What is lunatic
about it, exactly?

00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,181
Let me think about that.
Everything?

318
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,485
And rest assured, Agent Mulder,
when I walk out of here,

319
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,904
I will never again darken
your basement door.

320
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,200
So that's a maybe?

(EKG BEEPING)

322
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,707
It's hard to imagine there's someone
in there, when you really see him.

323
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,875
Research bears out a surprising
incidence of electro-activity

00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,549
What I want to try is a rather
novel but not untested protocol.

00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,634
I'm open
to whatever.

327
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,427
I'm certain that
you are, Agent Miller.

328
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,892
I believe so many answers lie
beyond the pale of the known world

329
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,470
in realms of
extreme possibility.

330
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,430
I believe
that you believe.

331
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,981
So what are
you proposing?

332
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,933
Doctors recently achieved
the ability to communicate

333
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:20,147
with a man known as Patient <i>23</i>
through magnetic imaging, MRI,

334
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,073
by prompting his
otherwise inert

335
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,990
and unresponsive
brain with questions

336
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,320
that triggered
electro-activity.

337
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,662
What kind
of questions?

338
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,787
Mundane questions about
housekeeping and tennis.

339
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,416
But they unexpectedly lit up
certain regions of his brain

340
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,918
that translated to
yes-and-no responses.

341

That is incredible.

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,508

be achieved rather simply

have done it, son"?

about who was behind the bombing.

he's gonna tell you?

body here isn't a human.

360

this terrorist is dead.

I suggest that you both
take a little breather

Apparently, Texas is something
of a promised land.

what changed your mind

on this whole
deal here?

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,958

Agent Miller.

397

Nothing professional
about it.

399
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,052
But you think
this misguided.

400
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,137
My loss is your gain,
Agent Mulder.

401
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,636
I'll deal with Agent
Miller about this later.

402
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,266

I am anticipating results,

that you will actually be communicating
with the terrorist, somehow.

or you to him, I have no clue.

Mmm. An anonymous caller,
but a very clear guess,

423
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:45,040
there's a large and unassimilated
Muslim community in the area,

wish to what?

426

Osama bin Laden,

But the anger sure remains.

795
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,752
That's the same angry
God as in the Koran,

796
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,962

to the infidels.

797

this God saying?

"Worship me and
my great anger"?

799
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,178
Well, that's a good
question, Mulder.

One for the ages.

801
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,974
Well, think about the immense
power in those prophecies,

802
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,185
the power in those words
to convince young men

803
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:22,738
to put on suicide vests today
and murder for their angry God.

swallow the pill.

of suggestion.

mothers are having babies

have a greater purpose

816
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,518

I agree.

817

to spread hatred.

818

But where does the
hatred end, though?

819
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:06,567
Maybe it ends where it began, by
finding a common language again.

820
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,452
Maybe that's
God's will.

really know?

beyond words.

825

like the prophets

and truly listen.
