174
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,243
I don't want to alarm you,
Agent Einstein,

175
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:39,914
but about six weeks ago,
I took my own blood,

176
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:42,959
and in sequencing my genome,
I discovered an anomaly.

177
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,919
What constitutes
an anomaly?

178
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:46,546
An aberration
in my sequence.

179
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,381
Something unexplainable

180
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:51,634
and, by definition, alien.

181
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:56,055
You can rest assured I don't
have alien DNA, Agent Scully,

182
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,390
if that's what
you're looking for.

183
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:58,725
Have you
sequenced your genome?

184
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:01,436
No. But has anyone?

185
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,104
MY Point precisely.

186
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,025
And why were you
even looking?

187
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,903
You know little of my
history, Agent Einstein.

188
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:12,697
And while we share
a faith in science,

189
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,449
I have come to
the understanding

190
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,910
that the science
that we were taught

191
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,496
takes us but a distance
towards the truth.

192
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:24,209
Yeah, but tampering
with our DNA?

193
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,711
I was given a smallpox
vaccine as a child,

194
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,296
as I'm sure
you were as well.

195
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,131
It was standard practice
in America at the time.

196
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,883
If you are suggesting
that there is

197
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,260
more in that shot
than a vaccine...

198
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,888
It's actually not that
far-fetched and within the realm

199
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:37,972
of accepted science.

200
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,809
Something entering the germ
line, something that would be

201
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:42,435
passed down hereditarily.

202
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,814
That would be an unprecedented
violation of the public trust.

203
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,233
And now you know
a bit more of the history

204
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,068
I was referring to.

205
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,028
For the purpose of what?

206
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,281
I don't know,
Agent Einstein.

207
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,575
And I don't know if
any of this is true.

208
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,161
But what I do know is that
the possibility exists,

209
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,455
and that is reason enough
to run these tests.

210
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,833
Hey. Been looking
for you.

211
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,627
A.D. Skinner asked me to come
down, help find Agent Mulder.

212
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,838
We know nothing, Agent Miller,
nothing more than this morning.

213
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,673
There's talk on the Internet.
What kind Of talk?

214
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:12,924

freaking out about

218
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,724
So what are we looking
at, Dr. Rubell,

219
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:22,976
the scale and scope?

220
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:24,727
A scale we've
never dreamed.

221
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,563
A scope that
quickly becomes global.

222
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:28,064
A massive contagion,
then?

223
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:31,150
Not one contagion, but a
variety of contagions.

224
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:33,778
If the flu doesn't kill you,
then something else will.

225
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,446
You're describing it

226
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,116
as a fast-moving
AIDS without the HIV.

227
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,576
Our immune
systems decimated

228
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,287

to all our genomes.

232

Suddenly Tad O'Malley is the

233
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:52,714
Is this at all plausible?

234
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,424
It's all too plausible,

235
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,967
and I think it's
already happening.

236
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,480

found out, Sandeep?

237
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:10,565
They're running tests now.

About the man,
who is he?

239
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,234
He's quite incoherent.

240
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:15,069
I think they've
determined he's military.

241
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,448
That man will die unless he's given
doses of intravenous doxycycline.

242
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,908
What do you suspect,
Dr. Scully?

243
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,577
Those lesions
are from anthrax.

244
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,329
Uh, someone's been
exposed to anthrax?

245
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:26,247
Willingly so,
in this case.

246
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,832
You better explain
this to me.

247
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,044
To me as well, Agent Scully,
because this is cause for alarm.

248
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:33,922
Soldiers deploying to Iraq
are given anthrax vaccines

249
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,341
to protect them in the event
of biological warfare.

250
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,259
But with compromised
immune systems,

251
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:40,803
it's the vaccines that are
attacking their systems.

252
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,347
Meaning we're
infecting them?

253
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,890
Thinking that
we're protecting them.

254
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,434
We don't know
that that's true.

of the injection.

256

That's where we saw the
lesions, Agent Einstein.

257
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,773
That's purely speculative.

258
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:52,982
Anthrax.

there be an outbreak?

in 2001.

Anthrax is the canary
in the coal mine.

00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,528
He'd been near death,
so badly burned

348
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,030
they were having to
reconstruct his entire face.

349
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,325
Why would he summon you?

350
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:39,912
He had an offer to make.

351
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:59,515
Agent Reyes, please come in.

352
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,989
I think you know who I am.

353
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,576
I thought that
you were dead.

354
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,662
They haven't killed me yet,

355
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,372
as hard as they may try.

356
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,422
Is it hard
to look at me?

357
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,762
Considering what
I know about you,

358
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,514
the things you've done, the
people you've done them to...

359
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,808
I'm not an evil man, Monica.

360
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,727
And you're a liar, as well.

361
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:46,937
What did he want, Monica?

362
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,440
To make a deal with me,

363
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,193
one that left me
very little choice.

364
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,862
You changed
your whole life.

365
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,740
You have to
understand why.

366
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,499
How badly I want a cigarette.

367
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,711
Well, I can't help you
with that.

368
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,922
But you can
help me, Monica.

369
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,216
And for that,
I'd spare your life.

370
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,636
It's a federal crime to
threaten an FBI agent, sir.

371
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:20,763
You're hardly in a position
to threaten anyone.

372
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:24,892
You see a man lying here,
a seemingly weak man,

373
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:27,937
but I'm the most powerful man
in the world.

374
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:32,233
You must have a sense
of what's happening,

375
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,151
heard the reports.

376
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,112
How did he
threaten you, Monica?

377
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:38,406
With the ultimate weapon,

378
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,617
the ability to
depopulate the planet,

379
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:43,911
to kill everyone
but the chosen.

380
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,955
By tampering
with their DNA?

381
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,500
Science acquired in the '50s,
given to them by an alien race.

382
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,839
Alien DNA mixed
with our DNA.

383
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,299
It's not quite so simple.

384
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:59,093
That's excellent.

385
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:03,514
Just be quick. We don't
have a lot of time.

386
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:11,981
<i>Merci.</i>

387
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,571
Ahh. Thank you, Monica.

388
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,699
You're slowly
killing yourself

389
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,367
while you hold
the world hostage.

390
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,411
The world will go on.

391
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,955
Just in my image
instead of God's.

392
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,999
You think you
can play God?

393
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,792
Oh. Not God, certainly.

394
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,057
They won't know
what hit them.

395
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,352
That their fates
were sealed since birth.

396
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,938
They were simply puppets.

397
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,651
You will die
a lonely old man.

398
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:59,236
Oh. I don't think so, Monica.

399
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:02,490
Now that I have you
to light my smokes.

400
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:08,162
Why did you call me,
Monica?

401
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,538
To tell me what
a coward you are?

402
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,540
To tell you
you're protected.

403
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,000
What are you talking about?

404
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,585
Your abduction.

405
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,505
The tests. Your DNA, Dana.
You're safe.

406
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,673
You're one of
the chosen elite.

407
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:21,342
They tampered
with my DNA.

408
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,177
We are both
protected, Dana.

409
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,513
That's what he
was offering me.

410
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:27,181
But what about
everybody else?

411
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,934
Everyone else
is happening.

412
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,186
It's been in
motion since 2012.

413
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,979
Well, then we have
to stop it.

414
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,397
The science
is complicated.

415
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:36,815
And Mulder...

416
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,609
Where's Mulder?

417
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:40,027
He loves Mulder.

418
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,614
He sent a man to him
to offer Mulder a deal.

419
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,414

00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,018
Who sent you?

423
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:03,944
You sent for me.

424
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:06,405
I'm here.

425
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,290
This is so
unnecessary, Fox.

426
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,543
I don't come
when you call.

427
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:23,714
I've controlled you since
before you knew I existed.

428
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,301
So who's in control now?

429
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,095
The world
crumbling around us.

430
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,556
You set this in motion.

431
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,808
Now you're gonna
put a stop to it.

432
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,769
It's far too
late for that, Fox.

433
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,146
Too late for your
heroics or mine.

434
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,439
I don't believe you.

435
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:42,274
You don't want to believe.

436
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:51,909
You may not believe this,

437
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,412
but I really want
to save your life.

438
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,999
I don't make
deals with you.

439
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,918
So you can see
Scully again.

440
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,962
You harm her in any way...

(LAUGHS) Every man
has his weakness.

443
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:14,682
Mine was always
just cigarettes.

444
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,308
You think it's power,

445
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:18,227
what you're doing,
but it's not.

446
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,687
It's sickness.

447
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,230
It's sickness not doing it.

448
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,898
Spoken like
a true psychopath.

449
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,776
I didn't set out to
destroy the world, Mulder.

450
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,403
People did.

451
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,029
You can't
justify your actions.

452
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:32,449
We have just had the hottest
year on record on planet Earth.

453
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,784
I didn't do that.

454
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:37,788
I'm not responsible for
the 40% loss of bird life

455
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,040
or the decimation
of the megafauna.

456
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,750
So just murder
all the people?

457
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,669
Aliens predicted all this.

458
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,379
They saw it
happening to themselves.

459
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:46,672
And you kept it
a secret.

460
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,298
Look at world
history, Fox.

461
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,344
Neither you nor I could save
mankind from self-extermination.

462
00:25:52,428 --> 00:25:53,971
So you plotted
your endgame.

463
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,181
I just changed
the timetable.

464
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,476
Everyone still
dies in the end.

465
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,686
How's it feel now?

466
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,312
What good would it do?

467
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,149
You'll be dead
yourself within a week.

468
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,111
What are you offering?

469
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,197
A seat at the big table.

470
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,784
It would be
a shame without you.

471
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,456
I couldn't look at
myself in the mirror.

472
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:22,958
Let alone you.

473
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,919
We could start
the world anew, Fox.

Not a rat's chance
in hell!

476
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,510
You speak to me of hell?
(CHUCKLES)

477
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:36,847
When you look to be the one
who's hell-bound.

478
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,016
You appear a little feverish.

479

480
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,604
Avian flu?

481
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,315
A nasty strain
of rhinovirus?

482
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,444
It's not too late, Fox.

failing to cover the story,

failing to see
the writing on the wall,

488
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,545
as anthrax outbreaks
give way to an epidemic

spreading of a substance

to find Agent Einstein.

Yes, I'm gonna call
them next.

507

Agent Einstein, I was afraid
you left the hospital.

No, I'd be afraid to leave. It's
gone from bad to worse out there.

What can we
possibly do?

We need to act quickly.

517
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:25,747
You were right
about that.

518
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,457
Well, I was wrong
about the science.

519
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,294
I was wrong about what's causing it.
Dead wrong, in fact.

But it's clearly

521
