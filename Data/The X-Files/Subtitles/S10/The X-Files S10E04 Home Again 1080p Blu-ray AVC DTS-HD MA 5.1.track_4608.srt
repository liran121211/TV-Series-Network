killed, that was only him.

533
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,582
"Him"? Who is him?

534
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,168
You saw those
things in the hall.

535
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,294
Yeah.

536
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,420
I made them.

537
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,922
I didn't mean to,
but I made 'em.

538
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:29,426
They'll go away, eventually.
They're fading.

539
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,470
But the Band-Aid
Nose Man...

540
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:35,891
He's different.

541
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,062
Tibetan Buddhists
would call him a Tulpa.

542
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,856
A thought form

543
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:46,776
using mind and energy to will
consciousness into existence.

544
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,323
<i>Tulpa</i> is a 1929 Theosophist mistranslation
of the Tibetan word <i>"tulku, "</i>

545
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,617
meaning
"a manifestation body."

546
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,869
There is no idea
in Tibetan Buddhism

547
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:58,038
of a thought form
or thought as form.

548
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,582
And a realized <i>tulku</i>
would never harm anyone,

549
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:01,875
let alone kill.

550
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,793
Okay. But I'm telling you.

551
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,462
I spend a lot
of energy in my art.

552
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:09,591
I meditated on it.
I willed it.

to look like,</i>

554

00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,266

From some
other place, yeah?

578
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,086
But now it's alive
and it's out there.

579
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:31,631
Down to the Band-Aid I used
to hold the clay in place.

580
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:32,966
Who would copy this?

581
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,676
And did you smell it?

582
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,178
It smells like
nothing on this earth.

583
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:40,056
It has its own life.
Does what it wants.

584
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,017
I just wanted
to scare 'em,

585
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,019
scare anyone that took dignity
away from the homeless.

586
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:46,688
That's where the violent
idea popped in my head.

587
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,356
It was just an emotion
that ran through my head.

588
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,775
An idea is dangerous,
even a small one.

589
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,986
But now he uses
that violent idea.

590
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,323
He thinks that is what
he is supposed to do.

591
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,907
You are responsible.

592
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,579
If you made the problem,

593
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,372
if it was your idea,

594
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,001
then you're responsible.

595
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,088
You put it out of sight, so that
it wouldn't be your problem.

596
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:18,011
But you're just as bad as
the people that you hate.

is possible,
