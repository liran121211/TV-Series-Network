1
00:00:02,354 --> 00:00:04,539
Previously on The X-Files...

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:07,774
The countdown has begun.

3
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,044
Alien technology being used against us

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,446
by a venal conspiracy of men

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,381
against humanity.

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,382
It's all part of a conspiracy

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,217
dating back to the UFO crash

8
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:20,087
at Roswell in 1947.

9
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,288
How can we help you, Mr. O'Malley?

10
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,456
I'm rattling some pretty big cages

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,790
in the intelligence community,

12
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:26,226
but I'm prepared to blow open maybe

13
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,462
the most evil conspiracy
the world has ever known.

14
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,764
I didn't know how my work would be used.

15
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,568
They removed your unborn fetuses.

16
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,404
They do everything through
here, even with the DNA.

17
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,705
Tell them about your DNA, Sveta.

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,575
I have alien DNA. For sure.

19
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,377
They police us and spy on us,

20
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,312
tell us that makes us safer.

21
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:46,980
We've never been in more danger.

22
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,049
Then do something about it, Mulder.

23
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,551
What are they trying to do?

24
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,452
That's the missing piece.

25
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,988
Testing yourself for alien DNA?

26
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:57,958
I sequenced my own genome,
because of my history

27
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,326
and because we have a child together.

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,961
Scully,

29
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,997
are you saying you have alien DNA?

30
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:07,267
I'm saying someone has to
stop these sons of bitches.

31
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,210
Oh, no. No!

32
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:34,495
My name is Dana Katherine Scully.

33
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,163
I am a special agent

34
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,499
with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation,

35
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,801
a career I chose after medical school,

36
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:44,304
which promised a chance to
further my aim as a scientist

37
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:48,675
and as a seeker of justice
in a science-based world.

38
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,511
Soon after joining the FBI,

39
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:55,315
I was asked to review the work
of a fellow agent, Fox Mulder,

40
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,351
and to debunk the X-Files,

41
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,854
cases involving what
my superiors regarded as

42
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,725
science fiction and
a waste of resources.

43
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,962
I quickly came to understand
Mulder's work on the paranormal

44
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:11,532
wasn't such as I'd been led to believe,

45
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,635
that the X-Files were worthy
of Mulder's investigations

46
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,238
and of mine, that a world
existed on the far fringes

47
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:20,874
of accepted science, a
world where a scientist

48
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:26,213
would have her strongly held
beliefs tested and retested.

49
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,483
I would also come to fear
that the institution I'd joined

50
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,486
and invested with my trust
was subject to the influence

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,322
of dark forces outside the Bureau

52
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,391
and sometimes within,

53
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,827
forces threatened by Mulder's work

54
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:42,863
and increasingly by mine.

55
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,698
Shortly after sensing these threats,

56
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:48,101
I was abducted from my
home by unknown assailants

57
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:51,905
and returned without a
clear understanding why.

58
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,675
But intervening incidents
have led me to believe

59
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,343
that during my short disappearance,

60
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,179
I was subjected to tests,

61
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:02,416
tests resulting in a
life-threatening disease,

62
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,753
its cure as mysterious
as the illness itself,

63
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:12,226
tests which I now suspect are
part of a larger conspiracy,

64
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,530
a conspiracy of men hiding
science for almost 60 years...

65
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,467
...secrets kept from the American people

66
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,936
by a self-interested cabal

67
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:25,472
intent on the consolidation of power

68
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:29,209
both at home and on a
perilously global scale.

69
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:32,546
But questions remain unanswered

70
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,316
about their motives and
their final objectives,

71
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:41,788
when and where these men might
play out their dark plans,

72
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,791
and the significance
of a recent test result

73
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:49,930
of my personal genetic makeup
turning up DNA anomalies

74
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:53,734
that I can only classify...

75
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,769
as alien.

Sorry I'm late.

81
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,593
The parking garage is
locked down for some reason.

82
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,863
You here, Mulder?

83
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:28,581
Six weeks ago, we went
off the air due to threats

84
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:32,152
from outside forces bent
on controlling content

85
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,653
deemed dangerous to their cause.

86
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,822
Today we're back,

87
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:38,224
with facts threatening
these forces yet again,

88
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,560
the discovery of something
that's so shocking

89
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:43,897
you'll want to sit down and
prepare yourself for the truth,

90
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:47,400
what may seem like science
fiction but is science fact,

91
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,502
the legitimate and verifiable...

92
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:51,371
discovery of alien DNA

93
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:54,574
that's in virtually
every American citizen.

94
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,110
I know what you're thinking right now...

95
00:05:57,144 --> 00:06:00,280
Agent Mulder's phone.

96
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:02,449
Who's this? Dana?

97
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,684
Yes. Who's this?

98
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,220
It's Tad O'Malley.

99
00:06:07,254 --> 00:06:09,956
I was just watching your show.

100
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,258
You need to get over here.

101
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:14,994
Where exactly is "Here"?

102
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,268
What happened here?

103
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,669
I don't know what happened.

104
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,404
What are you doing here
and where is Agent Mulder?

105
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,505
I don't know where he is.

106
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,140
You found it like this?

107
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:28,575
Door was open, unlocked.

108
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,076
We had arranged an informal meeting.

109
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,445
A meeting about what?

110
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,514
About new facts surfacing.

111
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:38,819
I saw your report, Mr. O'Malley,
and your dangerous allegations.

112
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:40,921
Dangerous allegations, yes,
but not irresponsible ones.

113
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:43,456
Alien DNA lurking in
every American citizen.

114
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,758
I had my own DNA tested.

115
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:45,792
And what did you find?

116
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:47,327
We found anomalous DNA.

117
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,931
90% of everyone's genome is
anomalous DNA, Mr. O'Malley.

118
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:53,834
I have a doctor who says this is
different. And he's not a quack.

119
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:55,535
I'd like to be the judge of that.

120
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,870
You found alien DNA yourself.

121
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:58,638
You found it in Sveta six weeks ago,

122
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,407
just like we all said you would.

123
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:05,011
And this has got Mulder excited.

124
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:07,247
It should get anyone excited.

125
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:11,017
Who are you calling?

126
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:13,854
Well, first I'm calling the police.

127
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:16,623
Still no word from him?

128
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:18,558
And he's not picking up either.

129
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:21,228
You'd think he would've left
a note, maybe a voice message.

130
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:23,130
I'm afraid he fears my judgment.

131
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:24,197
Fears your judgment on what?

132
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:27,033
On whether he's crazy or not.

133
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:28,568
Then you do know something.

134
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:33,173
This man, Tad O'Malley,
has been making claims.

135
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,808
Claims about what?

136
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:38,044
That you and everyone you
know has a piece of DNA

137
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,680
in your genome put there
without your knowing it.

138
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:42,516
Put there by whom?

139
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,184
Well, that's the question of the day.

140
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,185
This is an Internet lunatic.

141
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,720
You're not saying you believe him?

142
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,356
Just hold on, Agent Einstein.
You're talking to a scientist.

143
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,991
Uh, forgive me, Assistant Director.

144
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,392
It may sound insensitive,

145
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:55,228
but the suggestion is
pure science fiction.

146
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:57,264
What I'm saying, Agent
Einstein, is that the facts,

147
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:00,100
as I understand them, cannot
be discounted out of hand.

148
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:03,336
No one has the right or the ability

149
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,105
to tamper with your DNA.

150
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,875
Unless we gave them that ability.

151
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,592
_

152
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,317
Thank you for doing this,

153
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:18,752
Agent Einstein.

154
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:20,487
You didn't have to, considering.

155
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:22,656
My prejudices are only
against pseudoscience.

156
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,825
If I can help to clear up this nonsense

157
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,760
and find Agent Mulder,
I'm only happy to.

158
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,761
Can you help me?

159
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:29,262
Do you need to sit down, sir?

160
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:31,465
I-I don't know. I'm-I'm not sure.

161
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:32,532
Not sure of what?

162
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,034
Wh-What's happening to me.

163
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,469
Nurse, we need some help here.

164
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:36,470
Dr. Scully?

165
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:38,405
I think this man needs help.

166
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:39,806
As do so many people today.

167
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,708
Oh, his left arm, lateral deltoid.

168
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:42,776
Sir, can I see your arm, please?

169
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,611
I don't know how it got there.

170
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:46,246
Okay, you need to get
this man out of here,

171
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,481
get him to see a doc immediately.

172
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:48,482
Can you do that, Sandeep?

173
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:49,616
Yes, certainly. Right away.

174
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,752
Can I direct them in any way?

175
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:55,088
Just find out who he is and
what he's been exposed to.

176
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,703
I'm not sure what
this is going to prove.

177
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,836
Well, it may prove nothing
or it may be negative.

178
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:36,882
I don't want to alarm
you, Agent Einstein, but...

179
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,119
about six weeks ago,
I took my own blood,

180
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:43,722
and in sequencing my genome,
I discovered an anomaly.

181
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,190
What constitutes an anomaly?

182
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:46,859
An aberration in my sequence.

183
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:48,894
Something unexplainable

184
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:52,431
and, by definition, alien.

185
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:56,135
You can rest assured I don't
have alien DNA, Agent Scully,

186
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:58,070
if that's what you're looking for.

187
00:09:58,104 --> 00:09:59,271
Have you sequenced your genome?

188
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:01,707
No. But has anyone?

189
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:03,909
My point precisely.

190
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,147
And why were you even looking?

191
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:10,382
You know little of my
history, Agent Einstein.

192
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:13,052
And while we share a faith in science,

193
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,653
I have come to the understanding

194
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:17,256
that the science that we were taught

195
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,793
takes us but a distance
towards the truth.

196
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:24,496
Yeah, but... tampering with our DNA?

197
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,498
I was given a smallpox
vaccine as a child,

198
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,467
as I'm sure you were as well.

199
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,903
It was standard practice
in America at the time.

200
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:32,471
If you are suggesting that there is

201
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,573
more in that shot than-than a vaccine...

202
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:37,176
It's actually not that
far-fetched and within the realm

203
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,844
of accepted science.

204
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:41,613
Something entering the germ
line, something that would be

205
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,082
passed down hereditarily.

206
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:46,085
That would be an unprecedented
violation of the public trust.

207
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,487
And now you know a
bit more of the history

208
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:50,422
I was referring to.

209
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:52,858
For the purpose of what?

210
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:55,627
I don't know, Agent Einstein.

211
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:58,430
And I don't know if any of this is true.

212
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,632
But what I do know is that
the possibility exists,

213
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,868
and that is reason
enough to run these tests.

214
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,002
Hey.

215
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,838
Been looking for you.

216
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,873
AD Skinner asked me to come
down, help find Agent Mulder.

217
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:10,142
We know nothing, Agent Miller,
nothing more than this morning.

218
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:12,444
- There's talk on the Internet.
- What kind of talk?

219
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,612
People are freaking out about

220
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:14,966
reports on The Tad O'Malley Show.

221
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:17,783
Now, I know this is

222
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,885
hard for people at home to comprehend.

223
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,887
So what are we looking at, Dr. Rubell...

224
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,389
the scale and scope?

225
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:25,057
A scale we've never dreamed.

226
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,892
A scope that quickly becomes global.

227
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,394
A massive contagion, then?

228
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,330
Not one contagion, but
a variety of contagions.

229
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:34,133
If the flu doesn't kill you,
then something else will.

230
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,667
You're describing it

231
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:38,404
as a fast-moving AIDS without the HIV.

232
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:39,972
Our immune systems decimated

233
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:42,541
by the same tampering
to all our genomes.

234
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,676
Who will be first hit?

235
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:47,045
The people we most depend on...
the police, health care workers.

236
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,214
Then people in metropolitan areas.

237
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,850
Suddenly Tad O'Malley is the
singular voice of authority?

238
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,352
Is this at all plausible?

239
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,753
It's all too plausible,

240
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,288
and I think it's already happening.

241
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:09,768
What have you found out, Sandeep?

242
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,170
They're running tests now.

243
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:12,705
About the man... who is he?

244
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:13,839
He's quite incoherent.

245
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:15,374
I think they've
determined he's military.

246
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,009
That man will die
unless he's given doses

247
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:18,777
of intravenous doxycycline.

248
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,179
What do you suspect, Dr. Scully?

249
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:22,881
Those lesions are from anthrax.

250
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,683
Uh, someone's been exposed to anthrax?

251
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,952
Willingly so, in this case.

252
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,754
You better explain this to me.

253
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:32,291
To me as well, Agent Scully,
because this is cause for alarm.

254
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,193
Soldiers deploying to Iraq
are given anthrax vaccines

255
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:36,695
to protect them in the
event of biological warfare.

256
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,564
But with compromised immune systems,

257
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:41,133
it's the vaccines that are
attacking their systems.

258
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:42,634
Meaning we're infecting them?

259
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,236
Thinking that we're protecting them.

260
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,638
We don't know that that's true.

261
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:48,640
Left arm is the site of the injection.

262
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,542
That's where we saw the
lesions, Agent Einstein.

263
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:52,111
That's purely speculative.

264
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,645
Anthrax.

265
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,115
Why else would there be an outbreak?

266
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,751
- There were outbreaks in 2001.
- You don't understand.

267
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:01,420
Anthrax is the canary in the coal mine.

268
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:03,622
It's a harbinger of
infections to come...

269
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,924
measles, mumps, rubella, the flu.

270
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,659
We're all going to be exposed.

271
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:08,627
This is happening now?

272
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,229
You are witnessing what may be

273
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:12,398
the advent of a global contagion.

274
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:15,467
You can't just say these things
when this is an isolated case.

275
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,802
Would you like to wait and see?

276
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:17,936
Wouldn't you like to first

277
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,438
wait and see my test
results, Agent Scully?

278
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:21,473
I don't think I need to
see your test results.

279
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:46,532
Mulder.

280
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,701
Pick up, please.

281
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:07,195
_

282
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:31,710
We're now getting
reports of law enforcement

283
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,380
dealing with soldiers
and military personnel

284
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,216
indicating symptoms
of exposure to anthrax,

285
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,386
a rolling first wave of
contagion set in motion

286
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,056
by our revelations of a
far-reaching conspiracy of men.

287
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,758
It's exact...

288
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,344
_

289
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:04,202
_

290
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:06,245
Spartanburg.

291
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,935
This is just the beginning.

292
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,403
You keep saying that,

293
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,038
ruling out all other possibilities...

294
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:35,574
the possibility that they
were given a faulty vaccine.

295
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,309
The Department of Defense
was recently faulted

296
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,578
for giving soldiers live vaccines.

297
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:41,046
That wouldn't cause this.

298
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,314
What do we do here as doctors?

299
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:43,782
We ponder all possible scenarios.

300
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,951
We don't have time to
ponder, Agent Einstein.

301
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:47,920
Well, I think you're wrong.

302
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,458
I hope that I'm wrong.

303
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,259
I hope that there's an
explanation for this...

304
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,562
all of it, for Mulder's
disappearance, for everything.

305
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:59,465
But right now, we are in deep trouble.

306
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,567
Consider what you're saying.

307
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:03,502
Pathogens are virtually everywhere.

308
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,338
Every cough, every sneeze,
every cut on the finger deadly.

309
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:08,307
That's not what I'm
seeing here, Agent Scully.

310
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:10,776
I am seeing one class
of people infected.

311
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,549
You're right.

312
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:20,152
You're right.

313
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:22,087
You say they're tampering with our DNA,

314
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:24,423
that they're able to shut
down our immune systems

315
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,692
by the addition of something to our DNA?

316
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:29,194
Yes, but I don't know how exactly.

317
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:30,496
Or how it's being triggered.

318
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,031
I don't know that either.

319
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,299
Or why it's happening now.

320
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:38,203
No. It makes no sense.

321
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:41,040
Think about it.

322
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:44,643
Shutting down the immune system
is a complex biological process.

323
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:47,346
It would require something
being taken away from the genome,

324
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,481
not something added to it.

325
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,521
Hello?

326
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:57,956
Agent Scully? Dana?

327
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:59,725
Yes. Who is this?

328
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,628
I can explain what's happening.

329
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:05,364
I'm sorry. Who is this?

330
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:08,300
Someone who was there for you.

331
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,569
There for me when?

332
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:13,238
When you also needed help.

333
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,866
Agent Scully.

334
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,534
Agent Reyes.

335
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:36,303
Monica.

336
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:39,339
I wish this were under
better circumstances,

337
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:40,807
but I wish

338
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:43,043
a lot of things were
different here today.

339
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:45,212
You have something to tell me.

340
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:47,848
Something you need to know.

341
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:52,052
I looked you up when
I went back to the FBI.

342
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:54,254
They said you'd been gone for a decade,

343
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,022
that you left in a hurry.

344
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:58,091
I made certain choices.

345
00:17:58,126 --> 00:17:59,593
You might not approve

346
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:01,328
or understand,

347
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:04,197
but they made sense to me at the time.

348
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,011
Special Agent Monica Reyes.

349
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:21,248
Agent Reyes, someone would
like to speak with you.

350
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,016
Do not be alarmed by his appearance.

351
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,885
He's expected to make a full recovery.

352
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,624
He'd been near death, so badly burned

353
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:33,527
they were having to
reconstruct his entire face.

354
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:37,064
Why would he summon you?

355
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:40,600
He had an offer to make.

356
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,586
Agent Reyes, please come in.

357
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:15,335
I think you know who I am.

358
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,905
I thought that you were dead.

359
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,844
They haven't killed me yet,
as hard as they may try.

360
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,885
Is it hard to look at me?

361
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,858
Considering what I know about you,

362
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,961
the things you've done, the
people you've done them to...

363
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,929
I'm not an evil man, Monica.

364
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:45,866
And you're a liar, as well.

365
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,135
What did he want, Monica?

366
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,337
To make a deal with me,

367
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,006
one that left me very little choice.

368
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,008
You changed your whole life.

369
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:58,845
You have to understand why.

370
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:07,654
How badly I want a cigarette.

371
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:11,057
Well, I can't help you with that.

372
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,293
But you can help me, Monica.

373
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,529
And for that, I'd spare your life.

374
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:18,699
It's a federal crime to
threaten an FBI agent, sir.

375
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,401
You're hardly in a
position to threaten anyone.

376
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:25,205
You see a man lying here...
a seemingly weak man...

377
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:28,241
but I'm the most
powerful man in the world.

378
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:32,879
You must have a sense
of what's happening,

379
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:34,247
heard the reports.

380
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:36,216
How did he threaten you, Monica?

381
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,518
With the ultimate weapon...

382
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:42,422
the ability to depopulate the planet,

383
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,491
to kill everyone but the chosen.

384
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,093
By tampering with their DNA?

385
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:49,629
Science acquired in the '50s,
given to them by an alien race.

386
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,435
Alien DNA mixed with our DNA.

387
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,038
It's not quite so simple.

388
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:01,208
That's excellent.

389
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:04,244
Just be quick. We don't
have a lot of time.

390
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:12,019
Merci.

391
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,725
Thank you, Monica.

392
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:21,595
You're slowly killing yourself

393
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:23,463
while you hold the world hostage.

394
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:25,932
Oh, the world will go on.

395
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:28,602
Just in my image instead of God's.

396
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,103
You think you can play God?

397
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:31,905
Oh, not God, certainly.

398
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,088
They won't know what hit them.

399
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:51,224
That their fates were
sealed since birth.

400
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,093
They were simply puppets.

401
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:57,764
You will die a lonely old man.

402
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,133
Oh, I don't think so, Monica.

403
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:03,036
Now that I have you to light my smokes.

404
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:07,641
Why did you call me, Monica?

405
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:09,643
To tell me what a coward you are?

406
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:11,678
To tell you you're protected.

407
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:13,180
What are you talking about?

408
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,681
Your abduction.

409
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:15,949
The tests.

410
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,918
Your DNA, Dana. You're safe.

411
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:19,786
You're one of the chosen elite.

412
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,622
They tampered with my DNA.

413
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,256
We are both protected, Dana.

414
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,525
That's what he was offering me.

415
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,294
But what about everybody else?

416
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,263
Everyone else is happening.

417
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,532
It's been in motion since 2012.

418
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,101
Well, then we have to stop it.

419
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:36,002
The science is complicated.

420
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:37,371
And Mulder...

421
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:38,772
Where's Mulder?

422
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:40,140
He loves Mulder.

423
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:43,777
He sent a man to him
to offer Mulder a deal.

424
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:54,948
Who sent you?

425
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,791
You sent for me.

426
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:06,827
I'm here.

427
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,815
This is so unnecessary, Fox.

428
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:20,130
I don't come when you call.

429
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,628
I've controlled you since
before you knew I existed.

430
00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:27,491
So who's in control now?

431
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:30,661
The world crumbling around us.

432
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:32,997
You set this in motion.

433
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:34,999
Now you're gonna put a stop to it.

434
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,335
It's far too late for that, Fox.

435
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,604
Too late for your heroics or mine.

436
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:40,605
I don't believe you.

437
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,840
You don't want to believe.

438
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:53,437
You may not believe this,

439
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:55,539
but I really want to save your life.

440
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,443
I don't make deals with you.

441
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:00,978
So you can see Scully again.

442
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:04,114
You harm her in any way...

443
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:11,555
Every man has his weakness.

444
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:14,458
Mine was always just cigarettes.

445
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:16,460
You think it's power,

446
00:25:16,494 --> 00:25:18,695
what you're doing, but it's not.

447
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,830
It's sickness.

448
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:21,799
It's sickness not doing it.

449
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,634
Spoken like a true psychopath.

450
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,902
I didn't set out to
destroy the world, Mulder.

451
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:27,237
People did.

452
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:29,473
You can't justify your actions.

453
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:32,609
We have just had the hottest
year on record on planet Earth.

454
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:34,244
I didn't do that.

455
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:38,148
I'm not responsible for
the 40% loss of-of bird life

456
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:40,484
or the decimation of the megafauna.

457
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:42,152
So just murder all the people?!

458
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:43,487
Aliens predicted all this.

459
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:46,156
They saw it happening to themselves.

460
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,324
And you kept it a secret.

461
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:49,326
Look at world history, Fox.

462
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,796
Neither you nor I could save
mankind from self-extermination.

463
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,965
So you plotted your endgame.

464
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,867
I just changed the timetable.

465
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:58,869
Everyone still dies in the end.

466
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:01,338
How's it feel now?

467
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:03,340
What good would it do?

468
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:05,575
You'll be dead yourself within a week.

469
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,846
What are you offering?

470
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:12,849
A seat at the big table.

471
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:16,820
It would be a shame without you.

472
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:21,491
I couldn't look at myself in the mirror.

473
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:23,360
Let alone you.

474
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:26,964
We could start the world anew, Fox.

475
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:30,467
You, me, your beloved Scully.

476
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,135
Not a rat's chance in hell!

477
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,904
You speak to me of hell?

478
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:37,574
When you look to be the
one who's hell-bound.

479
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:40,310
You appear a little feverish.

480
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:41,511
The plague?

481
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:44,715
Avian flu?

482
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:46,750
A nasty strain of rhinovirus?

483
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,021
It's not too late, Fox.

484
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:57,561
We have breaking news of
hospitals being overrun

485
00:26:57,595 --> 00:26:58,695
and temporary shelters filling up,

486
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,197
but the reality is all too clear.

487
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:01,531
It is a collapse.

488
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,434
The mainstream media
failing to cover the story,

489
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:06,236
failing to see the writing on the wall,

490
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:08,839
as anthrax outbreaks
give way to an epidemic

491
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,508
of flu and bacterial diseases.

492
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,444
Now, if you see graffiti like
this in your neighborhood,

493
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:17,414
you can suspect your
DNA is being targeted

494
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:19,916
by a release of aluminum
into the atmosphere

495
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:21,785
through chemtrails...

496
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,787
a systematic spreading of a substance

497
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:25,722
that triggers a genetic response.

498
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,892
Cases in New York,
California, across the country,

499
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:31,795
while right here in Washington,
immunity to common germs

500
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:34,931
is breaking down and
flooding our city hospitals.

501
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:50,447
Dr. Scully, we are overwhelmed here.

502
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,915
We don't know what to do.

503
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:53,584
Yes, I can see that.

504
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:54,618
I'm trying to figure it out.

505
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:55,786
Are we all just gonna get sick?

506
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,220
I don't know, Sandeep.

507
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:59,990
But right now, I need
to find Agent Einstein.

508
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:01,591
Yes, I'm gonna call them next.

509
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,161
Agent Einstein, I was
afraid you left the hospital.

510
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:05,429
No, I'd be afraid to leave.

511
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:06,830
It's gone from bad to worse out there.

512
00:28:06,864 --> 00:28:08,465
There's nothing to be
done for those people,

513
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,400
- not yet anyway.
- Centers For Disease Control

514
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,602
confirms massive contagions.

515
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:14,237
They're at a loss to contain them.

516
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,006
I'm gonna call the WHO next.

517
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,841
I need your help, right here.

518
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:23,246
What can we possibly do?

519
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:24,748
We need to act quickly.

520
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:26,149
You were right about that.

521
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:27,918
Well, I was wrong about the science.

522
00:28:27,952 --> 00:28:29,086
I was wrong about what's causing it.

523
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,087
Dead wrong, in fact.

524
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:31,622
But it's clearly

525
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:34,524
a widespread failure
of our immune systems.

526
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,959
Through gene tampering.

527
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,328
What you're calling alien DNA.

528
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,765
That's where I was mistaken.

529
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,935
Alien DNA is what I have.

530
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:48,171
And alien DNA is all that can save us.

531
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:49,840
But why is everyone sick?

532
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:52,042
What they have, what you
have, what I have to presume

533
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:54,678
the entire population has is
something entirely different.

534
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,480
It's in the germ line already.

535
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,348
It's in sperm, it's in eggs.

536
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:00,117
It's a virus within a virus

537
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:02,019
that was put there through
the smallpox vaccine.

538
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:04,621
It's what these men are
calling the Spartan Virus.

539
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:05,956
Where are you getting this?

540
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,491
From a trusted friend who says

541
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,526
that it's not too late to change it.

542
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,896
Tell me what I've got to do.

543
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:13,864
I'm gonna take a swab.

544
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:15,632
But what are we looking to do?

545
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,801
To amplify my DNA.

546
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:20,370
Using alien DNA to
defeat the Spartan Virus

547
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,406
by creating a vaccine against it.

548
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:26,510
You're gonna do a PCR,

549
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:29,413
using primers from my sequence.

550
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:30,881
Okay, that shouldn't take long.

551
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,783
Good, because we don't have long.

552
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:41,124
This is no time for pride, Fox.

553
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:45,529
I don't...

554
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:47,197
I don't want your help.

555
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:54,071
The ultimate irony.

556
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:56,673
The defeat of the big-brained beasts

557
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,376
by the tiniest unthinking microbes.

558
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,079
All thanks to the Spartan Virus.

559
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,214
Musings of a madman.

560
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,650
You don't give up, do you?

561
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,695
You'll be sorry when I'm gone.

562
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,231
I'll miss you dearly.

563
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,834
You've made my life truly worth living.

564
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,640
I'm on the king's throne.

565
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,145
Feels soft.

566
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:37,814
Just like the king.

567
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,550
And yet...

568
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:42,619
I once cheated death.

569
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,659
Oh, I wish Scully was here...

570
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:50,827
see what a monster you've become.

571
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:54,298
I'm all she'll have left.

572
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:59,803
We'll have to move quickly
to extract more of my DNA.

573
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:02,072
First, we'll have to see if it's there.

574
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:03,740
It will be there.

575
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:06,176
It'll be on a band next to the marker.

576
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,363
Thank you.

577
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,268
I don't believe this.

578
00:31:31,302 --> 00:31:33,504
I don't believe this.

579
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:34,872
There's nothing.

580
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,385
There's no alien DNA.

581
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,082
I saw it when I sequenced my genome.

582
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:41,744
It was near the centromere
on chromosome 17.

583
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:42,947
It was there.

584
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:46,723
Excuse me, Dr. Scully.

585
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:51,229
The doctors are all getting sick.

586
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:53,310
If there is anything you can do.

587
00:32:01,393 --> 00:32:04,227
We are getting our
first reports of deaths.

588
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:06,696
Soldiers from anthrax and the elderly,

589
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,766
all succumbing to infections
because of immune systems

590
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,602
that have been depleted or disappeared.

591
00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:15,071
Launched by someone

592
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:18,274
bent on a biological attack on America.

593
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:20,777
New reports that microwave radiation

594
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:23,279
is also being used as a trigger.

595
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:25,848
And reports this may
also be global in scope.

596
00:32:25,883 --> 00:32:27,917
Reports in from Europe.

597
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:30,186
Our advice is to stay indoors.

598
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,188
My crew here is suffering.

599
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:33,790
But we will attempt to stay on

600
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:36,426
as long as there is still
hope of a turnaround.

601
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:08,791
As if we're not already in the dark.

602
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,962
We have to figure this out.

603
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:15,264
What's wrong with the science?

604
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,000
Okay.

605
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,601
The Spartan Virus removes

606
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:21,004
the adenosine deaminase
gene from your DNA.

607
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:22,739
Remove the ADA gene,

608
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:25,241
and your immune system
will simply vanish.

609
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:27,276
Yeah, but I'm not getting sick.

610
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:29,245
It's only a matter of time.

611
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,314
Without alien DNA, you
don't stand a chance

612
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,449
against the Spartan Virus.

613
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:35,618
Okay. So how does it work?

614
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:37,520
How does the virus

615
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:39,422
remove the ADA gene?

616
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:41,824
- A process called CRISPR-CAS...
- CRISPR-CAS-9.

617
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,827
RNA and a protein cutting
genes at exact locations.

618
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:46,296
Exactly.

619
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,298
But in this instance used as a weapon.

620
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,299
So how does your alien DNA protect you

621
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,135
- from this weapon?
- I don't know.

622
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,003
The alien DNA must code for something

623
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:55,705
that targets the CAS-9 protein.

624
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:57,307
It must somehow

625
00:33:57,341 --> 00:33:58,541
deactivate the weapon.

626
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:00,977
But we should have seen it in the gel.

627
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:03,313
Why didn't we see it?

628
00:34:03,347 --> 00:34:04,847
They must have known
that someone would...

629
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:05,982
would try to find it.

630
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:07,150
That someone would

631
00:34:07,184 --> 00:34:08,551
attempt to find a cure.

632
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:10,353
But your DNA is different.

633
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:11,387
Yes.

634
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,190
What are you thinking, Agent Einstein?

635
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:16,025
That this was our mistake.

636
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,560
What was?

637
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:20,029
Our sample was too small.

638
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:22,966
Agent Mulder.

639
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,636
Agent Mulder. Agent Mulder.

640
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,072
Agent Mulder. Agent...

641
00:34:29,106 --> 00:34:30,840
I'm getting you out of here.

642
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:35,211
Save yourself, Agent Miller.

643
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:36,746
No, I'm not just gonna
let you die. Come on.

644
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,414
There's nothing you can do.

645
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,083
There's nothing anyone can do for him.

646
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:42,518
Nothing to be done for anyone.

647
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:47,323
Maybe nothing here, but
we're not staying here.

648
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:48,591
We're leaving.

649
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:52,362
And no one is gonna stop us.

650
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:53,463
You think you'll get far?

651
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:56,933
You have no idea how well we planned.

652
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:01,905
Come on. Let's go.

653
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:07,243
We need to do the PCR

654
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:09,779
using a larger extract of your cells.

655
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,515
Because my DNA is different.

656
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,551
Because I have extra nucleotides.

657
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:17,120
And we'll get an amplification.

658
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:19,756
And this time, I'm sure we'll see it.

659
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:26,629
You're not feeling well.

660
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:29,999
Just a little feverish.

661
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:42,245
I'm not gonna make it.

662
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:45,448
Well, I'm not giving up.

663
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:47,150
Save yourself, Miller.

664
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:48,918
He's got the cure; ask him for it.

665
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:51,721
Why didn't you ask him?

666
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:54,457
'Cause that's exactly what he wants.

667
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:03,500
Who the hell are you anyway?

668
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:07,971
Before he dies, tell him good-bye for me.

669
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:26,823
There it is.

670
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:28,258
There it is.

671
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,425
That's alien DNA

672
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,594
we're looking at.

673
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:33,162
You'll have to centrifuge it.

674
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:39,969
Think I need to lie down.

675
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:42,171
We're gonna cure you, Agent Einstein.

676
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:45,675
We're gonna have a cure
here within a few hours.

677
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,343
Don't give up on me.

678
00:36:55,886 --> 00:36:58,354
Agent Miller, where are you?

679
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:00,490
Driving north with Mulder.

680
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:01,658
And what's his condition?

681
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:05,395
He's not doing so well.

682
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:07,163
And what's your condition, Agent Miller?

683
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:09,566
Yeah, we could use a couple doctors.

684
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,368
Help is on its way, I promise.

685
00:37:12,403 --> 00:37:13,736
Okay, we're gonna keep driving,

686
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:15,672
but there's been a run on gasoline.

687
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:17,674
We may just run out of road here.

688
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,642
Keep your phone charged.

689
00:37:19,677 --> 00:37:21,744
I'll come and find you wherever you are.

690
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:28,151
It's okay, stay right there.

691
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:30,253
Stay right there.

692
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:32,522
You're gonna need my help.

693
00:37:32,556 --> 00:37:34,757
Yes, I am, Agent Einstein.

694
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,093
I'm gonna need your
help getting these IVs

695
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:38,995
into all the other doctors here.

696
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:42,031
They'll be able to make more
of this and help the suffering.

697
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:46,503
If this actually works...

698
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:48,338
It's not gonna fail.

699
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,874
...then I'll have alien DNA.

700
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:55,211
We should all hope to have it.

701
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:59,249
It's the only hope we have.

702
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:02,285
Reports are hard to come by now.

703
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,922
Lines of communication are being cut,

704
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:10,960
as systems and infrastructure
are falling... and failing

705
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:14,864
with no one to man or operate them.

706
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:17,400
It would now appear...

707
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:19,803
we go out...

708
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:22,238
with a whimper...

709
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:25,909
a frightful, deafening silence.

710
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:49,833
Stop it!

711
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,334
Stop it, please!

712
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:54,804
Please, everybody, get to the hospital!

713
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:56,105
Get to the hospital!

714
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,341
Help is on its way, I promise.

715
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,176
Just get to the hospital.

716
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:10,687
I've... just gotten
a text from a doctor,

717
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:13,356
saying now there is...

718
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,159
a ray of light.

719
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:19,929
A vaccine... that could be a miracle.

720
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:21,331
Don't give up.

721
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:25,228
All I see are cars.

722
00:40:25,262 --> 00:40:28,064
I don't know how I'm gonna find you.

723
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:29,699
I'm gonna get out of the car,

724
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:31,401
stand in the road, all right?

725
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:39,275
I'm gonna get out, too.

726
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,620
I'm getting out.

727
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:55,625
I'm moving in your direction.

728
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:03,066
Yeah, I think I see you.

729
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,301
Just... just keep walking straight.

730
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:06,636
Okay.

731
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,281
Where is he?

732
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:23,620
Mulder.

733
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:24,988
I'm here.

734
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:27,457
He saved your life.

735
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,794
Old Smokey.

736
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:33,630
I suppose I should thank him.

737
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:36,766
We're gonna save your life.

738
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:39,002
Agent Miller...

739
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:41,304
is also in trouble.

740
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,507
I'll take care of Agent Miller.

741
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:47,544
But right now, we're gonna
get an IV into you, okay?

742
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,747
Okay.

743
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:53,753
He's worse off than I thought.

744
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:55,618
Can you do anything for him?

745
00:41:55,653 --> 00:41:58,621
What I can do might not help.

746
00:41:58,656 --> 00:42:01,324
He needs stem cells in him right now.

747
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:03,059
Stem cells from who?

748
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:07,297
We have a child together.

749
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:09,099
That child will be
protected by his inheritance

750
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,533
and my alien DNA.

751
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:14,070
Then we have to get to him.

752
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:19,075
I don't know where he is.

753
00:43:03,016 --> 00:43:08,016
