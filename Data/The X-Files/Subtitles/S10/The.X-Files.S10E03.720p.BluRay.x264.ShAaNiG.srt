recounting how I once thought

44
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,343
it had something to do

with a series
of mysterious sightings

46

of a rock-like creature
in Colorado,

47
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,809

just a publicity stunt

51
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,192
if not wiser, eyes,
how many of these cases,

52
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,487
whether it's "The Amarillo
Armadillo Man"

53
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,948
or "The Hairy Whatzit
of Walla Walla,"

54
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,615
can be explained away
as fraternity pranks,

55
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,322
practical jokes or
people making stuff up

56
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,658
simply because
they're bored and/or crazy.

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,037
And if that
doesn't explain it,

58
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,460
well, then it was
probably just ice.

Mulder, have you
been taking your meds?

60
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,712
Scully, Charles Fort
spent his entire life

61
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,670
researching natural
and scientific anomalies,

62
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,546
which he published
in four books,

63
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,631
all of which I know by heart.

64
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,924
And at the end
of his life,

65
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,224
Fort himself wondered

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,893
if it hadn't all been a waste.

67
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,562

00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,850
No, I am, lam.

70
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,480
I'm thinking maybe it's time
to put away childish things,

71
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,316
the Sasquatches and mothmen

72
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,946
and jackalopes.

73
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,497
I thought it'd be great
to get back to work.

74
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,625
But is this really how I want
to spend the rest of my days?

75
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,702
Chasing after monsters?

76
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,833
We've been given
another case, Mulder.

77
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,256
It has a monster in it.

78
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,421
One witness claimed that the
creature had three eyes

79
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,847
and the other one, one.

80
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,926
Notice they didn't get a
picture of it, which is odd,

81
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,512
because everybody always has
a camera on them these days.

82
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,481

witnesses while we're here?

85
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,447
where they say
they saw the creature

86
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,024
attacking the animal
control officer,

87
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,950
even though he claims
to not have seen

88
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,824
whatever it was
that was attacking him.

89
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,075
Of course not.

90
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,747
Mountain lions always
attack from behind.

91
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,745
He was out here responding to
a call about a mountain lion.

92
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,202
It was a mountain lion. That's
what killed the other victim, too.

93
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,337
Well, that is what the local
authorities thought,

94
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,086
until they did a search
the next morning

95
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,712
and they found
this area over here,

96
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,720
where they found three
more victims. Hmm.

97
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,306
Gray wolves, Scully.

98
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,224
They've made a comeback
in this region.

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,224
Wolves take their
prey back to a lair.

100
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,103
Well, they were all mutilated
in exactly the same manner.

101
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,652
However, the third victim
wasn't wearing any clothes.

102
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,525
Maybe he was a nudist.

103
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,943
Took a midnight hike
in the nude,

104
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,696
got attacked by a wolf
or a lion or a bear.

105
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,994
Maybe all
at the same time.

106
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,161
That's how I'd like
to go out.

107
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:25,038
The uniqueness of the wounds,
Mulder, implies a human element.

108
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,996
Aw, Scully, I gave up profiling
before I gave up monsters.

109
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,423
You've seen one serial
killer, you've seen 'em all.

110
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,675
Mulder, I can see
that you're going through

111
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,377
a questioning phase
of some sort,

112
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,337
but people have
been killed here.

113
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,798
And if we can help stop
that and save some lives,

114
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,806
I think that is a unquestionably
worthwhile thing for us to do,

115
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,391
regardless of whether the thing
we find is animal or human

116
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,016
or otherwise.

put it that way.

119
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,114

is doing these killings,

120

00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,513
What is up
with your phone?

180
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,688
I don't know,
it's this new app.

181
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,856
I don't know
if it's working right.

182
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,855
Are you taking picture or video?
I don't know.

183
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,777
Well, go to "settings."
Where?

184
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,854
Go to the settings.

188
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,207
No, I'm okay.

189
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,914
You've got
blood on you.

190
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,249
I don't think
it's mine.

192
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,806
Okay, that's it.

193
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,098
I quit.

194
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,301
Did you get
a good look at it?

195
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,140
I got a picture.

196
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,311
(GROWLING)

197
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,029
Oh!
Sorry

198
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,080
A bit of privacy, please.

199
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,704
Have you seen a...

200
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,520
That's its ear.

201
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,152
Or maybe it's a foot.

202
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,104
Mulder...
This one,

203
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,531
if you squint,
looks like

204
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,987
something.
(SIGHS)

205
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,443
And then this...

206
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,028
That's in focus!

207
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,662
But what is it?
It's a close-up.

208
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,786
Of the creature. Now, mind
you, I didn't say "monster."

209
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,417
And it wasn't
a Sasquatch.

210
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,166
But it was definitely an animal,
man-sized and hairless.

211
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,589
Maybe it was
a mangy Sasquatch.

212
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,800
Hey. You're overlooking
the video. Look.

213
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,047
(SCREAMING)

214
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,638
Mulder, you've got the lens
pointed the wrong way.

215
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,387
Yeah, it's the new
camera app. But look.

216
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,887
It shot blood at me.

217
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,681
From out its eyeball,
Scully, I think.

218
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,438
It was hard for me to see,
because I had blood in my eyes.

219
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,357
I haven't done
the blood analysis yet,

220
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,984
but it's probably residue
from the prior attack

221
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,110
on this victim.

222
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,159
And animals don't shoot blood
out of their eyeballs.

223
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,078
Oh, no? Well, tell that
to the horned lizard.

224
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,540
Which shoots blood
out its eyeball, Scully.

225
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,333
Yes, it's
a defense mechanism.

226
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,581
Scientific fact!

227
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,955
Mulder, the Internet
is not good for you.

228
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,335
Doesn't this
bear a resemblance

229
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,586
to what witnesses
claim they saw?

230
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,300
What, so now you're saying
that you were attacked

231
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,797
by a six-foot
horny toad?

232
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,925
Whoa! Let's just keep
this within the realm

233
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,597
of the natural sciences,
shall we?

234
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,304
My initial exam
of the bite marks

235
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,726
on this wound
would suggest

236
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,394
that they were made
by a human being.

237
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,023
So we're looking for a
man-sized horned lizard

238
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,600
with human teeth.

239
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,396
Sounds a bit silly,
doesn't it?

240
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,939
Yeah.

yourself, aren't you, Scully?

242
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,528
Yeah. I am.

243
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,165
I forgot how much fun
these cases could be.

244
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,335
It's been
a long day, Mulder.

245
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,124
Why don't you go
back to the hotel

246
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,002
and get some sleep?

247
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,957
And try not to
dream about monsters.

for the disturbance.

Now, please,
go back to your room.

I heard someone yell,
"Monster!"

257

That's what he had
the nerve to call me,

258
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,205
just because I asked him
to pay his overdue bill.

259
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,998
Does that make me
some kind of a monster?

260
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,829
Of course not.
Exactly.

gonna report you.

355
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,605
which we did not notice
at the time,

356
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,858
because we thought we were
looking for an animal.

357
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,314
Turns out we were
only half right.

358
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,274
Yeah, okay. Well, we need
to talk to this guy.

359
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,904
Well,l doubt he's coming
back to his room.

360
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,078
I did retrieve some personal
items from it, though,

361
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,574
that might help us
track him down.

362
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,665
Well, that sounds like a
good investigative plan.

363
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,202
The first thing
we need to do, though,

364
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,293
(WHISPERS) check out
of this motel.

365
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,299
Once upon a time,
there was a village

366
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:11,679
that was being tormented by
a man-eating lizard-dragon.

367
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,686
The local constable did everything
to try to kill this creature,

368
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,855
but nothing
could stop it.

369
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,520
So, finally,
he visits a Gypsy,

370
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,028
who tells him the only
way to kill this monster

371
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,862
is to stab it in its appendix
with a lance made of green glass.

372
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,654
Why the green glass?
And why the appendix?

373
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,580
Who the hell knows?

374
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,282
In these
old fairy tales,

375
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,495
the monster must always be destroyed
by some form of penetration.

376
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,047
A silver bullet,
a wooden stake...

377
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:48,135
Obviously, our ancestors were <i>as</i>
obsessed with impotency as we are, eh?

378
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,215
So, he fashions
a lance of green glass

379
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,766
and <i>stabs</i> the monster
in its appendix.

380
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,811
But <i>as</i> the monster
is dying,

381
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:01,187
the constable realizes he's
been looking in the mirror.

382
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,144
He was the monster
all along, you see?

383
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,278
The moral being?

384
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,992
It's easier to believe in
monsters out there in the world

385
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,822
than to accept that the real
monsters dwell within us

386
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,905
here

387
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,990
and sometimes here.

388
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,247
Maybe sometimes
here, right? (LAUGHS)

389
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,796
Not everything can be
reduced to psychology.

390
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,085
That's what you think.

391
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,842
At any rate, I was
reminded of this tale

392
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,590
because of your
suspect's delusion

393
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,048
that when the moon appears, he
would turn into a werewolf.

394
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,344
Werewolf?

395
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,017
I'm sorry.
I meant "were-lizard."

396
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,892
The werewolf was my
patient on Monday.

397
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,400
At any event, I prescribed
for him this antipsychotic,

398
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,853
but I doubt
it did him much good.

399
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,024
Why not?

400
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,106
He seemed pretty crazy.

401
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,366
Your, uh, records don't
provide much information,

402
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,949
and I'm assuming that "Guy
Mann" is not a real name.

403
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,501
Do you have any idea of
how I might find him?

404
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,297
I recommended, the next time
he felt an episode coming on,

405
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,842
that he go for a quiet stroll
in the local cemetery.

406
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:15,599
A reminder that no matter how
overwhelming our anxieties might be,

407
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,599
they will soon
be resolved

408
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,770
when we are dead and
buried for all eternity.

409
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,931
Do you really think that's
sound therapeutic advice?

410
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,484
It's what I do.

411
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,229

Perhaps I've read you wrong, Mr.
Mulder, but I wonder,

416
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,075
who is in more need
of an antipsychotic,

417
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,834

to be a were-lizard

418
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,210

that man, hmm?

Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

to say what I'm about to say,

I came in and I asked him if I
could ask him some questions,

00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,906
I want to believe.

873
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,795
I don't mean to
get too personal,

874
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,554
but this has been a real
trying time for me.

875
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,801
I've been
through a lot.

876
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,309
But just having
someone like you to...

877
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,480
Look, what I'm trying
to say is,

878
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,182
I'm glad to
have met you.

879
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,985
Like...

880
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,547
Likewise.
