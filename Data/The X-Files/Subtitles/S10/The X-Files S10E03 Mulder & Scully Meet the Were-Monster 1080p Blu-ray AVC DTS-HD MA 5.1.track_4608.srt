00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:49,338
it had something to do

with a series
of mysterious sightings

46

of a rock-like creature
in Colorado,

47
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,802

just a publicity stunt

51

if not wiser, eyes,
how many of these cases,

52
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,481
whether it's "The Amarillo
Armadillo Man"

53
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,941
or "The Hairy Whatzit
of Walla Walla,"

54
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,612
can be explained away
as fraternity pranks,

55
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,323
practical jokes or
people making stuff up

56
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:18,658
simply because
they're bored and/or crazy.

57
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,035
And if that
doesn't explain it,

58
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,453
well, then it was
probably just ice.

Mulder, have you
been taking your meds?

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,709
Scully, Charles Fort
spent his entire life

61
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:30,670
researching natural
and scientific anomalies,

62
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,547
which he published
in four books,

63
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,633
all of which I know by heart.

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,926
And at the end
of his life,

65
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,219
Fort himself wondered

66
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:38,887
if it hadn't all been a waste.

67
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,555

No, lam, lam.

70
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:49,481

to put away childish things,

00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,317
the Sasquatches and mothmen

72
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,944
and jackalopes.

73
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:58,490
I thought it'd be great
to get back to work.

74
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:01,618
But is this really how I want
to spend the rest of my days?

75
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,703
Chasing after monsters?

76
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,831
We've been given
another case, Mulder.

77
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,250
It has a monster in it.

78
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,423
One witness claimed that the
creature had three eyes

79
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:15,841
and the other one, one.

80
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,927
Notice they didn't get a
picture of it, which is odd,

81
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,513
because everybody always has
a camera on them these days.

82
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,474

witnesses while we're here?

85
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,441
where they say
they saw the creature

00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,025
attacking the animal
control officer,

87
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:35,944
even though he claims
to not have seen

88
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,821
whatever it was
that was attacking him.

89
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,072
Of course not.

90
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:40,740
Mountain lions always
attack from behind.

91
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,742
He was out here responding to
a oall about a mountain lion.

92
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:45,203
It was a mountain lion. That's
what killed the other victim, too.

93
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,331
Well, that is what the local
authorities thought,

94
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,083
until they did a search
the next morning

95
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,710
and they found
this area over here,

96
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:55,714
where they found three
more victims. Hmm.

97
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:58,300
Gray wolves, Scully.

98
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,218
They've made a comeback
in this region.

99
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:03,221
Wolves take their
prey back to a lair.

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,100
Well, they were all mutilated
in exactly the same manner.

101
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:10,645
However, the third victim
wasn't wearing any clothes.

102
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,522
Maybe he was a nudist.

103
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:13,940
Took a midnight hike
in the nude,

104
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:16,693
got attacked by a wolf
or a lion or a bear.

105
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,987
Maybe all
at the same time.

106
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,155
That's how I'd like
to go out.

107
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:25,035
The uniqueness of the wounds,
Mulder, implies a human element.

108
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:28,997
Aw, Scully, I gave up profiling
before I gave up monsters.

109
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,416
You've seen one serial
killer, you've seen 'em all.

110
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,668
Mulder, I can see
that you're going through

111
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,378
a questioning phase
of some sort,

112
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:37,339
but people have
been killed here.

113
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:39,799
And if we can help stop
that and save some lives,

114
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:43,803
I think that is a unquestionably
worthwhile thing for us to do,

115
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:48,391

we find is animal or human

put it that way.

119
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,107

is doing these killings,

120

00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:33,515
What is up
with your phone?

180
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:34,683
I don't know,
it's this new app.

181
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:35,850
I don't know
if it's working right.

182
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,852
Are you taking picture or video?
I don't know.

183
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,771
Well, go to "settings."
Where?

184
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:40,855
Go to the settings.

00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,915
You've got
blood on you.

190
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,250

it's mine.

192
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,799
Okay, that's it.

193
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,092
I quit.

194
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,302
Did you get
a good look at it?

195
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,138
I got a picture.

196
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,305
(GROWLING)

197
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,030
Oh!
Sorry.

198
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,074
A bit of privacy, please.

199
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,702
Have you seen a...

200
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,517
That's its ear.

201
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:02,145
Or maybe it's a foot.

202
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,105
Mulder...
This one,

203
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:06,524
if you squint,
looks like

204
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:07,984
something.
(SIGHS)

205
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,444

206
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,029
That's in focus!

207
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,656
But what is it?
It's a close-up.

208
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,784
Of the creature. Now, mind
you, I didn't say "monster."

209
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,410
And it wasn't
a Sasquatch.

210
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:20,163
But it was definitely an animal,
man-sized and hairless.

211
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,582
Maybe it was
a mangy Sasquatch.

212
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,794
Hey. You're overlooking
the video. Look.

213
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:27,045
(SCREAMING)

214
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,632
Mulder, you've got the lens
pointed the wrong way.

215
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:33,384
Yeah, it's the new
camera app. But look.

216
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,888
It shot blood at me.

217
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,682
From out its eyeball,
Scully, I think.

218
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:42,435
It was hard for me to see,
because I had blood in my eyes.

219
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,354
I haven't done
the blood analysis yet,

220
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,981
but it's probably residue
from the prior attack

221
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,107
on this victim.

222
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,152
And animals don't shoot blood
out of their eyeballs.

223
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:54,072
Oh, no? Well, tell that
to the horned lizard.

224
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:57,534
Which shoots blood
out its eyeball, Scully.

225
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,327
Yes, it's
a defense mechanism.

226
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,578
Scientific fact!

227
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,956
Mulder, the Internet
is not good for you.

228
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:04,332
Doesn't this
bear a resemblance

229
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,583
to what witnesses
claim they saw?

230
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,293
What, so now you're saying
that you were attacked

231
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:08,795
by a six-foot
horny toad?

232
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,922
Whoa! Let's just keep
this within the realm

233
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,590
of the natural sciences,
shall we?

234
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,301
My initial exam
of the bite marks

235
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:16,719
on this wound
would suggest

236
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:18,388
that they were made
by a human being.

237
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,016
So we're looking for a
man-sized horned lizard

238
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,601
with human teeth.

239
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,398

doesn't it?

00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:29,941
Yeah.

these cases could be.

It's been
a long day, Mulder.

245
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,122
Why don't you go
back to the hotel

246
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,999
and get some sleep?

247
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,959

dream about monsters.

That's what he had
the nerve to call me,

258

justbecause I asked him
to pay his overdue bill.

259
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,992
Does that make me
some kind of a monster?

355
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:40,603
which we did not notice
at the time,

356
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,855
because we thought we were
looking for an animal.

357
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,315
Turns out we were
only half right.

358
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,275
Yeah, okay. Well, we need
to talk to this guy.

359
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,902
Well, I doubt he's
coming back to his room.

360
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,071
I did retrieve some personal
items from it, though,

361
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,572
that might help us
track him down.

362
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,659
Well, that sounds like a
good investigative plan.

363
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:57,203
The first thing
we need to do, though,

364
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,290
(WHISPERS) check out
of this motel.

365
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:07,296
Once upon a time,
there was a village

366
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,676
that was being tormented by
a man-eating lizard-dragon.

367
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,680
The local constable did everything
to try to kill this creature,

368
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,848
but nothing
could stop it.

369
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:20,518
So, finally,
he visits a Gypsy,

370
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:24,021
who tells him the only
way to kill this monster

371
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:28,859
is to stab it in its appendix
with a lance made of green glass.

372
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,655
Why the green glass?
And why the appendix?

373
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,573
Who the hell knows?

374
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,284
Inthese
old fairy tales,

375
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:40,496
the monster must always be destroyed
by some form of penetration.

376
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,040
A silver bullet,
a wooden stake...

377
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:48,129
Obviously, our ancestors were as
obsessed with impotency as we are, eh?

378
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:51,215
So, he fashions
a lance of green glass

379
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,759
and stabs the monster
in its appendix.

380
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,804
But as the monster
is dying,

381
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:01,183
the constable realizes he's
been looking in the mirror.

382
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,145
He was the monster
all along, you see?

383
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,272
The moral being?

384
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:10,985
It's easier to believe in
monsters out there in the world

385
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:14,822
than to accept that the real
monsters dwell within us

386
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:15,906
here

387
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,992
and sometimes here.

388
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,244
Maybe sometimes
here, right? (LAUGHS)

389
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,789
Not everything can be
reduced to psychology.

390
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,082
That's what you think.

391
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,835
At any rate, I was
reminded of this tale

392
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,587
because of your
suspect's delusion

393
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,049
that when the moon appears, he
would turn into a werewolf.

394
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,342
Werewolf?

395
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:37,011
I'm sorry.
I meant "were-lizard."

396
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,889
The werewolf was my
patient on Monday.

397
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:44,393
At any event, I prescribed
for him this antipsychotic,

398
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,854
but I doubt
it did him much good.

399
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,022
Why not?

400
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,107
He seemed pretty crazy.

401
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:56,364
Your, uh, records don't
provide much information,

402
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:59,950
and I'm assuming that "Guy
Mann" is not a real name.

403
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,495
Do you have any idea of
how I might find him?

404
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:06,290
I recommended, the next time
he felt an episode coming on,

405
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:09,835
that he go for a quiet stroll
in the local cemetery.

406
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:15,591
A reminder that no matter how
overwhelming our anxieties might be,

407
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,593
they will soon
be resolved

408
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,763
when we are dead and
buried for all eternity.

409
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,933
Do you really think that's
sound therapeutic advice?

410
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,477
It's what I do.

Perhaps I've read you wrong, Mr.
Mulder, but I wonder,

00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,077
who is in more need
of an antipsychotic,

417
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,831

to be a were-lizard

418
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,208

that man, hmm?

I came in and I asked him if I
could ask him some questions,

873
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,793
I don't mean to
get too personal,

874
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,548
but this has been a real
trying time for me.

875
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:29,799
I've been
through a lot.

876
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:33,302
Butjust having
someone like you to...

877
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,473
Look, what I'm trying
to say is,

878
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,183
I'm glad to
have met you.

879
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:46,983
Like...

880
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:10,548
Likewise.
