killed, that was only him.

533
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,584
"Him"? Who is him?

534
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,174
You saw those
things in the hall.

535
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,296
Yeah.

536
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,422
I made them.

537
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,925
I didn't mean to,
but I made 'em.

538
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,428
They'll go away, eventually.
They're fading.

539
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,477
But the Band-Aid
Nose Man...

540
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,897
He's different.

541
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,069
Tibetan Buddhists
would call him a Tulpa.

542
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,854
A thought form

543
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,784
using mind and energy to will
consciousness into existence.

544
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:51,329
<i>Tulpa</i> is a 1929 Theosophist mistranslation
of the Tibetan word <i>"tulku,"</i>

545
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,623
meaning
"a manifestation body."

546
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,868
There is no idea
in Tibetan Buddhism

547
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,045
of a thought form
or thought as form.

548
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,588
And a realized <i>tulku</i>
would never harm anyone,

549
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,881
let alone kill.

550
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,800
Okay. But I'm telling you.

551
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,468
I spend a lot
of energy in my art.

552
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,597
I meditated on it.
I willed it.

553
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,099

to look like,</i>

554
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,304

555
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,273
and why I wanted him.

I didn't bring him here.

560
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,656
He came to me.

567

they come to you.

568

William.

574
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,906

TRASHMAN: This...

576
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,797
This is what came
to me in my dreams.

577
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,624
From some
other place, yeah?

578
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,085
But now it's alive
and it's out there.

579
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,634
Down to the Band-Aid I used
to hold the clay in place.

580
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,965
Who would copy this?

581
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,675
And did you smell it?

582
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,181
It smells like
nothing on this earth.

583
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,059
It has its own life.
Does what it wants.

584
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,015
I just wanted
to scare 'em,

585
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,021
scare anyone that took dignity
away from the homeless.

586
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,695
That's where the violent
idea popped in my head.

587
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,363
It was just an emotion
that ran through my head.

588
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,782
An idea is dangerous,
even a small one.

589
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,985
But now he uses
that violent idea.

590
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,322
He thinks that is what
he is supposed to do.

591
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,906
You are responsible.

592
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,582
If you made the problem,

593
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,379
if it was your idea,

594
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,007
then you're responsible.

595
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,087
You put it out of sight, so that
it wouldn't be your problem.

596
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,014
But you're just as bad as
the people that you hate.

If what you believe
is possible,

598
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,522
the last person involved in the
relocation would be Landry.

599
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,319
He got
the injunction lifted.

600
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,739
They're moving people out
to Franklin Hospital tonight.

All right, all right.

for Daryl Landry.

Mr. Landry, this is Agent Mulder.
I need you to call me back.

Sir, go to your room.

as parents,
