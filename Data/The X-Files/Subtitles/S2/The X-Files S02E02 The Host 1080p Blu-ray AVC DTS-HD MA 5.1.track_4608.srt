1
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:15,224
<i>(sailors shout in Russian)</i>

2
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,285
Argh!

3
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,542
<i>(shouting)</i>

4
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:33,422
<i>(man 1) Dave can set it up,
but the cost sounds a bit rich.</i>

5
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:37,718
<i>(man 2) If he's putting it together,
you'd be a fool to pass it up.</i>

6
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,221
<i>I hear you. I just...</i>

7
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,641
<i>You just what? You wanna take a dip,
you gotta test the water.</i>

8
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:48,187
<i>- You just don't wanna get wet.
- No, man. Dippage is sacred.</i>

9
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,107
<i>Dippage is sacred.</i>

10
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,652
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

11
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:58,781
You're relieved from your assignment.
Agent Bozoff will take over.

12
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,159
You've got a flight to catch in 45 minutes.

13
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,496
- Where am I going?
- Murder case. Newark, New Jersey.

14
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,666
Treat yourself.

15
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,711
Your contact in Newark
is a Detective Norman.

16
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:16,715
- How'd I draw the assignment?
- Assistant Director Skinner requested you.

17
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,051
Skinner requested me?!

18
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:45,536
- Mulder, FBI.
- My forensics team's just wrapping up.

19
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,873
We left the body where we found it.
Kenny!

20
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,878
This is one case I'm gonna be
happy to turn over to you guys.

21
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,182
<i>(Detective Norman)</i> Watch yourself.

22
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,435
Yeah. Wouldn't wanna step in anything.

23
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,151
They say it cuts the smell if you
don't breathe through your mouth.

24
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,904
<i>(Mulder)</i> They lied.

25
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:24,033
- Who found the body?
- Sanitation worker.

26
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,660
Looks like it's been here a while.

27
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:30,539
- Any ID?
- No. Not much to go on, either.

28
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,167
Front side is pretty much eaten away.

29
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,421
- Would you like us to turn him over?
- No, I'll take your word on that.

30
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:41,300
Hey, Agent Mulder!
What should we do with the body?

31
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:46,597
Wrap it up and send it to the FBI,
care of Assistant Director Skinner!

32
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,158
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

33
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,910
I need to speak to him.

34
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,121
Mr Skinner is unavailable.
If you'd take a seat...

35
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:15,793
Will you tell him that I'm here
and I need to speak to him... now?

36
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,671
Certainly.

37
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:25,469
Mr Skinner, I'm very sorry to interrupt,
but Agent Mulder is demanding to see you.

38
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,305
- Is there a problem, Agent Mulder?
- Yeah, there is.

39
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,683
Then make an appointment.

40
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,978
That's hard when you're
up to your ass in raw sewage...

41
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,605
...on another meaningless assignment.

42
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,401
- Excuse me?
- What's next? Scrubbing bathroom floors?

43
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,571
- You're out of line, Agent Mulder.
- So I gathered.

44
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,408
Fine.

45
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,619
Come into my office, Agent Mulder. Please.

46
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,460
Would you inform the room...

47
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:02,715
...as to why you regard your case
in New Jersey as meaningless?

48
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,260
It's a simple drugland body dump...

49
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,680
...not the type of case
the FBI wastes time or manpower on.

50
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:17,021
Given your recent history, you're not one
to judge what is or is not a waste of time.

51
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,606
Sir, my work on the X-Files...

52
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,067
The X-Files have been closed, Agent Mulder.

53
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,612
You will carry out new assignments...

54
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:29,491
...and investigate them to the best
of your ability. Is that not clear?

55
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,619
Yeah.

56
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:36,206
And I'll be anticipating your field reports
on your current homicide case.

57
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,375
Thank you.

58
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,099
Is this seat taken?

59
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,772
No. But I should warn you,
I'm experiencing violent impulses.

60
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,983
Well, I'm armed, so I'll take my chances.

61
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,497
I hear you really endeared yourself
to Assistant Director Skinner today.

62
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:23,462
Sometimes it's hard to smile when they
ask you to bend down and grab your ankles.

63
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,549
It's not as if you've ever tried
to fit into the programme.

64
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,301
No.

65
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,055
No, I've been thinking a lot about that lately.

66
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:38,310
- I've been thinking about leaving.
- The Bureau?

67
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,104
What would you do?

68
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,273
Pursue my work in the
paranormal, somehow.

69
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:49,905
You could request a transfer to Quantico.
Come back to the behavioural science unit.

70
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,158
They don't want us
working together, Scully.

71
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,953
And that's the only reason
I can think of to stay.

72
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,747
What about this case you're working on?

73
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,376
- It's a zero.
- Where's the body?

74
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,797
In our forensics lab.
Look, I know what you're trying to do.

75
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,091
Maybe I can request to do the autopsy.

76
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:14,179
It's an exercise. Skinner is just
rubbing my nose in this one.

77
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,390
There's nothing to it.

78
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,685
There's a dead body, isn't there?

79
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,656
Oh!

80
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:45,252
Examination and autopsy of
John Doe number 1-0-1-3-5-6.

81
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,881
Case number DP1-1-2-1-4-8.

82
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,135
Special Agent Fox Mulder,
field investigator.

83
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:59,308
Body is an adult male with
advanced tissue decomposition...

84
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,145
...weighing 165 pounds in <i>extremis...</i>

85
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,398
...69 inches in length.

86
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:11,153
Intact skin is mottled and discoloured...

87
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:15,866
...due to submergence in and exposure to
a highly bacterial environment.

88
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,660
Cause and time of death...

89
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,537
...unknown.

90
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,916
Possible identifying mark on right forearm.

91
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,925
Body cavities appear normal.

92
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,638
Interior organs intact...

93
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,433
...consistent in rate of decomposition.

94
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,898
Removing the ribcage.

95
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,244
Condition of heart and lungs are good.

96
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:05,457
No sign of thrombi,
natural or degenerate diseases.

97
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,669
Indicate victim was probably a young adult.

98
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:13,215
The liver shows some nodular hardening...

99
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,968
...consistent with incipient alcoholism.

100
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,886
Oh, God!

101
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,540
- It's on the way!
- Got it!

102
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,002
OK.

103
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,490
Need a big piece of 30-gauge
and some baling wire.

104
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,327
I gotta go back up top for the screen.

105
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,560
Frank! Help!

106
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,522
Frank! Frank!

107
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,233
Frank!

108
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,196
Frank! Hurry!

109
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,740
Hold on!

110
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,534
- Frank!
- Come on!

111
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,869
Frank!

112
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,123
Hold on till I tie the line! Hold on!

113
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,627
Pull up, come on! Come on! Come on!

114
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,005
Pull up!

115
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,930
My God!

116
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,393
I'm gonna get help!

117
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:48,036
I'm gonna give you a tetanus booster,
just as a precaution.

118
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:54,084
I'd be happy if you just give me something
to get this taste out of my mouth.

119
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,170
Let me take a look.

120
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,547
Ah.

121
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,758
- Any trouble swallowing?
- Uh-uh.

122
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,764
It'll go away.

123
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,643
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

124
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:16,606
Newark PD referred me to you.
I'm surprised the FBI is involved.

125
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,361
- Is there something here I should know?
- I don't know. Maybe you can tell me.

126
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,076
He's a sanitation worker. He claims he was
attacked by something down in the sewer.

127
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,413
- Attacked? By what?
- We've been unable to determine.

128
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:36,209
I thought it was a bogus disability claim,
but he appears to be telling the truth.

129
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,546
- What's his condition?
- He's in satisfactory health.

130
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:45,177
I've given him a heavy course of antibiotics,
and we're checking for hepatitis.

131
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,263
He does have a strange wound on his back.

132
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:54,311
- What kind of wound?
- It could be some kind of bacterial infection.

133
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,898
Frankly, I can't say
I've ever seen anything like it.

134
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:08,533
- This is Agent Mulder of the FBI.
- Any idea what attacked you?

135
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,161
I've been thinking it might've been a python.

136
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,537
A python?

137
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:18,168
Or a boa constrictor. Somebody probably
flushed their pet snake down the toilet.

138
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,006
We found an alligator in the sewer
a couple of years ago.

139
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,677
Stronger than hell, I'll tell you that.
Clamped onto me like a vice.

140
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,806
It almost looks like a bite.

141
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,648
<i>- (phone rings)
- Excuse me.</i>

142
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,777
- Mulder.
- <i>Mulder, it's me. I need to see you.</i>

143
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,113
<i>I've got something you should know about.</i>

144
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,825
- What is it?
- Some kind of parasite in your John Doe.

145
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,744
I should know more
by the time you get here.

146
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,082
I'm in Jersey. I should be taking
the shuttle in about an hour.

147
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,001
Can I get outta here? I'd like to go home.

148
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,045
<i>- (phone rings)
- Excuse me.</i>

149
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,799
<i>- Scully, this is a bad time for me to talk.</i>
- <i>(man) Mr</i> Mulder?

150
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,551
Yeah?

151
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:12,180
I think you should know...
you have a friend at the FBI.

152
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,144
Who is this?

153
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:24,359
Agent Mulder? If you don't have any more
questions, I'm gonna release this man.

154
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,528
OK. Go ahead.

155
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,250
Close the door.

156
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:49,968
It's called Turbellaria, commonly
known as a fluke, or flatworm.

157
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,262
This was living inside the body?

158
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:57,601
It had attached itself to the bile duct
and was feeding off the liver.

159
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,894
Lovely!

160
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,732
Believe it or not, some 40 million
people are infected worldwide.

161
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,361
This isn't where you tell me
some terrible story about sushi, is it?

162
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,532
Maybe you'd rather hear what you
can catch from a nice rare steak.

163
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,952
So, what? The murder weapon
was a top sirloin?

164
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,497
Flukes are endemic
in unsanitary conditions.

165
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:23,627
It's more likely that the victim
contracted it down inside the sewer.

166
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,255
- Before or after he died?
- I don't know.

167
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,177
My sources say it's unlikely
a single parasite could have killed him.

168
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,724
He was a young man. But the weird thing is,
there's no other discernible cause of death.

169
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,353
How do these parasites attach themselves?

170
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:46,816
They have what's called a scolex, a
sucker-like mouth with four hooking spikes.

171
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,527
- Anything like this?
- Where'd you get that?

172
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,698
Something attacked a workman
in a New Jersey sewer this morning.

173
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,242
And you're asking me if this is from a fluke?

174
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,369
Could it be?

175
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,538
The scolex is a tiny organ.
This is a huge bite mark.

176
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:04,125
- How big can these things get?
- Mulder, I...

177
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,505
I'm sorry.

178
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,633
It felt like old times there for a second.

179
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:19,766
Flatworms are what are known
as obligate endoparasites.

180
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,352
They live inside of the host...

181
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,523
...entering the body through
the ingestion of larvae or eggs.

182
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,985
They are not creatures that
go around attacking people.

183
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,071
That's good. I didn't wanna tell Skinner...

184
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,950
...his murder suspect was
a giant bloodsucking worm.

185
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,368
No.

186
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:45,625
Well, at the very least, this'll be interesting
to the Newark Department of Sanitation.

187
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,801
Look, I don't know who you shared
our conversation with the other night, but...

188
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,513
...I'd prefer it if you didn't
try to launch a campaign for me.

189
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,224
- Excuse me?
- I don't know who you talked to.

190
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,812
- I didn't talk to anybody.
- Somebody told me I had a friend at the FBI.

191
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:14,446
Look, Mulder, I... I don't know what to say.
But I... I wouldn't betray a confidence.

192
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,162
The city runs on different systems...

193
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,416
...some new, some built
at the turn of the century.

194
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,253
- Almost as old as Charlie. Right, Charlie?
- Oh, yes, sir.

195
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:58,091
- What part of the sewer was I in?
- An older section. Big eight-foot tunnels.

196
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,261
It looked more like a catacomb
than a sewer line.

197
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,722
The new sections are concrete pipe,
mostly 24 inches.

198
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,684
And all the sewage
comes through this plant?

199
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:12,564
560,000 people a day call my office
on the porcelain telephone.

200
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,568
Have you ever seen one of these?

201
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,407
It looks like a big old worm.

202
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,952
It's called a fluke. It came
from the body in the sewer.

203
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,121
Wouldn't surprise me.

204
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:32,000
No telling what's been breeding
down there in the last 100 years.

205
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,103
<i>(splashing)</i>

206
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,873

Ray here.

209
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,311
Charlie, slow down.

210
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,318
I'm backflushing the system. It's in there.

211
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,738
- What is it?
- I don't know. It just swam right past me.

212
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,698
There it is.

213
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:14,561
<i>Turbellarian flatworms are carnivorous
scavengers, less than 30m in length...</i>

214
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,898
<i>...found in fresh and sea water.
They are hermaphroditic...</i>

215
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:24,404
<i>...with complex reproductive systems,
capable of internal fertilisation.</i>

216
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:28,491
<i>Many species require more than
one host to complete a life cycle.</i>

217
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:33,496
<i>Although the wound on the sanitation
worker suggests scolex attachment...</i>

218
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,668
<i>...the sheer size of the wound precludes
involvement of the common fluke worm.</i>

219
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,578
<i>(phone rings)</i>

220
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,833
- Scully.
- <i>Scully, it's me.</i>

221
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,169
- <i>You know that fluke you caught?</i>
- Yeah.

222
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,421
<i>It must've been the runt of the litter.</i>

223
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,842
I don't see it.

224
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,891
There it is. Tucked away in the
far corner behind the pipes.

225
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:21,187
- Oh, my God.
- I don't know if you can see...

226
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,857
...but it has no sex organs. It's genderless.

227
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,444
Platyhelminthes are often hermaphroditic.

228
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,446
Mulder, this is amazing!

229
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:35,284
Its vestigial features seem parasitic,
but it has primate physiology.

230
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,704
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

231
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:43,543
But I'll have to tell Skinner that his suspect
is a giant bloodsucking worm after all.

232
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:48,464
All we're missing is the identity
of the body in the sewer.

233
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:53,052
He was a Russian.
An engineer on a cargo freighter.

234
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:58,558
He had a tattoo on his forearm. I didn't
make the connection until I detected...

235
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:03,563
...that that was the name Dmitri,
spelled in Cyrillic lettering.

236
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,607
How did you make the connection at all?

237
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:10,778
Somebody shoved <i>this</i> under my door.

238
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,285
I guess you really do
have a friend in the FBI.

239
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,291
And, Mulder...

240
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,253
...when you see Skinner
to hand in your field report...

241
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,757
...I know that it's your decision,
but I hope that you know...

242
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,095
...that I'd consider it more than
a professional loss if you decided to leave.

243
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,216
Everything looks in order.

244
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,721
Is something wrong, Agent Mulder?

245
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:23,559
That's an unexpected response,
considering the bizarre nature of the case.

246
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,394
And of the suspect.

247
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:29,148
The strangeness of the criminal
and the crime are not lost on me.

248
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:35,321
I had my reaction to them in a conversation
about how to process the suspect.

249
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,157
<i>This</i> meeting is to evaluate your work.

250
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,249
There's no way you'll prosecute this.

251
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:51,754
The Justice Department wants the suspect
transferred to a psychiatric institution.

252
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,591
This is not a man, it's a monster!
You can't put it in an institution.

253
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,761
What do you do with it, Agent Mulder?
Put it in a zoo?

254
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,180
It killed two people.

255
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,684
Two?

256
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,770
The sanitation worker who was attacked
was found dead at home

257
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:10,523
as a result of his injuries.

258
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:22,118
You know, you had a pair of agents
that could've handled a case like this.

259
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:26,956
Agent Scully and I might've been able
to save his life, but you shut us down.

260
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,125
I know.

261
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,628
This should have been an X-File.

262
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,886
We all take our orders
from someone, Agent Mulder.

263
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,973
That'll be all.

264
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,588
You're secure!

265
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,954
This is vehicle 49-40 requesting
immediate backup and assistance.

Other than that, bupkis.

272
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,877
We got a police line in a two-mile radius.

273
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,548
Watch any access to the sewer system.
It's gonna try to get back underground.

Yes. Why is it imperative?

Reinstatement of the X-Files

<i>We're at a campsite

- <i>The</i> tanker.

284
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:46,001
- Hold on, Six-Four.
- What if he's on the tanker truck?

285
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:08,816
The company that owns the truck
doesn't keep detailed service records.

286
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:14,113
They had five trucks out this morning.
Three of them have deposited their loads.

287
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:18,075
- So he could have been here and gone.
- If he hasn't, he will be.

288
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,578
- And every tanker dumps its load here?
- It's a state law.

289
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:25,082
- Everything's processed through this plant?
- Yep.

290
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,294
- Then what?
- It empties through an outlet pipe...

291
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,504
...about five miles out to sea.

292
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,799
- Could it have escaped through that pipe?
- Doubtful.

293
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:39,638
The system's full of filters. Nothing bigger
than your little finger's gonna get through.

294
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:43,726
If it's here, it's going to be trapped here.

295
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:46,228

00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,902
The treatment plant. I thought it

- Why <i>not?</i>

301
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:48,332
It hadn't occurred to me, but the fluke in the
corpse might have been an incubating larva.

302
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:53,796
This creature, or whatever it is,
transmits its eggs or larvae through its bite.

303
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:59,051
- You mean it's trying to reproduce?
- It's looking for hosts.

304
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:04,431
It attacks because the victims' bodies
provide generative nourishment.

305
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,850
- Mulder...
- Yeah.

306
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:10,437
- If it finds a new host...
- I know. It could multiply.

Agent Mulder! Linesman spotting
something down in a section of pipe!

308

- Here.
- That's near where we found the first body.

310
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,118
Right. Except this is
an old overflow system...

311
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:27,121
...that dumps into the harbour
during heavy rainfall.

312
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,165
That must be where it got into the system.

313
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,877
It's working its way back out to sea.

314
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:28,682
That's the overflow pipe. It leads
to another vault like this one...

315
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:32,019
...then about three quarters
of a mile to the sea.

316
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,855
Let's see if we can get that gate closed.

317
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,294
It's rusted in position.

318
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,881
Let's see if I can get some leverage here.

00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,349
- Is this seat taken?
- No.

332
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:18,727
But I should warn you,
I may reek a bit of the sewer.

333
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:21,188
I'll take my chances.

334
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:31,698
You talked to Skinner yesterday?

335
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:34,368
Success in our work is imperative, Scully.

336
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:38,372
Reinstatement of the X-Files
must be undeniable.

337
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,833
- That came from Skinner?!
- No.

338
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,045
We have a friend in the FBI.

339
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:52,969
I thought you might be interested in the lab
results on the biology of the fluke larva.

340
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,307
Dissection and analysis indicates...

341
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:00,936
...reproductive and physiological
cross-traiting, ...

342
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:04,272
...resulting in a sort of
quasi-vertebrate human.

343
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,024
Human?

344
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:12,072
Yes, but still capable of spontaneous
regeneration, like any fluke or flatworm.

345
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,825
How does that happen?

346
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,661
Radiation. Abnormal cell fusion.

347
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,872
The suppression of natural
genetic processes.

348
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,544
Mulder, nature didn't make this thing.
We did.

349
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,148
I know these.

350
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,903
These are from Chernobyl.

351
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:55,991
That creature came off of a
decommissioned Russian freighter...

352
00:42:56,074 --> 00:43:00,495
...that was used in the disposal of
salvage material from the meltdown.

353
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,250
It was born in a... in a primordial
soup of radioactive sewage.

354
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:14,593
You know, they say three species
disappear off the planet every day.

355
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,888
You wonder how many new ones
are being created.

356
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,997
<i>(child) I made this!</i>
