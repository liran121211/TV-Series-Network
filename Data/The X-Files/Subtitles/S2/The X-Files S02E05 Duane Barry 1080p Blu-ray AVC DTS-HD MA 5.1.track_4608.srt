Hello, Duane. Nice to see you.

21
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:45,310
Nice to see you too, Doc.

22
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:51,817
- How are you feeling today?
- Pretty good.

23
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,736
Why don't we sit down, Duane?

24
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,407
- I wanna go over a few things with you.
- OK.

25
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,869
Now, uh... it says here...

26
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,915
...that you've been refusing
to take your medicine.

27
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:12,212
- I don't like the way it makes me feel.
- OK. All right.

28
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:17,551
Let's talk about that. Because we give you
that medicine for a reason, Duane.

29
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:22,097
- Because of your behaviour.
- I know. I know.

30
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,725
Because we don't want you
to hurt anybody again.

31
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,771
Are you still hearing voices?

32
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:34,568
I'm not crazy, Doc.
Duane Barry's not like these other guys.

33
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,946
No, everybody here is different.

34
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,534
They're coming again.
They're coming again. I can feel it.

35
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:46,663
They're gonna take Duane Barry to the place.

36
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,207
Nobody's coming, Duane.

37
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,211
Nobody can stop 'em.

38
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,508
I'm gonna give you a shot.

39
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,596
I think you just need some rest.

40

This'll make you sleep.

41
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:12,355
And when you wake up, you'll see
we didn't let anybody hurt you. OK, Duane?

42
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:16,401
Duane?

43
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:24,534
Duane!

00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:26,620
Get away. Get away.

45
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,956
- Put down the gun, Duane.
- Gimme the keys.

46

Either way, Doc, we're getting
outta here together. You got it?

50
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,097
Let's go, now! Go! Go! Go!

51
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:00,487
Agent Mulder.

52
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,907
Krycek. What's up?

53
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:10,539
There's a situation going down.
They want you right away.

54
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,958
What kind of situation?

55
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,169
A hostage negotiation.

56
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,296
- And they want me?
- Yeah.

57
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:21,174
- What for?
- The guy escaped a mental institution.

58
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:27,013
He's got four people at gunpoint in an office.
Claims he's being controlled by aliens.

59
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:43,947
- Krycek, Mulder. Where's the commander?
- Right that way, sir.

60
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,500
- OK, I got it right here.
- Lucy.

61
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:06,177
(man) You can put people
on the third and fourth floor.

62
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:07,637
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,806
Lucy Kazdin, negotiation commander.

64
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,019
- This is Agent Krycek.
- Let me show you what we've got.

65
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:22,235
His name's Duane Barry. He's armed with
a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun...

66
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,070
...one 9-round magazine.

67
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:27,699
We believe that he's prepared
to use the gun and not afraid to die.

68
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:31,411
- What does he want?
- Safe passage for him and his hostage...

69
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:34,497
- ...a shrink named Hakkie.
- Passage to where?

70
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:38,251
He's bent on taking the doctor
to an alien-abduction site.

71
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:42,255
He can't quite remember where the site is,
so he stopped at a travel agency.

72
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,217
- Is he lucid?
- Yes, but off his medication, so he's manic.

73
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:50,722
Ranting about scoop marks, scars on his
body, homing devices and other nonsense.

74
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:51,973
Like what?

75
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:55,268
This alien-abduction business,
which I guess you know about.

76
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:58,563
Yeah, but I've never been
in a hostage negotiation before.

77
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:01,775
We'll take you through it.
Agent Rich is advisory commander.

78
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,403
- He and I will be coaching you.
- What Mr Barry needs is a friend.

79
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:10,825
Someone who appears to understand him
and can appeal to his sense of reason.

80
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:14,746
Do we know anything about
his abduction experiences?

81
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:19,167
You really believe
in this stuff, Agent Mulder?

82
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,378
Is that a problem?

83
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:27,008
We're here to save lives.
You'll begin negotiations immediately.

84
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:30,011
Every three hours
we'll re-evaluate your progress...

85
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:35,100
...and let our tactical commander
advise and update on the use of force.

86
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:47,445
If this man <i>is</i> an abductee,
I need to know more about him.

87
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,990
His personal history.
Each abduction case is different.

88
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,868
That material's not been made available to us.

89
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:56,705
Nobody's thought to call
the hospital for records?

90
00:08:56,788 --> 00:09:02,502
Look, Agent Mulder, the guy's a psycho.
Your object is to keep him on the phone.

91
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:06,131
The longer you do, the more chance
he's not gonna kill anybody.

92
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:11,177
We stop to do a Freudian analysis, next thing
we know we've got four dead hostages.

93
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:16,182
So, whatever crap you gotta make up
about spacemen or UFOs...

94
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,810
...just keep him on the phone.

95
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,152
Are we gonna have to sit
on the floor like this all night?

96
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:32,240
I told you to shut up!

97
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:35,034
We all have families, for God's sake.

98
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,333
Duane, don't hurt anyone.

99
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:46,671
- Please?
- I'm not gonna hurt you, Doc.

100
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:52,510
Because this time
you're going with Duane Barry.

101
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:56,055
So you can see what it's like.

102
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:59,225
That it's real!

103
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,978
<i>(Phone)</i>

104
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:12,238
- Duane?
- Yeah.

105
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,532
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder.

106
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,495
- Look, I wanna try to help you.
- Yeah?

107
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:24,083
Well... we're just sitting here
waiting for, uh... travel plans.

108
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:27,879
I think I know what
you're going through, Duane.

109
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:31,633
I just wanna make sure
you get what you want and that Bob...

110
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:35,094
...Kimberly, Gwen
and Dr Hakkie don't get hurt.

111
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,722
You know what I'm going through?

112
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:43,895
You think you know what Duane Barry's
going through?! You don't knowjack!

113
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:50,276
I know you're scared, Duane. And that
you'd like to see this all come out right.

114
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,737
Yeah, right.

115
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:58,117
So they can put me back in the nuthouse...
where I belong.

116
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:03,748
We're only concerned about your safety,
Duane. You and the others.

117
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,294
Hey, what's your name?

118
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,463
Mul-dore?

119
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,758
I know the routine.

120
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,096
Honesty, containment...

121
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:22,267
<i>...conciliation. Am I missing something?</i>

122
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:25,311
You need someone to trust, Duane.

123
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,731
<i>I know a lot of people
who've been through similar experiences.</i>

124
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:33,945
You wanna do something for me, Agent
Mulder? You keep your dogs on a leash.

125
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,576
You try to gas me out or do
anything stupid, these people die.

126
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:46,541
They're not taking me again. You got it?
They can take somebody else!

127
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,878
- Nobody's gonna try anything, Duane.
- <i>(hangs</i> up)

128
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:54,090
Who is this guy? He's FBI, isn't he?

129
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,343
- Former FBI.
- And you didn't think to mention that?

130
00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:03,433
He's been institutionalised on and off
for over a decade. It's beside the point.

131
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:07,228
The point being that the Bureau
wants to minimise its embarrassment.

132
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:09,522
That we can police our own.

133
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,609
They would like it done
as neatly and cleanly as possible.

134
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:18,031
- Well, you're off to a hell of a start.
- Negotiation is a process, Agent Mulder.

135
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:21,492
If you just wanted somebody
to read the script, you didn't need me.

136
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:25,622
This method has proven successful
in winning the hostage-taker's trust.

137
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:29,334
No. That man is afraid, and the only way
you're gonna win his trust...

138
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,378
...is by trying to understand
what he's afraid of.

139
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,423
Have you ever spoken
to an abductee, Agent Kazdin?

140
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:40,219
Heard them talk about having their brains
sucked out through their nostril?

141
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:43,514
- Wanna know what they do to your ovaries?
- Not particularly.

142
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,519
Well, then, understand that you might
have to alter your approach a little bit here.

143
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:57,487
Is there anything I can do?

144
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,365
- Yeah. What's your name again?
- Krycek.

145
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,910
- Krycek. Have you got your notepad?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:09,040
Grande, two per cent cappuccino
with vanilla. Agent Rich?

147
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:19,384
<i>As you can see, the SWAT team has taken
positions on all the surrounding buildings...</i>

148
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:21,970
<i>- Scully.
- It's me. I'm in Virginia.</i>

149
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:24,889
I know. I've been watching it on TV.
What's going on?

150
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,058
<i>What's the media saying?</i>

151
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:31,062
An escaped mental patient is holding
people hostage in a travel agency.

152
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:35,566
What they're <i>not</i> telling is he's former FBI
who claims to be an alien abductee.

153
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:39,153
- Seriously?
- His name's Duane Barry. I need your help.

154
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:43,199
<i>Find out what happened to him.
Transcripts from therapy sessions...</i>

155
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,786
...hypnotic regressions,
anything about his abduction.

156
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:51,290
<i>- Mulder?
- The lights just went out here.</i>

157
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,421

- We've lost our captured line.
- We have either four or five shots fired.

166
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,378
- What's the number in there?
- 5552804.

167
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:40,965
We have either four or five shots fired.

168
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,469
An electrical substation blew.
We've got no power.

169
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:46,679
- Duane?
- I told you.

170
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,807
<i>- Is everyone all right, Duane?</i>
- You <i>didn't believe me.</i>

171
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,519
No, I believe you.
I just need to know if anybody's been shot.

172
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:59,484
I need towels. Kimberly?

173
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:03,321
Kimberly? He's going to bleed to death.

174
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:06,324
I guess we're gonna need a doctor.

175
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:20,004
You'll have almost full ambient hearing loss
and your sense of balance may be affected...

176
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,675
...particularly if you have to move quickly
or get into a physical situation.

177
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,595
If you get trapped or held in the building...

178
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,765
...we'll be able to warn you
if there's a tactical assault.

179
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,811
And remember, he's either got
four or five rounds left.

180
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:38,022
There's a wireless mike
in the top of this flak jacket.

181
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:42,735
Speaking in a normal voice, we should hear
anything you say up to a hundred yards.

182
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,279
Attempt to keep these devices concealed.

183
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:49,367
If you put a telephone to that ear,
it'll reveal that you're wired.

184
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:51,327
- You really wanna do this?
- Yeah.

185
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,623
Your job will be to deliver medical help
to the hostage. Anything else is a bonus.

186
00:15:55,706 --> 00:16:00,086
Get in and get out. You are not to risk
your own life. And whatever you believe...

187
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:04,090
Don'tjump into his delusion.
I can't negotiate if he thinks I believe him.

188
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:08,344
Right. This is Agent Janus.
He's a trained medic.

189
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,973
He'll work on the hostage.
You're to keep Duane Barry talking.

190
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:17,061
Like I said, if he's talking, he's not gonna
shoot anybody - including you.

191
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:23,526
I've got three snipers out there.
Anything you can do to get him to the door...

192
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:27,280
All we need is one shot
to the medulla oblongata.

193
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:35,538
<i>Tact Command, this is rooftop zero two.
I have them in sight.</i>

194
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:40,585
<i>They're passing the fountain and
approaching the front entrance now.</i>

195
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:51,804
(Duane Barry)
Just unlock the door. Move back.

196
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,732
- Duane?
- Hands in the air.

197
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,153
- Put the kit on the floor slowly.
- We're unarmed.

198
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,325
- We just wanna help the injured.
- (woman) Over here.

199
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,704
Face the door!

200
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,290
That's right.

201
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:28,633
Not armed, huh? You're FBI, aren't you?

202
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,053
- Got a gun in the kit?
- No.

203
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,764
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No.

204
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,350
We're just here to help.

205
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,146
OK.

206
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:47,193
- Nobody's gonna try anything, Duane.
- That's right. You wanna work with him.

207
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,404
We just wanna make sure
no one else gets hurt.

208
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,990
Just do your business and get out.

209
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,670
- How's he doin'?
- He's bad.

210
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:11,884
Hi, my name is Janus. I'm a paramedic.
Hold on. We're gonna take care of you, OK?

211
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,430
They wanna work with you, Duane.
But you gotta work with them.

212
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:19,725
- Why not let the others go?
- Doc's going with me.

213
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,561
Then let the women go.

214
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:30,194
Were they here, Duane?
The light. Was that them?

215
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:35,366
- Don't try and BS Duane Barry.
- We lost time.

216
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:41,038
I checked my watch.
Isn't that what happens? Time stops? Isn't it?

217
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,500
Duane?

218
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:50,756
<i>(screams)</i>

219
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,391
<i>(screaming)</i>

220
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:23,205
- You're making it up.
- Isn't that what they've been saying to <i>you?</i>

221
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:27,418
- That you're making it up?
- They say it's all inside my head.

222
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:31,589
- All they wanna do is give me more drugs.
- I hear you, Duane.

223
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:35,718
- You hear me cos I got a gun.
- No, I believe your story.

224
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:38,512
No, you're feeding into his psychosis.

225
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:42,933
<i>I know you're afraid.
I know the pain and the fear you must feel.</i>

226
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,228
Just listen to me.
Don't try and identify with him.

227
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:51,400
I've talked to people, Duane. People
just like you who nobody wanted to believe.

228
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:58,616
This man's gonna die
unless we get him to a hospital.

229
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:01,243
Why don't you let him go, Duane?

230
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,289
There's no reason this man has to die.

231
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,627
Come on, Duane.
You've got the power. Let him go.

232
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,174
OK.

233
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:21,639
Good. You made the right choice. Now, we're
just gonna move him carefully to the door.

234
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:24,809
No! Baldie can go.

235
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:31,357
But you stay.
I'm trading the bald man for you.

236
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,318
Dammit!

237
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,655
They're coming out. Get him.

238
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,118
You're gonna be all right, sir.

239
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,285
Keep moving.

240
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,419
Now let's see how good a liar you are.

241
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,004
I'm telling the truth, Duane.

242
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:58,676
How could you ever know
what Duane Barry's been through?

243
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,723
How could anyone know?

244
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,810
It happened to my sister.

245
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,861
Don't you think you can lie to save their lives.

246
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,530
I want some honesty!

247
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,158
I want some respect!

248
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:30,666
I'm tired of all the BS!

249
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,627
How does it happen, Duane?

250
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:37,423
Driving in your car? Alone in bed at night?

251
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:42,553
When do they come to you?
You're paralysed, aren't you?

252
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:47,057
Unable to move.
Sometimes you can't even breathe.

253
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:50,227
You feel an electric shock
and then they're there.

254
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,855
He's gonna push him right over the edge.

255
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,566
I need a clear picture
of what's going on in there.

256
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,735
Right away.

257
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,073
You're choosing
a dangerous course, Agent Mulder.

258
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:07,786
There are beings, aren't there, Duane?
Are they tall? Or small?

259
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:09,914
- No!
- Diminutive?

260
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,923
They take you, Duane, against your will.

261
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:22,843
- He's gonna kill us.
- You're powerless.

262
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:27,431
Sometimes you can't even speak.
It's always the same. Nobody can help you.

263
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,769
Where do they take you, Duane?

264
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:35,940
Is there a ship?
Do they take you to a ship, Duane?

265
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:40,778
How do you get there?
Are you conscious of being transported?

266
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,013
<i>(Duane Barry) They're,</i> uh...

267
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:12,017
<i>They're talking to Duane Barry...</i>

268
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,814
<i>...but they don't speak.</i>

269
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:22,319
He can hear what they're saying.

270
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,533
They can... read his mind.

271
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:34,665
That's right. Abductees call it "mindscan".
It's a kind of telepathy.

272
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,878
I'm telling 'em I don't wanna go...

273
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,882
...but they never listen.

274
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,886
They know what I'm sayin'.

275
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,726
But they just...

276
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,896
...go right on about their business.

277
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,200
Tell him what their business is.

278
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,706
Tell him.

279
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:21,045
They take you aboard the ship
to perform the tests.

280
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:32,181
They... drilled my teeth.

281
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:36,018
They drilled holes in my damn teeth!

282
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,228
<i>(Whimpers)</i>

283
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,586
<i>(whirring)</i>

284
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,434
<i>(screaming)</i>

285
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,079
<i>(Phone)</i>

286
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,289
Yeah?

287
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,584
Who here can talk to an Agent Scully?

288
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,631
Agent Scully, it's Alex Krycek.

289
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,344
- Where's Mulder?
- He traded himself for one of the hostages.

290
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,972
- What?
- <i>He's in with Duane Barry.</i>

291
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,517
- Get him out of there.
- They're working <i>on</i> it.

292
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,478
No, get him out of there now
or he's gonna be killed.

293
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:06,775
- How can <i>you be sure?</i>
- Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is.

294
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,120
How old was your sister when they took her?

295
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,540
She was eight.

296
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,335
I've seen kids sometimes. Young girls.

297
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,339
What are they doing to them?

298
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:31,508
Doing tests.

299
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,677
You know...

300
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,513
...testing 'em.

301
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:48,317
They tell 'em not to cry.

302
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,861
Are they hurting them?

303
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,030
Oh, yeah.

304
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,533
Sometimes...

305
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,913
...sometimes it hurts real bad and, uh...

306
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:07,377
...you just wanna die, you know?
You know what's it's like, sir?

307
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:17,054
It's like living with a gun to your head...
and never knowing when it's gonna go off.

308
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,098
You can let the others go, Duane.

309
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:26,271
Let the others go and take me.

310
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:31,109
Oh. They heard you talking like that,
they're gonna have your ass.

311
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,948
I don't care about that, Duane.

312
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,619
No. I wouldn't do that to you.

313
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,458
Besides, Doc and I got an appointment.

314
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,962
Ain't that right, Doc?

315
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,818
We got a picture.
Mulder is here, opposite the doctor.

316
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:17,030
The women are on the north wall. We can't
see the east wall. Barry must be there.

317
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,950
- Hold on a second.
- No. I don't think you understand.

318
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,619
- I just flew down from...
- We've got a situation...

319
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,622
- Let me talk to someone in charge.
- Calm down, Scully.

320
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:30,627
I'm not gonna calm down until I can talk to
someone who will listen to what I'm saying!

321
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,671
What's the problem here?

322
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:37,509
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and I have
information that is vital to your negotiations.

323
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:41,513
- What information?
- I think there has been a misjudgment here.

324
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,933
This man who claims to be
under the control of aliens...

325
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:49,187
...his mental health history
describes a rare state of psychosis.

326
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:54,651
As you see from his medical records, in 1982
Duane Barry was shot in the line of duty...

327
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:58,322
...the bullet piercing his bilateral frontal lobes.

328
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:02,326
The injury left him nearly incapable
of functioning in society.

329
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:06,163
It effectively destroyed
the moral centre of his brain.

330
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,957
Almost a hundred years ago
there was a famous case.

331
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,502
A man named Gage had
a blasting rod pierce the same region.

332
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,796
And what effect did it have?

333
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,051
He became a pathological liar,
suffering from severe delusions.

334
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,763
His behaviour was characterised
as bizarre and violent...

335
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:26,058
...with a tendency to act out his fantasies.

336
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,604
How did you get involved in this case?

337
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,899
Agent Mulder called me.
We used to work together.

338
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,863
Well, if this is true, he's got
your former partner completely fooled.

339
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:42,950
Is there a way I can reach him
with this information?

340
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,666
The government knows about it, you know.

341
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:55,629
They're even in on it sometimes,
right there in the room when they come.

342
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,839
They work together.

343
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:02,386
With a, uh... secret, uh... corporation.

344
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,854
Who in the government?

345
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:16,858
A man. Military. They're all in it together.

346
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,030
<i>The government knows why they're here...</i>

347
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,742
<i>...but they wouldn't dare let the truth out,
so they cooperate.</i>

348
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:33,083
You're gonna have to deal with resolving
this situation, Duane, sooner or later.

349
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,711
I'm tired.

350
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,339
There's no other way out.

351
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:42,467
You've got to tell them what you wanna do.

352
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:47,014
- I just wanna go back to the place.
- What place?

353
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,975
Where it started.
Where they first came and got me.

354
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,144
Where <i>is</i> that?

355
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:58,150
A mountain.

356
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:03,280
<i>We went, uh... up and... up.</i>

357
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,575
Ascending...

358
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,619
...ascending to the stars.

359
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,248
I'm not going again.

360
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:19,296
- No.
- Mulder, it's me.

361
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:24,301
Listen to me. You cannot trust Duane Barry.

362
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:29,473
<i>He is a psychopath who took a bullet
in the head. He is not what you think he is.</i>

363
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,059
What?

364
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,978
How do they find you each time?

365
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,147
Implants.

366
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,317
My gums, sinus cavity...

367
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,822
...here in my bellybutton. Tracking devices.

368
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:51,119
<i>Mulder, he could snap at any time. He has
a history of irrational and violent behaviour.</i>

369
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:54,039
Now you have to work
towards resolving this.

370
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:58,668
Now, you have his trust.
You have to try and negotiate with him.

371
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:06,718
Why not let the women go, Duane?
They'll deal with you if you let the women go.

372
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,971
That's good. That's good, Mulder.
Now, keep him talking.

373
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:14,434
HRT is moving into position and unless
you can get him to free the hostages...

374
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,020
...they are going to execute a tactical plan.

375
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:22,651
The women are of no consequence to you.

376
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,070
Let 'em go.

377
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,739
It's the right thing to do, Duane.

378
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,536
OK, but he stays.

379
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,505
Go on. Get outta here.

380
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,716
Get up. Go on.

381
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,885
Get outta here. Go on.

382
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:59,729
I... I just want to say that I believe you.

383
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,910
OK, go!

384
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:17,414
Are we safe now?

385
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:22,127
- The women are clear.
- I got him. Standing, centre room.

386
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,714
Moving.

387
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:33,138
This is a countdown, Mulder.
They're coming at you.

388
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,313
<i>- Position one, ready.
- Coming at you.</i>

389
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:46,818
- We're gonna need transportation.
- What do you want, Duane? A car?

390
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:51,239
- I don't know.
- Do you know where you wanna go?

391
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,203
They're gonna tell me.

392
00:33:56,286 --> 00:34:00,165
Duane, you can't leave here
if you don't know where you wanna go.

393
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,292
- Duane!
- What?

394
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,129
- Come here.
- Hold your fire. You lost your line.

395
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:14,137
- There's something I wanna ask you.
- What?

396
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:19,142
You didn't believe me.

397
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,937
I had to earn your trust.

398
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,691
Now there's something <i>I</i> gotta know.
Are you making any of this up?

399
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:42,040
You, uh... calling Duane Barry a liar now?

400
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,670
No.

401
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,632
You think I'd make it all up?

402
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:53,176
No, I don't. I'm sorry.

403
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:58,682
- You're sorry?!
- Duane, will you listen to me for a second?

404
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,726
You're like all the others.
You say you believe me.

405
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:05,021
- I do believe you.
- You're lying just like everybody else!

406
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,190
I believe you, Duane!

407
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:15,824
- I trusted you! I trusted you! I was a fool!
- Can I... Can I say something?

408
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:18,034
Duane, can I say something?

409
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,706
I know you're tired, but there's
something you've forgotten to do.

410
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:27,377
When you let the women leave,
you left the door unlocked.

411
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:32,173
Go and lock the door, Duane.
Go lock the door.

412
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:35,593
Go lock the door, Duane. Go lock it.

413
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:41,266
They can get in here. Go lock the door.

414
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,378
(man) He's down! He's down!

415
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,719
<i>(distorted sounds and voices)</i>

416
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,609
<i>Code three. Repeat. Rolling code three.</i>

417
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:37,113
<i>Medical unit two zero. We're rolling.</i>

418
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,833
You OK, Mulder?

419
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,795
Yeah.

420
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:57,467
Whatever you're feeling,
you did the right thing.

421
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:03,598
I know. lt'sjust that, uh... I believe in him.

422
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:12,649
Sometimes when you wanna believe
so badly, you end up... looking too hard.

423
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:29,833
- Agent Mulder. Thanks for coming.
- No, I was surprised to get your call.

424
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:35,046
Yeah, well, as it turned out, whatever
your impression of the way it was handled...

425
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:40,260
...I didn't get to thank you for going
out there and putting it on the line.

426
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:41,594
What?

427
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:46,558
I don't know. I guess I thought maybe
you'd called me down here to chew me out.

428
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:48,852
- How's he doing?
- Duane?

429
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:54,566
They almost lost him, but he's stabilised.
They've got him listed on critical still.

430
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,664
I checked on his record with the Bureau.
It was exemplary.

431
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:12,500
His accident was something of a mystery.

432
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:16,713
Shot by his own weapon in a drug stakeout,
left for dead in the woods.

433
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,550
He was never the same.
Lost everything - wife, kids, house.

434
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:24,053
The fine thread of sanity.

435
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:31,436
I actually called you down here
for another reason, Agent Mulder.

436
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,439
Uh...

437
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:41,362
In the X-rays, the surgeon
found several pieces of metal.

438
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:46,409
In his gums, in his sinus cavity
and one in the abdomen.

439
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:51,206
I had them checked. I felt you'd wanna know.

440
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:56,794
And there were tiny drill holes
in his left and right rear molars.

441
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:03,051
A dentist said they could not have been done
with any of the current equipment in use.

442
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:09,057
Not without chipping or damaging the tooth.
Anyway, I thought you oughta know.

443
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:33,081
This could just be a piece of shrapnel.
Duane Barry did a tour of duty in Vietnam.

444
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:39,087
It was right where he said it would be. Along
with the ones in his gums and his sinus.

445
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,464
And you think this was implanted?

446
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:46,553
Well, if it was, that would mean
Duane Barry is telling the truth.

447
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:49,138
Or some version of the truth.

448
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,942
Look, I'll take this down to ballistics.
We can have this cleared up in a second.

449
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,835
Let me just make a slight adjustment.

450
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:26,426
What do you think?

451
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:30,346
Could be a shell casing
or a small artillery refragment.

452
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:33,516
The edges are dull,
but it could've been white-hot.

453
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,893
That would make sense.

454
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,271
But look at this.

455
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:41,899
- What?
- These small markings. See them here?

456
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:45,820
Mm. Looks like some kind of a stamp.

457
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:49,907
Like it's been tooled or etched.
Pretty fine work too.

458
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:55,538
This square we're looking at
is only ten microns across. Strange.

459
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,437
Eleven fourteen.

460
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,283
Thank you.

461

- I'll be right with you.

Mulder, it's me. I just had something
incredibly strange happen.

470
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:51,380
This piece of metal they took out of
Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it.

471
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:55,384
I ran it through a scanner
and some kind of a serial number came up.

472
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,347
What the hell is this thing, Mulder?
It's almost as if...
