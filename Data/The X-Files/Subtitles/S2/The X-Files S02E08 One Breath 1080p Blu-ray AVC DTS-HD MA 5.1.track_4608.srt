00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:09,970
<i>(woman) Once, when she was a girl,
a very little girl...</i>

2
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:13,348
<i>...Dana was in the woods.</i>

3
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:19,980
<i>It was autumn. She had always been
a tomboy, unlike her sister Melissa.</i>

4
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:28,822
<i>For her birthday, Dana's brothers gave her
a BB gun and were showing her how to use it.</i>

5
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:35,537
<i>Their father had told them
only to shoot at cans.</i>

6
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:42,002
<i>But in a patch of grass
Bill Junior found a garter snake.</i>

7
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,924
<i>And the boys began shooting.</i>

8
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:52,721
<i>Wanting to fit in with her brothers,
Dana also shot at the snake.</i>

9
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:56,850
<i>It squirmed wildly, fighting for life...</i>

10
00:00:56,934 --> 00:01:02,272
<i>...but as the boys continued to shoot,
the snake began to bleed.</i>

11
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:07,027
<i>When she realised what she had done...</i>

12
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,324
<i>...Dana began to cry with irrevocable guilt.</i>

13
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:19,414
<i>Through her tears, she was saying that
something was missing from the snake.</i>

14
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,753
<i>She had taken something
that was not hers to take.</i>

15
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:28,715
<i>Although afraid of snakes,
Dana held the animal...</i>

16
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,552
<i>...as if sheer human will could keep it alive.</i>

17
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,519
<i>The snake, its blood on her hands, died.
Nothing she could do would bring it back.</i>

18
00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:46,066
(Mulder) It's too soon, Mrs Scully.

19
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:49,236
We can't give up.

20
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:57,035
That day in the woods, I felt for my daughter.

21
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:02,040
But at this moment...

22
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,460
...I know how my daughter felt.

23
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,672

<i>(phone rings)</i>

29
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:04,246
Sir... Sir, you can't go in there!

30
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:27,519
Who brought her here?
How did she get here?

31
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,688
- Would you...
- How did she get here!

32
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,691
Ms Scully was in this condition
when I arrived.

33
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:36,486
- If you step outside, Dr Daly...
- Is that Daly? Are you Dr Daly?

34
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,822
- What the hell is going on?
- Settle down...

35
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:43,201
Was it paramedics, FBI, military?
Answer me right now!

36
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,038
You saying she just appeared?!
Who did this to her?!

37
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:49,624
- Sir...
- I wanna see her admission forms!

38
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,751
I wanna see what tests were done!

39
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:56,339
If you're with them, if you're hiding anything,
I swear I will do anything!

40
00:04:56,423 --> 00:05:00,177
Whatever it takes,
I'll find out what they did to her!

41
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,769
Dana is listed in critical condition. Comatose.

42
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:13,231
There is unawareness
of self or environment.

43
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:18,153
No evidence of language comprehension
or voluntary responses to external stimuli.

44
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:25,160
My apologies, but no one here can determine
how Dana arrived at the hospital...

45
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,371
...or how she was attended to
in such a critical condition.

46
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:31,124
Um...

47
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:36,671
Because of the absence of Dana's recent
medical history, I'm at a loss for a prognosis.

48
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:40,842
I can't determine with certainty
how long she's been in this state.

49
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:43,053
You haven't said why she's like this.

50
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:49,726
We just don't know, Mrs Scully. There are no
signs of injuries, traumatic or non-traumatic.

51
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:53,563
I can't find signs of
degenerative or metabolic disorders.

52
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:58,318
- We have conducted every test possible.
- I'd like her examined for trace evidence.

53
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:02,489
She's been bathed and cleaned
since her admittance.

54
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:06,493
Also there is a situation
which I don't know if you're aware of.

55
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:11,206
The FBI has notified us of
the terms of Dana's living will.

56
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:16,545
- What is it? What did she say?
- Well, Dana is a doctor.

57
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:20,549
Her criteria for terminating
life support is quite specific.

58
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:25,053
She states that if her
Glasgow Outcome Scale lists her...

59
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,847
She doesn't wanna live in this condition.

60
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:33,103
You signed the will as her witness.

61
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:53,999
I've been told not to call you Fox.

62
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,793
BY Who?

63
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,504
Dana. Just now.

64
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:06,052
Dana talked to you just now?
If she'd talked, the EEG would've moved.

65
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,349
Her soul is here.

66
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,396
Hi, Mom.

67
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:20,066
I'm glad you could come, Melissa.

68
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,694
You're Scully's sister?

69
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:30,910
Dana's choosing whether...

70
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,830
...whether to remain or move on.

71
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,091
You can feel her.

72
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:48,511
Here.

73
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:22,003
<i>(Mulder) She's not here.</i>

74
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:27,759
<i>(Melissa)</i> Your anger... your fear is blocking
any positive emotions she needs to feel.

75
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:37,894
I need to do more than
just wave my hands in the air.

76
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:47,213
(woman) May I help you?

77
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,177
Dana Scully, please.

78
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,804
Frohike?

79
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:17,243
Hey, Mulder! This is weird.

80
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:23,583
- Good work sneaking out these charts.
- Tucked 'em in my pants.

81
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,794
There's plenty of room down there.

82
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:29,798
You look down, Mulder.
You're welcome to come over on Saturday.

83
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:33,718
We're hoppin' on the Internet
to nit-pick inaccuracies of Earth 2.

84
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:37,806
- I'm doing my laundry.
- The chart shows abnormal protein chains.

85
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:41,059
The amino acid sequence
is in a combination I've never seen.

86
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,437
I downloaded Scully's data
to the newest Lone Gunman.

87
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:49,108
- He goes by the name "The Thinker".
- <i>(Byers)</i> This guy's a hacking genius.

88
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,533
What?

89
00:10:56,616 --> 00:11:00,829
He reports the protein chains
are the by-products of branched DNA.

90
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:04,165
- Branched DNA?
- The cutting edge of genetic engineering.

91
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:07,252
Biological equivalent of a silicon microchip.

92
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:11,714
Way beyond cutting edge.
This is technology 50 years down the line.

93
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,801
- What's it used for?
- Could be a tracking system.

94
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:19,264
- Developmental stages of a marker.
- You mean a hi-tech identity card?

95
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:23,977
Or something as insidious as grafting
a human to something... inhuman.

96
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:27,313
Good theories, but all for naught.

97
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:30,441
This branched DNA is inactive.
It's waste product.

98
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:35,947
Whoever experimented on Scully is finished.
Now it's just a biological poison.

99
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:39,367
Will she live?

100
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:44,789
Um...

101
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:48,126
Her immune system has been decimated.

102
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:54,841
And, uh... I doubt even a healthy
human body has the ability to fight this.

103
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,594
Mulder, there's nothing you can do.

104
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,687
<i>Dana?</i>

105
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,524
<i>Dana, honey? I know you can hear me.
This is Nurse Owens.</i>

106
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,861
<i>I'm here to take care of you, sweetheart.</i>

107
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:19,073
<i>Watch over you. Help you find the way home.</i>

108
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:23,411
I know you're far away from home tonight...

109
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:25,997
...and that where you are is peaceful.

110
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,166
It would be nice to stay.

111
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:34,088
But, Dana, you must leave here
only when it's time.

112
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,178
I'll be here when you need me, dear.

113
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:53,483
Excuse me, sir. I have to take some blood.

114
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,045
<i>(continuous beep)</i>

115
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:17,256

00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,425
Let's go)!

117
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:23,096
- Let's get an airway in.
- She's asystolic.

118

- BP 80 over 60, dropping.
- Let's shock her. Paddles. 200 joules.

119
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,979
- Clear!
- Clear.

120
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:34,732
- What have we got?
- Got a catheter in. Dropping...

121
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,527
- Let's go again. Clear!
- Clear.

122
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,498
Hey!

123
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,797
- I didn't expect you here.
- A man took Scully's blood.

124
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,966
- Forget him!
- Get that gun away!

125
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,470
This compact SigSauer
is pointed at your head...

126
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:49,849
...to stress my insistence that your search
for who hurt your partner desist now!

127
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,186
You ignore my call, then expect me
to do what you say? Go to hell!

128
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,897
You got him killed! You got her killed.

129
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,274
That's not going to happen to me.

130
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:02,403
You're my tool, understand?
I come to you when I need you.

131
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:05,656
You're heading in a direction
that can lead them here.

132
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,911
- What are you talking about?
- You can't know. That's the point.

133
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:13,247
I owe her more than just
sitting around doing nothing.

134
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:17,251
She was a good soldier, but there is
nothing you can do to bring her back!

135
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,420
She's not dead.

136
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,380
Listen to you.

137
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:27,011
Listen. You're a damn schoolboy, Mulder.
You have no idea. No idea.

138
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,597
OK, then tell me. Tell me!

139
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,271
I used to be you.

140
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:39,774
I was where you are now.

141
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,943
But you're not me, Mulder.

142
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,988
I don't think you have the heart.

143
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:50,243
Walk away, grieve for Scully
and then never look back.

144
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:54,747
You will be able to live
with yourself, Mulder...

145
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:56,791
...on the day you die.

146

<i>(footsteps)</i>

00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,973

Federal agent. You know I'm armed.
Don't turn around.

151
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,609
Put your gun very slowly on the ground.

152
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:12,033
Put your hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers.

153
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,494
Turn right towards the machine
and put your head on it.

154
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,176
Face me.

155
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,471
Who wants this?

156
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:36,849
Who wants it?!

157
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:40,478
All right, let's go. This way.

158
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,161
<i>(screams)</i>

159
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,923
Stay there.

160
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,508
Wait!

161
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,848
You wanna see what it takes
to find the truth, Agent Mulder?

162
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,643
You wanna know the things I know?

163
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,778
I'll attend to this.

164
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:44,250
(Dr <i>Daly)</i> Discontinuing the respirator
does not necessarily mean ending her life.

165
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:49,422
Karen Ann Quinlan lived for nine years
after cessation of mechanical ventilation.

166
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:54,302
I do believe, however, this is not the case
with your daughter, Mrs Scully.

167
00:18:54,635 --> 00:19:00,391
My guess is that she's been like this since
her disappearance, and she will not improve.

168
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,644
Is she below the criteria
established in her will?

169
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:09,317
It's possible branched DNA
can be treated with designer antibiotics.

170
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,447
I don't know where you got this diagnosis,
but you are in no position to continue...

171
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,826
You've never provided an answer as to
why she's here or what's wrong with her.

172
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,871
- We must study her.
- She's not a piece of evidence.

173
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,832
She's here because of
unnatural circumstances.

174
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,126
She's dying.

175
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,712
That's perfectly natural.

176
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,965
We hide people
because we don't wanna look at death.

177
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:37,845
We have machines prolong a life
that should... that should end.

178
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:42,350
That's a much more unnatural circumstance
than any cause of her death.

179
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,935
That's very politically correct.

180
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,189
That's very human.

181
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,693
I love her.

182
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,072
And this is right.

183
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,455
Dana... has made our decision.

184
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:08,292
Fox.

185
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,589
You and Dana had a friendship
built on respect.

186
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:22,306
Now, in the last year,
I have lost my husband...

187
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:27,144
...and God knows
I don't wanna lose my baby girl.

188
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:31,023
But, like you, I have always respected her.

189
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:40,449
Fox, this is a moment for the family.

190
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:44,537
But you can join us if you want.

191
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,890
Read it. It's all there.

192
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:51,353
If you're having trouble sitting on Mulder,
Assistant Director Skinner...

193
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:53,814
...I'm sure you know we'd have no trouble.

194
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:55,608
Uh-uh.

195
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,178
<i>(knocking)</i>

196
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,347
Yeah, come in.

197
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:33,020
Sit down.

198
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:38,734
I called you because of rumours
about an incident at the hospital.

199
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:42,321
Is this about the tooth
found in the cafeteria Jell-O?

200
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:46,200
The rumour has it
you were involved in the laundry room?

201
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,827
- No, sir.
- A man was executed.

202
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,039
- I was with Scully.
- Traces of her blood were found.

203
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:58,170
- May I see the police report?
- There is no report or body. You know that!

204
00:22:58,254 --> 00:23:01,632
Since I am unfamiliar with the incident,
how would I know?

205
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,093
- Knock it off!
- How does it feel?

206
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:08,764
Constant denial of everything,
questions answered with a question.

207
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:13,519
- I wanna know what happened, dammit!
- Him! That's what happened.

208
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:16,689
Cancer Man is responsible
for what happened to Scully.

209
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:19,358
- How do you know that?
- It's a rumour.

210
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,986
- Who is he?
- It's not your...

211
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,281
You can have my badge, the X-Files.
Just tell me where he is.

212
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,993
And then what? He sleeps with the fishes?

213
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,706
We're not the Mafia, Mulder.
We work for the Department of Justice.

214
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,000
<i>That's</i> what I want.

215
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,128
Agent Scully was a fine officer.

216
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,048
More than that, I liked her. I respected her.

217
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:47,094
We all know the field we play in
and what can happen in a game.

218
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:52,349
If you were unprepared for all the potentials,
then you shouldn't step on the field.

219
00:23:57,438 --> 00:24:00,941
What if I...
I knew the potential consequences...

220
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,110
...but I... I never told her?

221
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:11,118
Then you're as much to blame
for her condition as... the Cancer Man.

222
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,455
Hello, Starbuck.

223
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,291
It's Ahab.

224
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,880
People would say to me...

225
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:08,425
..."Life is short."

226
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,680
"Kids, they grow up fast.
Before you know it, it's over."

227
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,225
I never listened.

228
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:21,397
To me, life went at a proper pace.

229
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,692
There were many rewards.

230
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:30,864
Until the moment that... I knew...

231
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,158
...I understood that...

232
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,037
...I would never see you again.

233
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:41,375
My little girl.

234
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,173
Then my life felt as if it had been
the length of one breath.

235
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,677
One heartbeat.

236
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:59,810
I never knew how much I loved
my daughter until I could never tell her.

237
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:07,317
At that moment, I'd have traded every medal,
every commendation, every promotion...

238
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,529
...forjust one more second with you.

239
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,996
We'll be together again, Starbuck.

240
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,541
But not now.

241
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,293
Soon.

242
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,146
Dana?

243
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,357
I know death is at arm's reach tonight.

244
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:51,236
But, Dana, your time is not over.

245
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:00,704
You know, Fox... Sorry, Mulder.

246
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,170
You could spend your life finding everyone
responsible and it still won't bring her back.

247
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,801
Whoever did this to her
has an equal horror coming to them.

248
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,888
Including myself?

249
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,934
Pardon me. Sir, do you have
change for the cigarette machine?

250
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,937
No. Sorry, I don't.

251
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,273
What do you mean, yourself?

252
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,944
There's a pack already here. Morleys.

253
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,696
Not my brand.

254
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,594
<i>(shouting on TV)</i>

255
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,898
<i>(man on TV)
Cigarette, Frank? How about a smoke?</i>

256
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,446
<i>(creaking)</i>

257
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,491
Sit down!

258
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,286
- How'd you find me?
- Shut up!

259
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:26,164
Tonight I ask questions and you answer,
you son of a bitch!

260
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:30,752
Don't try and threaten me, Mulder.
I've watched presidents die.

261
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,884
Why her?

262
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,929
Why her and not me?

263
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,684
Answer me!

264
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,853
I like you.

265
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,481
I like her, too.
That's why she was returned to you.

266
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,321
You should be the one to die.

267
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,114
Why?

268
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:02,993
Look at me. No wife, no family.

269
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,079
Some power.

270
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,833
I'm in the game because
I believe what I'm doing is right.

271
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,003
Right?

272
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,172
Who are you to decide what's right?

273
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,258
<i>Who are you?</i>

274
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:27,059
If people were to know of the things
that I know, it would all fall apart.

275
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:33,815
I told Skinner you shot the man
in the hospital, but I didn't believe it.

276
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,777
And here you are with a gun to my head.

277
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:41,573
I have more respect for you, Mulder.
You're becoming a player.

278
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:49,748
You can kill me now,
but you'll never know the truth.

279
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:00,926
And that's why I'll Win.

280
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:05,847
Don't worry. This'll be our secret.

281
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:10,560
We wouldn't want others to... start rumours.

282
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,955
<i>(machine whirring)</i>

283
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:18,587
When I started out,
this room was where they kept the copier.

284
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,715
At least back then
it wasn't just wasted space.

285
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,677
<i>(ripping)</i>

286
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:32,142
It's unacceptable.

287
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:39,775
I know you feel responsible for Agent Scully,
but I won't accept defeat as self-punishment.

288
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:44,946
All the forensics, the field investigations,
the eyewitness accounts...

289
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,115
...to still know nothing.

290
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,910
To lose myself...

291
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,079
...and Scully.

292
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,040
I hate what I've become.

293
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:10,555
When I was 18, I... uh... lwent to Vietnam.

294
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:17,521
Iwasn't drafted, Mulder. I... I enlisted in
the Marine Corps the day of my 18th birthday.

295
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,524
I did it On a blind faith.

296
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:26,655
I did it because I believed it was
the right thing to do. Maybe I still do.

297
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,201
Three months into my tour...

298
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:36,081
...a ten-year-old North Vietnamese boy
walked into camp, covered with grenades.

299
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,708
And I, uh...

300
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:43,672
I blew his head off
from a distance of ten yards.

301
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:51,263
I lost my faith. Not in my country
or in myself, but in everything.

302
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,517
There was just no point
to anything any more.

303
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,899
One night, on patrol, we were, uh... caught.

304
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:07,404
And everyone... everyone fell.

305
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,740
I mean everyone.

306
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,665
I looked down at my body...

307
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,419
...from outside of it.

308
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:28,550
I didn't recognise it at first. I watched the VC
strip my uniform, take my weapon.

309
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:34,055
And I remained in this thickjungle.

310
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,809
Peaceful...

311
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,978
...unafraid...

312
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,191
...watching my... my dead friends...

313
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,278
...watching myself.

314
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:55,118
In the morning the corpsmen put me in
a body bag until... I guess they found a pulse.

315
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,121
I awoke in a Saigon hospital two weeks later.

316
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:07,631
I'm afraid to look any further
beyond that experience.

317
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,383
<i>You'?</i>

318
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,303
You are not.

319
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,473
Your resignation is unacceptable.

320
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,691
You...

321
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:31,029
You gave me Cancer Man's location.

322
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:36,243
You put your life in danger.

323
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:41,665
Agent Mulder,
every life, every day, is in danger.

324
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,585
That's just life.

325
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,646
Your plane ticket.

326
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:09,901
- But we barely know each other.
- I can't tell you why she was taken.

327
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,405
It's too close to me.
I'm giving you the men who took her.

328
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,992
- How?
- They believe you'll be out of town.

329
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:21,955
They believe you have information
about Scully in your desk in your apartment.

330
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:26,001
At 8.17 tonight they'll search your apartment.

331
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:29,045
They will be armed. You will be waiting.

332
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:33,550
- Waiting?
- To defend yourself with terminal intensity.

333
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,973
It's the only way, Mulder.
The law will not punish these people.

334
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,356
After tonight, we cannot
make contact for several weeks.

335
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:11,338
<i>(knocking)</i>

336
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,471
Mulder.

337
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,187
Sorry.

338
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,899
I came by. You weren't answering,
your machine wasn't on.

339
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,818
Can I come in?

340
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,656
For a second?

341
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,920
- Why is it so dark?
- Because the lights aren't on.

342
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,881
OK.

343
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,718
I just came from the hospital.

344
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:02,680
Dr Daly says... she's weakening.

345
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:07,310
It could be any time, so I figured
you'd wanna come down and see her.

346
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,687
Well, I can't.

347
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:14,859
- Well, I'd think that you would.
- Yeah, well, I would. I can't. Not right now.

348
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,948
Listen.

349
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:25,120
I don't have to be psychic
to see that you're in a very dark place.

350
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:27,747
Much darker than where my sister is.

351
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:33,169
Willingly walking deeper into darkness
cannot help her at all. Only the light will...

352
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:38,091
Enough with the harmonic convergence crap!
You're not saying anything to me.

353
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:42,929
Why don't you just drop
your cynicism, paranoia and defeat?

354
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:47,142
Just because it's positive and good
doesn't make it silly or trite.

355
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:52,313
Why is it easier for you to try to get even,
than just expressing to her how you feel?

356
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:55,733
I expect more from you. Dana expects more.

357
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,781
Even if it doesn't bring her back,
at least she'll know.

358
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,367
And so will you.

359
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:51,247
I feel, Scully, that...

360
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:58,379
...you believe you're not ready to go.

361
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,134
And you've always had
the strength of your beliefs.

362
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,512
I don't know if my being here...

363
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,726
...will help bring you back.

364
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,776
But I'm here.

365
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,941
<i>(weeps)</i>

366
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:00,126
(nurse) I'm afraid in this case...

367
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,463
Let me check the chart.

368
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:09,844
No, there doesn't seem to be any
significant changes since you were last here.

369
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,353
Call Dr Daly. Now!

370
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,566
This is ICU. Find Dr Daly, stat.

371
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:36,371
<i>(phone rings)</i>

372
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:45,588
<i>Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message...</i>

373
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,757
I'm here.

374
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,560
Hello, Fox.

375
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:02,438
Not Fox. Mulder.

376
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,653
How are you feeling?

377
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,781
Mulder, I don't remember anything.

378
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:15,076
After Duane Barry...

379
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,245
It doesn't... it doesn't matter.

380
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:21,582
I... brought you a present.

381
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,961
<i>Superstars of the Super Bowls.</i>

382
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:28,047
I knew there was a reason to live.

383
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:32,802
Now you wanna get some rest. I...

384
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:37,890
...just came by to see
how you're doing. Say hi.

385
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,563
Mulder?

386
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:47,817
I had the strength of your beliefs.

387
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,415
I was holding this for you.

388
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,336
<i>(door opens)</i>

389
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:54,842
Can I see Nurse Owens?
I've got something I'd like her to have.

390
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:57,386
Nurse who?

391
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:02,016
Owens.

392
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,644
Short, with straight, light-brown hair.

393
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:09,190
She watched over me in Intensive Care
and I'd like to thank her.

394
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:14,487
Dana, I've worked here for ten years
and there's no Nurse Owens at this hospital.
