<i>(Scully) Mulder, it's me. I just had something
incredibly strange happen.</i>

3
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:29,031
<i>This piece of metal that they took out of
Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it.</i>

4
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:32,826
<i>I ran it through a scanner
and some kind of a serial number came up.</i>

5
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,163
<i>What the hell is this thing, Mulder?
It's almost as if...</i>

6
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:39,791
<i>It's almost as if somebody
was using it to catalogue him.</i>

<i>- (man) Come on!
- (Scully) Mulder! I need your help! Mulder!</i>

00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:47,359
(man) They're taking that
down to the lab now.

10
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,588
- Mulder!
- Lady...

11
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:11,800
I need your help! Mulder!

12
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,769
Mulder!

13
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:27,274
- (man) You can't disturb the crime scene.
- It's my daughter's apartment.

14
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:31,069
Just let me go. I have to get through.
I have to get in!

15
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:33,447
Mrs Scully?

16
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:38,827
She's not in there.

17
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:42,122
Where is she?

18
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:45,792

19

<i>(police radios)</i>

20
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:47,437
<i>Holly Reardon reporting live. Police have

00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,731
<i>We have received unconfirmed...</i>

22
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:53,193
<i>(Mrs</i> Scully) I knew it would happen this way.

23
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:56,571
I had this dream
about Dana being taken away.

24
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,492
It's so strange.

25
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,792
I, uh... I was gonna call her...

26
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,421
...but I was afraid I was gonna scare her.

27
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,596
She would've laughed at me, anyway.

28
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:27,769
She doesn't believe in
that kind of thing, you know.

29
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:39,698
According to the reports, Agent Scully states
that Duane Barry's propensity for violence...

30
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:43,493
...is due to brain damage
from a bullet wound in the head.

31
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:46,288
Is this the operational opinion?

32
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,999
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,834
Is there another?

34
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:54,880
He's convinced he's going to be
abducted by aliens.

35
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:59,885
That by taking someone to the abduction site,
he won't be abducted himself.

36
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:06,224
That he's following orders
from alien voices in his head?

37
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,101
<i>(Kryfiek) Yes.</i>

38
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:12,063
Well, that's an interesting spin
on the Nuremberg defence.

39
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:16,693
Which explanation do you
subscribe to, Agent Mulder?

40
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,571
There's a question of
how he could've gotten to her.

41
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:22,199
And you think these alien voices told him?

42
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:26,703
Scully was carrying a piece of metal that
was removed from Duane Barry's abdomen.

43
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,080
He described it as a tracking device.

44
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:34,085
Agent Scully... thought that
you had made a miscalculation...

45
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,630
...in Duane Barry's psychosis. Is that true?

46
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:41,134
Yes. But that still doesn't explain
how he could have found her.

47
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:44,679
- Where would he be taking her?
- (Mulder) I don't know.

48
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:48,391
He talked about a mountain.
He wasn't specific about the location.

49
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:52,687
Well, however he got to her,
he took Agent Scully's car and her weapon.

50
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:57,484
We all understand the seriousness of this
matter and should proceed ahead quickly.

51
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,862
- Turn over your files to HRT.
- I'd like to brief them myself.

52
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:04,741
- Go home. You've been up all night.
- Sir, I know Duane Barry.

53
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:09,454
- I've been in his head. I know how he thinks.
- You're too close to this case!

54
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:12,290
If we can use you, we will.

55
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,918
- Sir...
- That's an order, Agent Mulder.

56
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,380
Make sure he gets home safely.

OK. But could you just give me the ticket

- Where was that patrolman killed again?
- Rixeyville, Virginia. Route 229.

- Doesn't it lead to the Blue Ridge Parkway?
- I don't know.

What?

"Ascend to the Stars. Skyland Mountain."

00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,403

- Get your car. Meet me downstairs.

- Get your car.

- I'll deal with Skinner.

00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:31,836
He thinks Scully's been taken to Skyland
Mountain. I'll hold him off till they locate her.

Wait, here he comes. I'll be in touch.

120

- I'm fine.

124
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:38,361
- Well, you haven't slept yet. I have.
- I said I'm fine.

125
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:50,707
You know, Chernobyl, Exxon Valdez,
Three Mile island...

126
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,043
...they were all linked to sleep deprivation.

127
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:59,632
The department of transportation estimates
that over 190,000 fatal car crashes...

128
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:02,552
...every year are caused by sleepiness.

129
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:07,598
Did they estimate how many people are
put to sleep listening to their statistics?

130
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:10,184
I'm just trying to keep you awake.

131
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:21,779
Look, if Skinner sends in the whole cavalry,
Duane Barry might go over the edge.

132
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,114
You're right.

133
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:26,617
If we find him first,
we'll notify the Bureau. All right?

134
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:31,205
Yeah. You really think
he tracked her down with that implant?

135
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, that's the easiest explanation.

136
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,047
- It's also the most implausible.
- Is there another possibility?

137
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,468
Somebody could've given him her address.
I don't know who.

138
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,141
There's our turn-off.

139
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,855
- Have you seen this guy?
- Yeah, he was here.

140
00:14:55,938 --> 00:15:00,151
He's wanted for kidnapping a federal agent.
Did you let him go up on the tram?

141
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,446
It's shut down in the summer.
I told him to take the back road.

142
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,364
- How long ago?
- 45 minutes.

143
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:07,492
- Did he have a woman with him?
- No.

144
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,286
- How long does it take to drive?
- Over an hour.

145
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,872
- You gotta get me up there.
- No. No way.

146
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:17,502
We just got done refitting the cable.
It hasn't been tested with passengers yet.

147
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,545
- You have to drive.
- I don't have time.

148
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,049
- You don't have a choice.
- No. You don't have a choice.

149
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:33,726
I can't stop you from going up there.

150
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,355
But if there's a problem with the cable,
I'm shutting this thing down.

151
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:40,691
I'm not gonna be responsible for your death.

152
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,408
What are you doing?

153
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:52,870
Stay here. And whatever happens,
don't let him stop the tram.

154
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:55,748
You hit your "run" and "up" button
on the panel.

155
00:15:55,832 --> 00:16:00,461
"Speed indicator" controls your ascent.
Now, when you wanna slow down...

156
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:03,047
Don't crank it faster than 15!

157
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:43,087
What the hell's he doing? I told him not
to go that fast. Base to car one. Pick up.

- <i>D'you</i> hear <i>that sound?</i>

159

<i>This is base. Please pick up the handset.</i>

161
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:16,871
<i>Can you hear me?
Slow it to 15 or I'll shut this thing down.</i>

162
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,665
Base to car one. Pick up.

163
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,670
- <i>Base to...</i>
- Go ahead.

164
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:27,632
- Slow it down.
- You're breaking up.

165
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:30,968
Slow it down or the cable will jump the tower.

166
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:54,659
<i>Second tower's coming up.</i>

167
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:00,331
Slow it through the next tower.

168
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:16,013
- How close is he?
- He should be up top in a minute.

169
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:21,143
There he is.

170
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:53,426
What are you doing? Turn us back on.

171
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,388
Krycek, what's happening down there?
Krycek, do you read me?

172
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:02,184
<i>Tell the operator to restart the tram.
Hello?</i>

173
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:06,647
I've got him stalled up there.
I'll hold until you advise.

174
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:35,509
Is there an emergency system on board?
Can you read me down there?

175
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:37,887
Can anyone read me?

176
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:17,945
<i>(car radio) ..with scattered rain
and intermittent thunder showers.</i>

177
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:23,492
<i>Look for highs tomorrow around 65 degrees,
with tonight's low dipping to 48 degrees.</i>

178
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:29,707
<i>That high-pressure ridge has moved
east now. There will be unstable activity.</i>

179
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,918
<i>Joining me now for
the business report is Susan Roberts.</i>

180
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:38,090
<i>The dollar turned on the foreign exchange
markets, while closing stronger here.</i>

181
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:43,596
<i>Gold dropped almost two dollars, in spite of
the speculation about inflationary trends.</i>

182
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,806
<i>Silver was down 80 cents.</i>

183
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,975

184
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,765
<i>(man laughing)</i>

185
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,144
Yes!

186
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,901
- Federal agent!
- Yes!

187
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:41,570
Yes! Yes! Yes!

188
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:42,988
- Freeze!
- Yes!

189
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:45,658
I said freeze! Where is she?

190
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,744
I'm free, you son of a bitches!

191
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,914
You can't touch Duane Barry any more!

192
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,792
Don't move! Don't move!

193
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,629
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Where is she? Where'd you leave her?

194
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,422
- They took her.
- Who?

195
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:05,177
Them! I told you they were gonna
take somebody else.

196
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,846
They did!

197
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,518
No!No!No!

198
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,104
No! No!

199
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,606
No! No!

200
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:21,026
No! No!

201
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,822
No! No!

202
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,033
No!

203
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,749
<i>(man) A search and rescue chopper
has found them on the mountain.</i>

204
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:40,212
<i>We've sent out five teams to search for
that missing federal agent.</i>

205
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,596
Some water?

206
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,605
You can wait outside.

207
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:33,641
Now what happened after
you took her out of the trunk?

208
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:37,895
We walked a little ways
up to the top of the mountain.

209
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,689
Right where you found me.

210
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:45,778
- Then where'd you take her?
- I didn't.

211
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,906
<i>They cm.</i>

212
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:55,454
That was the deal. Her instead of me.

213
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,679
- Did you kill her?
- No.

214
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:18,352
I swear.

215
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,188
- How'd you get this?
- From the ship.

216
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,233
- What ship?
- You saw it.

217
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,194
- I saw a helicopter.
- They were here!

218
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,488
I'm not lying to ya!

219
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:33,575
There they are! Ask them.
They know what happened.

220
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,954
- Sit down, Duane.
- No! You've gotta stop 'em!

221
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:41,542
Hurry! Hurry! They were just out there!
They were right outside! They...

222
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,420
- Duane, settle down!
- No!

223
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:50,134
They'll tell you where she is!
The military's in on it. Just ask 'em!

224
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,143
Did you hurt her? Did you hurt her?!

225
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,729
- No!
- What is this?

226
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,038
<i>(coughing)</i>

227
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:43,896
I'm sorry.

228
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,735
They had to take her.

229
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,995
I hope they're not hurting her...
too much with the tests.

230
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,334
I'm sorry.

231
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,266
- Hey.
- Yeah?

232
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:26,772
- What's the matter? What did he say to you?
- He's given me nothing.

233
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,733
Were you out here alone?

234
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,902
Yeah. Why?

235
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,780
Nobody goes in or out of that room.

236
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,949
Hey, Mulder...

237
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,815
<i>(high-pitched whine)</i>

238
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,771
(man) Rescue two...

239
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,503
- What are you doing?
- I heard him...

240
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,672
Come here. Come here.

241
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:19,509
I heard him gagging. He couldn't breathe.

242
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:23,972
- He said you choked him.
- No one is to interrogate the suspect.

243
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,183
- Except you?
- Except me.

244
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,019
- Did you ask him about Scully?
- Yeah.

245
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:33,523
- What did he say?
- He started whistling "Stairway to Heaven".

246
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,703
- Keep an eye on him.
- OK.

247
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,292
- You've got Duane Barry?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,216
Agent Mulder,
you disobeyed my direct order.

249
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,971
(man) Call the paramedics!

250
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,183
- What happened?
- He was gagging.

251
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,852
Duane. Duane.

252
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,024
Duane.

253
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,572
<i>(paramedic) Coming through!</i>

254
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,829
- Respiration?
- Nothing.

255
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,748
Start CPR.

256
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:38,797
Ready?

257
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,800
One, two, three, four, five.

258
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,055
One, two, three...

259
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,661
Excuse me?

260
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:13,206
I'm Agent Mulder. I'd like a copy
of this man's autopsy report.

261
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,417
I'm sorry. It's still incomplete.

262
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,711
- Are you the pathologist?
- Yes.

263
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,673
Can I ask what your preliminary findings are?

264
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:27,596
Um... second-degree burns on the face,
contusions about the neck, bruised larynx.

265
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,059
If I had to list cause of death at this point,
I'd have to say asphyxiation.

266
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,853
Were you expecting something else?

267
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,107
- You haven't run a toxicological yet?
- They should be finished shortly.

268
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,694
I'd be interested to see what you find.
When will it be on file?

269
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:45,947
- Later this morning.
- I'd like a copy as soon as possible.

270
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:50,327
Well, I'm sorry. You'll have to go
through regular military channels.

271
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,996
What do you mean, "military"?

272
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,750
- You're not FBI?
- Quantico's under militaryjurisdiction.

273
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:00,754
There wasn't an FBI pathologist
available this morning.

274
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:35,956
Skinner's expecting my report on the
Duane Barry incident. What do I tell him?

275
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,542
The truth.

276
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,003
- What do you mean?
- Confirm Mulder's version of events.

277
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:44,756
You've earned his trust.
You have to preserve it.

278
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,094
- For how much longer?
- Until your assignment is completed.

279
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,305
If Mulder's such a threat,
why not eliminate him?

280
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,142
- That's not policy.
- It's not?

281
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,147
After what you had me do?

282
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:05,193
Kill Mulder and you risk turning
one man's religion into a crusade.

283
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:07,988
- What about Scully?
- We've taken care of that.

284
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:10,448
How?

285
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:13,451
- We tell you what you need to know.
- I've a right to know.

286
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:17,497
You have no rights,
only orders to be carried out.

287
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:22,961
If you have a problem with that,
we'll make other arrangements.

288
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:36,266
The victim appears to have expired
from prolonged hypoxemia...

289
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:41,605
...secondary to asphyxiation. Of several
etiologies, the most likely is strangulation...

290
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:45,150
...due to the presence
of contusions and a bruised larynx.

291
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:49,279
- Do you want to speak, Agent Mulder?
- I didn't kill him, if that's what you mean.

292
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:53,825
- But you attacked him?
- I was interrogating him about Agent Scully.

293
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:58,038
- He wasn't cooperating, so I pushed him.
- And you lost control.

294
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,249
Momentarily. But then I left the room.

295
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,003
He was very much alive. I spoke to him.
Agent Krycek spoke to him.

296
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:09,799
Agent Krycek says he entered the room
because the suspect was gagging.

297
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,677
Is Agent Krycek asserting
that I killed him too?

298
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:18,850
No. He corroborates your story. But the fact
is we've got a dead suspect, Agent Mulder...

299
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:21,770
...and no other plausible cause of death.

300
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:27,359
OPC wants both of you to take a lie-detector
test. You're to report there immediately.

301
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:34,699
There is another plausible cause of death.

302
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:38,745
- Which is?
- Poisoning by injection or ingestion.

303
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,830
Poisoning?

304
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,960
You won't find that
on the Navy pathologists report.

305
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:48,421
- What are you saying?
- That the autopsy is incomplete.

306
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,591
That the military covered up
the toxicological findings.

307
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:55,804
- And why would they do that?
- Because they know where Scully is.

308
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,682
Why are you so paranoid, Mulder?

309
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:03,979
Oh, I don't know... Maybe it's because
I find it hard to trust anybody.

310
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:15,031
- Alex? Alex? Can I borrow your car keys?
- Why? Where are going?

311
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,909
- There's somebody I gotta see.
- We're scheduled...

312
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,704
I know. Just give me the keys. Please.

313
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,040
Thanks.

314
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,059
You wasted a trip, Mr Mulder. There's
nothing the senator can do for you now.

315
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:46,396
- What?
- Not without committing political suicide.

316
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:50,191
Why? Do they have something on him?

317
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:55,363
They have something on everyone, Mr
Mulder. The question is when they'll use it.

318
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:58,450
- I need his help.
- No one can help you now.

319
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:01,494
Your channels of appeal
and recourse are closed.

320
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:04,497
Your predecessor could've helped me.

321
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,129
You know, don't you?

322
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:20,221
- You know what's happened to her.
- This reaches beyond any of us, Mr Mulder.

323
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,850
- Even my predecessor.
- I want an answer!

324
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:29,397
Why kill Duane Barry
if there was nothing to hide?

325
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:34,402
- You mean the government?
- There are no answers for you, Mr Mulder.

326
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,988
They only have one policy:

327
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,992
Deny everything.

328
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:05,160
- This is a serious allegation, Agent Mulder.
- Only so far as it is true.

329
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,624
"Agent Krycek was hired by an outside
agency to impede a federal investigation...

330
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:16,296
...and may be responsible for the death
of a suspect in a capital murder case."

331
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:18,840
It goes on.

332
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:23,428
"And the possible murder of
the tram operator at Skyland Mountain."

333
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:29,309
There's a lot of blood on this document. Are
you standing behind this going on record?

334
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:30,393
Yes, sir.

335
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:34,314
Then you damn well better
have the facts to back it up.

336
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:38,526
I need to see Agent Krycek, immediately.

337
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,831
I can't protect you, Agent Mulder.

338
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:56,920
Past a point, this will become
a larger Bureau matter.

339
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:06,804
All right, what have you got?

340
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:12,310
I found this in Agent Krycek's car.
He doesn't smoke.

341
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,272
Agent Krycek was the last person
with Duane Barry before he died.

342
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:20,360
He was also the last person to see
the tram operator before he disappeared.

343
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:25,156
When I got to the top of Skyland Mountain,
I saw an unmarked helicopter in the area.

344
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,202
I believe Krycek gave away
the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Scully...

345
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,371
...to whoever he's working with.

346
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,623
- And who is that?
- I don't know.

347
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:37,377
The military? Some covert organisation
within the government?

348
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,588
Whoever the man who smokes
those cigarettes works for.

349
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:41,631
Why?

350
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:45,343
Because Agent Scully got too close
to whatever they're trying to deny.

351
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:51,140
Because she had hard and damning evidence
- that metallic implant - in her possession.

352
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:56,688
Or because her termination would prevent
further involvement with me and my work.

353
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:04,362
Do you think Agent Scully's dead?

354
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,115
I don't know.

355
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,577
How far do you think they'd go?

356
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,664
What do you know about Krycek?

357
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:18,334
- I didn't give him the assignment. I only...
- (phone)

358
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:29,012
Yes.

359
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:31,180
Thank you.

360
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:40,231
Agent Krycek didn't show up
for work this morning.

361
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:43,443
His home number has been disconnected.

362
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,325
That's it? He's gone?
He just disappears into the woodwork?

363
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:51,659
So it would appear.

364
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:55,955
Who are these people who can murder with
impunity and we can't do anything about it?

365
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,041
- Let it go.
- Like hell!

366
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:01,586
- There's nothing you can do.
- What can you do about it?

367
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:07,967
There's only one thing that I can do,
Agent Mulder.

368
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:12,138
As of right now, I'm reopening the X-Files.

369
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,310
That's what they fear the most.

370
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:49,175
Agent Mulder? Thank you for calling me.

371
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:53,596
- Sorry I don't have better news.
- Do you know something? ls Dana OK?

372
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,766
I don't know anything more about it.

373
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:01,896
I know you're doing all you can.

374
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:19,706
I had that dream again last night,
about Dana being taken away.

375
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:22,709
I can't tell you how it scares me.

376
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:28,923
It's probably scarier
when you <i>stop</i> having the dream.

377
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,177
Don't you think?

378
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,867
I found this.

379
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:01,789
It's something l...
I never considered about her.

380
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,419
If she was... if she was such a sceptic...

381
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:10,548
...why did she wear that?

382
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:16,262
I gave it to her on her 15th birthday.

383
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:27,607
Don't you want to keep it?

384
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:40,703
When you find her, you give it to her.
