Damn.

3
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:36,747
There's ash in the wine
from the fires in Malibu Canyon.

4
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,920
You can almost see from here.

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,699
I want you to know I... I don't do this.

I... I mean I'm... I'm not one of those guys...

8
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:19,706
...that sends his family

9
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,210
But... when I met you
at the corporate party, I...

10
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:25,379
Ssshh.

11
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:28,173
It'll be worth it.

12
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:37,849
I'll do things with you no one's ever done.

13
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:13,051

<i>(Phone)</i>

18
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,360
Let's start in the bedroom
and work our way downstairs.

19
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:21,239
Don't let the media in on the writings
in blood on the wall.

20
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:29,289
Excuse me, sir. If I can ask your indulgence,
this is a restricted crime scene.

21
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,042
- Mulder. I'm with the Bureau.
- Nobody called them.

22
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,210
They should have.

23
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:37,297
LAPD has seen, I don't know, a couple
of weird crime scenes down the years.

24
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:40,509
- We can handle it.
- There's no time for agency rivalries.

25
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:44,095
I don't care about credit for the arrest
or what goes on whose record.

26
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:48,433
In the past year these killers have murdered
six people. They only kill at night.

27
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:51,686
In a week, two more people
will be dead and they will be gone.

28
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,981
- How do you know?
- There's a file on the previous murders.

29
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:59,194
I've studied it. I've studied <i>them.</i>
I've been waiting for them to reappear.

30
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,113
How can you be sure
these are the same killers?

31
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,699
The wire reported a body drained of blood...

32
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:08,203
...bite marks on the exteriorjugular
and median cubital veins.

33
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,580
Every mirror in the house was smashed.

34
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:14,751
Yeah, well, it's what the wire <i>didn't</i> report
that distinguishes this scene.

35
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:18,755
There's writings on the wall,
written in the victim's blood.

36
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:23,593
"He who eats of my flesh and drinks
of my blood shall have eternal life."

37
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,805
"And I will raise him up on the last day."

38
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,391
They have the same
feeble literal grasp of the Bible

39
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,977
as all those big-haired preachers do.

40
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:34,646
The victim - was he a father?

41
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,650
Yeah. Three boys.
The, uh, family's been notified.

42
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:45,282
In Memphis they murdered James Ellis,
58, father of Ellis & Sons Clothiers.

43
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:48,994
The second victim was
a Korean woman, Linda Sun.

44
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:52,163
The third victim was a Jesuit theologian.

45
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,582
Excuse me.

46
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:57,669
In Portland, three months ago,
the first victim was a priest.

47
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:01,715
The second victim was the only son
in a family of six children.

48
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,678
The last victim was the owner of
a New Age book shop - The Holy Spirit.

49
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:12,183
I believe that's how they perceive
themselves, as a kind of unholy trinity.

50
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:17,022
They use these to extract the blood
and then store it for a quick fix later.

51
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:22,319
Their need is insatiable, but murdering
for blood risks exposure and capture.

52
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:25,363
If my profile of
the previous cases holds true...

53
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,700
...they've been working near
blood products for a month.

54
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:33,038
Look, Agent Mulder, I'm really sorry
I was such a hard-ass back there.

55
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:36,291
But in this town
it's really tough to trust anyone.

56
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:39,711
I'd be happy to have you work
on our investigation. This is...

57
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,631
I'm working alone.

58
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:45,342
An FBI agent without a partner?

59
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:51,097
Our department's under a crisis alert
right now because of the fires in the canyon.

60
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:54,643
The fact is, I don't think I can free up
any resources for you now.

61
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,603
I only need one thing.

62
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:01,232
<i>(tapping in numbers)</i>

63
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:07,030

- <i>Hi. This is</i> Marty Mulder <i>from Payroll.</i>

64
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:10,617
I have a question regarding
the W-4 form of a recent employee.

65
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:13,703
- You mean Frank?
- When was he hired?

66
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:17,582
<i>A couple of weeks ago.

79
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:38,139
- Tell us your real name.
- Please! I can't take it.

80
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:41,851
Turn off the lights!
You're killing me. Turn them off!

81
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,356

Please!

84
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,737
Turn 'em off!

85
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,952
That better?

86
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,273
I'll only talk to <i>him.</i>

87
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,281
Lucky you.

88
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,420
You know what we are.

89
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:53,006
What are you?

90
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:58,803
He is the Father, I am the Son
and she is the Unholy Spirit.

91
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,307
And the three of you killed Garrett Lorre.

92
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:03,892
No.

93
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:06,728
Your fingerprints were found
at the crime scene.

94
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:12,775
No. When a snake eats a fly,
it's not murder. ltjust is.

95
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,528
Frogs eat flies.

96
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,324
Are you dead?

97
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:23,661
- I never will be.
- You believe that?

98
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,834
Don't you wanna live for ever?

99
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:36,341
Well, not if drawstring pants
come back into style.

100
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:43,473
Look, what nobody realises
is that there is no afterlife.

101
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:47,185
I know this - listen to me, listen to me.
I know this because...

102
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,480
...when we prolong our lives
by taking theirs...

103
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:55,652
...all I see is such... horror in their eyes.

104
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:59,572
And that's because at that moment
they're face to face with death.

105
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,867
And then suddenly they realise
there's nothing else.

106
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:08,331
There's no heaven. There's no soul.
There's just rot and there's just decay.

107
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,545
And I will never, ever, ever,
ever have to face that.

108
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:19,217
It's a stiff price, though. Look at yourself.
Drinking blood, living in darkness.

109
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:24,389
Unable to see your reflection in a mirror.
Or is that just a myth?

110
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,186
I can't be seen in a mirror.

111
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,360
Look, anything worth anything has a price.

112
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,990
And when I'm standing
next to your deathbed

113
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,535
looking as young as I look right now...

114
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:50,248
...and I see that fear in your eyes
at the moment of death...

115
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:54,961
...then, then tell me the price is too stiff.

116
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:04,137
It's more likely I'll be looking into your eyes
before they lead you into the gas chamber.

117
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:13,187
But that's a moment you won't have to face
if you tell me where the others are.

118
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:16,858
Why would I?
They're the only ones that can kill me.

119
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:19,652
If you are what you say you are...

120
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:22,613
...I know what can kill you.

121
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:31,831
It'd be very easy to cover those windows.
Just tell me where the other two are.

122
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:40,465
In a couple of hours,
there'll be no escaping the sun... Son.

123
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:53,102
If he wants to talk,
cover the windows and call me.

124
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:56,856
What if he turns into a bat
and flies out through the bars?

125
00:14:56,981 --> 00:15:01,778
That man is delusional, but I get the sense
that not even he believes his own claims.

126
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:04,113
We've gotta play along with his beliefs.

127
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:07,366
I'm hoping that the sunlight
will give him an excuse to talk.

128
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:12,497
- Go back to your hotel and get some sleep.
- I didn't check in to a hotel room.

129
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,665
I don't sleep any more.

130
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,991
<i>(screaming)</i>

131
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:52,870
Number four! Right away!
Number four, right away!

132
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:02,046
<i>(screaming)</i>

133
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,926
<i>(laboured breath)</i>

134
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:16,811
An oedema ball at the nostrils, rupture of
the skull due to internal steam pressure.

135
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:20,898
These are indications of long exposure
to extreme temperatures...

136
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,151
...not a sunburn for 15 seconds.

137
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:26,404
The guards found no flammable materials?

138
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,782
I had believed that...

139
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,578
...this man's illness was psychological.

140
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,622
There is a condition
known as Gunther's Disease.

141
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:41,085
Congenital erythropoietic porphyria
creating cutaneous photosensitivity.

142
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,797
I'm familiar with porphyria.
It causes lesions and blisters...

143
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,259
...when skin is exposed to sunlight,
not fourth-degree burns.

144
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:52,638
Sufferers have a deficiency which can be
supplemented by a small ingestion of blood,

145
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:56,267
...not... the kind of bloodthirst
that this man had.

146
00:16:57,101 --> 00:17:01,397
It's probably ignorance of porphyria as
a disease that led to the vampire myths...

147
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,983
...in Asia in the Middle Ages.

148
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:10,448
I had... dismissed the possibility of the
actual existence of such a creature as myth.

149
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:15,453
You are really upsetting me...
on several levels.

150
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:21,000
- When will you get the blood tests back?
- Next week.

151
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:26,130
What's this purple stain here?

152
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,927
Could be an ink stamp,
like they give at a party or a club.

153
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,304
Can you read it?

154
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,724
It is possible that
the heat burned the ink permanently

155
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,894
into the lower levels of the skin.

156
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,163
An old coroner's trick.

157
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:02,833
I can make a quarter appear
from behind your ear.

<i>(grunge music)</i>

00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:07,523

like me is doing in a place like this?

160
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,113
How do you define normal?

All I know is, uh...

164
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:30,546
...normal is not what I feel.

165
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,928
You've lost someone.

00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:43,434
Not a lover. A friend.

I'll get these.

00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:02,411
"He who drinks my blood..."

169
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,789
"Has eternal life."

170
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,671
You're not interested
in this place, in what we do.

171
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:16,967
- How do you know?
- You're afraid of me.

172
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,180
I take the life of others...

173
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:26,977
...inside me... into my blood.

174
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:33,150
I need to know.

175
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:20,114
And all day long I deal with equity...

176
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,534
...notes, bonds...

177
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:26,954
Nothing that's real.

178
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,374
And this gives my life... life.

179
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,936
My name's Kristen.

180
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,898
It's a normal name.

181
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,908
AIDS.

182
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:07,036
Aren't you afraid?

183
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,252
I wish I <i>could</i> die.

184
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:23,320
The Father, the Son.

185
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,791
I don't know who you are, freak,
but we're two consenting adults.

186
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,045
Now, get the hell outta here.

187
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:33,015
Kristen?

188
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,357
Kristen?

189
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,402
Kristen?

190
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,448
Come out.

191
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,034
Hm.

192
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:55,412
It's my turn.

193
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,594
Don't worry. I took care of that guy.

194
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,057
I told you I'd protect you.

195
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,275
<i>(screaming)</i>

196
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:38,914
The murderers cut off the power supply
at some point, and the phone. Fits their MO.

197
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,751
This is our forensic dentist
you requested. Doctor Jacobs.

198
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,169
How do you do?

199
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:49,007
I don't wanna bias your report, but I need
a preliminary examination for anything...

200
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,176
- ...unnatural.
- Uh-huh.

201
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,474
Shine the light down here.

202
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,649
Agent Mulder?

203
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:54,156
All this time I've been putting
raspberry sauce on ice cream.

204
00:26:54,865 --> 00:27:00,829
Check these prints. One will be the victim's.
The other should be the woman we're after.

205
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,091
The bites are not done by an animal.
These are human.

206
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,969
And, realise this is a cursory exam,

207
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:19,681
but I'd say they were made
by three different people.

208
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,937
The Unholy Spirit.

209
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:15,612
We got the front. You go around the back.
You, check the garage.

210
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,078
OK, do it. Open her up.

211
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:36,008
Ms Kilar? Los Angeles Police Department.
We have a warrant to search the premises.

212
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:00,324
I found these. Veterinary needles.

213
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:04,494
The size matches the puncture wounds
on the previous victims.

214
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,915
And look at this. From a snakebite kit.

215
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,708
It's placed over the wound
to extract poison.

216
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,044
- Only this one...
- Has blood in it.

217
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,087
Detective?

218
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,298
Over here.

219
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,019
The other side down.

220
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:37,319
Well, she wasn't at work and she's not here.

221
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,989
She's gone, and she's not coming back.

222
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,200
<i>(sirens and helicopters)</i>

223
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,374
<i>(door closes)</i>

224
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:16,233
Special Agent Fox Mulder,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

225
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,780
They're after you.

226
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:26,618
- How do you know?
- The bread. Legends in Eastern Europe.

227
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:31,665
It's said that one can protect oneself
by eating bread filled with blood.

228
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,251
You were protecting yourself.

229
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,425
And now you're protecting me?

230
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:48,098
I think it's best if I took you into
protective custody. They'll kill once more.

231
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,726
They'll try to kill you.

232
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,146
Why are you here alone?

233
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,235
Because you think you're not afraid?

234
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:09,327
Because you need to know? You need
to know they are who you believe they are.

235
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:12,456
What I believe you to be.

236
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:28,013
One change in the wind
and the fires will move this way.

237
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,476
Have you ever tasted blood?

238
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,774
No, you haven't.

239
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,486
Blood tastes... dangerous.

240
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:48,492
It's sweet... and thick.

241
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:55,165
You were in Memphis and Portland
when the other murders occurred.

242
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,293
How are you connected?

243
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:05,717
When I was a little girl, my father beat me.

244
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,848
Abuse is too frail a word.

245
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,020
He showed his love for me by beating me.

246
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,981
I was dead.

247
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:27,531
One night he hit me so hard, he knocked out
two teeth and locked me in my room.

248
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:34,663
The blood poured
from my mouth onto the floor...

249
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,874
...and down my throat.

250
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,546
It was the only way I knew I was alive.

251
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,552
I met John in Chicago.

252
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:53,014
You know him as "the Son".

253
00:32:56,893 --> 00:33:02,232
He also beat me.
I guess that's the way it works sometimes.

254
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,907
He hit me once and cut open my lip.

255
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:19,583
I was angry... and as revenge
ljumped on him and I bit through his lip.

256
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,086
He tasted my blood...

257
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,631
...and I tasted his.

258
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,138
After that we were into blood sports.

259
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,558
But...

260
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,145
lnevenu

261
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,233
I lost him.

262
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:51,907
One night he came home
with two others and it turned...

263
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,452
...unnatural.

264
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,333
I left him and I moved to Memphis.

265
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:06,296
But they followed you. They want you.

266
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,424
I'm tired of running.

267
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,471
And you're here to protect me.

268
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,773
Are you trying to ward me off?

269
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,987
It's from someone <i>I</i> lost.

270
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,324
Well, I hope you find her.

271
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,537
The one you lost, John, he's...

272
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,208
“dead.

273
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,795
But they've picked up another.
They're three again.

274
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:53,385
Kristen, I think you'll be safer if you
come back to the police station with me.

275
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,804
Without him, they won't come for me.

276
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,390
I won't go.

277
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,059
Then I won't go.

278
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:05,897
You need to get cleaned up.

279
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,693
Mm.

280
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:21,204
<i>(knocking)</i>

281
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,373
Yeah?

282
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,669
No mirrors.

283
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,298
I don't like the way I look.

284
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,883
It makes this hard.

285
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,391
I'll do it.

286
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:03,204
<i>(winces)</i>

287
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,931
It's not who you are.

288
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:25,268
It doesn't make you happy.

289
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,433
I've been watching.

290
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:10,105
I had to wait for you to finish.

291
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,317
I had to wait to tell you...

292
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,445
...it's true.

293
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,990
I was as surprised as anybody.

294
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,832
You can live for ever.

295
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,963
Everybody else just dies,
but we, we come back.

296
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:39,008
The Spirit showed me.

297
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,390
And now she'll show you.

298
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,774
We live in a different world, Kristen.

299
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,861
And nobody on the outside can end my life.

300
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,780
You can't kill me.

301
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:05,160
But I can kill... you.

302
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:12,083
I know, Kristen, what I did to you was...

303
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:17,547
If I were to die, I would certainly
go to hell for what I did.

304
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:22,385
But I love you, and I can atone for eternity.

305
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,558
Kill him...

306
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:32,353
...and we'll be together.

307
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,315
You've got to drink the blood of a spirit.

308
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:38,359
- But he's not...
- No! He is.

309
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,279
A spirit is one who believes.

310
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:44,365
He knows we're possible.

311
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,246
You don't have much time
before the sun comes up.

312
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,793
Cut him open...

313
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,088
...and we'll finish.

314
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,277
You have to go.

315
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:24,489
- Are they here?
- The fire...

316
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:28,535
- You have to go.
- My car's down the hill.

317
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:33,456
- Mine's in the garage. The keys are in it.
- You have to get your things.

318
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:36,668
I'll be right there.

319
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:01,442
He's not dead!

320
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,154
John's alive. I saw him.

321
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,867
Come on.

322
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:32,241
<i>(speaking in tongues)</i>

323
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:51,552
- Are you all right? I'll go.
- I won't leave without him.

324

<i>(car tyres screech)</i>

325
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,977
We'll rise up.

00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:43,646
You can't kill us!

327
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:46,441
You're not one of us.

328
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:49,652
But I will be.

329
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,494
I'm tasting the blood of a believer.

330
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:03,499
But you haven't taken a life.

331
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,137
I'll take mine.

332
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:18,806
Don't do that. Don't do that! Don't!

333
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,350
Don't! Don't! No, don't!

334
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:23,352
Don't!

335
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,008
Agent Mulder.

336
00:43:57,553 --> 00:44:01,015
I'm sorry. We found four bodies.

337
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:03,226
All dead.

338
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:10,691
- No remains?
- The fire was extremely hot.

339
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:13,277
It's just ashes and bones.

340
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:09,292
<i>(Child) I made this!</i>
