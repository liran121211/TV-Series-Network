00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,782
<i>Stock prices fell for

3

<i>...amid worries about
the prospect of higher interest rates.</i>

- There's a fire outside my apartment.
- Are you at 700 East 56th Street?

11
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,747
- Yes, apartment 606. <i>For</i> God's sakes, hurry!
<i>- Fire units are being dispatched.</i>

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,468
Somebody help! Help!

<i>(alarm sounds)</i>

16
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,327
Keep right. Please keep moving, sir.

17
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,047
I don't see any smoke anywhere.

18
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,092
Get a crew up to the roof!

19
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:17,722
This is Lieutenant Regan. We have
a possible 2-3 false alarm in apartment 606.

20
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,641
Let's confirm that location. 606.

21
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,686
<i>(dispatcher) Yes, that's affirmative. 606.</i>

22
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,315
It's cold. Let's do it!

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,286
<i>(fireman)</i> I'll take the bedroom.

24
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,623
<i>(Regan)</i> He looks dead.

25
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,340
<i>(fireman)</i> Nothing here.

26
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,142
<i>- 911 operator. Police emergency.
- This is Dr Saul Grissom.</i>

27
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,937
<i>- There's a fire outside my apartment.
- Are you at 700 East 56th Street?</i>

28
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,233
<i>- Yes, apartment 606. For God's sakes, hurry!
- Fire units are being dispatched.</i>

29
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,818
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

30
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,363
The article makes no mention of a fire.

31
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,741
Yes, Agent Mulder, I can read.

32
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,327
Grissom's company
had government contracts,

33
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:49,206
so this investigation
would be within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

34
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,751
But that's not why
you want the assignment.

35
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:59,842
I think that the circumstances surrounding
Grissom's death warrant a closer look.

36
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:05,598
NYPD won't even talk to me unless you
get the Attorney General to sign off on it.

37
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,142
Where did you get the tape?

38
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:13,397
Presumably someone has led you to believe
there's more here than is being reported.

39
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,903
My source, the only one
I've ever trusted, is dead.

40
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,205
I'll look into this further
and, uh... let you know.

41
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:36,212
In the meantime, you have 24 hours
of wiretap tape to transcribe.

42
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,673
<i>(woman on tape) You comin' over or what?</i>

43
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,092
<i>You said you was comin'
over two hours ago.</i>

44
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,096
<i>I'm waitin' here like some bimbo
who ain't got nothin' better to do..</i>

45
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,439
<i>...waitin' here like some bimbo
who ain't got nothin' better to do...</i>

46
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,608
<i>...than just sit around and wait for you.</i>

47
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,777
Agent Mulder?

48
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,156
- Yeah?
- It's your 302.

49
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,284
Assistant Director Skinner
just approved it.

50
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,082
There's a mistake.
Another agent has been assigned to the case.

51
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,417
That would be me.

52
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,670
Krycek. Alex Krycek.

53
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:23,092
- Skinner didn't mention taking on a partner.
- It wasn't Skinner.

54
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:27,388
I opened the file two hours before
your request, so technically it's my case.

55
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,893
- You already talked to the police?
- Yep.

56
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:36,480
Just hung up on the officer in charge
a few minutes ago.

57
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,484
A detective named... Horton.

58
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:44,363
- Seems Grissom called 911 to report a fire.
- I heard the tape.

59
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:49,827
Did you hear that Forensics found
a spent fire-extinguisher on the floor?

60
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,162
Grissom's prints were all over it.

61
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:58,002
The walls and floor in his living room
were covered with ammonium phosphate.

62
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,005
- But no trace of fire?
- Not even a burnt match.

63
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,091
- Is that all you know?
- Yeah. So far.

64
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,846
- What do you think it means?
- I appreciate the show and tell...

65
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,516
...and I don't want you to take this
personally, but I work alone.

66
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,605
- I'll straighten things out with Skinner.
- It's my case, Agent Mulder.

67
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:22,109
Look, I may be... green...

68
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:26,405
...but I had the case first
and I'm not gonna give it away so quickly.

69
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,201
I'll tell you what.
I got some work to finish up around here.

70
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:36,415
Why don't you go to the motor pool and
requisition us a car? I'll meet you there.

71
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,835
That's all? You don't have a problem
with us working together?

72
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,254
Hey, it's your party.

73
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,468
I'll, um... I'll get the car.

74
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,192
Electrocution affects
electrolytic conduction...

75
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,945
...disrupting the heartbeat
and most of the autonomic systems.

76
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,617
Death actually occurs from tissue damage,
necrosis in the heart itself...

77
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,537
...particularly in the sinus
and atrioventricular nodes.

78
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,999
Agent Scully. Sorry to interrupt.
You have a call from a George Hale.

79
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,419
- Says it's urgent.
- Excuse me.

80
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,341
- Where <i>are</i> you?
<i>- National Airport.</i>

81
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,510
Catching the shuttle to LaGuardia.

82
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,304
Wanna join me in the Big Apple
for an autopsy?

83
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,265
- What's going <i>on?</i>
<i>- I was hoping you could tell me.</i>

84
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,143
I can't today.
My last class isn't over until 4.30.

85
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,271
That's fine.
I can have the ME wrap the body to go.

86
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,024
<i>- Mulder...</i>
- You'll get it by <i>five.</i>

87
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,653
What's the name?

88
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,834
Doctor Grissom's alpha wave analysis
defined the standard.

89
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,461
He revolutionised the way
we think about sleep.

90
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,172
His death is a tremendous loss to science.

91
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,175
How many other kinds
of sleep disorder did he treat?

92
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,512
There are 38 different
dyssomnias and parasomnias.

93
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,307
Doctor Grissom treated them all
with an unprecedented success ratio.

94
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,019
Maintaining that kind of batting average
must have taken its toll.

95
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,480
Excellence demands certain sacrifices.

96
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,734
- Did he show signs of psychological stress?
- Not really.

97
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,695
Except for his own occasional
bout of insomnia.

98
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,489
- But he was never delusional?
- Of course not.

99
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,660
- What's his story?
- This patient's night terrors...

100
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:41,039
...prevent him from cycling out of REM sleep
into the more restful slow-wave sleep.

101
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:46,253
It's still experimental, but we're trying
to modify his brain wave patterns externally.

102
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,174
- How do you do that?
- Electrical stimulation of the occipital lobe...

103
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,051
...creates visual and auditory hallucinations.

104
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:57,723
- It's possible to alter somebody's dreams?
- In theory, yes.

105
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,324
<i>(car door shuts)</i>

106
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,618
I paid off your cab.

107
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:22,414
- I don't like being ditched like a bad date.
- Sorry if I hurt your feelings.

108
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:26,084
What's with this attitude?
You don't know the first thing about me.

109
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,711
Exactly.

110
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:31,757
You know, back at the academy...
some of the guys used to make fun of you.

111
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,470
- Stop it or you're gonna hurt my feelings.
- But some of us followed your work.

112
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,516
Because we knew there was more
out there than they were telling us.

113
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,684
<i>(phone rings)</i>

114
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,356
- Yeah.
- Dr Grissom didn't die from cardiac arrest.

115
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,985
- What is it?
- I think you should take a look for yourself.

116
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:57,574
I haven't even started on the chest and the
abdomen and I'll have more to tell you then.

117
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,743
I can make it in two hours.

118
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,415
Where are we going?

119
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,969
- Spleen or pancreas?
- Stomach.

120
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,137
I was just about to start on it.

121
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:25,102
Oh, uh... this is Alex Krycek.
We're working the case together.

122
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,437
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

123
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,942
Notice the pugilistic attitude of the corpse.

124
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,111
<i>(Krycek splutters)</i>

125
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:40,284
This condition generally occurs
several hours after death.

126
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,120
It's caused by
a coagulation of muscle proteins...

127
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,498
...when the body is exposed
to extremely high temperatures.

128
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,710
- Like fire?
- This degree of limb flexion...

129
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,380
...is observed exclusively
in burn-related victims.

130
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:58,302
- There was no fire.
- And no epidermal burns to indicate that.

131
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,306
But when I opened up the skull,
I found extradural haemorrhages...

132
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,142
...which can only be caused by intense heat.

133
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,061
Somehow this man suffered
all of the secondary...

134
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:12,816
...but none of the primary physiological
responses to having been in a fire.

135
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,027
Any theories?

136
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,240
I can't even begin to explain what could
have caused it. I mean, it's almost as if...

137
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,409
What?

138
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,539
As if his body believed
that it was burning.

139
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:48,352
<i>(TV) ..with sapphire and cubic zirconium
baguettes, all in a 14-carat gold band.</i>

140
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,772
<i>Now, normally this ring retails for 1350.</i>

141
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,107
<i>Well, I think it'd be a value at 900.</i>

142
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,861
<i>I saw it in a big department store
last week for $1,000...</i>

<i>...but you will not believe
what we are offering it to you for.</i>

144
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,450
<i>677!</i>

145
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,619
<i>I mean, isn't that wonderful...</i>

146
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,084
<i>(man)</i> You left the door open, Willig.

Preacher?

148
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,215
Not a good idea leaving your door open
in this neighbourhood.

149
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,342
You never know who's gonna drop by.

150
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,345
Damn! What are you doing here?

151
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:29,935
- How long you been in town?
- Not long.

152
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,647
You want a beer?

153
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,443
How you doing, Henry? Huh?

154
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,322
Huh? How you been?

155
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:48,036
How am I doing? I'm, uh...

156
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:54,292
...trying to forget. You know?
I'm trying to get it out of my head.

157
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,254
No luck, huh?

158
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,716
No. I'm, uh...

159
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,970
...still fighting it, you know.

160
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,473
I keep seeing the faces.

161
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,185
Every day I see...

162
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,522
Ah, what's the difference?

163
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,650
We're all going to hell, right?

164
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:22,154
Where you think we've been
the last 24 years?

165
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:26,283
But after this,
wherever he sends us is gonna seem like...

166
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,452
Like a Hawaiian vacation.

167
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,375
What do you want here, Preacher?

168
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,506
You killed him, didn't you?

169
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,303
You killed Grissom. I saw it on TV.

170
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,474
He had to pay, Henry.

171
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,144
All of us have to answer
for what we did over there.

172
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,106
We can't get away from it.

173
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,869
No.

174
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:16,875
"He retains not his anger for ever,
because he delights in mercy."

175
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,129
"He will turn again;
he will have compassion on us."

176
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,091
"He will subdue our iniquities," Henry...

177
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:28,053
..."and he will cast all our sins
into the depths of the sea."

178
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,517
It's all right, Henry.

179
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,852
It's all over now.

180
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,088
The victim was Henry Willig.
Unemployed, lived on disability.

181
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,799
No indication of forced entry or struggle.

182
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,302
No abrasions or contusions
or trace evidence in the body.

183
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:13,181
Cause of death is being listed as...
burst aneurysm.

184
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,853
- Why did your friend from Homicide call us?
- Because a medical examiner called him.

185
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,857
The autopsy revealed 43 internal
haemorrhages and skeletal fragments...

186
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,109
...which doesn't happen spontaneously.

187
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:28,780
- Not without corresponding external trauma.
- What does the ME have to say about it?

188
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:34,202
He said if he didn't know otherwise,
he'd swear they were gunshot wounds.

189
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,205
What's this scar right here?

190
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,792
His records say the only surgery
he had was an appendectomy.

191
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,837
Unless they got to his appendix
through his neck.

192
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,757
Maybe it happened in Vietnam.
Willig did a tour with the marines in 1970.

193
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,845
- I'm sure they didn't keep the best of records.
- Willig was a marine?

194
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,682
So where do marines receive
basic training on the East Coast?

195
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,684
Parris Island?

196
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,272
Where Grissom was stationed
from 1968 to 1971.

197
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:07,861
Which means that he and Willig
were there at the same time. 24 years ago.

198
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:18,079
There we go. Willig was assigned
to Special Force and Recon Squad J-7.

199
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:21,208
Of 13 original members,
he's one of two survivors.

200
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,543
Till yesterday.

201
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:28,673
Which leaves us with one person who can
tell us what happened at Parris Island.

202
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:36,056
<i>I've been supervising Mr Cole's treatment
since I admitted him 12 years ago.</i>

203
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,352
I'm afraid you won't find him
very cooperative, though.

204
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:44,064
We just want to ask him
a few questions about his military service.

205
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,651
He doesn't respond very well to...
authority figures.

206
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,320
Is that why you put him in isolation?

207
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,906
We've had to house Mr Cole in this section...

208
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,576
...because he was interfering with
our treatment of other patients.

209
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,039
- How was he interfering?
- He was disrupting their sleep patterns.

210
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:05,210
With psychiatric patients,
the circadian cycles must be maintained.

211
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,422
Excuse me, but exactly how
would Cole disrupt their sleep?

212
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,050
Here we are.

213
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,345
Mr Cole!
There are some gentlemen here who...

214
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,479
- You discharged him two days ago.
- I certainly did not.

215
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,564
Don't you think I'd remember if I did?

216
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:31,403
I was on shift, and you signed the order
yourself. That is your signature, isn't it?

217
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,663
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- Let's get Cole's face out on the wire.

218
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,624
- Mulder.
- <i>(man) Mr Mulder.</i>

219
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,961
<i>We obtained information
that might assist your work.</i>

220
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,964
<i>But you must exercise discretion
when we meet.</i>

221
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>If anyone follows you, I won't be there.</i>

222
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,300
- Who are you?
- Who I am is irrelevant.

223
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:45,143
- Why are you trying to help me?
- You think I want to be here, Agent Mulder?

224
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,895
I don't want to be here.

225
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,443
- What is this?
- Data from a top-secret military project...

226
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,572
...born of the idea that sleep
is the soldier's greatest enemy.

227
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,621
Grissom was conducting sleep-deprivation
experiments on Parris Island.

228
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,916
Not deprivation. Eradication.

229
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,878
- Why?
- Why else? To build a better soldier.

230
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,800
Sustained wakefulness dulls fear,
heightens aggression.

231
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,096
Science had just put a man on the moon...

232
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,641
...so they looked to science
to win a losing war.

233
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,519
And Willig and Cole were the lab rats?

234
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:31,356
Lab rats with the highest
kill-ratio in the Marine Corps.

235
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:36,027
4,000-plus confirmed kills
for a 13-man squad.

236
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,363
Is Cole behind what's happening now?

237
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,741
I'm not here to do your thinking,
Agent Mulder.

238
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:46,413
All I know is Augustus Cole
hasn't slept in 24 years.

239
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,708
There's someone else you should see.

240
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,795
Another squad member
reportedly killed in action.

241
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,007
- I thought Cole was the last.
- His name is on the envelope.

242
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,640
- How do I contact you?
- You can't.

243
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,227
- I may need more.
- You still don't get it, do you?

244
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,065
Closing the X-Files, separating
you and Scully, was only the beginning.

245
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,361
The truth is still out there...

246
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,198
...but it's never been more dangerous.

247
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,997
The man we both knew...
paid for that information with his life.

248
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,084
A sacrifice I'm not willing to make.

249
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,913
Where were you?

250
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:14,959
Someone matching Cole's description just
robbed a drugstore. He's in a nearby motel.

251
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,795
- Is he alive?
- He was when the night manager saw him.

252
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,341
So where were you?

253
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,720
Detective Horton?

254
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,097
I'm Agent Krycek. This is Agent Mulder.

255
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:33,019
I've been waiting for you. I tried holding the
SWAT guys back, but they're getting antsy.

256
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,564
Cole didn't steal dime one
from that drugstore. Just some pills.

257
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,566
- Freeze!
- <i>(gunshots)</i>

258
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,735
<i>(woman screams)</i>

259
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,159
- Inside! Now!
- <i>(child cries)</i>

260
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,538
Officer down!

261
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:57,710
We got two officers down. Both critical.
Request emergency vehicles immediately.

262
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:01,089
<i>(dispatcher) Roger, I copy
on your officers being down...</i>

263
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,435
What's going on here, Mulder?

264
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,856
These two officers. They shot each other.

265
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,579
<i>Also described in the report is
an experimental neurosurgical procedure...</i>

266
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:36,040
<i>...designed to induce
a permanent waking state.</i>

267
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:40,503
<i>The procedure involved cutting part of
the brain stem in the midpontile region...</i>

268
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,298
<i>...which would explain Henry Willig's scar.</i>

269
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:47,677
<i>A similar scar should also
be evident on Augustus Cole.</i>

270
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,180
<i>Postop treatment included
a regimen of synthetic supplements...</i>

271
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:55,351
<i>...to replenish the organic deficits
caused by prolonged lack of sleep.</i>

272
00:23:55,435 --> 00:24:00,148
<i>This is consistent with the antidepressants
Cole robbed from the pharmacy.</i>

273
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,443
<i>These drugs maintain
serotonin levels in the blood...</i>

274
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:08,364
<i>...serotonin being the primary substance
produced during sleep.</i>

275
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,037
<i>It is theoretically possible that this procedure
diminished the subjects' need for sleep...</i>

276
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,625
<i>...but I can neither quantify nor substantiate
its success without further evidence.</i>

277
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,293
<i>(phone rings)</i>

278
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,212
- Scully.
- The second officer is still in a coma...

279
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,299
...so I don't think we can count on him
to tell us what happened.

280
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:31,679
I'm going over these reports you faxed me.
They're incredible.

281
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:37,435
The military already sent troops through
radioactive clouds. They had to top that.

282
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:41,189
Sleep eradication doesn't explain
the shooting of those officers.

283
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,609
Or the anomalous autopsy results
on Willig and Dr Grissom.

284
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,279
I learnt at Grissom's clinic
what happens to a person's cortex...

285
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,698
...when you stimulate it with electricity.

286
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:55,578
They have visual and auditory hallucinations.
Any med student can tell you that.

287
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,332
What if that stimulus
were to come from a remote source?

288
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:03,419
What if Cole has developed the ability
to project his unconscious?

289
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,716
Are you suggesting Cole killed
those people with telepathic images?

290
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,720
Think about it, Scully.
In all those years without REM sleep...

291
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:18,017
...maybe Cole bridged the waking world and
the dream world - the collective unconscious.

292
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,771
And what if, by existing consciously
in the unconscious world...

293
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:26,693
...he's developed the ability to externalise
his dreams and effectively alter reality?

294
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,573
Even if you're right, you'll have
a better chance of finding Cole...

295
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,327
...if you work up a profile
and try and surmise his next move.

296
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:41,332
All right. I'll sharpen my pencils
and I'll see you later.

297
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,586
I'll be right there, Krycek.

298
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,424
- Where are you going?
- To check on another member of the squad.

299
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:53,720
- See if he can tell us something.
- Sounds like your new partner's working out.

300
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,807
He's all right. He could use
a little seasoning and wardrobe advice.

301
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,144
- He's more open to extreme possibilities...
- Than I was?

302
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,647
Than I assumed he would be.

303
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,985
Must be nice not having someone
questioning your every move...

304
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,279
...poking holes in all your theories.

305
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,448
Oh...Oh yeah. It... It's great.

306
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm surprised I put up with you for so long.

307
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,125
You'd better go.

308
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:28,546
I'll read over this report again
and see what else I can come up with.

309
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,672
OK.

310
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,689
<i>(country music on radio)</i>

311
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,741
Clear this up.

312
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,178
Salvatore Matola?

313
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,724
Are you here to shoot me?
You gonna kill me?

314
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,685
No. We're with the FBI.

315
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,355
We just wanted to ask you some questions.

316
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,358
Why did you think we were here to kill you?

317
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,529
- Idunno.
- You know about Willig and Grissom, huh?

318
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:41,410
I read about it in the paper.
Figured they were finally killing us all off.

319
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,955
Who?

320
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,669
Hey, Sal, can you spare a few minutes?

321
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:54,632
Yeah, I guess so. I got a break coming up.

322
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,642
Spare a few minutes. I guess.

323
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,693
They said it'd be like living two lifetimes.

324
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:17,488
And that... At first, that's what it was like.

325
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,075
Not having to sleep an' all...

326
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:25,329
...made us feel like
nothing could touch us, you know?

327
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,873
Uh...

328
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,584
We'd do 24-hour patrols...

329
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,462
...night ambushes, you know?
That type of thing.

330
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:38,050
- And you never got tired?
- No. Not so that we had to sleep.

331
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,221
And then, nothing that the pills couldn't fix.

332
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,433
- Serotonin?
- Yeah.

333
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,688
How long did this go on?

334
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,066
Quite a while, I'd say.

335
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:01,073
Quite a while. Until we stopped taking orders
from Company Commander in Saigon.

336
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,910
The entire squadron went AWOL?

337
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,081
Yeah. Something like that.

338
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,046
- Well, then who did you take orders from?
- We didn't.

339
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,132
We just made up missions as we went along.

340
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:22,219
Till it didn't matter any more
who we were killing.

341
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,681
Farmers... women.

342
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,810
Outside of Phu Bai there was this...

343
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,481
...school, and, uh...

344
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,405
They were just kids.

345
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,701
No one ever tried to stop you?

346
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,538
No, sir.

347
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:59,048
Police suspect Augustus Cole may be
behind the murders of Willig and Grissom.

348
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,258
You mean Preacher?

349
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:06,430
That's what we used to call him -
he was always reading from his Bible.

350
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:10,101
You know, saying this and that
about Judgment Day.

351
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:14,313
Saying that one day we were gonna
have to pay for what we were doing.

352
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:19,986
That's... that's what he said back then.
That's what he'd say.

353
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:24,865
But why Grissom? He was never in-country.
He wasn't even part of the squadron.

354
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,660
Sure he was.

355
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,621
He made us what we are.

356
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,294
- Him and Dr Girardi.
- Who's Dr Girardi?

357
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,799
The other doc on the project.
The one who did the surgeries on us.

358
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,303
It's because of him that...

359
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,266
...I haven't slept a night in 24 years.

360
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:02,737
<i>(Krycek)</i> I'm still not clear why
you think Cole will go after Girardi.

361
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,114
Cole sees himself as an avenging angel.

362
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,451
He thinks everyone
responsible for the atrocities...

363
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,203
...directly or indirectly, must be punished.

364
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,582
Yeah, but why now?
Why after all these years?

365
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:20,463
Phu Bai was one of the bloodiest massacres
of the war. Over 300 children slaughtered.

366
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,008
And unlike My Lai,
no US troops were ever charged.

367
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,303
The 24th anniversary of the massacre
was two days ago.

368
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,472
<i>(phone rings)</i>

369
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:34,268
- Mulder.
- I think I've found Francis Girardi.

370
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,812
He's a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard.

371
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:41,317
- Do you have his number in Boston?
- Yes. But he's coming to Grissom's funeral.

372
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,613
- When?
- Tonight. He arrives at Bronx station at 7.30.

373
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:49,950
Get a photograph to the security desk
so we know who we're looking for.

374
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,577
Got it.

375
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,586
- Mulder, FBI. You got a photo for me?
- Right here.

376
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,308
Stay here. I'll cover the other side.

377
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,651
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

378
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,154
Drop it!

379
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,256
Mulder.

380
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,467
You all right?

381
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:33,137
Girardi! Where is he?

382
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,222
Girardi's not here.

383
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,391
I saw him. He was...

384
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,769
Mulder!

385
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:45,608
You were shouting and waving your gun
around, but Girardi never showed.

386
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:50,154
No, Girardi was here. So was Cole.
We just missed them.

387
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,202
Mulder, if they'd been here,
I would have seen them.

388
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,163
I'm telling you, Mulder. They weren't here.

389
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,628
<i>(Mulder)</i> OK, there's nothing here
so let's rewind the tape.

390
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,924
Start with a small window of time -
say, 1935 to 1945.

391
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:14,261
If you don't find anything within that
time frame, open it up one minute at a time.

392
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:17,514
With all these cameras,
we should be able to see something.

393
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,683
Can we talk for a second?

394
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,897
What's the problem?

395
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,400
You still haven't answered
my question about what happened.

396
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:33,489
- I told you, I thought I saw Girardi.
- Come on. You just about killed someone!

397
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:38,369
And we both know I'm covering for you
by keeping it between us.

398
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:41,872
- All right, what do you want to know?
- Just the truth.

399
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:47,503
- There's things that I need to know.
- My ideas are usually not very popular.

400
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,090
I told you, I wanna believe.
But I need a place to start.

401
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:59,890
I think Cole possesses the psychic ability
to manipulate sounds and images...

402
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:03,727
...to generate illusions that
are so convincing they can kill.

403
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,146
How's that for a theory?

404
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:12,695
Puts a whole new spin on virtual reality,
but at least it begins to explain some things.

405
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,114
Agent Mulder?

406
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,787
- See this car in the upper-right corner?
- Yeah.

407
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,374
It wasn't there five minutes ago.

408
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,461
- Where is this?
- That's track 17.

409
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,630
It's a restricted part of the yard.

410
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,805
<i>(Girardi)</i> What are you doing?

411
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,974
This is insane!

412
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,727
You can't do this to me.

413
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:49,523
You can't hold me responsible.

414
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,860
I was following orders. Just like you.

415
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,279
The Lord hates the lying tongue.

416
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,448
It's the truth.

417
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,036
The truth is what you did to us.
What you made us do.

418
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:05,748
No one made you do anything.
You volunteered.

I can feel the air stinging on my skin.

455

What the military did to you was wrong.
But maybe your testimony can help.

456
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,199
They cut out a piece of my brain.

Went through my files, my computer.

Without that report as evidence, Skinner's
not gonna authorise an investigation.

Skinner?

is just the beginning.

476

That we've never been in greater danger.

477

Do you trust him?

478
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,915
- Do you know where he got this?
- Not yet.

he's either found another source...

You'll see that I've outlined
several countermeasures.

00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:30,150
- What about Scully?
- Reassigning them to other sections...

484
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,779

strengthened their determination.
