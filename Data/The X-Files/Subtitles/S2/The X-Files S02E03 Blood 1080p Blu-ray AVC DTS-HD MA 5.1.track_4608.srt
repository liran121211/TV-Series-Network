<i>(alarm)</i>

2
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,465
OW!

3
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,303
Hey,Ed?

4
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,474
- You OK?
- There's blood.

5
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,480
It's only a paper cut.

6
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,191
Uh, listen, Ed. I need to talk to you.

7
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:23,668
Ed, I... This is never easy.

8
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,630
And everybody down here
sure likes you a lot, Funschie.

9
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,968
And I know it's tough
cos you're new to this area.

10
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:35,388
Ed, I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna have to let you go.

11
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:40,518
I mean, your work is first-rate
and, like I said, you're a good guy.

12
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,313
But you know the story:
cutbacks and seniority.

13
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,525
And you're a low man on the pole.

14
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,864
Could I work part time?

15
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:01,372
The guys took up a collection today.

16
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,749
It's a hundred bucks.

17
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,715
Look, why don't you stay on
till the end of the week?

18
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,394
<i>(lift door opens)</i>

19
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,647
- Is there room here for me?
- I think we can make some.

20
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,858
Thank you.

21
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,872
<i>(woman)</i> Excuse me.

22
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,749
It's OK.

23
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,879
<i>(uneven breathing)</i>

24
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,536
- Hey, Ralph. How you doin'?
- All right.

25
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,705
Thanks for coming at short notice.

26
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,374
I realise the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit

27
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,461
mainly profiles murder suspects
still at large.

28
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:40,758
It must be odd being asked to profile
our suspects, all of whom are dead.

29
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:45,763
I am relieved the Bureau
answered our request and sent you.

30
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,976
In all honesty, Agent Mulder, whatever's
going on here is way over our heads.

31
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,945
The suspect's body is out on the sidewalk.

32
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,490
We're holding the security guard
who shot him.

33
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,701
The witnesses in the elevator
are down at the hospital.

34
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,287
Talk to them whenever you're ready.

35
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,879
I've asked all the businesses
in the building to close for the day.

36
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:24,176
We've done our best to preserve the area
for you. We've photographed the scene.

37
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:28,556
The area's been sketched,
but we haven't dusted for prints yet.

38
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,268
We wanted to wait for you
before collecting further evidence.

39
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,062
Was this damaged during the incident?

40
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,653
- I'll find out.
- May I see the suspect?

41
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,867
Things like this aren't
supposed to happen here.

42
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:52,746
A 42-year-old real-estate agent
murders four strangers?

43
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,582
That shouldn't happen anywhere.

44
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:58,502
Since colonial times there's only
been three murders in this area.

45
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:02,423
In the last six months,
seven people have killed 22.

46
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:06,176
Per capita, that's higher than
the combined homicide rate of Detroit,

47
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,470
DC and Los Angeles.

48
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,473
This town is not any of those places.

49
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,226
In Franklin, you never have to
pull off the road...

50
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:18,022
...to make way for a celebrity
driving with a gun to his head.

51
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,774
In each incident, the suspect was killed?

52
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,277
Suicide. By cop.

53
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,863
Each incident occurred in a public place.

54
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,949
The suspect went crazy
and refused to desist.

55
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,493
Officers used deadly force to save lives.

56
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,663
Were autopsies conducted
for substance abuse?

57
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:37,875
This town is mainly made up
of apple and cherry growers.

58
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,501
Folks here don't drink much.

59
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:43,964
They certainly don't do drugs.
The coroner's tests were negative.

60
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:49,053
<i>(radio) This is Dispatch. Can you provide
additional backup for unit 42?</i>

61
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,269
Played softball
with this guy over Labor Day.

62
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,567
He was one of those nice guys. Couldn't play
and didn't bitch about being in right field.

63
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,819
What's wrong with right field?

64
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:10,407
Always the first to shake hands at the end
of the game, whether he'd won or lost.

65
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,035
You gotta have an arm to play right field.

66
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:17,081
Bought a round of beers afterwards,
even though he didn't drink.

67
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,416
[played right field.

68
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,087
Let's have this analysed by the Bureau's lab.

69
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,007
What the hell could bring anyone to do this?

70
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:36,016
- <i>(child)</i> I wanna go home.
- <i>(mother)</i> Don't be in such a hurry.

71
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,269
You'll just have to wait
for the man to finish, OK?

72
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,650
- Mommy...
- Baby, you're bleeding.

73
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,778
Come on, tilt your head back.

74
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,447
I told you to leave it alone. OK?

75
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,702
Now, don't touch it or it'll bleed again.

76
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,954
Tilt your head back. There you go.

77
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,916
Lucky we had a Kleenex, eh?

78
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,127
Good girl.

79
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,954
Hey! Hey!

80
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,165
What the hell's wrong with you?

81
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,842
<i>(Mulder) Mass murderers
are divided into two classifications:</i>

82
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,719
<i>the spree killer and the serial.</i>

83
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,806
<i>The violent outburst in a public locale...</i>

84
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,101
<i>...and the suspect's disregard
for anonymity or survival...</i>

85
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:04,730
<i>...define the Franklin incidents
as spree killings.</i>

86
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:10,235
<i>The confounding element of these profiles
is that, given their backgrounds...</i>

87
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,946
<i>...the perpetrators would be, statistically...</i>

88
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,785
<i>...more likely the victims of violent crimes
rather than the originators.</i>

89
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:21,413
<i>The killers were all middle-income,
responsible people...</i>

90
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,208
<i>...none with a history of violence.</i>

91
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,545
<i>Relatives reported only minor
displays of dysfunctional behaviour:</i>

92
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,591
<i>...sleep disorders, headaches,
eating difficulties.</i>

93
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:38,388
<i>But witnesses did report the last suspect
displayed a claustrophobic reaction.</i>

94
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,687
<i>I'm convinced
an outside factor is responsible...</i>

95
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:50,108
<i>...but I must concede frustration
as to a determination of the cause.</i>

96
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:54,112
<i>A residue on the fingers of
the most recent perpetrator was analysed...</i>

97
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,948
<i>...and reported to be an undefined</i>

98
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,451
<i>but non-toxic organic chemical
found on plants...</i>

99
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,579
<i>...perhaps remaining from gardening.</i>

100
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:08,460
<i>There have been reported abductee
paranoia in UFO mass-abduction cases.</i>

101
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,629
I was wondering when you'd get to that.

102
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,132
<i>I find no evidence of this to be the case.</i>

103
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,593
<i>The single connecting trace evidence...</i>

104
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,848
<i>...is the destruction of
an electronic device at the crime scene.</i>

105
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,601
<i>A pager, a fax machine.</i>

106
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,147
<i>A cellular phone, a gas pump digital display.</i>

107
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,988
<i>In all honesty, Scully, We never had
a more difficult time developing a profile.</i>

108
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,117
<i>There is no way to know who will be a killer.</i>

109
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,287
<i>Or who will be killed.</i>

110
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,624
<i>(whistling and chinking)</i>

111
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,635
Hello?

112
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,892
Hello?

113
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,686
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

114
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,149
I called earlier.
A deadline came up at work.

115
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,486
If it's ready, I'll just
pay you and be out of here.

116
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,198
How did you manage
to break that, anyhow?

117
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,367
Oh, it's a long story.

118
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,245
- Did you fix it?
- It's fixed.

119
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,706
What do I owe you?

120
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:32,044
I'll tell you. In fixing that,
I found some other problems.

121
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,589
Serious problems, Mrs McRoberts.

122
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,717
Come back here. I'll show you.

123
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:45,849
I'm sorry... My husband's waiting for me.

124
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,936
- I have to go.
- OK.

125
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,023
But you ain't gonna go very far
unless you get this fixed.

126
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,399
Come here.

127
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,370
<i>(mechanic whistles)</i>

128
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,811
<i>(engine starts)</i>

129
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,649
This is a diagnostic test of your engine.

130
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:40,070
You're supposed to have an output
of 168 horses at 6200rpms.

131
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,573
You're nowhere near that.

132
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,537
Come over here.

133
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,082
Next to me. I want you to take a look at this.

134
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,170
Well, first of all, you're leaking oil like crazy.

135
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:01,008
Your throw rods are chattering,
valves need adjustment...

136
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,262
A couple of engine mounts
should be replaced.

137
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,351
To tell you the truth...

138
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,704
If you don't believe me, take a look here.

139
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,552
Aarghh!

140
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,600
Agent Mulder?
Larry Winter, county supervisor.

141
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,270
Uh, pardon my rubber.

142
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:22,524
Can you tell me if this murder
is more of the same?

143
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,152
They don't seem to be connected.

144
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,196
Well, should I be relieved or more scared?

145
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,408
I mean, is this the start of copycat killers?

146
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,661
Larry, it's not a copy
of the other homicides.

147
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:38,748
This wasn't a public area.
The suspect fled, covering his tracks.

148
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,962
The killer appears
not to have had a premeditated weapon.

149
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,757
They are connected.

150
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,511
- Mrs McRoberts?
- Yes.

151
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:56,516
This is Sheriff Spencer. I'm Agent
Fox Mulder with the FBI. May we come in?

152
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,768
- I'm late for work.
- You can blame me.

153
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:08,361
- Been having some car trouble?
- That's my husband's department.

154
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,155
May I speak with him?

155
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,033
He took the car to Pittsburgh for a meeting.

156
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:17,287
- Is it OK if I have my breakfast?
- It's the day's most important meal.

157
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:34,512
Um, this invoice was, uh, signed by you.

158
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,308
Did you pick up the car last night?

159
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,480
Yes.

160
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:56,368
Can you describe to me exactly how
the dashboard read-out was damaged?

161
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,705
Mrs McRoberts?

162
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,210
I did it.

163
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,005
- I broke it.
- Why?

164
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,344
Mrs McRoberts?

165
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,224
Did you see something in the read-out?

166
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,687
Mrs McRoberts?

167
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,609
I can help.

168
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,365
Mrs McRoberts?

169
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,036
- Stop!
- No!

170

171
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,054
<i>...that were undetected
in previous autopsies.</i>

172
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,558
<i>Levels of adrenaline are high
in cases of violent death...</i>

173
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,936
<i>...twice as much as in victims
of natural death.</i>

174
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,148
<i>This subject's levels were 200 times normal.</i>

175
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,694
<i>The adrenal gland displayed
extensive adrenal haemorrhage,</i>

176
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,404
<i>yet not from disease...</i>

177
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,365
<i>...but rather from wear.</i>

178
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:22,912
<i>Other physiological evidence present
indicated episodes of intense phobia.</i>

179
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,833
<i>Analysis of the vitreous humour,

180
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,878
<i>...indicated the presence

181
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,381
<i>of an undetermined chemical compound.</i>

182
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,258
<i>This compound, at its base...</i>

183
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:40,221
<i>...is similar to the substance analysed
earlier on a perpetrator's finger.</i>

184
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:44,100
<i>Although further qualitative
analysis must be performed...</i>

185
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:48,146
<i>...it is my opinion that this chemical,
when reacting with adrenaline...</i>

186
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,649
<i>...and other compounds
secreted during phobic episodes...</i>

187
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:56,488
<i>...creates a substance similar
to iysergic acid diethylamidez...</i>

188
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,656
<i>...LSD.</i>

189
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,879
Pardon me. I'd like to apply for a job.

190
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,299
Sorry. They're not accepting
applications at this time.

191
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,829
Sir, may we ask you
to sign up for the blood drive?

192
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,584
Are you all right?

193
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,004
Sir?

194
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,937
<i>(insects buzz)</i>

195
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,706
Hmm.

196
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,377
In our April edition of The <i>Lone Gunman,</i>

197
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,922
we ran an article
on the CIA's new CCDTH-2138...

198
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,591
...fibreoptic-lens micro-video camera.

199
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,636
Small enough to be
placed on the back of a fly.

200
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,722
Imagine being a fly
on the wall of the Oval Office.

201
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,016
Been there. Done that.

202
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,352
That is a Eurasian cluster fly.

203
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,397
They infest vegetation
like apples or cherries

204
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,816
and can inflict a lot of damage to crops.

205
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,610
It's been irradiated to control propagation.

206
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:26,030
Or... agents of competing
agricultural corporations...

207
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:32,120
...posing as Franklin City employees, are
releasing fertile flies to destroy the crop.

208
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,414
No. This bug's been nuked.

209
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,749
It was a fine effort, though.

210
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,962
Have you ever come across
this chemical compound?

211
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,131
LSDM?

212
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:47,218
Obviously you haven't read
our August edition of <i>TLG.</i>

213
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:52,765
Oh, I'm sorry, boys. It arrived the same day
as my subscription to Celebrity Skin.

214
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,934
Come over here.

215
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:06,070
- So, Mulder, where's your little partner?
- She wouldn't come.

216
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:10,408
- She's afraid of her love for you.
- She's tasty.

217
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,911
Frohike, it's men like you
that give perversion a bad name.

218
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,873
Here. Toxic pesticides.

219
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,294
The chemical in that report
is called Iysergic dimethrin...

220
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:25,173
...an unreleased experimental
synthetic botanical insecticide.

221
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,885
- It acts as a natural pheromone.
- LSDM is sprayed on the plant...

222
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:33,598
...which invokes a fear response in the pest:
"Get out of here. There's danger."

223
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:37,060
- The insect leaves the plant.
- Why won't they release it?

224
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,021
Is it possible it affects
humans in the same way?

225
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,440
Possible?

226
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,609
Let me show you something.

227
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,572
This is actual newsreel
footage taken in the '508.

228
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:55,453
They're spraying DDT, a chemical the
government did release and determine safe.

229
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,331
30 years later they found out
women exposed to it

230
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,500
had higher rates of breast cancer.

231
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,462
They convinced local officials
it was safe to spray on children.

232
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,674
It took a decade
of bureaucratic and industry heel-dragging

233
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,927
before it was banned.

234
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,262
Different chemicals. Same stunts.

235
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,015
They just learned how not to be so obvious.

236
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,143
Hey, Frohike, can I borrow those?

237
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,521
If I can have Scully's phone number.

238
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,368
<i>(distant rumbling)</i>

239
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,998
<i>(rumbling)</i>

240
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,272
Stealth helicopters?

241
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,609
Experimental pesticides
responsible for violent behaviour?

242
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,362
I saw the chopper from two
different locations. Look at my skin.

243
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,157
Feel my hair. The insecticide is still on me.

244
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,785
I've checked up on you.

245
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:02,246
You have a penchant for "spooky" evidence.

246
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,042
- Don't start that crap. Don't divert blame.
- Hang on a second...

247
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,252
If you're the one who's responsible...

248
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:12,256
...the sooner you take responsibility,
the sooner people will stop dying.

249
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,802
The killers all resided
near heavily sprayed areas.

250
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:21,599
You don't live here, Mulder.
I live here. I have my heart in this town.

251
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:25,019
I have three children.
I'm not gonna dump poison on them.

252
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,189
Yeah, well, if it's so safe,
why was it done in secret?

253
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:33,069
- What kind of a crusade are you on?
- Answer the question. Are we spraying?

254
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:41,202
This county lives on money
generated from its crops.

255
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,538
Irradiated flies were not effective.

256
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:47,625
The delays to get approval would
have caused millions in crop damage.

257
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,545
Look at the hell they raised over Malathion.

258
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:54,549
Meanwhile, people's lives were
being ruined by a damn bug.

259
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:58,719
Ruined? 23 people are dead.

260
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:03,140
There's no proof the spray caused
violent behaviour. It was proven safe.

261
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,852
By who? Who proved it to you?

262
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,653
<i>(door closes)</i>

263
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,322
I'm sorry, Mulder, he's right.

264
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,784
I'd love to say I flew 300 miles
in the middle of the night...

265
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:25,246
...to prove you're about to become
the next Charles Manson.

266
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,374
But I find little physiological evidence...

267
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:33,296
...that states that LSDM has toxically
affected you, even after massive ingestion.

268
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,924
Your own autopsy says
the killer had chemical anomalies.

269
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:42,096
Yes, but you are proof that
it wasn't from exposure to LSDM.

270
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,557
May I see that chart, Agent Scully?

271
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,642
Sure.

272
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,812
Look here. These are normal...

273
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,657
<i>(Scully)</i> ..perhaps subjected
to repeated LSDM spraying.

274
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,745
Scully, are you familiar
with subliminal messages?

275
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:10,082
You mean like... sex and
ice cubes in liquor ads?

276
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,418
- That's paranoia.
- No, it's a fact.

277
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:17,006
Stores use subliminal messages in
their ambient music to deter shoplifting.

278
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:21,969
The Russians use electro-encephalographic
techniques to control behaviour.

279
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:28,726
- How is this connected with the spraying?
- Electronic devices were always destroyed.

280
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,687
- I'm still waiting.
- The insecticide LSDM...

281
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,065
...is known to cause fear in cluster flies.

282
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,109
What if it causes the same reaction
in humans?

283
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,945
All the perpetrators were phobic.

284
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:43,324
Taber was claustrophobic. McRoberts's
husband said she had a fear of rape.

285
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:47,328
The insecticide heightened
their phobia to an unbearable level.

286
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,580
The electronic devices relayed messages

287
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:52,667
that told them what to do
in order to alleviate it.

288
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,712
- The messages were relayed purposely.
- By who?

289
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,232
He's probably one of those people
that thinks Elvis is dead.

290
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:21,404
Mulder, I was wrong. Exposure to
the insecticide does induce paranoia.

291
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:26,283
I think this area is being subjected
to a controlled experiment.

292
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,453
Controlled by who? By the government?

293
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,914
By a corporation? By Reticulans?

294
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,541
They've done it before.

295
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:37,712
DDT in the '50s, Agent Orange,
germ warfare on unsuspecting areas.

296
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:43,134
Yes, but why, Mulder? Why intentionally
create a populace that destroys itself?

297
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,219
Feat

298
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:49,890
It's the oldest tool of power. If you're
distracted by fear of those around you...

299
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,644
...it keeps you from seeing
the actions of those above.

300
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,567
I just had a talk with Mr Winter.

301
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,194
I've persuaded him to a compromise.

302
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,156
He's agreed to stop the spraying...

303
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:09,326
...and to blood testing extensively
of people exposed to the spray area.

304
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:10,619
But?

305
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,331
But the official explanation for the testing

306
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,959
cannot be linked
to the side effects of LSDM.

307
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,051
<i>Franklin and Venango Counties

308

00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,044
The blood test.

338
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:33,465
I know what he's afraid of.

339
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,801
And I know where he's going.

340
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,315
Hey, wait. Stop! Stop!

341
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,734
Stop! Hey!

342
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,154
All right, all right. Hold on a second.

343
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,074
Thank you.

344
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,398
- Pardon me.
- Wait for the next stop.

345
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:34,526
- Please, I'm on the wrong bus.
- Wait for the next stop.

346
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,446
Open the door! Open the door!

347
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,323
Open the door, dammit!

348
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,999
<i>(radio) C-1, this is X-ray-4.
Negative on that north-south line.</i>

349
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,542
Copy that.

350
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,212
If he's on it, it's gonna be this line.

351
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,800
- Here it comes.
- Get the uniforms out of sight.

352
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,670
Have you seen this man?

353
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:39,133
I picked him up.
Drove four feet and he went apewire.

354
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,511
- Where'd you let him out?
- Near the college.

355
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:47,015
- We'll have to wait him out.
- I don't think <i>he's</i> waiting.

356
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,784
- Scully, anything?
- Nothing.

357
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,913

359

Get down! Get down!

360

<i>(loudspeaker) Everybody remain calm.

361

<i>Stay down.</i>

00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,721
<i>Take cover.</i>

363
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:50,198
I've seen that. I've seen that and
I don't want to see that again, baby.

364

Put it down!

369
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,981
Put it down!

370
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:08,276
- Don't kill me.
- Then put it down, Ed.

371
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:12,280
I can't. They won't let me.

372
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:15,534
I know they won't, Ed.
I know they won't let you.

373
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,622
Then...

374
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,502
You make me put it down, then.

375
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,965
You do it.

376
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,802
If you don't put it down...

377
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,389
...I'm gonna have to shoot you.

378
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,476
Or you're gonna have to shoot me.

379
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,401
There's gonna be blood everywhere.

380
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,197
Oh... Ah.

381
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,665
Agh!

382
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,183
- Don't kill me.
- It's all right.

383
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,827
Agent Scully will
examine him at the hospital.

384
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:44,080
I want unrestricted access
to him for questioning.

385
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:48,376
Mulder, you know more about
what happened to him than he does.

<i>Mulder, where are you?</i>

392
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:37,425
<i>Mulder?</i>

00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,803
<i>Mulder, where are you?</i>
