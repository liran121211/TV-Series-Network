1
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:09,970
- They were to check in at midnight.
- You try every band?

2
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,266
- All audiovisual seemed to be down.
- Maybe it's just a satellite glitch.

3
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:19,438
We thought so too, until we received this...
from a tracking station in Bend, Oregon.

4
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,191
They picked it up
on an emergency frequency.

5
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:28,280
What are those guys doing?

6
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:33,952
We did manage to uplink
Firewalker's video camera.

7
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:38,207
It's at base camp, so we hope it can
give us a picture, tell us what's going on.

8
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:41,001
Data feed's coming in now.

9
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:50,677
- What's the robot doing in the volcano?
- I don't know.

10
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,846
There's no descent scheduled.

11
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:56,683
Firewalker's not responding.
I can't get control.

12
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:00,854
- Someone's overriding it.
- Lock camera remote and pan left.

13
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,653
Stop. Stop!

14
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,905
Go back.

15
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,243
Tilt up and zoom in.

16
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,540
Eflkson.

17
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,335
What the hell...? Give me that!

18
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:32,719
There it is again. Did you see that?
You saw that shadow, didn't you?

19
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:36,348
Yeah, but what could be moving around
in that kind of heat?

20
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,058
I don't know.

21
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:44,856
Maybe it was, uh, just a ghost signal.
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time that...

22
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:48,777
<i>(high-pitched distortion)</i>

23
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,869
What's going on up there?

24
00:02:55,427 --> 00:03:01,183
<i>(TV) Let's go to our science editor Eric
Parker in Mount Avalon, Washington. Eric?</i>

25
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:04,144
<i>I'm standing here
with a group of scientists...</i>

26
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,857
<i>...who are excited about this device,
which looks like a large titanium bug.</i>

27
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,487
<i>Firewalker will next week make
its first descent into an active volcano.</i>

28
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:17,032
<i>This robot is the brainchild
of volcanologist Daniel Trepkos.</i>

29
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,409
<i>It will gather samples
from the crater...</i>

30
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:22,829
<i>...which may hold scientific data
about the Earth's core.</i>

31
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:25,374
<i>Scientific data?</i>

32
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:28,919
<i>We're talking about revisiting
the very origin of the Earth.</i>

33
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,630
<i>Peering into the fire where it all began.</i>

34
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:37,469
<i>A human endeavour more important even
than man's exploration of space.</i>

35
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:42,224
That's no mean claim.

36
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:45,143
Daniel always had a flair
for self-dramatisation.

37
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,981
- I'd always heard that he was brilliant.
- Brilliant doesn't go quite far enough.

38
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,692
He occupies a rare place
among scientists...

39
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:56,947
...where dreams, ambition and...
great luck converge.

40
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,782
You think his luck just ran out.

41
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:04,788
The team sent a distress signal yesterday
after failing to make a status report.

42
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,582
They haven't responded to any of our calls.

43
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:12,295
But by using remote telemetry,
we were able to activate Firewalker's camera.

44
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,506
This is what we found.

45
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,551
You're looking at the floor of the volcano.

46
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:21,847
But this is the last thing
we expected to discover.

47
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,184
The dead man is, uh, Phil Erikson...
chief seismologist.

48
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,105
Now, look at this.

49
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:34,860
Whoa! What the hell is that?

50
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,238
<i>(sighs) We don't know.</i>

51
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,699
Whatever it was disabled the camera.

52
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:45,162
The temperature readings
are upwards of 130° at this depth.

53
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,664
- But that was alive.
- Why weren't you there?

54
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:52,419
<i>(sighs)</i> I left the project six weeks ago.
Trepkos and I nearly came to blows.

55
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,840
- Over what?
- Well, I wish I could explain.

56
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,301
Daniel and I, uh...

57
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:06,475
I always played Salieri to his Mozart.
I was never quite on his plane of intellect.

58
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,768
But this time I found him slipping.

59
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:11,229
Into madness.

60
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,817
- He controlled the others...
- You think he's responsible for this?

61
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:19,070
Whatever there is between me and him,
I pray that he isn't.

62
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:24,117
We've got 20 million tax dollars
in this project. If word of it were to get out...

63
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:28,288
...it could destroy years of work.
I'm afraid to go through proper channels.

64
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,500
Yeah. We're not exactly proper channels.

65
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,130
- How soon can we get up there?
- There's a flight waiting to take us to Seattle.

66
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:40,759
From there, a helicopter
will fly us to Mount Avalon.

67
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,221
Scully?

68
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:49,100
- I don't think it's a good idea for you to go.
- Mulder, I appreciate your concern...

69
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,479
...but I'm ready - I wanna work.

70
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,982
Well, maybe you should take some time off.

71
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,277
I've already lost too much time.

72
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,294
There it is!

73
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,905
This was Firewalker's satellite relay.

74
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,952
We installed field instruments here.
Seismographs, tiltmeters...

75
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:33,496
We'll look here after we've checked inside.

76
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,960
The instruments are worth millions of project
dollars. I'm accountable to the USGS for 'em.

77
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:43,757
- Shouldn't we find the descent team first?
- I just wanna take a quick damage survey.

78
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,384
I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.

79
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,322
Hello?

80
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,241
<i>(flicks light switch)</i>

81
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:45,360
Looks like somebody wanted to put this
operation permanently out of commission.

82
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,190
<i>(grunts)</i>

83
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:13,031
Mulder!

84
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:16,201
- Wait! Wait!
- What's going on?

85
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:19,954
- This isn't what it looks like!
- He just about took my head off.

86
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:24,083
I told you, I made a mistake, OK?
I'm sorry, all right?

87
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,962
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm... I'm Ludwig. I'm Jason Ludwig.

88
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:31,841
- I'm the robotics engineer.
- Do you always greet people this way?

89
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:35,386
I heard a noise. I thought it was him.
I was protecting myself.

90
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,263
You know, self-preservation?

91
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:41,518
Who did you think I was that you thought
you had to protect yourself?

92
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,728
Trepkos.

93
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:56,783
Sometimes he wouldn't talk to us for days.
Then, boom! You couldn't get him to shut up.

94
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,952
Don't get me wrong, OK?

95
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:01,830
No one revered the man more than me.

96
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:04,916
I mean... he was a prophet...

97
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,502
...an oracle.

98
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:09,295
He saw things.

99
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,007
L-I... I mean, he...
he saw things that you and me...

100
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,219
...we only dream about...

101
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,430
...and then forget when we wake up.

102
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,818
Well, it's OK, you can come out now.
The cavalry's here.

103
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:39,826
This is Peter Tanaka, our systems analyst.

104
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,704
<i>(Tanaka coughs)</i>

105
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:48,459
And, uh, this is Jesse O'Neil.

106
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:52,297
Are you the rescue team?

107
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,216
- No, we're With the FBI.
- FBI?

108
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:58,219
But you're taking us back, right?

109
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:02,390
- After we've investigated what happened.
- Trepkos is what happened.

110
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:05,810
- Did he kill Erikson?
- He flipped out.

111
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:10,273
Right after the descent, he just flipped out.

112
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:14,777
Can you think of anything that might've
caused or contributed to his behaviour?

113
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:18,364
- You're asking me?
- Daniel was sick.

114
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:23,786
He had a bipolar disorder.
I think that's what it was.

115
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,291
It wasn't a secret, but it's not
something he advertised either.

116
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,085
But with his medication he was just fine.

117
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:35,673
Well, I think Erikson's wife
might disagree with that.

118
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,386
You're part of the team, Jesse?

119
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:46,059
Daniel was my thesis advisor
at the university.

120
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,354
He asked me to assist him on this project.

121
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,776
- Are these his notes?
- Oh... yeah.

122
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,946
Well, whatever's left of 'em.

123
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,991
First thing he did was
destroy all his own work.

124
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:05,453
You know, his field journals,
his computer disks.

125
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,290
We salvaged what we could, but...

126
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:12,418
...I don't really think
you'll find much in there.

127
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,879
Of use, anyway.

128
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:44,242
- <i>(bird takes flight)</i>
- Hello?

129
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,954
Anyone there?

130
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:03,511
Scully.

131
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:12,395
What d'you make
of Mr Trepkos's neighbourhood?

132
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:16,858
- What d'you mean?
- Isn't their behaviour bizarre? Paranoid?

133
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:21,571
- After what they've been through, no.
- They're practically climbing the walls.

134
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,615
They've been living in
the middle of nowhere for a year.

135
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:27,410
One is dead, probably
at the hands of another.

136
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:31,039
You have to expect some heightened level
of emotional distress.

137
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:34,542
It's more than that. There's
something they're not telling us.

138
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,919
Based on what?

139
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:40,465
Based on when Ludwig
tried to play T-ball with my head.

140
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,009
He knew I wasn't Trepkos.

141
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:48,431
- Now Mulder, you're sounding paranoid.
- Pierce knows these people.

142
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,517
Let's find out what he thinks.

143
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,519
OK.

144
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,006
No one... can leave.

145
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,594

<i>(Ludwig) Pierce!</i>

<i>- (O'Neil) Something's happened!
- (Tanaka) Oh, my God!</i>

150
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:47,240
Get over here. He's over here!
I've found him! I've found him!

151
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:50,201
I've found him!

152
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:58,417
- That should do it.
- What shall we do with the body?

153
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,211
- Do you have a freezer?
- Yeah.

154
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,965
- Radio for the helicopter. I'm almost done.
- Let me help you.

155
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,467
No, that's OK, we got him.

156
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,851
- We can't leave, Scully. Not yet.
- Why not?

157
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:18,437
- Trepkos is still out there.
- He killed Pierce and probably Erikson.

158
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:21,482
- We should come back with a larger party.
- No.

159
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,488
I've been going over Trepkos's work. I found
references to a subterranean organism.

160
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:30,324
- What?
- An organism existing within the volcano.

161
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:32,660
No specific description...

162
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,538
Mulder, nothing can live
in a volcanic interior.

163
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:39,417
Not only because of the intense heat,
but the gasses would be toxic.

164
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,919
What does this say?

165
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:47,717
It describes the metabolism from
hydrogen sulphide into silicon dioxide.

166
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,719
A silicon-based life form?

167
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:53,472
The basic building block for every
organism known to man is carbon.

168
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:58,227
- From bacterium to redwood trees.
- Silicon is the closest element to carbon.

169
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:02,732
It reacts identically with other elements -
it combines to form complex molecules.

170
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:06,485
A silicon-based life form is one of
the holy grails of modern science.

171
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:07,904
Maybe Trepkos found it.

172
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:13,284
Mulder, that is science fiction. It's... an
elaborate construct from a delusional mind.

173
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,578
This doesn't prove anything.

174
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:19,332
Trepkos said he had evidence.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

175
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:25,213
- Whatever evidence he had, he destroyed.
- Maybe it wasn't Trepkos who destroyed it.

176
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:29,050
- What if it was one of the others?
- Why would they do that?

177
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,347
All of these people are suffering to
varying degrees from post-traumatic stress.

178
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:40,186
And from a medical point of view, we have to
get them out of here sooner rather than later.

179
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,239
<i>(knock at door)</i>

180
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,158
Jesse?

181
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,495
Can I talk to you?

182
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,670
Are you OK?

183
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,591
I hate this place.

184
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,844
What happened here, Jesse?

185
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,516
You can trust me.

186
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,104
After the first descent...

187
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,273
...Daniel changed.

188
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:27,650
He became withdrawn and paranoid.

189
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,946
He locked himself in the lab
for three days and wouldn't let any of us in.

190
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,824
Do you think the descent
triggered his breakdown?

191
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:37,118
Well, that's what I thought.

192
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,037
And then... I found out...

193
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,292
...that he's not taking his pills.

194
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,379
Lithium carbonate.

195
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,590
Yeah, he said that
they were polluting his brain.

196
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:54,635
And... he said I was polluting his body.

197
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,434
I'm scared.

198
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,229
- I don't wanna die here.
- What are you so afraid of, Jesse?

199
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:07,565
Daniel.

200
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:14,322
The only reason I even came here
was because of him.

201
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:19,910
He promised me
that this would be an adventure.

202
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,623
That it would change my life.

203
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:34,675
But eight months is a long time,
and I just wanna go home now.

204
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,844
Where's home?

205
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,847
Anywhere but here.

206
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:50,358
<i>(Trepkos on tape) Samples 7, 12 and 22 also
contain trace evidence of the organism.</i>

207
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:55,654
<i>The possibility of this new,
or perhaps unfathomably old, life form...</i>

208
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,160
...has <i>left me sleepless, wondering
if I haven't lost all perspective.</i>

209
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:08,292
<i>If my intense desire to find the truth
hasn't finally eclipsed the truth itself.</i>

210
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:13,631
<i>Our meddling intellect misshapes
the beauteous forms of things.</i>

211
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,800
<i>We murder to dissect.</i>

212
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:21,222
<i>My mind is a tangled knot
I can no longer untie.</i>

213
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:26,060
<i>Daily, I fight the urge to sever it completely
to stop this descent.</i>

214
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,366
<i>(tremor)</i>

215
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,873
What caused that tremor?

216
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:52,336
There's been a lot of seismic activity
in the northeast rift zone.

217
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,341
If Trepkos hadn't destroyed our instruments,
we might have learned something from it.

218
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,927
- (coughs)
- You feeling all right?

219
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,432
Yeah.

220
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:07,810
Agent Scully's a medical doctor.
Let her take a look at you.

221
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,104
- I'm fine.
- Just let her take a look...

222
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,605
No!

223
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:18,362
I'll go get Scully.

224
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:25,161
- Come on, get up. She'll help you.
- I don't want her to!

225
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,122
Of course you do! It's for the best.

226
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,875
We have to get out of here.

227
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,921
He just collapsed after the tremor.
He seems pretty bad.

228
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,968
- He's burning up.
- What is it?

229
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,930
An infection or a toxic reaction.
We've gotta get him to a hospital.

230
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:48,476
- I'll get a stretcher.
- We can't just leave Trepkos.

231
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,978
Give me the shortwave.

232
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:59,487
This is Agent Scully with the Firewalker
team. Come in, Search and Rescue.

233
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,782
I'll get O'Neil
and meet you at the landing site.

234
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,534
<i>This is Search and Rescue.</i>

235
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,704
Request dispatch of medevac immediately.

236
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:12,791
We have an Asian male, mid-thirties,
spiking a high-grade fever.

237
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,589
<i>(choking)</i>

238
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,438
<i>(knock at door)</i>

239
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:37,316
Tanaka's collapsed. We're getting him out.

240
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,705
<i>(groans)</i>

241
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,000
- Tanaka!
- Peter!

242
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,670
Peter, come on, get back here!

243
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,666
There.

244
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,421
<i>(choking)</i>

245
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,673
- Come on.
- Don't go down there!

246
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:46,510
- Let me go! What're you doing? Let go of me!
- Don't go down there.

247
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:49,179
For God's sakes, he needs our help!

248
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,588
So what is it, Scully?
What are we dealing with?

249
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:25,924
Without better imaging equipment,
I can't say for sure.

250
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,510
I'll take any theory you've got.

251
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:33,140
- It appears to be some kind of a fungus.
- Anything you recognise?

252
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:38,395
Well, I'm not a botanist, but I think it's
fair to guess that it's an unknown genus.

253
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,357
- What am I looking at here?
- Spores.

254
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,401
I scraped them off the tip of the fungus.

255
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:51,283
It appears as if one of the spores grew inside
Tanaka until it reached reproductive maturity.

256
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,452
Essentially outgrowing its host.

257
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:58,791
But by then it had caused massive tissue
damage, particularly to the respiratory tract.

258
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:02,670
- That accounts for the sand in his lungs.
- You found sand in his lungs?

259
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:06,965
Silicon dioxide. The waste product
of a silicon-based organism.

260
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:12,638
Wait a second. There... there's no such thing
as a silicon-based organism.

261
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,099
Maybe now there is.

262
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:19,603
But we won't have proof until
we determine its molecular structure.

263
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:22,606
Come on. How else do you explain
the sand in his lungs?

264
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,985
It's the best trace evidence
we could ask for. Trepkos was right.

265
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,988
Daniel knew about this?

266
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:33,659
He discovered a spore
in the samples Firewalker brought up.

267
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,160
He would've told us.

268
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:39,915
Not if what he discovered was
too disturbing even for him to understand.

269
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:44,795
This might explain something else.
The spore could explain Trepkos's dementia.

270
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,881
Fungi contain alkaloids
that affect the nervous system.

271
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,760
Yeah, but what about us?
I mean... we weren't exposed.

272
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:56,557
We don't know that. If it was an airborne
microbe, any of us could've inhaled a spore.

273
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:58,976
So we're not going home, right?

274
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,396
Not until we know how it's transmitted,
how it incubates.

275
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:07,651
If even one of us is infected, we could risk
infecting a much larger population.

276
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:18,120
Search and Rescue, this is
Agent Mulder. Do you copy?

277
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,373
<i>This is Search and Rescue.
We're in a holding pattern. Over.</i>

278
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:27,463
Notify FBI District HQ in Spokane that we're
in quarantine due to possible contagion.

279
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,841
Have CDC send up an evacuation unit
on high alert.

280
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,427
<i>What's the nature of the contagion?</i>

281
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,806
<i>Agent Mulder?</i>

282
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,644
Tell them it's a biological agent...
of unknown origin.

283
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,022
<i>That's affirmative. Standing by.</i>

284
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,777
Maybe you should go check up on O'Neil.

285
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,465
I'm gonna go find Trepkos.

286
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:19,431
- What if he's already dead?
- He'll find it tough answering my questions.

287
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,892
I've gotta find out what he knows.

288
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:25,771
It could change our understanding
of the origin and evolution of life.

289
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:29,316
He's dangerous, Mulder.
He's already killed two men.

290
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:33,237
- Then I have to find out why.
- Will you at least let me go with you?

291
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,613
No.

292
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:39,159
Look, I know what you're thinking,
but you have to get past that. We both do.

293
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:42,663
I'm back... and I'm not going anywhere.

294
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:46,792
You have to finish the autopsy on Tanaka.

295
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:52,256
Hopefully that'll give us a better idea
of what we're dealing with - whatever it is.

296
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,468
I'm counting on you to keep us all
from ending up on that slab.

297
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,869
- Do like we said, OK?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

298
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:24,121
You know what to say, right?

299
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,625
I could use a little help.

300
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,461
Excuse me.

301
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,759
- So what do you need?
- Directions, a contour map, USGS survey.

302
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,345
Anything that can help me get here.

303
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,640
Oh.

304
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,312
These are the steam caves.

305
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:53,358
They feed into the Sherman Crater.
That's how we access the caldera.

306
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:56,069
- How did you get these?
- Firewalker.

307
00:28:56,153 --> 00:29:01,158
They were transmitted right before
Trepkos destroyed his camera.

308
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,784
Oh!

309
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,704
So you're finally gonna go after Trepkos?

310
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,876
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

311
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,921
You won't find him with those.

312
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:18,216
- And you won't find him with any map either.
- How will I find him?

313
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,385
You won't.

314
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,349
- Not without a guide.
- A guide?

315
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,602
Yeah, a guide.
I've been up here for almost a year.

316
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,104
I spent months in those caves...

317
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:35,609
...charting every fissure, every crevice,
so Firewalker wouldn't trip.

318
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,695
If Trepkos is there, I can find him.

319
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,532
- Why are you so eager to help me find him?
- Oh, I'm... I'm not eager.

320
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:48,872
I just don't want to wait around for Trepkos to
do to me what he did to Pierce and Erikson.

321
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:51,291
Plus, you've got the gun.

322
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:56,588
You're the only one
who can get us out of this place.

323
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,610
Whatever I'm smelling, is it toxic?

324
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:24,116
Between the heat and the sulphur, it can get
pretty nasty in here. But it won't hurt you.

325
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,576
You'll get used to it.

326
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:33,625
- How far does the cave extend?
- Three quarters of a mile, to the crater rim.

327
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,587
Let's head in.

328
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:43,176
It twists around quite a bit
till you get there. Lots of dead ends...

329
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,680
...and blind drops.

330
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:51,601
Unless you know where you're going,
you're... like a rat in a maze.

331
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,030
Argh! Argh!

332
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,449
Argh!

333
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,480
Your gun.

334
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,486
Back. Get back.

335
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,621
Why are you doing this, Trepkos?
He's already dead.

336
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,999
How many times do you have to kill him?

337
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,758
It's not him I'm trying to kill.

338
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:44,756
I have attempted to culture the spore, using
temperatures ranging from human basal...

339
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:48,260
...to those approximating
the volcanic interior.

340
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:51,805
I have used nutritive mediums containing...

341
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:56,726
...human tissue, blood and saliva.
Even sulphur.

342
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,312
However, none of the seven trials...

343
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:03,608
...have successfully grown
the fungus that killed Tanaka.

344
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:09,072
Based on this preliminary data,
I have come to the following hypothesis:

345
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:14,995
...That unless the spores are ingested
or inhaled by the host organism...

346
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,998
...immediately upon their release...

347
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,375
...they become harmless...

348
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,669
...effectively dead.

349
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,595
Jesse?

350
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,144
<i>(Jesse) What is it?</i>

351
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:43,607
I thought you'd like to know - the chances
are good that none of us were infected.

352
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,483
<i>(choking)</i>

353
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:51,281
We were a safe distance from Tanaka. When
Mulder and Ludwig come back, we can leave.

354
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:55,619
I... I just need to run a few more tests,
but I think we're gonna be OK.

355
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,124
Ow. Oooh.

356
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,045
OK, Jesse? Jesse?

357
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,302
<i>(Mulder) What went wrong, Trepkos'?</i>

358
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:18,683
Firewalker carried something back
to the surface.

359
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,646
Firewalker brought up an elephant.

360
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,775
The truth...

361
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:30,403
...is an elephant described by three blind men.

362
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,659
The first man touches the tail
and says it's a rope.

363
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:40,997
The second man feels the rough leg
and says it's a tree.

364
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:45,835
The third man feels the trunk
and says it's a snake.

365
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:49,172
What about you? What do you say it is?

366
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:55,345
I say the earth holds some truths
best left buried.

367
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:58,181
Like the spore?

368
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,523
- Who are you?
- I'm Special Agent Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

369
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,317
You don't look like a policeman.

370
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:12,487
I came down here to investigate
Erikson's death.

371
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,073
That's not why you're here.

372
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:22,205
You still believe you can petition heaven
and get some penetrating answer.

373
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,042
If you found that answer...

374
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,880
...what would you do with it?

375
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:38,638
I just wanna know what happened
after the first descent.

376
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,976
What did you find?

377
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:50,108
It was porous...

378
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,322
...obsidian.

379
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,536
Erikson thought it was some sort of rock,
so I told him to pulverise it for analysis.

380
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,290
- Erikson released the spore?
- He discovered a new life form.

381
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:09,878
In a single moment, all that science
held sacred suddenly turned on its head.

382
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:16,009
- What about Erikson? If... if he was infected...
- I was too immersed in the work to notice.

383
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:22,140
I'd been alone in the lab for three days...
when I heard their screams.

384
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:28,104
They were all gathered around him.

385
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:34,027
By the time I realised what was happening,
they were already changing.

386
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,656
The spore... grew in each of them
until it became...

387
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,159
What do you mean?

388
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,579
It's a parasite.

389
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:47,540
It lives to find a host.

390
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,377
- But you weren't infected?
- No.

391
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:54,255
You destroyed your work, the equipment.

392
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,384
You killed Pierce... so no one could leave.

393
00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:00,303
No one can leave.

394
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:08,645
What about O'Neil?

395
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,522
Jesse?

396
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:15,026
- Was she exposed to the spore?
- They were all exposed.

397
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:21,658
- All of them.
- I have a colleague, a friend...

398
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,994
...who's with O'Neil right now.

399
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:29,165
- Let me go to her.
- She may already be infected.

400
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:37,841
I can't let you leave.

401
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,761
Then you're gonna have to shoot me.

402
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:45,098
Because I'm walking outta here.

403
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,603
Jesse?

404
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,746
Oh!

405
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,249
God, you scared me!

406
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,878
- <i>(laboured breathing)</i>
- Jesse?

407
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,881
<i>- Are you OK'?
- (choking)</i>

408
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,967
Jesse, what's wrong? Jesse?

409
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:07,805
Jesse, what are you doing?

410
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,434
<i>(choking)</i>

411
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,948
<i>(laboured breathing)</i>

412
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,828
<i>(choking)</i>

413
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:48,281
Scully?

414
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:51,826
Scully?

415
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,037
I'm OK. I'm OK.

416
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,960
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

417
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,561
Yeah.

418
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:24,108
Mulder, look...

419
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:28,613
...she was infected. I don't know how.

420
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,074
Erikson was the original host.

421
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:35,578
When the fungus shed its spores, everyone
was at ground zero, except for Trepkos.

422
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,997
Did you find him?

423
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:08,277
I told her... it would change her life.

424
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:23,835
Search and Rescue,
this is Agent Mulder. Do you copy?

425
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,463
<i>This is Army Biohazard.
How many are in your party?</i>

426
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:37,807
We have two survivors -
Agent Scully and myself.

427
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,477
<i>Copy that. Our ETA is seven minutes.</i>

428
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:46,357
Mulder, what are you doing?
They're gonna wanna question him.

429
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,986
It's all over, Scully.

430
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,156
He won't talk.

431
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:10,131
<i>Scully and I are in the third day
of a month's quarantine...</i>

432
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:13,134
<i>...undergoing level four decon procedures.</i>

433
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:17,388
<i>We are, so far, without symptoms
of fungal contamination.</i>

434
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:27,106
<i>Our specimens and field notes were taken by
the biohazard corps prior to our evacuation.</i>

435
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:33,029
<i>Their presence is delayed indefinitely for
the arrival of the USGS data retrieval team.</i>

436
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:38,034
<i>I suspect, though, there will be
little left for them to retrieve.</i>

437
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:44,290
<i>There are no plans to explore the volcanically
active mountains in the Cascade range...</i>

438
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,751
<i>...including Mount Avalon.</i>

439
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:53,466
<i>All access points to that volcano
have been sealed off by army engineers.</i>

440
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:58,679
<i>Of the members
of the Firewalker descent team...</i>

441
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:02,016
<i>...only Trepkos and O'Neil
remain unaccounted for.</i>

442
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,229
<i>They are presumed dead,
and the search for them has been abandoned.</i>

443
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:10,066
<i>Firewalker, however, was recovered, ...</i>

444
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:15,655
<i>...though its sensory and locomotive systems
were found to be irreparably damaged.</i>

445
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:19,867
<i>The data it collected from the Earth's interior
will never be known.</i>

446
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:25,581
<i>And of the events that occurred at Mount
Avalon between 11 and 13 November 1994...</i>

447
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,503
