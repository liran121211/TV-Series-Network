<i>On August 20 and September 51977...</i>

4
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:21,898
<i>...two spacecraft were launched from
the Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida.</i>

5
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,775
<i>They were called Voyager.</i>

6
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,990
<i>Each one carries a message.</i>

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,828
<i>(man) I send greetings

<i>(Mulder) 13 years after its launch,
Voyager 1 passed the orbit of Neptune...</i>

14
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,855
<i>...and essentially left our solar system.</i>

15
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:08,569
<i>Within that time,
there were no further messages sent...</i>

16
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,155
<i>...nor are any planned.</i>

17
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,370
<i>We wanted to listen.</i>

18
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:22,917
<i>On October 121992, NASA initiated
the High Resolution Microwave Survey...</i>

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,921
<i>...a search by radio telescopes
scanning ten million frequencies...</i>

20
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:31,008
<i>...for any transmission
by extraterrestrial intelligence.</i>

21
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:35,388
<i>Less than a year later,
Senator Richard Bryan...</i>

22
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:40,226
<i>...successfully championed an amendment
which terminated the project.</i>

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,232
<i>I wanted to believe,
but the tools had been taken away.</i>

24
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,694
<i>The X-Files had been shut down.</i>

25
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,864
<i>They closed our eyes.</i>

26
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,450
<i>Our voices have been silenced.</i>

27
00:01:56,534 --> 00:02:01,205
<i>Our ears now deaf to the realms
of extreme possibilities.</i>

28
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,165

<i>(man 1) Cecil and me,

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,788
<i>- (man 2) You treat yourself?
- (man 1) Man, let me tell you!</i>

35
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:28,417
<i>- (man 1) You know that one Tuesday?
- Wait, wait. You went on Tuesday?</i>

36
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:32,380
<i>- No. That's the stripper's name: Tuesday.
- Oh, yeah. [know her.</i>

37
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:36,509
<i>She's on stage dancing to that
Offspring song, "Come Out and Play".</i>

38
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,011
<i>- Nice touch.
- Very hot.</i>

39
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,180
<i>- Keep going.
- I'm tipping her big.</i>

40
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,892
<i>No ones, five spots. I'm laying 'em
on the rail - boom, boom, boom.</i>

41
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,854
<i>- She didn't like it?
- By the end of the song, I had $40 laid out.</i>

42
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,649
<i>It's not a long song, is it?</i>

43
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:56,529
(Soul/y) It is advantageous to begin
an autopsy by removing the cranium.

44
00:03:56,654 --> 00:04:01,992
The cranium is opened with a horizontal
division an inch above the eyebrow ridges.

45
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,171
Something wrong?

46
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,510
What this man imagined...

47
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,638
...his dreams...

48
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,516
...who he loved, saw, heard...

49
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,685
...remembered...

50
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,312
...what he feared...

51
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,816
...somehow it's...

52
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,069
...all looked in this small mass
of tissue and fluid.

53
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:43,701
Are you OK, Agent Scully?
You kind of sounded a little spooky.

54
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,553
Good afternoon, Agent Mulder.

55
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,102
<i>(door opens)</i>

56
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:03,072
$4 for the first hour of parking is criminal.

57
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,992
What you got better be worth
at least 45 minutes.

58
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:13,082
You know, Mulder, from...

59
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,168
- ...from back there you looked like him.
- Him?

60
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,381
- Deep Throat.
- He's dead, Scully.

61
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:26,053
I attended his funeral at Arlington through
binoculars from a thousand yards away.

62
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:31,058
Now the picture frame was turned down.
You wanted to talk. What have you found?

63
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,353
I wanted to talk,
but I haven't found anything.

64
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,231
It's dangerous for us
just to have a little chat.

65
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,942
We must assume we're being watched.

66
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,445
- I haven't seen any indication...
- No, of course not.

67
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,242
- These people are the best.
- I've taken all of the necessary precautions.

68
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,412
I have doubled back to make sure
I haven't been followed.

69
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,789
No one has ever followed me.

70
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,794
The X-Files have been terminated, Mulder.
We have been reassigned.

71
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,592
- What makes you think they care about us?
- So why have you come here covertly?

72
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:09,221
Because I realised that it was
the only way that you would see me.

73
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,517
- So what do you want?
- To know that you're all right.

74
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:19,732
Mulder, you passed me today
within a foot, but you were miles away.

75
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,653
I'm on electronic surveillance.

76
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:28,866
White-bread cases, bank fraud,
insurance fraud, healthcare swindles.

77
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,493
Mulder, I know that you feel...

78
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:36,999
...frustrated, that without
the Bureau's resources you can't continue...

79
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,209
- No. It...
- Well, what then?

80
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,382
When we were shut down, you said you'd
go on for as long as the truth was out there.

81
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,219
But I no longer feel that from you.

82
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,725
Have you ever been to San Diego?

83
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,687
Yeah.

84
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,566
Did you check out the Palomar Observatory?

85
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,068
No.

86
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:08,113
From 1948 until recently,
it was the largest telescope in the world.

87
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:13,369
The idea came from a brilliant and wealthy
astronomer named George Ellery Hale.

88
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:17,164
The idea was presented to Hale
while he was playing billiards.

89
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:23,420
An elf climbed in his window and said to get
the money from the Rockefeller Foundation.

90
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:28,384
And you're worried that all your life
you've been seeing elves?

91
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,224
In my case...

92
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,059
...little green men.

93
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:42,898
But, Mulder, during your time
with the X-Files you've seen so much.

94
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,984
That's just the point. <i>Seeing</i> is not enough.

95
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,280
I should have something to hold on to.
Some solid evidence.

96
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,117
I learned that from you.

97
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,249
Your sister's abduction -
you've held on to that.

98
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,964
I'm beginning to wonder if...

99
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,342
...if that ever even happened.

100
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,471
Mulder...

101
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,685
...even if George Hale only saw elves
in his mind, the telescope still got built.

102
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,480
Don't give up.

103
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,822
And next time...

104
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,825
...we meet out in the open.

105
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,170

Do we have to watch this, Fox?

114
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,949
Leave it. I'm watching The <i>Magician</i> at nine.

115
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,244
Mom and Dad said
I could watch the movie, buttmunch.

116
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,499
They're next door at the Galbrands',
and they said I'm in charge.

117
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,337
Hey, get out of my life!

118
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,548
Agh!

119
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,177

120
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,558

Good thing it wasn't
a <i>Double Jeopardy</i> question.

00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,398
Do you know the significance of this piece?

137
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,487
Well, recalling music appreciation
with Professor Ganz...

138
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,781
...Bach had a genius for polyphonic...

139
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,077
This is the first selection of music
on the Voyager spacecraft.

140
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,331
The first.

141
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,668
Four and a half billion years from now...

142
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:17,172
...when the sun exhausts its fuel
and swells to engulf the Earth...

143
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,593
...this expression will still be out there...

144
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,890
...travelling four and a half billion years.

145
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,896
That is, if it's not intercepted first.

146
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,399
Imagine, Fox...

147
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:39,069
...if another civilisation out there
were to hear this.

148
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,949
They would think
what a wonderful place the Earth must be.

149
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:52,457
I would want this to be the...
first contact with another life form.

150
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,553
I know I've let you down.

151
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,809
You've supported me
at great risk to your reputation.

152
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,730
I realise that when they shut us down,
there was nothing you could do.

153
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,274
All I can say is, I think we were close.

154
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,987
To what, I don't know.

155
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,243
What?

156
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,460
Do you like Bach, Mulder?

157
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,255
- I live for Bach.
- Then let's hear it again.

158
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:58,440
I take it you are familiar with the
High Resolution Microwave Survey?

159
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:02,903
The search for extraterrestrial radio signals.
They shut it down.

160
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:07,908
You have to get to the radio telescope
at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.

161
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:13,872
I'll try to delay them as long as I can, but
my guess is you'll have at least 24 hours.

162
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:18,502
After that, I can no longer hold off
the Blue Beret UFO Retrieval Team.

163
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,508
And they have been authorised
to display terminal force.

164
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,676
What am I looking for?

165
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,063

- In the bull pen hallway.</i>

169
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,414
<i>Did you speak with him?</i>

170
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,917
<i>No. Is he in some kind of trouble?</i>

171
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,586
<i>He failed to appear
at his assignment this morning.</i>

172
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,339
<i>His whereabouts are unknown.</i>

173
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,847
<i>- I'll volunteer to assist in any search.
- No, Agent Scully...</i>

174
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,561
- She doesn't know where he is.
- How can you be so sure?

175
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,398
Because if she knew,
she wouldn't be so worried about him.

176
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,238
I don't smoke.

177
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,700
She'll find him.

178
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,257
<i>Gracias.</i>

179
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,920
No trace evidence apparent
around the exterior of the control room...

180
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,673
...which is locked with chains.

181
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,032
The power has been turned off.

182
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,203
Although the control
panel lights are still on.

183
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,084
The room's about 30 by 15.

184
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,879
I see no signs of any recent occupation.

185
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,510
There's quite an odour of mildew
in the air. The air is stale.

186
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,556
If anyone's been here recently,
I see no indications.

187
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,267
<i>(whirring)</i>

188
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,446
<i>(tape rewinds)</i>

189
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:20,243
<i>(woman) Mulder! You hounded me to have
lunch today, and then you don't show.</i>

190
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,953
<i>You're a pig.</i>

191
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,122
<i>(beeping)</i>

192
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,569
Galactic latitude?

193
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,114
<i>(footsteps)</i>

194
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:01,469
- What are you doing here, Agent Scully?
- Are you following me?

195
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:07,142
Agent Mulder's residence is under
surveillance. Explain why you're here.

196
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,855
I was told by the assistant director
that Mulder was gone.

197
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,859
- So?
- So whenever he's away, I feed his fish.

198
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,870
What the hell is this?

199
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,208
Looks like a self-test the computer does.

200
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,761
- Damn.
- Just dump it in the tank.

201
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,100
That would be bad for the fish.

202
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,461
<i>(screams)</i>

203
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,171
<i>No me lastime, no me lastime!</i>

204
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:04,467
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- Por favor... Tengo mucho miedo.

205
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,595
- <i>(cries)</i>
- That's all right. Settle down.

206
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,308

<i>ÉNombre? éNombre?</i>

210
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,071
Jorge.

211
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,699
<i>Me Name Jorge Concepcién.</i>

212
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,618
Jorge, why are you so afraid?

213
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,331
What have you seen?

214
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,421
<i>Luces_.</i>

215
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,632
<i>...en el cielo... rojo...</i>

216
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:48,011
<i>...azul... anaranjado.</i>

217
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:51,681
<i>Pensé que una avioneta
se habia estrellado...</i>

218
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,102
<i>Pero cuando Ilegué...</i>

219
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,396
<i>...vi hombres...</i>

220
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,732
<i>...como animales...</i>

221
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,026
<i>...pero no hombres.</i>

222
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,528
<i>Me agarraron y me pusieron aqui...</i>

223
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,241
<i>- iTodavia estén en el bosque!
- Jorge, no comprendo.</i>

224
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,079
Did you say men? <i>gHombres?</i>

225
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,397
It looks like the "Wow!" signal.

226
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:46,444
- The "Wow!" signal?
- Ohio State has a radio telescope...

227
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,406
...that conducts searches
for extraterrestrial intelligence.

228
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,410
In August 1977, my buddy Jerry Ehman...

229
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,914
...found a transmission
on a printout like this.

230
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,833
He was so excited,
he wrote "Wow!" in the margins.

231
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,794
What was there?

232
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,923
A signal - 30 times stronger
than galactic background noise.

233
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:12,887
It was on the 21cm frequency, which no
satellite transmitters are allowed to use.

234
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,599
The signal was intermittent,
like Morse code.

235
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,355
And more importantly, the signal seemed to
turn itself on while in the telescope's beam.

236
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:27,944
The "Wow!" signal is the best evidence
of extraterrestrial intelligence. But this...

237
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,655
This is better.

238
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,990
Where did you get this?

239
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,994
Maybe you can tell me.
Is that from Ohio State?

240
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,709
Can't tell.

241
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,462
There are a few nickel-and-dime
SETI projects around.

242
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,594
UC Berkeley has one. The Planetary Society
has one at Harvard and in Argentina.

243
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:58,766
NASA was working out of Goldstone
in California and Arecibo in Puerto Rico.

244
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,882
Mulder.

245
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:50,401
This signal from 06.30 Tuesday: the narrow
band and matching of the antenna pattern...

246
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,572
...indicates that it originated
from beyond lunar distance.

247
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,074
- The same message is...
- <i>(beeping)</i>

248
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,871
No! Jorge, don't touch that red button.
<i>Noho</i> on the <i>rojo.</i>

249
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,333
Thanks.

250
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:13,883
The same message is transmitted
four hours later on a wide band...

251
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:20,556
...which puts its point of origin very close,
just miles away from...

252
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,724
<i>(tape plays)</i>

253
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,894

00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,817

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,486
<i>IVémonos inmediatamente, por favor!</i>

257
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,280

There's a storm outside.

258
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,449
<i>(high-pitched tone)</i>

259
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,869

You can't be afraid.

263
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,142

264
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,313

265
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,943

266
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,322

<i>Flight 235 to Atlanta

282
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,353
Relax. We know where she's going:
St Croix, Caribbean Air, flight 519.

283
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:58,941
Takes off at five after seven.
The gate's in the other terminal.

284
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,796
I'd like a ticket on the 6.30 flight
to San Juan.

285
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:30,514
The day is...

286
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,518
The time is 10.30.

287
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:39,190
Although not a pathologist,
I will record my observations of the body...

288
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:44,695
...in case at some future time decomposition
should obscure forensic evidence.

289
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,992
The subject, perhaps victim,
is Hispanic male...

290
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,912
...undetermined age.

291
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:56,165
There are no overt
external injuries apparent.

292
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:02,213
There are no indications
of any lightning strikes.

293
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,133
No singeing of the hair
or burns of any kind.

294
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,555
There are no...

295
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,392
There are no puncture wounds
due to needles or probes...

296
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:19,063
...commonly associated
with cases of alien abduction.

297
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,484
The subject was discovered
in a sitting position...

298
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:28,405
...rigor mortis having set in - although
less than half an hour had elapsed.

299
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,868
The skin is strikingly affected
by goose flesh.

300
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,248
The body shows signs
of intense cadaveric spasm.

301
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,378
The expression reflects...

302
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:49,385
My God, Scully,
it's as if he's been frightened to death.

303
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,863
Again, Scully, nothing but evidence.

304
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,700
And again, no evidence at all.

305
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:21,542
The printouts of received transmission
indicate contact with another life form...

306
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,794
<i>...and ye“ cannot see them.</i>

307
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:29,008
And even if I could see them,
would they really be there?

308
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:34,597
This could be a classified military satellite -
these transmissions are from the Voyager.

309
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:38,434
Could extraterrestrials
really have intercepted them?

310
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:43,898
Or is this just some elaborate joke
played on those who want to believe?

311
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:48,611
I was sent here by one of those people.

312
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,905
Deep Throat said "Trust no one."

313
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:54,325
That's hard, Scully.

314
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,952
Suspecting everyone, everything.

315
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:03,459
It wears you down. You even begin
to doubt what you know is the truth.

316
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,842
Before, ...

317
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,470
...I could only trust myself.

318
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,974
Now, I can only trust you.

319
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,853
And they've taken you away from me.

320
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:30,819
My life up to this point
has been about the need to see her again.

321
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,822
To see them.

322
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,953
But what would I do if they really came?

323
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,459

Mulder...

334
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,744
I was sure you were dead.

335
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:28,664
Mulder... it's Scully.

336
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,167
Dana Scully. Do you know where you are?

337
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,213
They came, Scully.

338
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,425
The ones that took her, they were here.

339
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,969
Here? Or here?

340
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,013
On the tapes. The tape.

341
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,182
Evidence. Proof.

342
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,855
- The transmissions. It's all here.
- Proof of what?

343
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,315
Contact.

344
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,901
These printouts. It's here.

345
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,071
And the man.

346
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:06,452
We'll have to examine the body.
There'll be more proof.

347
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,662
<i>(rattling)</i>

348
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:14,376
- Is that them?
- No, this isn't it.

349
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:26,763
It's the Blue Beret Crash Retrieval Team.
They'll kill us. The body!

350
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,682
- We don't have time.
- Help me!

351
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:32,561
We're never gonna be able
to get the body out of the country!

352
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,776
Mulder, we <i>have</i> to go.

353
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,030
Evidence is worthless if you're dead.

354
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,805
Let's go!

355
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,485
Hold your fire! Get this truck
to the bottom of the hill!

356
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,278
Move! Come on, move!

357
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,968
Mulder!

358
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,698
Dammit.

359
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:19,001
You left your off-site setup.
Another brick agent had to cover you.

360
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:24,798
The entire surveillance, all the months of
work on this case, gone. Just like you, gone.

361
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,303
This has fourbagger all over it, Mulder.

362
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,181
Censure, transfer, suspension, probation.

363
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:38,478
Leaving my assignment
warrants disciplinary action.

364
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:42,024
- And I'm willing to accept those measures.
- But?

365
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:45,861
But I had enough to arrest
those suspects after three days.

366
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:49,448
I could've nailed them on 40 counts
of bank fraud. But you left me there.

367
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,242
I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone.

368
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:56,872
Let alone wiretap my phone,
an illegal procedure without a court order!

369
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,426
Your time is over...

370
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,595
...and you leave with nothing.

371
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,222
Get out.

372
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,394
I said, get the hell out.

373
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,928
Report back to your assignment.

374
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,558
A minute ago I was a fourbagger.

375
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,606
Do you want me to make the arrests?

376
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,276
I think we need more to go on.

377
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:13,115
Continue the surveillance.

378
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,796
<i>(tape hisses)</i>

379
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,801
It should be right here.

380
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,440
The entire tape is blank.

381
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:53,822
An electrical surge during the storm
may have degaussed everything...

382
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,783
...erasing the entire tape.

383
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,874
You still have nothing.

384
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:10,046
I may not have the X-Files, Scully,
but I still have my work.

385
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,514
And I still have you.

386
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,396
And I still have myself.

387
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,572
<i>(man 1) What's the difference
between a lap dance and a table dance?</i>

388
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,450
<i>(man 2) A lap dance, they're all over you.</i>

389
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,702
<i>(man 1) A lap dance costs what?</i>

390
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:45,373
<i>(man 1) All right, all right.
Tell me the best spot. Where?</i>

391
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,877
<i>- Paramount. But you gotta spend money.
- I'm there.</i>

392
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,506
<i>(man 1) Wednesday, it's your dancer?</i>

393
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:56,218
<i>No, don't go Wednesday.
That's amateur night.</i>

394
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:58,637
<i>(man 1) Amateurs, huh? Nice touch!</i>

395
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,766
<i>- (man 2) They're not really amateurs.
- Yeah, sure, sure.</i>

396
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:07,270
<i>If you don't mind spending the money,
the girls are all over you.</i>

397
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,065
<i>And they're good-looking too...</i>

398
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,746
<i>(hissing)</i>

399
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,953
<i>(child) I made this!</i>
