There's some reluctance on the part of the FBI to even open an X-File on the matter until Mulder finds that the Darlene was also supposedly abducted during a girl scout outing when she was a teenager. Ruby had something of a wild reputation and the local authorities believe she may have run off with a biker. Ruby's younger brother Kevin is seeing something on the television that he can translate into binary code, something that is of interest to the NSA. For Mulder, the case is far too reminiscent of his sister Samantha's abduction by aliens when he was 12 and she 8 years old.\u2014garykmcd", "The X File team returns to Iowa, Sioux City this time, for a case that has similarities to the facts and circumstances surrounding the childhood disappearance of his sister.
