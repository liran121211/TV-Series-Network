He was interviewing a young girl at the time, Michelle Bishop, but there was no one else in the room with them. Mulder immediately begins to suspect that Michelle may have telekinetic powers, something that seems to be proven when Scully finds a large burn mark on Barbala's body much as Mulder as predicted. Michelle says there was a ghost in the room with them and her rendition of him leads then to the case of dead detective Charlie Morris, who was killed in a police raid. In fact,Charlie may be back and seeking revenge against the policemen who got rid of him.\u2014garykmcd", "The only witness to a 14th Precinct cop's apparent suicide is an eight-year-old girl, who was found miles away from her New York home.
