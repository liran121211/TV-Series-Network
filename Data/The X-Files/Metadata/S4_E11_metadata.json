There were reports of a very bright flash of light followed by a yellow rain just as she was killed. Scully's examination of the body reveals that she died as a result of a massive fungal infection. The locals however are certain that the culprit is El Chupacabra, a mythical beast from Mexican folklore. They're also sure the beast is to be found in Eladio Buente, Maria's brother-in-law who was with her when she died. While Scully looks for a scientific explanation, Mulder believes the fungus may be alien in origin. Regardless, they must find Eladio before the fungus spreads.\u2014garykmcd", "White flashes of lightning followed by yellow rain in the San Joaquin Valley of central California give new life to an old Mexican folk tale of El Chupacabra, a gray-skinned being whose victims decompose fast.
