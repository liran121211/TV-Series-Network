They had recently had to abort a launch just seconds before lift-off and another launch is now scheduled. The man in charge of the program is a legendary Gemini astronaut, Col. Marcus Aurelius Belt. He claims there's nothing to the scrubbed launch that they weren't aware of and the talk of sabotage is nonsense.

It's all related to something that happened to Belt during his last Gemini flight and it's now affecting his judgment.\u2014garykmcd", "A Mission Control Comm.
