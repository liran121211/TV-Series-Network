When they meet that man's daughter, Cindy, she is identical to Teena. Deep Throat provides Mulder with information about the Litchfield experiments, attempts at gene modification where children, named Adam and Eve, were produced. They trace a common link from the girls to Dr. Sally Kendrick who was fired for her position at a fertility clinic for experimenting in eugenics.
