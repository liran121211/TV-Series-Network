Their recollection of the case is significantly divergent. They had gone to Texas to investigate a death by exsanguination and Scully thinks that someone is playing at being a vampire. Her autopsy finds a high level of chlorohydrate in the dead man's system. There's soon a second victim and she finds that both victims had eaten pizza. As she recalls it, she saved an incapacitated Mulder and tried to capture the culprit. Mulder's recollection is somewhat different. It was he, not Scully who developed the key clues in the case including the fact that the victim's shoes were untied and then discovering a second victim in a runaway RV. Before they can speak to Skinner, they have to return to Texas when the vampire Mulder killed seems to have disappeared.\u2014garykmcd", "While investigating bizarre exsanguinations in Texas, Mulder kills a teenage boy whom he mistakes for a vampire.
