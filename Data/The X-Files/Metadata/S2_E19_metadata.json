All but one quickly dies and the survivor is under guard in a military hospital. Mulder's archive has reports of a number of ships disappearing in the same area just off Norway. He believes it's all related to the Navy's World War II-era Philadelphia Experiment where the government was trying to find a way to make ships invisible to radar. They find the missing ship, the USS Ardent, in the Norwegian Sea abandoned and with all of its crew dead but one, the captain. Both the ship and the captain are quite old and they seem to have gone through some type of time anomaly. Scully has a scientific explanation for what has happened but they are going to have to solve the mystery quickly as they begin to age rapidly.\u2014garykmcd", "Less than thirty American sailors are rescued on an escape boat from their ship, positioned in the Norwegian Sea, and seem to have aged five decades in only weeks.
