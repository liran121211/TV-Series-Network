Scully, Mulder and a few others end up trapped there.", "Mulder and Scully head off to the Pacific Northwest when there are reports that 30 loggers seem to have simply disappeared. Mulder is aware of a similar case in 1934 and along with a forest ranger and a representative of the logging company, the agents head off into the woods. They know that environmental activists are in the area and when they come across one of them, he says that a swarm of bugs that only comes out at night is responsible for the deaths. A body they find wrapped in a bug cocoon seems to bear out his claim. With no way to communicate with the outside world and with the gas for the generator running low, they have to find a way to survive.\u2014garykmcd", "Thirty loggers in Olympic National Forest in Washington State disappear within a week of their arrival. Due to the disappearance of another logging group in 1934, Mulder takes the case and invites Scully along to investigate.
