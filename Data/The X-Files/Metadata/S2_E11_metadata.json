Nurse Michelle Charters has the bruises to prove the attack but not surprisingly, no one will take her seriously given the nature of her claim.

Incidents continue to occur making believers of the agents who believe that the residents are getting drugs from someone else in the institution.\u2014garykmcd", "A nurse (Teryl Rothery) who works in a home for the elderly in Massachusetts claims to have been raped by an invisible assailant.
