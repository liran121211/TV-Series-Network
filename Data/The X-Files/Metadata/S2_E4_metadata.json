An apartment dweller called emergency services to report a fire outside his door but firemen arrive to find no fire and the owner dead with a spent fire extinguisher nearby. Scully's autopsy finds that the dead man's internal physical condition resembles that of someone who has been in intense heat, even though there are no visible burn marks. A second death gives them a connection between both men as they had served together in the Marines in the early 1970s. They subsequently learn that a man by the name of Augustus Cole has somehow escaped from a high security facility and that, incredibly, hasn't slept for 24 years. Mulder concludes that Cole is seeking revenge.\u2014garykmcd", "A doctor specializing in sleep deprivation is found dead in his condo after reporting a massive fire outside the door.
