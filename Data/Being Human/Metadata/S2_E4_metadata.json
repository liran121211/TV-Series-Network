Bishop's ghost confuses him further whether to kill his 'son' or persist in pretty hopeless attempts to save him, at growing danger to himself and the supernatural community, only to find the 'father instinct' wins out. Josh is shocked when he learns that Nora's ex Will has been killed and eaten, as he feared by the purebred werewolf siblings Connor and Brynn McLean, and fears for his life as Boston police detective Raimes naturally suspect him, so he turns to Aidan's brand new vampire-police-mole, whom he finds about as scary. Meanwhile Sally freaks as her mother's death allows her adulterous mother Rena to fully, eternally indulge her affair with now fellow ghost Gerry Patterson, who Josh still treats to a 'family' dinner.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2049680", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 212, "number_of_episodes": 52}
