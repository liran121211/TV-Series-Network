Aidan and Suzanna come face to face with the truth about their tumultuous past, and Josh and Nora seek help from an old friend in an attempt to bring Josh back to who he was.\u2014Anonymous", "Aiden is thriving, though at the expense of others, and Kenny is left to clean up the aftermath. Meanwhile, Josh and Nora discover Robbie's dead body and reveal their werewolf nature to ghostly Robbie. Sally explains her version of the afterlife but becomes fixated on resurrecting Robbie despite Josh's warnings about the risks of magic. Aiden returns home, briefly interacts with Robbie, and sneaks off for more blood. Sally catches him losing control and asks for his opinion on using magic to save Robbie. In his altered state, Aiden supports her intentions, despite usually being anti-magic. Determined, Sally decides to consult Donna, a witch from her past, to gain insight. Meanwhile, a beautiful young woman pushes her shopping cart through a hardware store. She seems mundane enough, her cart filled with wood boards, a sleeping bag, and her leather handbag, and wearing a simple top under a gray jacket. Her hazel eyes, however, dart about suspiciously until they land on a ladder. Quickly, she pushes her cart aside and goes towards it. She starts pushing it with all her might until it reaches a certain point. Sally jumps out of her body, revealing to be the reason for her strange behavior. As the dazed woman leaves, Sally climbs up top. Using risky magic, she brings Donna from the past to the present. Donna reveals her dark history: she was resurrected by witches who sacrificed an innocent soul, and she warns Sally that using magic comes with dangerous consequences, including getting stuck in the past.

Before departing, Donna asks Sally to seal her death spot to prevent further tampering with magic. Sally attempts to promise restraint but is transported back to 2010, the day of her murder.
