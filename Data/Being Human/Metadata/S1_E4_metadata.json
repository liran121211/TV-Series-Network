Josh freaks out, and cannot get away from Ray fast enough. Later, he meets Ray, once again, at the hospital. Ray convinces Josh to let him teach him how to be a Werewolf. Ray shows Tony how to use a rump-roast to form a barrier that will keep Josh from roaming, and possibly coming across any humans he might kill. Ray takes Josh to a shed, in the woods, where he can store his clothes and other articles for cleaning up in the mornings. Eventually, Josh offers Ray a place to stay, for a short while, so he will have another Werewolf to talk to. While walking around the city, they come across Marcus, and another Vampire, and beat them unconscious.\u2014Sharon McKnelly"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1805704", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 307, "number_of_episodes": 52}
