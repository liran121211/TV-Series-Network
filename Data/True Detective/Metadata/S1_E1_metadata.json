They had only been partners for a few months when a naked woman's body was found in a farmer's field. She was posed kneeling before a tree with a crown of deer antlers on her head. The victim is identified as Dora Lange who, as Cohle had predicted, worked as a prostitute. Hart is a family man who does his best to get to know his new partner but Cohle reveals little of himself other than he is divorced and had a child who died. In the course of their investigation, they take an interest in another case, that of Marie Fontenot, a young girl who disappeared some time ago. They may have also found a link between the two cases.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2657398", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 32664, "number_of_episodes": 31}
