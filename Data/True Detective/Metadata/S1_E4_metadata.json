The search for Reggie Ledoux leads the detectives to a motorcycle gang called the Iron Crusaders, which Rust worked undercover in the past.", "The detectives continue their search for Reggie Ledoux but an opportunity arises when Hart learns that Ledoux is cooking meth for a drug-dealing motorcycle gang known as the Iron Crusaders. Cohle knows them well having had dealings with the gang during the four years he worked as an undercover narcotics officer. He decides that the only way to move the case forward is to take two weeks of personal time - citing a dying father as the reason - and unofficially go undercover. He soon hooks up with his old contacts in the Iron Crusaders but it's clear that regaining their trust isn't going to be easy. At home meanwhile, Hart runs into major problems after his wife Maggie learns of his affair with Lisa. In the present day, the detectives interviewing Cohle and Hart can't quite understand why, having found a major lead in the case, Cohle would suddenly take two weeks leave.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2790174", "rating": 9.6, "votes": 39093, "number_of_episodes": 31}
