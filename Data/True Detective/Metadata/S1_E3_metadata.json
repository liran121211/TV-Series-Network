Martin's mistress gets on with somebody else leaving him furious. Cohle's theory becomes increasingly more convincing than ever.", "Cohle and Hart continue their investigation. They track down the minister who used the church but learn they had abandoned it some four months before it succumbed to fire. The local authorities blamed the fire on teenagers but it's still an open case. Cohle combs through old files searching for any connections to their current case. He may have found a 2-year-old case that appears similar, and sets out to find the dead girl's boyfriend, Reggie Ledoux, who has a record and knew Charlie Lange in prison. Maggie Hart sets Cohle up on a date and the four of them go to a bar where Martin sees his mistress Lisa out on a date with someone. In the present day, Cohle explains his interrogation technique, which even Hart admits is different but effective. Hart's recollection of his family life is somewhat skewed.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2790184", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 27252, "number_of_episodes": 31}
