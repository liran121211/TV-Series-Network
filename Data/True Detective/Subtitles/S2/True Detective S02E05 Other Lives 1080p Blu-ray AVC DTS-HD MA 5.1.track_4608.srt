179
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,563
Hmm.

180
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,899
And your kid Tony.

181
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,943
My family ain't your concern, boychick.

182
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,989
You've been running girls
through the poker room.

183
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,283
Not so much as a heads up to me.

184
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,955
Penance is an extra five 3 month.

185
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,416
Get out of my office, Frank.

186
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,251
Next time, wait for an invitation.

187
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,840
I'll let you get back to your process,
then, Michelangelo.

188
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,718
Mr. Semyon.

189
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,514
You don't direct me, Khe Sanh motherfucker.

190
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,933
I'm Chinese.

191
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,727
Then go stand in front of a fucking tank.

192
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,854
GENA'S ATTORNEY: Mr. Velcoro
was a person of interest

193
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,023
in a state investigation into corruption.

194
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,316
HARRIS: Which yielded nothing.

195
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,110
GENA'S ATTORNEY: And after the firefight
in Vinci, he resigned under scrutiny

196
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,946
and pending a charge on substance abuse.

197
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,614
HARRIS: That's anecdotal hearsay.

198
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,825
There's no record of my client
being reprimanded for drug use.

199
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,994
JUDGE: Would you submit to a blood test,
Mr. Velcoro?

200
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,287
Absolutely, Your Honor.

201
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:11,083
Finally, Your Honor,
we are contesting Mr. Velcoro's paternity

202
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,002
and wish to establish
whether he even qualifies for father's rights.

203
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,212
- HARRIS: Objection.
- Fucking assholes.

204
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,797
JUDGE: You're not helping your case,
Mr. Velcoro.

205
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,507
GENA'S ATTORNEY: Mrs. Brune
was the victim of an assault

206
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,925
during the period of conception.

207
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,803
She believes the rapist to be
the biological father of her child.

208
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,181
I raised that boy. Am raising him.

209
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,641
It doesn't matter where he comes...

210
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,226
Our position is that it matters a great deal.

211
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,648
- I trusted you.
- I trusted you.

212
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,983
What does that mean?

213
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,695
I'll instruct the parties to refrain
from addressing one another. Period.

214
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,823
Now, I'm going to order
a paternity and toxicology test.

215
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,658
I'm ordering supervised visitation

216
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,536
until both the paternity
and toxicology results are in.

217
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,997
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

218
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,499
What, I gotta get a stranger
to chaperone me and my son?

219
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,544
JUDGE: I've delivered my verdict.
Don't push me, Mr. Velcoro.

220
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,172
Any revision at this point
would not be in your favor.

221
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,607
She never looked at me like that before.

222
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,901
Like she hated me.

223
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,653
You really gonna test clean?

224
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,530
Yeah.

225
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,323
Yeah, 60 days now.

226
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,286
I want to fight this however I can.

227
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,329
Then pull some more cash together.

228
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,541
Tax-free or not, this is gonna get expensive.

229
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,510
<i>FRANK: You need more money?</i>

230
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,388
<i>RAY: I need more money.</i>

231
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,390
We're war rationing.

232
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,017
RAY: More work, then.

233
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,270
I can, you know, do double shifts at the Lux.

234
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,105
This is for your kid?

235
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,815
Hmm.

236
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,817
I might have a job for you.

237
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,406
The guy who bought the waste company
we used in the corridor died.

238
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,991
Place has been cleaned out.

239
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:12,996
I'm gonna start listening to the hot feeling
I got in the back of my neck.

240
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,375
I want you to tail Blake.
I want to know what his life is outside of me.

241
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,461
I can do that.

242
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,049
What's your feeling?

243
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,133
Running girls?

244
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,136
Am I in confession?

245
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,971
No.

246
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,307
Just, uh, never seemed like you.

247
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,351
Maybe you're just not very perceptive.

248
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,814
Ask you something?

249
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,026
You think those Mexes really did Caspere?

250
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,114
I don't know.

251
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,700
It was bullshit surveillance and...

252
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,288
The crash pad was a fucking meth factory.

253
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,549
Caspere died

254
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,969
with five million of my dollars, cash.

255
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,222
Stan's killed.

256
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,268
I'm squeezed out of the rail corridor.

257
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,896
The enemy won't reveal itself, Raymond.

258
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,358
Stymies my retribution.

259
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,652
It's like, uh...

260
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,739
Blue balls in your heart.

261
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,871
I'll see about some shifts at the Lux.

262
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,791
But follow Blake.
He's gotten too smooth for my peace of mind.

263
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,850
Oh, Paulie. Oh, no.

264
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,853
I'm getting married.

265
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,230
I love her.

266
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,034
Her name is Emily.

267
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,827
How pregnant is she?

268
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,787
Almost four months.

269
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,082
Mother of God.

270
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,631

271
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,385
You're a good-looking white man.

272
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,473
And you want to get in shootouts

273
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,684
and become somebody's husband.

274
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,895
You could do anything you want.

275
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,814
Okay.

276
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,947
If I was a man, I'd have had the world.

277
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,659

303
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,737

I don't care about family.

and Geldof announces a governor's run
with 3 suddenly massive war chest.

570
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,698
So, he had his hand out. That what this is?
