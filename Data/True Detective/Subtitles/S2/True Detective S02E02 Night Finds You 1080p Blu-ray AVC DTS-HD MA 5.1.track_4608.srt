00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,240
How'd a water stain get there?

4
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:57,576
It rained maybe twice this last year.

5
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,038
It's like everything's papier maché.

6
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,377
Stop thinking.

FRANK: I don't like being on a ledge.

JORDAN: Nobody gets rich
on their own money.

9
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,721
I never really knew what to do with it.

10
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,348
Money.

11
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,811
I see that about myself.

12
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,234
You always said you want lots of land.

13
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,611
Yes.

14
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,614
But you need children to leave it to.

15
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,909
It's never really yours.

16
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,828
You don't take it with you.

JORDAN: You don't take anything with you.

18
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,043
Just yourself, whatever that was.

19
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,963
I've worked my whole life, same as you.

20
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,842
And not being poor
is better than the opposite.

21
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,641
My old man back in Chicago,

22
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,603
when I was a kid... (CHUCKLES)

23
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,482
...he used to lock me
in the basement when he'd go on a bender.

24
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,320
Usually last the night.
Let me out the next day.

25
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,573
Thought he was keeping me safe, I guess.

26
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,744
This one time, I was six,

27
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,456
he puts me down there,

28
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,750
and I wake up,

29
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,378
and it's locked.

30
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,255
It had happened before.

31
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,970
Anyways, I guess he ended up arrested.
I guess.

35
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,647
I was out of food.

36
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,027
The third day, the, uh, lightbulb burned out.

37
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,739
Pitch black in there.

38
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,827
That's when the rats started coming out.

39
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,580
I dozed off and...

40
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,961
I felt the thing, you know, nibbling my finger.

(GULPING)

42
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,718
I woke up.

43
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,180
It was, you know, chewing my finger.

44
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,184
What did you do?

45
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,189
I grabbed it in the dark with my hands
and I started smashing it.

46
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,694
And I just kept smashing it

47
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,532
till it was nothing but goo in my hands.

48
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,625
Two more days I was in there,

49
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,004
in the dark,

50
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,883
till my dad comes home.

51
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,773
Sometimes I wonder how many things
you have like that

52
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,236
that I don't know about.

53
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,405
Ever since, I wonder,

54
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,201
what if he never comes home?

55
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,415
What if

56
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,753
I'm still in that basement

57
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,839
in the dark?

58
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,433
What if I died there?

59
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,361
That's what that reminds me of.

61
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,367
That water stain.

62

63
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,459
it's all papier maché.

64

also had gonorrhea, for what it's worth.

Hydrochloric acid on his eyes.
Burn pattern tells us he was on his back.

73
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,498
Lack of spray around the orbital cavity
indicates precision.

74
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,209
Some kind of glass eyedropper, maybe.

00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,294
O'NEAL: He's our body.

76
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,714
I don't see that changing,
so why don't you all fill me in?

Victim is a key figure
in a state's investigation.

78

- What state investigation?
- GELDOF: Newly formed.

79
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,097
We're looking into various allegations
made against Vinci in the papers.

80
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,601
Vinci detectives have been
on Caspere as a missing person for two days.

81
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,562
We have the man's house,
which was burglarized.

82
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,771
You want to shut us out,

83
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,065
we'll continue
our investigation autonomously.

84
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,569
In Vinci, so everybody
can keep their little corners to themselves,

85
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,989
but, ladies and gentlemen,
PD is solving this case.

86
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:31,285
I understand Ventura.
How does the state have any claim here?

87
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,455
Our officer found the body.

88
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,248
This could get you
out from under, Woodrugh.

89
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,126
That actress bullshit.
You'd be detailed as a state's investigator.

90
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,837
GELDOF: The Caspere homicide
is your public investigation.

91
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,632
Looking into Vinci PD
is your confidential mandate,

This probe is very important
to the governor's office.

you'll be offered a chance
to remain investigator.

In line for a state detective shield.

101
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,532
can I just go back to being on the bike?

lividity on his torso.

104
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:20,918
He was bound upside down, or close to it.

105
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:26,340
Attorney general's office has concerns
about obfuscation on the part of Vinci PD.

106
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,134
DAVIS: Detective Bezzerides,
you'll be primary commander of the detail.

107
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,845
Secondary is gonna be a Vinci guy, Velcoro.

108
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,390
Your DB was into a lot of LA County money.

109
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,684
His house was broken into,
So you're going to Vinci.

110
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,812
Vinci detective with you, word is he's bent.

111
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,523
Work him. Leverage something to turn him.

112
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,525
We'll have a full state probe up inside a week.

113
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,277
Caspere's death is a window into everything.

114
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,655
And what is "everything" exactly?

115
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,281
You know anything about the city of Vinci?

117
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,833
DAVIS: It started out as a vice haven,
early 1900s.

118
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,210
Went industrial in the '20s.

119
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,296
Pushed out residents
from manufacturing zones.

120
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,676
Worst air polluter in the state.

121
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:15,431
Annually emits or processes
27 million pounds of toxic waste.

122
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,897
AUSTIN: Reds tried to stop my grandfather
from industrial rezoning.

123
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,566
Same thing.

124
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,487
(SIGHS) Geldof's been after us
since we won the last EPA suit.

125
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,615
It's about money, Detective Velcoro.

126
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,285
BODINE: Caspere was one of the architects
of the community renewal initiative.

127
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:42,624
Passing legislature, our city gets to keep
75% of its county tax revenue for eight years.

128
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,793
- And what's that worth?
- BODINE: About $900 million.

129
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,128
Being kept from the county general fund.

130
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,671
AUSTIN: Hell, Ernst, it's our money.

131
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:51,175
Vinci's a goddamn success story
in a depressed economy.

132

to dig into whatever they can, Ray.

we need you running point.

Dixon is secondary to you,
staging out of Vinci.

136
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,524
You'll be working under a Ventura
detective commanding the task force.

137
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,904
That clear to you, Detective?

138
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,573
10-4, Lieutenant. Just one question.

139
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,201
Am I supposed to solve this or not?

Ray accepts dualities must be effected
to, uh, serve public interests.

of the buckle's imprint on both wrists.

Tape residue.

147
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,976
Pelvic wounds
are from a 12-gauge at point-blank range.

Official COD is heart attack.

- Trauma-induced.
- A coup de grace.

151
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,904
CORONER: Lividity indicates he was placed
in an upright position after death.

152
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,908
Spent a few hours that way.
Nothing under his nails, no prints.

His eyes?
What the fuck kind of modus operandi is that?

155
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,632
RAY: Doc said it was hydrochloric acid.

156
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,677
And a shotgun blast happened.

157
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,263
Torture. Somebody wanted
to know something.

158
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,514
Yeah, his house was tossed.

159
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,641
Somebody's making a move.

160
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,103
What? What does that mean?

161
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:30,357
- You knew Caspere?
- There's deals being done upstate.

162
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,734
- A lot of money moving around.
- RAY: What deals?

163
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,863
You pull my string? Is that how this works?

164
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,740
Jesus, Frank. The more I know,
the better I can deal with this.

FRANK: This is what you deal with.

166
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,369
Caspere was important
to this thing I have going on.

Oh, the young man here,
he got a dynamite anecdote.

346
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,712
Last withdrawal was five days ago.

347
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:04,759
Nothing jumps except this.
Once a month, $4,000 cash withdrawal.

Let me see this.

349
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,274

to come around the time

Car didn't go anywhere.
Says his Mercedes was a lease.

355
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,210
- Well, that makes sense.
- Not city. Catalast Group.

356
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,670
Why'd Catalast lease him a car?

00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,397
The police said that someone
beat up Wit Conroy.

Said it had something
to do with a schoolyard altercation.

even if he doesn't know it.

391
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,509

it's probably because he knows

475
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:18,002
A number of things. Neuroses, anxiety,

476
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,588
a painful past, like many.

477
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,633
- Guilt.
- Guilt over what?

478
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,636
Ben had a weakness for young women.

479
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,889
Paying for them, more specifically.

480
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,557
He frequented escorts,

481
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,061
although it ignited in him
tremendous shame and self-loathing,

482
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:39,106
which resulted in further
damaging tendencies.

483
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,152
- Old cycles.
- How long had he been seeing you?

484
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,738
About three years.

485
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,491
Was he making any progress, his therapy?

486
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,243
I like to think so.
His relapses were less frequent,

487
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,080
and he didn't compound them
with further damaging behavior.

did he ever mention any girls by name?</i>

but I'd be willing to go back over my notes.

491
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:06,717
What about the name Tascha?
He, uh, ever mention her?

492
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:11,388
Did he ever mention violence?
Trouble with a girl, a pimp?

493
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:15,101
He was sexually obsessed,
but he was not aggressive.

494
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:18,562
More passive.

495
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:25,361
