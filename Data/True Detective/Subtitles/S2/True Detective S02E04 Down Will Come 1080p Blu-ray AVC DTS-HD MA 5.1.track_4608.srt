00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,716
Theo Chessani, he would
have to be somewhere in his 903 by now.

358
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,883
His son.

359
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,678
We have a dead body. Benjamin Caspere.

360
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,849
I recognize him.

361
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,892
Never spoke.

362
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,353
He attended some seminars here, I believe.

363
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,230
You remember anything about them?

364
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,108
Those times, Chessani, Pitlor?

365
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,280
ELIOT: That's Pitlor.

366
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,825
Hard to tell,
but I think that's the Vinci mayor as a kid.

367
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,411
Jesus, that's some fucking coincidence.

368
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,290
Well, a lot of spiritual movements
cross-pollinated in these parts.

369
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:26,085
Being that I kept exclusively
to such company, it's not so unusual.

370
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,840
More unusual is that my daughter
became a sheriff's detective.

371
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:32,925
Uh...

372
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,806
Oh, your mother took this, you know.

373
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,185
An old soul

374
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,687
right from the start.

375
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,066
Excuse me.

376
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,904
You have one
of the largest auras I've ever seen.

377
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,072
Green and black.

378
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:58,075
It's been taking up this whole room. I just...

379
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,536
I had to say something.

380
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,209
You must have had hundreds of lives.

381
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,378
I don't think I can handle another one.

382
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,344
What do you think green and black means?

383
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,096
I don't know.

384
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,015
You're a mood ring?

385
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,609
RAY: We're driving to Fresno now?

386
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,030
It's not that I don't
enjoy our time together, but...

387
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,825
When I was in Chessani's house,

388
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,077
there were all these
soil readings for Fresno land.

389
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,913
GPS shows Caspere in the same areas.

390
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,888
RAY: Now I get why nobody lives out here.

391
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,433
Chessani's map went all the way
to the Lost Coast.

392
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,072
ANI: (SIGHS) So, What is all this?

393
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,701
RAY: Maybe this is where the bodies
are buried.

394
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,207
MAN: <i>It's our biggest issue in the county.</i>
<i>Mine ta ilin gs, runoff.</i>

395
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,250
ANI: Hi, there.

396
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,668
MAN: <i>We're constantly finding
new contamination.</i>

397
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,128
Like in this area here.

398
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,422
A lot of these mines
have been closed for decades.

399
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,216
Companies are bankrupt.
There's really no one to do the cleanup.

400
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,093
State doesn't have the resources.

401
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,306
Can you think of any reason why our victim
would visit so many of these sites?

402
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,933
I don't know. Um...

403
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,815
Unsafe levels of lead,
cadmium, arsenic, and/or mercury.

404
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,985
It's contaminated the water table
to such a degree,

405
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,904
the farmland here is useless.

406
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,823
Family farms have been selling out for years.
Whole county's turning over.

407
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:02,533
People have just given up.

408
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,673
MALKIN: It's about trust, right?

409
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,383
The people in my industry,

410
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,511
they can't even tell
when they're lying half the time.

411
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,221
Entitled.

412
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,517
Hey, doll. Look at you. (CHUCKLES)

413
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,774
- This place does all right, huh?
- Six-figure weekends.

414
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,026
On paper, you come in as part-owner.

415
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,071
The club's equity
guarantees the land investment.

416
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,364
MALKIN: How's the capital multiplied?

417
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,699
In dry farmland in the middle of the state?

418
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,370
The rail puts the land in line
for commercial zoning and development.

419
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,206
Fed money means cost overages.

420
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,167
This is the last pork barrel outside of defense.

421
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,214
Ah, man, we were young once, huh?

422
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,299
I was so focused on my career.

423
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,718
I think things worked out well for us both.

424
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,803
(CHUCKLES)

425
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,890
Let me talk to my business manager,
see how liquid I can go.

426
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,809
And I wasn't looking for any land,
you understand,

427
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,312
but I'll definitely, uh, give it
serious consideration.

428
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,611
I wanted to drag my heels,

429
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,655
I'd go to a credit union.

430
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,825
You aren't interested,

431
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,618
Why'd you take the meeting?

432
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,496
Well, this lady asked.

433
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,165
And I am interested.

434
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,376
We'll kick the tires, Frank. (PATS)

435
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,712
Trust takes time.

436
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,298
Beautiful, you call me.

437
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,634
Lunch.

438
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,513
-(SIGHS)
-(DOOR OPENS)

439
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,098
I told you he was a dipshit.

440
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,851
- But not too much of one...
-(DOOR CLOSES)

441
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,020
...to avoid this colorful shared history.

442
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,189
I was a kid,

443
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,984
and he never pulled anybody's teeth out.

444
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,446
This gonna get fucking worse,
what I gotta do.

445
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:05,573
You get that, right?

446
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,491
Butjust like that, you're back here.

447
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,745
Have I somehow
given you the impression I've got a choice?

448
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:14,248
Caspere, my fucking life's savings, Stan.

449
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,084
Congratulations, we're club owners again.

450
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,086
I'm saying it seems fast.

451
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,840
Maybe we should take
some time for ourselves, talk this through.

452
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,383
Things move fast now, babe.

453
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:27,428
Someone hit the fucking warp drive,
and I'm trying to navigate through the blur.

454
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,637
(SNAPS FINGERS) It's moment to moment,

455
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,599
and you just wasted my time
on your fairy producer boyfriend.

456
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,392
Your time, is it?

457
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,728
- Your time.
- Mmm-hmm.

458
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,521
My boyfriend.

459
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,231
Here's an idea.

460
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:42,026
Let's be one of those couples that fights a lot.

461
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,986
That's a fucking great idea.

462
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,353
Yeah.

463
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,105
Yeah, this is them.

464
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,941
Guy that pawned these, you got video?

465
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:25,027
It was a girl. Still got the tape.

466
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,956
Car gets processed, we might get something.

467
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,332
But that was him.

468
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,669
And I'd like state to know
Velcoro put himself in harm's way for me.

469
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,296
Where's Davis? I want to talk to her.

470
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,173
Anything you want to tell me?

471
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,716
About you and Velcoro?

472
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,137
No. Why?

473
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,638
Detective...

474
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,141
(SIGHS) Look, Ani,

475
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,810
there's been a formal complaint lodged.

476
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,854
Sexual misconduct.

477
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:02,773
- Against who?
- You, for Christ's sake.

478
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,733
Wait, what?

479
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,237
Deputy Steven Mercer.

480
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:13,826
Conducting a relationship with a subordinate.
That's called coercion.

481
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,452
You attended the seminar.

482
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,537
Is this for real?

483
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:27,131
You do realize they're all
giving Mercer high-fives out there, right?

484
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,843
What I do outside work...

485
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,513
This isn't outside work.
This is an IA complaint.

486
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:38,142
And I was subsequently made aware
of your relationship with Detective IIinca.

487
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,103
Oh, for fuck...

488
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,189
Once.

489
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,399
Once.

490
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,860
Partners? I mean...

491
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,529
What, you're telling me
that's some kind of first for this place?

492
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,990
Unofficially, admin doesn't stick its nose in

493
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,868
until a situation's created
that disturbs the department.

494
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,121
Okay, so if I had married Mercer,
this'd be okay?

495
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,706
Imagine that.

496
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,292
You adopting a position
of righteous indignation.

497
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,213
He was your subordinate.
That means you had power over him.

498
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,714
County has to investigate.

499
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,382
This would not be happening to a man.

500
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,052
If a complaint were lodged, you bet it would.

501
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,012
They just wouldn't be able to use that line.

502
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,389
I don't have anything to apologize for.

503
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:21,685
I'd consider altering that tune
before Professional Standards talks to you.

504
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:25,731
And until their investigation is concluded,
you cannot enter this building.

505
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,651
Wait a... (SCOFFS)

506
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,821
I'm suspended?

507
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,198
Since you got this state detail,

508
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,242
you'll keep working on that
as a special investigator,

509
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,912
but right now you're on departmental leave,
pending investigation.

510
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,833
Listen,

511
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,378
there's some word

512
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,505
you got gambling debts.

513
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,841
That comes up,
they'll want to look at your bank records.

514
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,760
I'd straighten them out if you can.

515
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,474
Does this have anything
to do with that mayor?

516
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,142
Vinci? Chessani?

517
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,272
Look,

518
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,023
I don't care who you sleep with,

519
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,693
so long as you find them
outside this department.

520
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,362
<i>Am, come on.</i>

521
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,155
You know as well as I do

522
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,367
no grown woman
in her right mind would date a cop.

523
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,749
Hey.

524
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,461
- You're gonna leave just like that?
- Not allowed in the building.

525
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,506
And it never hit you this might
come back some way you don't like?

526
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,843
- You talked to them?
- They asked questions. And Mercer?

527
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:36,927
(SCOFFS)

528
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,429
Really?

529
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,972
This has to do with you and me, doesn't it?

530
