You all right, bud?

Yeah, I'm okay.

39
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,901
Worried about the other kids?

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,269
How much longer do I
have to go to school?

41
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:24,981
A while longer, sorry to say.

42
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:30,789
You got that camping trip
coming up next weekend, huh?

43
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,308
That'll be fun, right?

44
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,180
Hey, you like your new kicks?

45
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,556
All right.
Go on, pal.

46
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,340
Mom or Richard will pick you up.

47
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:50,260
I'll see you in two weeks, yeah?

48
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:54,260
Head up.

49
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,068
Strong.

50
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:05,668
Hey, I love you, buddy.

51
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,380
Now be proud.

52
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,509
Hey, Chad.
Nice sweater.

53
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,188
I really like it.

54
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:25,668
Oh, and I like your shoes, too.
They match your hair.

55
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:28,981
It's great.

56
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,981
<i>It wasn't an incident.</i>

57
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,541
She was...
She was beaten.

58
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,140
Raped.

59
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:44,228
I'm sorry, I need to ask.

60
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,348
Your wife,
was she pregnant at the time?

61
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,900
We think so.

62
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:53,589
<i>You were trying
a long time, right?</i>

63
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,861
Mmm.

64
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,228
<i>Your son was born nine
months after what happened?</i>

65
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:06,181
<i>And they never caught the
man who did it, correct?</i>

66
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,101
No.

67
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:16,085
They never caught the guy.

68
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,300
And how is the relationship
with your son?

69
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,620
It's good.
It's real good.

70
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,389
I mean, he's a...
He's a true-blue kid.

71
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,548
You know?
I have...

72
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:32,388
I bought us... I got us
these digital recorders.

73
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:35,381
You see? So we can send
each other letters, like,

74
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,980
and express stuff, talk.

75
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:39,588
Book said that can
be effective, so...

76
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,620
<i>So why do you feel
your visitation rights</i>

77
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>should be expanded,
Detective Velcoro?</i>

78
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,101
Well, how about
I raised him alone

79
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,500
for two months
when she took off?

80
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,540
You know?
It was me and him.

81
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:55,220
She comes back,
she's talking divorce.

82
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:57,188
<i>Did either of you
request a paternity test?</i>

83
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:59,252
No.

84
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,268
My son is my son.

85
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,429
They're gonna ask that question.

86
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,997
<i>More rudely than I just did.</i>

87
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,700
Look, you're not getting...

88
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,660
There's me and him
and I'm his dad.

89
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,181
And I just need you to come
up with something, all right?

90
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:15,988
<i>You might have the wrong idea.</i>

91
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,100
Why? You like
paying taxes?

92
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,980
Just...

93
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,924
<i>You were with
LA Sheriff's Department</i>

94
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,972
<i>eight years before Vinci PD.</i>

95
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:28,341
<i>Anything there gonna hurt you?</i>

96
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:29,845
No.

97
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:31,700
I welcome judgment.

98
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,460
Deputy Velcoro, right?

99
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:10,981
This filth hurt your woman.

100
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,060
We know this guy.

101
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,428
Tell me.

102
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,780
Sometimes everybody's
not always on the same side.

103
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:24,981
Fine, it's business.

104
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:30,340
But this... no.

105
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,180
Fuck that.

106
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,708
Some things don't stand.

107
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,756
What do you know about it?

108
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,700
<i>Fits the description, right?</i>

109
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:10,740
My people know him.
He's not with us.

110
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,180
Amphetamine freak.

111
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,901
Bragged about it, said, well,

112
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:17,428
matched your wife's account.

113
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:18,789
How do you know
my wife's account?

114
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,340
This is only information, man.

115
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:22,532
Shit in the air.

116
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,501
I'm sharing with you.

117
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,508
I wanted to do this.

118
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,916
And now it's done.

119
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:34,980
That's it.

120
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,348
What do you want from me?

121
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,580
Me?

122
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,180
Yeah.

123
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,068
Not a thing.

124
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:44,948
Maybe we'll talk sometime.

125
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,748
Maybe not.

126
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:53,748
Your wife, she doing better?

127
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,340
Did you go to sleep?

128
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,580
No. Big day.

129
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,180
All the marbles.

130
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,428
Suits you better than you think.

131
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,188
Behold what was once a man.

132
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,340
You think I should have
sprung for the country club?

133
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:19,588
Don't put on airs.

134
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:22,388
You don't need to fake anything.

135
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,180
You're better than that.

136
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,348
<i>Caspere pitches at developers.</i>

137
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:59,508
Russians in for five.

138
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:02,964
Somebody taking Osip
through customs?

139
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:05,604
United Ambassadors are
meeting him at the ramp.

140
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,140
Maybe I should have
gone to the airport.

141
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,820
Don't want to look hungry.

142
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:11,188
Never do anything out of hunger,

143
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:12,820
not even eating.

144
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:18,388
What?

145
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:24,180
The fuck?
An eight-part series?

146
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:26,948
<i>Talks city corruptions,
sweatshops, nothing on us.</i>

147
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:28,948
Nothing, huh?

148
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,468
What's Osip gonna
tweak from this?

149
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,708
<i>That we're not buttoned
down at the least.</i>

150
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:36,260
Could put Tom or Ivar on the
reporter you want, but I think...

151
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,420
No, get Velcoro.

152
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,860
He won't get carried away.

153
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:42,628
If this story gets play, there
could be a state investigation.

154
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:44,308
But I'm saying
you're not touched.

155
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,548
This place is built on a
codependency of interest.

156
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,780
Worries me,
you talking so stupid.

157
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,748
Everybody gets touched.

158
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:09,780
<i>Hey, hey, I'm sorry.</i>

159
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,460
Look, don't let that ruin it.

160
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:12,989
Just... it took me
by surprise was all.

161
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,019
You know?
I didn't expect that.

162
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,828
Forget it.
Don't worry about it.

163
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,668
Oh, come on, we don't
have to stop, right?

164
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,827
You know, it's just
I wasn't really ready.

165
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:22,180
I didn't think...
I mean, I don't know.

166
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:24,180
<i>Do you...
Do you like that?</i>

167
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:26,100
Sometimes.

168
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:28,948
Okay. I just didn't
think that most women...

169
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,140
You know, you, would...
I'm just used to...

170
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:34,020
You know, I mean...
Have you done that a lot?

171
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,099
Let's not talk this to death.

172
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,988
Hey, I still got
some time before I report.

173
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,700
Yeah, I've got
to get ready for work.

174
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:46,068
Can we talk?
Please?

175
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:48,708
I mean, forget this,
what just happened.

176
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:50,868
You know, I think
this is good, right?

177
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,948
Depends on what's expected.

178
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,500
Well, I wanted...
I mean, I thought,

179
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:58,868
you know, maybe we could talk
about taking things forward.

180
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:01,140
Steve, you're a nice guy,
but right now is not the time

181
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:02,260
you want to have
this conversation.

182
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,388
Okay.
But if you...

183
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,668
Can you get your stuff?
'Cause I gotta get going.

184
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:10,948
Yeah.

185
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,348
Sheriff's Department!

186
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,707
- Yo, what's this?
- Hands! Hands! On your knees.

187
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:36,660
You running hookers?

188
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,340
<i>Right there!
Stay there!</i>

189
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:42,260
<i>Sheriff's Department!</i>

190
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,907
Hands up!
Get up! Get up!

191
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,620
- Clear!
- All right, everybody out.

192
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,460
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

193
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:49,828
<i>Right here, right here.
Let's go, move, move.</i>

194
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,427
<i>Clear in the back.</i>

195
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:59,348
- What is this?
- Webcams.

196
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,139
Private subscribers.
Totally legit.

197
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,580
We ain't broke no law of yours.

198
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,467
Got IDs for these girls?
Visas?

199
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,468
They American,
that what you mean?

200
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,020
Who here is an American?

201
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:09,988
Say "I am an American"
one by one.

202
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:11,380
I am an American.

203
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,659
I am an American.

204
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,220
<i>- I am an American.
- I am an American.</i>

205
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,459
- This is private property.
- Shut the fuck up.

206
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,300
Come on, now. Everybody out.
Let's go.

207
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:20,580
Let's go, on your feet.

208
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:21,907
Hey!

209
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:30,708
All right.

210
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:34,100
I ran this op
because I heard a rumor.

211
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,468
Unbelievable. Porn.

212
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,627
It's not porn, okay?

213
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:41,059
Not everybody has a problem with sex.
I'm a performer.

214
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,419
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

215
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:45,028
So this is like some kind
of Meryl Streep type

216
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:46,740
expressive creativity?

217
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:48,308
I... are you off
your meds?

218
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:51,667
God, you're
fucking hilarious, man.

219
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,620
You want people to stop screwing

220
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:55,540
and start taking drugs, right?

221
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,620
- That is so typical. So typical you.
- That's not...

222
00:14:57,622 --> 00:15:00,228
This isn't right.
It's not healthy.

223
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,124
Not healthy? Really? And what do
you know about being healthy?

224
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:05,188
When you walk,
it's like erasers clapping.

225
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,628
- Okay. Okay.
- This isn't your business.

226
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:10,420
So what is this? This is like
another "I hate my sister" cycle?

227
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,340
When does that stop?
You take another bust?

228
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:15,188
Bust doing what?
Masturbating?

229
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,940
I'm straight edge now, okay?
I'm totally clean.

230
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:21,950
Okay, then maybe you should
get back on something.

231
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:27,139
You know, what you say are my problems
are really your fucking problems.

232
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,508
Don't think we got anything.

233
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,763
They even have
the business license.

234
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,940
Yep.

235
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:16,820
<i>That low background
rumble is the sound</i>

236
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,579
<i>of paper shredders
on the third floor.</i>

237
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:21,268
First part of a series, it says.

238
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,020
<i>Talks about municipal salaries,</i>

239
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,299
<i>undocumented workers,</i>

240
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,763
pollution, policing practices.

241
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,620
He uses the word extortionary.

242
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:30,947
Are we expecting subpoenas?

243
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:32,788
You know Ben Caspere,
the city manager?

244
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,060
Gone missing. Second day he
hasn't shown up for work.

245
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:36,580
Lots of people looking for him.

246
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,627
- Fix on his phone?
- Shut off.

247
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,420
Mayor Chessani's on DEFCON.

248
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,419
His office has been
on the horn all morning.

249
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,100
Some big meeting today.

250
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,459
<i>Get with Teague Dixon on this.</i>

251
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:47,619
Caspere is officially
a missing person.

252
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:49,668
Dixon?

253
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,380
Seriously, Lieutenant, he's...

254
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,539
We're lucky just
to detail the two of you.

255
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,180
Uh, you know
where I should start?

256
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:02,979
City manager's office,
I imagine.

257
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,459
All right.

258
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,100
License and registration,
please, ma'am.

259
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:43,268
Uh, yes. Yeah.

260
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,220
Um... I, um...

261
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:54,819
don't have my license
on me right now.

262
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:56,820
It's at my house.

263
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,300
It's just, like,
a mile away in Malibu.

264
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,780
I'm really close.

265
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,419
You had anything to drink
this morning, ma'am?

266
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,387
To drink?

267
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,859
No. No, sir.

268
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,668
Well, I absolutely
have not ha...

269
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:11,859
Have not have had
anything to drink.

270
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:14,308
Would you step out of
the car for me, ma'am?

271
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,827
Sir,

272
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,547
please, if I get
in trouble again...

273
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:24,339
<i>Look, I pay my parents'
bills for them and...</i>

274
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,148
Um, look,

275
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,388
maybe you could
just escort me home

276
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,451
<i>and we could talk</i>

277
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:36,819
<i>or do something.</i>

278
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:39,939
A trade, like...

279
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:48,179
<i>Hell, I know, Paul.
We all know it's bullshit.</i>

280
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:51,860
<i>Soliciting a blowjob
to avoid a citation.</i>

281
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:53,172
<i>That ain't you, kid.</i>

282
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:55,748
But it's cut the tabloids
on that mercenary work.

283
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,547
This actress,
she violated her parole

284
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:01,779
by leaving the fucking house
to score, I guess.

285
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:05,107
Swerves into traffic
high, freaks,

286
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:06,419
I'm getting flushed.

287
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:07,699
- No.
- Yes.

288
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,740
Administrative leave with pay
just until IA finishes.

289
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,660
The Black Mountain work,

290
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,107
do you know how hard
they're looking?

291
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,467
You got a little
vacation, that's all.

292
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,987
Comes back around
about this girl,

293
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,939
and it will,
you'll be reinstated.

294
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,540
Back on the bike?

295
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,699
I like the bike, sir.

296
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:35,667
The highway, it suits me.

297
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,003
I am no good on the sidelines.

298
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,860
The other watch commanders

299
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:44,259
want me to convey
our full support.

300
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,339
Black Mountain.

301
00:19:57,941 --> 00:20:00,324
We were working
for America, sir.

302
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:02,340
I know you were, son.

303
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:19,539
Woodrugh, tell me it's true.

304
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,187
Hey, Bart.
Enjoying it?

305
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,499
- Yes.
- All right.

306
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:46,659
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

307
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:57,379
Mayor.
You heard from Caspere?

308
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,067
Newspaper shit
couldn't wait, huh?

309
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,428
Federal contracts come through,

310
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,779
they can write all the
stories they fucking want.

311
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,499
Newspaper's not
gonna be a problem.

312
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:11,379
Let's allow an afternoon
for celebration, gents.

313
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:14,979
See that? I tell people
it's her brains.

314
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:19,700
Maybe you'd like
something to eat?

315
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:21,379
Please.

316
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,027
- See you in a bit.
- Yeah.

317
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,827
Caspere hasn't been
to work in two days.

318
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,459
He hasn't? This is his
entire goddamn pitch.

319
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,899
Watch the mayor.
He's getting a load on.

320
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:43,219
You think I should have
sprung for the country club?

321
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,819
Nah.

322
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,787
What did you say
about looking hungry?

323
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,539
- Osip landed yet?
- Just touched down.

324
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,180
<i>- No family?
- Bachelor.</i>

325
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:58,707
<i>He didn't have any
trips on the books?</i>

326
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,260
Not the type to just take off?

327
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:03,475
No, sir. He wouldn't leave
without saying something.

328
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,187
He had been going up to Monterey

329
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:06,659
and the Russian River
Valley a lot,

330
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,907
but he wouldn't be
out of touch like this.

331
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,019
He mention anything
about the newspaper?

332
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,939
You know, that journalist.

333
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:15,347
Nothing I've heard.

334
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,587
I've only been here
about six weeks, though.

335
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,507
I didn't know
a whole lot about him yet.

336
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,827
Bad blood?
Any enemies?

337
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:25,107
I don't think so.

338
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,700
I mean, not like enemies.

339
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:30,467
Mr. Caspere sort of holds the
purse strings for a lot of stuff.

340
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,179
A lot of people
have to go through him.

341
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:33,939
Okay.

342
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,819
<i>Can you give us
a list of his properties?</i>

343
00:22:36,868 --> 00:22:40,147
I... well, I guess
that's okay.

344
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:42,931
Sure, it is.
We're the police.

345
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,339
Big place for one guy.

346
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,779
Hey, you see that, too, right?

347
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:24,500
Now we got us
something-something.

348
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:42,259
<i>You ever meet this guy?</i>

349
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:45,299
<i>Once or twice.
Some civic thing.</i>

350
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,499
I had no idea he was so...

351
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,595
<i>adventurous.</i>

352
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,539
You know, I got instructions.

353
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,899
Anything happens to me,
you burn all my shit quick.

354
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,099
Took the computer.

355
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:40,340
This is fucked.

356
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:43,220
We need a tech crew
in here for prints.

357
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:45,987
Anything they can catch.
Catalog what's left behind.

358
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,379
We should let the bosses know.

359
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:49,859
You sure they
don't know already?

360
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,299
<i>We need to treat this
like a 207.</i>

361
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:55,427
- What?
- Kidnapping.

362
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,107
Teague, we don't belong on this.

363
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,427
Francis Semyon.
Look now at you.

364
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,539
This man in the '90s,
what a terror.

365
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,747
The good life suits you.

366
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,939
Osip, have a champagne.

367
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,267
To friends and the future.

368
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,899
Hear, hear.

369
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,739
Frank, I don't think
you met Michael in Paris.

370
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,787
Michael Bugulari, my attorney.

371
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,539
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Semyon.

372
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,939
Osip, you should
meet some people.

373
00:25:35,988 --> 00:25:38,259
Contractors, developers.

374
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:48,019
If he turns up, I'm gonna put my
size 13s so far up Caspere's ass...

375
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,427
He'll spit shoelaces?

376
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,820
They should make the fucking
banks deliver these things.

377
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:32,771
<i>This the best they
got for police to do?</i>

378
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:34,787
<i>Take people's houses?</i>

379
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,963
They just make us
drop the paper, ma'am.

380
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,579
We are sorry.

381
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,899
<i>You want to be police?</i>

382
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:44,819
Why don't y'all find my sister?

383
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:48,067
Uh, who's that?
She missing?

384
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,939
My little sister Vera.

385
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:56,787
She's 24.

386
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,139
- How long she been missing?
- We're not sure.

387
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:01,027
I mean, about a month ago,

388
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,747
I hadn't heard from her
for a few weeks.

389
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,979
Started calling,
getting voice mail.

390
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,507
One day it's disconnected.

391
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,379
I go to her apartment.

392
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,787
Her old roommate says
she moved out a while back.

393
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,379
Took all her stuff.
They didn't know where.

394
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:20,019
Does she have a job?

395
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,243
She worked as a maid
at a couple of places.

396
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,659
But they said she quit.

397
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:27,219
Well, could you come down,

398
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:29,107
file a report, and we
could get started on it?

399
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,859
We told city police.
Never heard anything.

400
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:34,867
<i>Last place she worked,
this, like,</i>

401
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,163
religious place, an institute.

402
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,667
Panticapaeum?

403
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,667
The Panticapaeum Institute?

404
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,547
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

405
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,819
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

406
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,939
Our city manager Ben Caspere
was going to be here

407
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,619
to explain this,

408
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:03,107
but I suppose I can
approximate the information.

409
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,019
So everybody knows
Proposition 1 has passed.

410
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,579
And next year
construction will start

411
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:11,571
on a $68 billion
high-speed rail

412
00:28:11,604 --> 00:28:13,219
up Central California.

413
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:15,699
An undeveloped valley
adjacent to the rail

414
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:17,667
<i>and the coastal highway
has been purchased</i>

415
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,907
by several holding companies

416
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,067
anticipating
a commercial development

417
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,459
<i>that will be in line
for hundreds of millions</i>

418
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,027
in federal grants.

419
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,067
And the feds

420
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,306
have guaranteed cost overages.

421
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:04,979
<i>I was told something
a long time ago.</i>

422
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:07,219
<i>Let me share it with you.</i>

423
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:11,427
When you see
only with God's eyes,

424
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,515
you see only the truth.

425
00:29:14,547 --> 00:29:18,227
<i>And you recognize
a meaningless universe.</i>

426
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:23,539
Ginsberg said this to me once.

427
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,362
And it was a gift.

428
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,539
<i>So today's exercise</i>

429
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,739
<i>is to recognize the world
as meaningless</i>

430
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:34,610
and to understand
that God did not create

431
00:29:34,644 --> 00:29:36,419
a meaningless world.

432
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:40,931
<i>Hold both thoughts
as irrefutable and equal,</i>

433
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:44,499
because this is
how we must live now

434
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:46,979
in the final age of man.

435
00:29:57,188 --> 00:30:00,323
She gave her notice
maybe two months back.

436
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:01,619
Any forwarding address?

437
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:05,139
No, she said she got a new
job, less hours, more money.

438
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:08,387
Told me she was working,
like, some club circuit.

439
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,299
<i>She mentioned Sonoma, I think.</i>

440
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:13,235
All right if we talk
to the rest of your staff?

441
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:15,586
Of course.

442
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,579
Shh.

443
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,707
I may have seen her.

444
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:37,027
Just on the grounds, but, no.

445
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,347
No, not speak to her.

446
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,299
I wouldn't know her name.

447
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:44,899
I still have an office, but...

448
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:48,499
I don't spend as much
time here as I used to.

449
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:51,026
Just a few lectures a year.

450
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,986
I've wondered how you are.

451
00:31:57,108 --> 00:31:58,627
You talk to Athena?

452
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,643
A few days ago, actually.

453
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,579
She seems good.

454
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:05,586
Clear eye, has a job.

455
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,019
You talk to her that much?

456
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:09,667
Do you know what her job is?

457
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,899
Something on the Internet.

458
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,507
Web camera performances,
she said.

459
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,307
Athena, goddess of love.

460
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,938
I won't go near computers,
you understand.

461
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:22,387
She's doing porn.

462
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:25,619
Well, what exactly is porn?

463
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:28,466
I remember, you see,
when the status quo,

464
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,579
they labeled anything they
didn't like pornography.

465
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:32,099
Avant-garde cinema, then,

466
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:35,027
featuring live sex acts
for paying customers.

467
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,747
She has a different outlook.

468
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:39,186
Athena said it was theater.

469
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,546
God damn.

470
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,347
You don't have any feeling,
your daughter doing that?

471
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:45,779
Well, what would you
have me do, Antigone?

472
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:48,626
Since I've never been good
at guessing your needs.

473
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,507
Maybe talk her into doing
something with her life.

474
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:57,139
Maybe convey some guidance,

475
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,587
some values she could carry.

476
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,778
We have always disagreed here.

477
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,259
I am not comfortable
imposing my will on anyone

478
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:06,418
and I haven't been since 1978.

479
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:08,738
Not even to stop them
walking into a river.

480
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:10,258
Yes, not even then.

481
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:11,922
And if your mother's
flair for drama

482
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,356
had been more present
in her acting,

483
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,418
she might have gone on
to great things.

484
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,891
These totems,

485
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:32,979
they watch over
departed spirits.

486
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,027
I've always felt
your mother among them.

487
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,658
You won't even own it a little.

488
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:41,059
She abandoned
the two of you, I didn't.

489
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:45,778
You should spend less time
in a state of resistance

490
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,979
making up problems for yourself.

491
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:50,578
What does that mean?

492
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,818
A failed marriage,
a few relationships,

493
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,139
you're angry at the entire world

494
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:58,739
and men in particular

495
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,107
out of a false sense
of entitlement

496
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,706
for something
you never received.

497
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,586
Your entire personality

498
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,147
is an extended criticism
of my values.

499
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,938
Meant, I'm sure,

500
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:12,499
to compel me into engagement
through argument.

501
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,979
Do you even like what you do?

502
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,659
Or is it just a reflexive urge
toward authority out of defiance?

503
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,739
Talk to your daughter, prick.

504
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,547
Help her.

505
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:29,827
I just did.

506
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:38,547
- Hey, bud.
- Dad?

507
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,306
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, Ray.</i>

508
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,699
You're not till next Friday.

509
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:44,067
Hey, buddy, I knew you had
a camping trip coming up

510
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,899
and I just wanted to...
Here, it's a Coleman.

511
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:48,419
It's, like, top line.

512
00:34:48,468 --> 00:34:50,227
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

513
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:51,587
<i>Camping trip was last weekend.</i>

514
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:54,098
He ended up having
a stomachache.

515
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,747
Wait a minute.
Where's your shoes?

516
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:00,979
- What?
- He's wearing shoes. Ray, you been drinking?

517
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:03,698
Not those, the Nikes.

518
00:35:03,747 --> 00:35:06,226
The fucking LeBrons or whatever.

519
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,098
The tennis shoes he begged...

520
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,018
You know what I'm talking about.

521
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,507
I just didn't wear them.

522
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:14,258
You realize I tell when people
are lying for a living?

523
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,026
All right, Ray.
Let's talk about this later.

524
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,427
Is that...
Is that blood on your sleeve?

525
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:20,978
What happened to your shoes?

526
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,427
It was a little thing
that happened last week.

527
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:25,426
Boys.

528
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,946
What happened?

529
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:31,459
What happened to your shoes?

530
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:34,147
Ray, God damn it. They took his
shoes out of his gym locker.

531
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:35,699
And what?
What, shit on them?

532
00:35:35,748 --> 00:35:36,979
They cut 'em up.
That's it.

533
00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:38,579
Christ, man, come on.
This isn't good for him.

534
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,259
- Who was it, boy?
- Ray, stop it.

535
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:42,788
- Let's talk later somewhere else.
- Jesus, God, you fat pussy.

536
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,178
You're gonna give me
a kid's name right now

537
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,667
or I'll pull down your pants
and I'll spank you

538
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,106
in front of the fucking
cheerleading squad.

539
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:50,578
Don't look at him!
You look at me!

540
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:52,739
You tell me the name
of that kid, Chad.

541
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,378
I'm gonna count to three.

542
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:57,458
One, two...

543
00:35:57,507 --> 00:35:59,459
Aspen.
Aspen Conroy.

544
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:02,258
Aspen?
That's a boy's name?

545
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,835
- Chad.
- God damn it, Ray.

546
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:08,707
What the hell
is the matter with you?

547
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,819
Asshole.

548
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:19,682
We just had a... a thing,

549
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:21,987
me and you.

550
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,458
Totally, totally my fault.

551
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:30,898
Childhood is so scary.

552
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:35,779
I used...

553
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:38,978
I used to want
to be an astronaut.

554
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,747
But astronauts don't even
go to the moon anymore.

555
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,739
<i>Detective Velcoro?</i>

556
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,618
Yeah.

557
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,842
<i>Yeah, got that Conroy
address you wanted.</i>

558
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,890
<i>Place in Sherman Oaks.</i>

559
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,826
Go.

560
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,658
<i>Last name Conroy,
first name Wit.</i>

561
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,067
<i>982...</i>

562
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:33,539
And your pop,
he's a piece of work, huh?

563
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,019
Don't talk about
my family, Elvis.

564
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,419
<i>Come on back, baby.</i>

565
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:16,579
<i>I've got something for you.</i>

566
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,898
It's been a week,
Mr. Policeman.

567
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,178
Get that dick over here.

568
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:38,578
Hold that thought.
I'm pretty rank.

569
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,898
Let me jump in the shower.
I'm gonna get clean for you.

570
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:42,546
I like it when you stink.
I don't mind.

571
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:45,826
Five minutes
and I'll be right out.

572
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:47,299
Can I soap you up?

573
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:49,027
No, I like you the way you are.

574
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:52,226
One hot shower, I'm ready to go.

575
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,178
I'm timing you,
Officer Woodrugh.

576
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,787
Jeez, that was like 30 minutes.

577
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:54,707
I thought you had drowned.

578
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:56,338
What took you so...

579
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,466
It's been a long day.

580
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,979
I had to work some kinks out.

581
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:04,098
Well, I've got a place

582
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:06,946
right here where you can
work that kink out.

583
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:24,675
Osip, we talked
this through in Paris.

584
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,658
Caspere's absence
don't mean a thing.

585
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:28,338
It is happening, though.

586
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,898
Vinci tapped fed money
from the subway line,

587
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,578
and the same thing will happen

588
00:40:32,627 --> 00:40:35,298
on a much, much bigger scale
with the rail corridor.

589
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:37,138
Owned by our holding companies.

590
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:38,738
Set up through Catalast.

591
00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:44,179
This goes beyond us.
A legitimate legacy.

592
00:40:44,181 --> 00:40:48,178
Chance for the grandkids to be part of
one of those old California families.

593
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:50,226
Don't even remember where
the money comes from.

594
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:53,986
Let's talk more at dinner.

595
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,778
Give us a minute, friends.

596
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:17,698
I thought we already
had an agreement, Osip?

597
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:22,019
Frank, you know you have
my complete confidence,

598
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:25,266
but our organization
has very old rules.

599
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:26,898
Checks and balances.

600
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:29,426
I have to perform
my due diligence.

601
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:32,227
Sure. Sure.

602
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:35,155
But, Osip,
it's a buy-in.

603
00:41:35,187 --> 00:41:36,979
I thought you
were here to close.

604
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:40,370
I will close
when I'm ready to close.

605
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:41,938
Do not rush me, Frank.

606
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:50,738
Sure.

607
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,306
Yeah, of course.

608
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:55,938
You guys should relax.

609
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:57,826
Get some rest before dinner.

610
00:41:57,859 --> 00:41:59,698
I look forward
to meeting Caspere.

611
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:25,298
Fuckin' Caspere.

612
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,026
What could you have
to talk to my son about?

613
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:32,818
Relax, it's nothing.

614
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:35,586
Maybe I just want to ask him
about some stolen property.

615
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:38,706
Look, bud, you want
to call him out

616
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,186
and maybe we can take care of
this, you know, right here?

617
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:44,338
You don't even have
to tell the missus.

618
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:48,258
- Yeah, hold on. Um...
- Great.

619
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:52,338
<i>Hey, son? It'll just
be a second, honey.</i>

620
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:00,866
<i>This man's with the police.</i>

621
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:03,426
He says he has something to ask you.

622
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:06,418
You like to bully kids,
Ass-pen.

623
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:07,858
Hold on, what is this?

624
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,178
You're 12 years old
and you're already evil as fuck.

625
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:12,386
Hey, you can't talk...

626
00:43:13,747 --> 00:43:15,586
- No!
- You're gonna run out on your dad?

627
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:18,850
Take a look.
He's doing this for you.

628
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,218
Stop! Stop! Stop!

629
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:31,586
- Stop!
- Stop? Stop?

630
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:34,418
I thought that got you off, kid...
Seeing people in pain.

631
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:37,186
If you ever bully
or hurt anybody again,

632
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:39,058
I'll come back
and butt-fuck your father

633
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,618
with your mom's headless
corpse on this goddamn lawn.

634
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:47,698
12 years old, my ass.

635
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,066
Fuck you.

636
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:02,898
Oh, my God, Wit!

637
00:45:04,387 --> 00:45:06,818
What's this one?

638
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:08,578
The big one.

639
00:45:13,395 --> 00:45:15,378
I know you don't like
talking about the army,

640
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,346
but I keep wondering...

641
00:45:17,378 --> 00:45:19,538
It's not from the army.

642
00:45:19,571 --> 00:45:22,514
It's from before.

643
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:24,530
A long time ago.

644
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:32,818
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on something.

645
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:35,266
Just got to check it out.

646
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,106
How are you working
on something?

647
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:39,026
- You're on leave.
- <i> It's a side job, babe.</i>

648
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:41,362
Told a friend I'd help him out.

649
00:45:46,387 --> 00:45:48,386
That sounds like bullshit, Paul.

650
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,985
Hey, it's not.

651
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,938
I swear.

652
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,338
Are you ever
gonna spend the night?

653
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:04,050
Hey, there's no one else.

654
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:07,858
It's just right now
my life is kind of fucked.

655
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:10,098
I gotta keep working.

656
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,018
I need to do something.
I need to work.

657
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,002
You need to come back to bed.

658
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:26,145
It's just work.

659
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:27,938

00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,425
I asked him how long he thought
it took Stephen Hawking

674
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:32,498
to type a piece of
investigative journalism.

675
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:35,539
He ain't gonna be writing
that story no more.

676
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:37,394
Good. Yeah.

677
00:48:37,427 --> 00:48:39,778
Give him something to chew on.

678
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:54,658
Supposed to savor that.

679
00:48:54,707 --> 00:48:57,458
Yeah?
Let me try it again.

680
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,297
Tying one on?

681
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:11,698
Not particularly.

682
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,010
How's your kid?

683
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:18,866
You talk to that lawyer
I put you with?

684
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:21,618
Harris? Yeah. Yeah.
She's gonna see what she can do.

685
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,418
She said, you know,
don't get my hopes up.

686
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,577
Is your dinner okay, Ray?

687
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:32,658
- Yeah.
- You want something else?

688
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,498
No, thank you, darling.

689
00:49:39,347 --> 00:49:42,018
You seeing anybody?
A woman?

690
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:44,658
There something else
I'd be seeing?

691
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:49,202
Nah, not interested
in anything like that anymore.

692
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,506
<i>Need to get back

693
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:55,425
A good woman mitigates
our baser tendencies.

694
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,778
You got time.
Have more kids.

695
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:03,698
We're trying.

696
00:50:04,819 --> 00:50:08,098
Gonna be doing this IVF thing.

697
00:50:08,147 --> 00:50:09,458
I tell you,

698
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,097
I ain't looking forward
to jerking off in no cup.

699
00:50:12,146 --> 00:50:15,058
Huh.

700
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,626

at the Soho Bar.
