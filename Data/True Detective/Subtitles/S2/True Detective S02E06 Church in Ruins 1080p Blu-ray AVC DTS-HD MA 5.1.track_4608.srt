7

you gave me a man's name
on a piece of paper.

8
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,899
- I did.
- Because you knew what I'd do.

00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,278
I knew what I'd do.

10

Who was he to you, that man?

12
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,786
Me? Nobody.

13
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,372
Some greaser crankhead.

14

15

That didn't hurt.

But I have a sense of justice. You know that.

You wanted your hooks in a cop,

My eyes look the same as yours, you ask me.

181
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,845
They're gonna burn you.

182
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,597
- That remains to be seen.
- You better hope they do.

See if I'm whistling Dixie.

185
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,691
If they don't give you life,
I will have every inch of your flesh

186

removed with a cheese grater,
starting with your prick.

187

Your nuts, too.

196

I remembered something.

million in blue diamonds.

00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,243
Yeah, I was the one
you talked to on the phone.

Double homicide,

214
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,124
Woman was pregnant.

215
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,003
Margaret Osterman. I remember her name.

216
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,968

zero people of interest.

- Yeah, well...
- Nothing.

Place was looted right after
the actual robberies,

219
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,142
so no crime scene integrity.

220
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,230
Wasn't no looters, either.

You had to show me this?

229
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:07,694
They were hiding
in one of the display cabinets.

230
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,780
Had to stay like that for a long time.

231
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,952

232
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,794

Kids couldn't offer up anything?

236
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,476
They could barely talk.

237
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,604
