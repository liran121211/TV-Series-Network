from one of Catalast's holding companies,

177
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,482
and this other guy
fuck you out of Caspere's shares.

178

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,000
She said he was white.

184
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,501
You found Irina?

185
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,087
Sort of.

186
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,798
She's gone.

187
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,308
You got a name for me?

188
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,644
The man who put you on my wife's attacker?

189
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,107
I'll have it for you by the end of the day.

190
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,818
Word of honor.

191
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,281
I guess I'll continue
with the belief it wasn't you.

192
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,991
Uh-huh.

193
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,410
Ray,

194
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,747
go ahead and show yourself out just now.

195
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,209
I need a few minutes alone,

196
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,336
process the ins and outs of all this.

197
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,463
Sure.

198
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,757
I gotta go anyways.

199
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,022
Woodrugh, Velcoro.

200
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,484
The Rulfo girl said a policeman paid her
to pawn Caspere's stuff.

201
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,778
Look in LAPD service records, all right.

202
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,988
Find out where Holloway was in '92

203
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,907
and who else was in his squad.

204
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,369
Davis is meeting me this afternoon.
I want her to see those signatures in person.

205
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,413
ANI: Your sister put me onto you.

206
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,833
She said you were missing.

207
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,917
(SCOFFS)

208
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,340
And then this was delivered to her.

209
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,759
Contents of a mailbox you kept.

210
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,719
I need you to look at this stuff.

211
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,722
These pictures.

212
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,647
Oh, shit, man.

213
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,525
Forgot I kept that box.

214
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,945
Right.

215
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,573
Yeah, Tascha must have sent these.

216
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,743
Tascha? You know Ben Caspere?

217
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,705
He had a girl he introduced as Tascha.

218
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,250
Yeah.

219
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:45,547
I met Ben at the Panticapaeum Institute

220
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,591
when I was a maid.

221
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,718
He was the one.

222
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,095
He hooked me up on the circuit.

223
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,517
Tascha... God... Was his, like, favorite.

224
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,519
She's Hungarian.

225
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,688
(SCOFFS) But she had these plans.

226
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,275
Photos of these parties.

227
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,443
Iwarned her.

228
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,362
Fuck. Maybe she sent these as backup.

229
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,824
(SCOFFS) Bitch tried
to involve me in that shit.

230
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,326
She tried to blackmail them.

231
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,869
Iwarned her.

232
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,121
Dudes like this don't play.

233
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,041
All right, what about these diamonds?

234
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,584
They mean anything to you?

235
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,044
Those must be...

236
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:29,049
Yeah, she had said once
that Caspere had shown her these diamonds.

237
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,843
Said they were special-like.

238
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,261
What happened to Tascha?

239
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:42,145
Wherever we were, it was some place up north.

240
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,982
They found a camera.

241
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:51,821
So, I think there was a cabin out back.

242
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,075
It was Tony C and their guys.

243
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,244
And they took her into the woods.

244
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,328
Will you testify?

245
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,121
Fuck,no.

246
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,832
I was hammered anyway.

247
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,794
You know what?
Thinking about it, I don't know what I've seen.

248
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,587
Is that when you tried to get out?

249
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,715
I never tried to get out.

250
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,929
Girl fucked up.
All you gotta do is follow the rules.

251
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,931
I didn't want to get out.

252
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,766
You feel me?

253
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,643
I was never missing.

254
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,690
You didn't look like you wanted to be
where you were when I found you.

255
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,026
<i>Hook too much Mom on top of champagne.</i>

256
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,946
So what? It happens.

257
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,952
All right, so...

258
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,080
Who's the other girl?

259
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,249
Her name is Laura, maybe.

260
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,626
I ain't seen her in, like, five, six months.

261
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,503
Maybe they took her out to the cabin?

262
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,047
No, she wasn't dumb like Tascha.

263
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,342
Look, can I just get a ride?

264
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,929
- Or call somebody?
- Your sister's on her way.

265
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,184
What the fuck?
You don't think my sister's fucked up?

266
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,855
The way she waits hand and foot
on that panty-sniffing motherfucker?

267
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,315
Better than being strung out.

268
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,484
Yo, I have a place.

269
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,320
I got nice things.

270
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:17,032
I had a good thing with Tony and his people.

271
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,492
Maybe, and this is just a thought,

272
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,454
maybe you were put on Earth
for more than fucking.

273
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,499
Everything is fucking.

274
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,881
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

275
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,647
(CRYING) Oh, thank God.

276
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,819
No, stop. I am not going with you.

277
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,363
Fuck your <i>pervertido</i> husband.

278
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,449
- DANIELLE: He's different now.
- You need to lay low, Vera.

279
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,036
Stay with your sister.
I'll let you know when it's safe.

280
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,371
Till then, you're in danger.

281
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,540
You fucking <i>putas.</i> You put me in danger.

282
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,418
And I'm the only one who can get you out.

283
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,838
You reach out to those men,
I'll let them know you talked to a cop,

284
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,548
and they'll paint a cabin with you.

285
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,305
(KEYBOARD CLICKING)

286
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,272
You motherfuckers.

287
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,498
Holy fuck.

288
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,756
Shit.

289
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,934
Late today.

290
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,061
Had to get Ivar covering the pit.

291
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,982
Sorry, boss. I was taking care of some stuff.

292
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,153
The girls had a little private thing last night.

293
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,071
15 Gs.

294
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,615
- Yours.
- Holy cow.

295
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,119
You must be what they call
a natural-born pimp.

296
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:30,457
Me, I always saw a difference
between a whore and a pimp.

297
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,376
A whore can still have integrity.

298
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,797
You want to move me up, let me know.

299
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,884
That's the thing, right?

300
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,261
There's nothing to move you up to.

301
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,638
Is there?

302
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,515
I mean,

303
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,352
all my shit's been taken down to the street.

304
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,899
You'll get it back, boss.

305
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,902
Everybody knows you will.

306
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,321
Stan was following you.

307
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,825
And he wasn't the subtlest guy in the world,

308
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,827
so I'm guessing that you spotted the tail.

309
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,705
Hey, look, boss. I don't know...

310
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,166
What did he see you doing

311
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,627
caused you to punch his ticket like that?

312
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,756
You took his eyes. Why?

313
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,592
To make it look connected to Caspere?

314
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,388
Truth is your only play right now,

315
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:32,560
because you fucked up
letting yourself be alone

316
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,355
in this room with me.

317
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:39,025
Look, Frank,
there's been a mistake somewhere.

318
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,361
You're arrogant.

319
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,363
Or else you never would have walked in here.

320
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,235
Have I got a fucking story for you.

321
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,406
Hell.

Please. Frank, please.

328
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,728
- I can...
- You can what? Talk?

329
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,855
Osip? His crew?

330
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,442
Caspere? Stan?

331
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,027
Osip's people...

332
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,862
They've been running Eastern bloc girls

333
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,615
through Southern California
for over a year, Frank.

334
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:12,619
Osip's been moving to take your spot
ever since your meeting in Paris.

335
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,037
With your help, huh?

336
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,330
(GROANS)

337
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,248
They reached out.

338
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,627
All these moves you were making,
you'd have done the same.

339
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,670
You think they give a shit about handshakes?

340
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,881
You never should have brought this to Osip.

-(SQUISHING)
-(GROANS)

342
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:34,849
Fuck.

(CHOKING)

344
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,898
You kill Caspere? Or did Osip?

345
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,651
No, no. Nobody knows who that was, man.
Nobody.

346
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,235
So where's the money I gave him?

347
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,406
Caspere was always gonna fuck you, Frank.
Osip was backing the play.

348
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,702
Osip and Tony Chessani,
they're absorbing Caspere's action?

349
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:59,332
- Why'd you kill Stan?
- He saw me meeting Osip and his guy.

350
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,293
He wanted a payoff, Frank.
He tried blackmailing me.

351
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,588
- Bullshit.
- What the fuck? It's "bullshit"?

352
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:09,133
You got all these big plans, land deals.
Where was that supposed to leave us?

353
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,805
You taught me,
"Make your own opportunities."

354
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,891
That guy way back, Velcoro's wife,

355
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,560
who was that guy you gave up?

356
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:22,313
What? Velcoro? Frank, what...

357
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:26,109
He didn't hurt Ray's wife. Who was he?

358
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,486
This fucking meth head.

359
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,281
He said I ripped him off.

539
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,407
What are you planning, Frank?

540
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,327
You might say my ship's come in.

541
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,371
And who sails this ship?

542
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,171
(DOOR CLOSES)

543
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,298
You got an APB on Davis's murder?

544
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,759
Davis was supposed to meet me
and get the whole story.

545
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:41,927
Found her there dead.

546
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,722
They probably did it with one of the pieces
I keep at home.

547
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:49,143
I switched license plates at a fucking mall.

548
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:52,312
That's it, then. She was our only authority.

549
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,773
You and her are fugitives.

550
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,071
Well, it doesn't make sense.

551
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,366
It was cops.

552
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,786
Back in the '92 robbery,

553
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,955
Burris and Dixon were serving
under Holloway.

554
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,291
Caspere worked at the same station.

555
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,042
Jewelry store was their district.

556
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,795
Caspere probably helped them
move the stones.

557
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,547
They were all working together.

558
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,215
Orphaned two kids.

559
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,801
Leonard and Laura.

560
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,764
So that's how they bought in, the diamonds.

561
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:30,934
And whatever they got for them
went to Chessani.

562
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:36,607
Next couple of years,
they migrate into six-figure salaries in Vinci.

563
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,484
Their own private fiefdom.

564
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,402
Except Dixon.

565
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,154
He was just a regular dick.

566
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,824
Dixon was checking in on those diamonds
before we ever found 'em.

567
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,162
Maybe he knew Caspere held onto 'em.

568
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,665
Maybe it meant leverage for him.

569
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,877
But Dixon taking that headshot...
I checked every arrest record.

570
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,171
Burris busted Ledo Amarilla in '06.

571
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,049
Released after interrogation, no notes kept.

572
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,467
That whole day was a setup.

573
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,844
Amarilla, too.

574
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,971
He thought it was gonna go
a different way, I think.

575
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,974
That's what Caspere's place was tossed for.

576
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:14,353
Burris, Holloway, Dixon, whoever,
and they were looking for those diamonds.

577
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:17,940
The last piece of evidence
for a 23-year-old double murder.

578
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,942
Tascha was gonna blackmail Caspere.

579
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,946
So Holloway, Burris, they killed Caspere.

580
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,365
ANI: Thatjust... That doesn't make sense.

581
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,701
Him dying bought them all exposure,
kicked this whole thing off.

582
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:30,827
And if they had Caspere,

583
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:33,205
why wouldn't they torture him
for the fucking diamonds?

584
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,289
I mean, it's... (GROANS)

585
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,793
-(SIGHS)
-(PHONE BUZZES)

586
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,017
I gotta head home soon.

587
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:55,811
All right.

588
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,354
Could you take this to State?

589
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,523
RAY: State? Davis is dead.

590
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:00,899
Geldof was at the party.

591
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,985
How about Ventura Sheriff?

592
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,319
Oh.

593
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,488
They're looking to do me.

594
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,324
And what have we got?

595
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,327
Some documents for a holding company?

596
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:15,330
A theory on some rogue cops from '92?

597
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,958
- Feds?
- Not without more.

598
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,961
Unless one of you guys got a friend there,
I don't see protection.

599
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,386
That ain't a fucking mayor.

600
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:33,223
That's a homunculus state corporations
slid into office.

601
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,435
Who the fuck even is Los Angeles?

602
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:39,521
Nobody can say. See? Nobody knows.

603
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,523
So, nobody expects shit to actually work.

604
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,526
Me, my family. We are Vinci.

605
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,237
We're a goddamn political dynasty.

606
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,699
Like the Kennedys.

607
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,995
Do me a favor, hum my balls 3 little, huh?

608
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,585
Maybe later.

609
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,295
Frank.

610
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,133
Another gin.

611
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,718
Time to hit the road, Austin.

612
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:11,762
(LAUGHS)

613
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,889
You don't tell me what time it is.

614
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,100
I'm just thinking you might want to get home
and take care of business.

615
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:18,644
What the fuck's that mean?

616
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:22,230
Your boy, Prince Tony, has been greasing
the skids to slide into your chair.

617
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,816
Buying the Attorney General with his hookers.

618
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,029
Working with a Russian named Osip Agranov,
Jacob McCandless from Catalast.

619
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,490
All this in your house, behind your back.

620
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,993
Sober up.
You might realize you're getting fucked.

621
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:38,705
Now get out of here. Closing time all around.

622
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,930
I'd have known,
I'd have gotten the red carpet out.

623
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,807
Let me make you a drink.

624
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,951
Our company bought the lien here, Frank.

625
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,744
Same thing at the Lux.

626
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,330
The clubs are ours.

627
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:22,207
The clubs?

628
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,585
Shit, man.
I'm working just to stay in the black, here.

629
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,547
We think we can do better.

630
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,842
Bring in our own girls,
move our own products,

631
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,135
wash our own money.

632
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,138
We're going to be doing
a lot of business in California now.

633
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:41,810
Good for you.

634
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,021
I tell you, hindsight,

635
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,109
I was out of my element with that land stuff.

636
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,402
Stick to what you know, right?

637
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:54,489
I must say,
you're taking this better than expected.

638
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:59,035
Is Mr. Churchman around? Blake?

639
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,537
Shit, no.

640
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,248
Guy's been around less the last three months
than my wife's period.

641
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,668
You know, Frank, my board,

642
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,797
they thought we should take you out.

643
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:16,845
I said, "Frank Semyon understands business.
He'll adjust."

644
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,723
So what are my prospects? Straight up.

645
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,728
You can manage the day-to-day
of the casino and the club.

646
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,938
We put you on salary.

647
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,982
I said, "Frank knows clubs."

648
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,196
I had ideas of getting out of this, you know.

649
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,407
There's no such thing for you, Frank.

650
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,285
That world isn't yours. You manage clubs.

651
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,872
In time, we find something new to build on.

652
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,001
Well, what can I say to that?

653
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:51,463
After all, no fighting what you can't change.

654
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,800
Look, I ain't lasted this long

655
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,177
without some knowledge
of my own limitations.

656
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,348
And it is my hope
that we can fucking build on this.

657
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,184
Going into the future.

658
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:05,811
(GLASSES CLINK)

659
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,491
- Velcoro.
<i>- What's up, man?</i>

660
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:22,577
I wanted to call.

661
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,413
I think...

662
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,084
I ain't told anybody about this

663
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:32,629
other thing.

664
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,383
<i>But somebody sent me these pictures.</i>

665
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,843
<i>Pictures of me.</i>

666
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,511
What? Of our thing?

667
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,430
<i>No, it's something else. This is mine.</i>

668
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,102
I think I might be walking into something.

669
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,313
<i>Then don't.</i>

670
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,902
- I'll call <i>you</i> back.
<i>- Listen, hold on. Wait...</i>

671
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,625
What the fuck is this?

672
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,127
Orders.

673
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,879
I gotta take your gun.

674
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,256
Don't make a thing of it.
You've got eyes all over you.

675
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,807
Come on, I can get you through this.

676
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:30,395
Black Mountain?

677
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,063
Not anymore.

678
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,149
Ares Security. We rebranded.

679
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,985
We just service one client now,
Catalast Group.

680
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,659
When you got in touch, what was that?

681
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,120
I had orders to check on you.

682
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,748
After all that press stuff,

683
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,708
make sure you kept confidentiality.

684
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:57,589
This is your situation. I didn't make it.

685
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,133
Let's go.

686
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:02,844
They just wanna talk.

687
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,445
That was Woodrugh.

688
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,448
Something's up with him.

689
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,117
- What?
- I don't know.

690
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:27,243
He said he'd call me back.

691
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:31,539
We need an exit strategy.
Get out of the country.

692
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,416
There's no way they'll let us go to trial.

693
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:37,003
You hear me?

694
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,798
Vera said this girl's name was Laura.

695
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,050
Does she look... She look familiar?

696
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,428
I swear, there's something...

697
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:48,264
No. Her name is Erica.

698
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,559
From the city manager's office.

699
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,397
She was Caspere's secretary.

700
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,982
- You met her on the movie set.
- Yeah.

701
00:46:57,065 --> 00:47:00,610
Woodrugh said
one of the orphans in that robbery,

702
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:01,945
-her name was Laura.
- Laura.

703
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,284
- You got it?
- Yeah, it's here.

704
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,912
Let me see.

705
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,333
I don't know. What do you think?

706
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,358
You've been looking for information
about me, son.

707
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:43,069
Well, here's your chance to ask.

708
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,369
All right, Mr. Patterson. Thank you.

709
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,956
No, this was very helpful.

710
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,127
Moved out of her apartment six weeks ago.

711
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,213
Quit the city manager's
office around that time.

712
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:04,132
Woodrugh could do a trace on her.
Credit cards, whatever.

713
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,051
