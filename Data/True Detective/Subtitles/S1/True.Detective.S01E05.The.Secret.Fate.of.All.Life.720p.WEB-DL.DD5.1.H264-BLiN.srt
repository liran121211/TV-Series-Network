00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:10,174
¶

2
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,722
¶

3
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,423
Uhh...

4
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,292
What happened to your face?

5
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,360
Pool game the other night.

6
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:46,330
Called the wrong dude
on cheating.

7
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,367
You got to watch that.

8
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:54,238
What do you want again?

9
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,174
I'm repping some people.

10
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,843
Yeah. They want to get
to the good cook.

11
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,611
They'll trade you
or the IC Brotherhood,

12
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:05,183
however you want to do it,
coke for crystal.

13
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,220
Why am I not talking to Miles?

14
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,523
Oh, me and Ginger go way back,

15
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,526
boosted together.

16
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,661
You ain't saying much.

17
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,564
I figure I let my man
give you the details.

18
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,399
Look.
This shit I got,

19
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,768
you can step on it 5, 6 times.

20
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,835
It'll still kick.

21
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,405
Just means you got
to cook a little more

22
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,209
for a lot more profit.

23
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:34,478
Nah.

24
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,681
I ain't go no use for it

25
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,815
or your money.

26
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,219
What, money don't spend?

27
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,524
I can see your soul
at the edges of your eyes.

28
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,528
It's corrosive, like acid.

29
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,497
You got a demon, little man,

30
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,999
and I don't like your face.

31
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,903
It makes me want
to do things to it.

32
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:04,308
Ginger, you call me again,
I'm setting Miles on you.

33
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,713
I see you again,

34
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,382
I'm putting you down.

35
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,585
There's a shadow on you, son.

36
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,634
¶

37
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,412
Marty, you got him?

38
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,948
You fucking better, the
shit I've been though.

39
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,017
I do. I got him.

40
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,951
We're on empty roads now.

41
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,021
So I got to drop back,
or he'll spot the tail.

42
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,555
OK. That's
Reggie Ledoux's

43
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,990
cook partner Dewall.

44
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,525
Birddog him, Marty.

45
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,459
You got it.

46
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,594
What's your location?

47
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,431
Just south of I-10 along
the Creole Nature Trail

48
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,999
heading towards Carlyss.

49
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,067
Hurry up, man.

50
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,936
Copy that.
On my way.

51
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,453
How we doing back there, Ginger?

52
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,655
Fuck you, motherfucker.

53
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,659
Aah!
Yeah.

54
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,464
How'd you get onto Ledoux?

55
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,533
One of my old CI's tipped me off

56
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,070
to the location
of his cook house.

57
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,007
So I came back on the job.

58
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:47,778
Didn't want anybody else
to catch him, bring him in.

59
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,948
Look. You want my help?

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,017
Just show me the rest
of the file.

61
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,121
Why are you so hot to see
the new discovery file, man?

62
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:00,825
Well, why are y'all...

63
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,962
so hot to not give it to me?

64
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,733
It's supposed to be like
a consultation, right?

65
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,103
Yeah, but you go first.

66
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,871
You take me through it,

67
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,141
and I'll let you
see what we got.

68
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,115
I'll hold you to that.

69
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,474
Where's Ginger?

70
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,043
Wrapped up in a ditch.
What you got?

71
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,813
Well, lost him and then
had to double back

72
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,649
a few times till
I found the exit.

73
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,584
That's his truck there.

74
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,721
We're gonna have
to call this in, Rust.

75
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,589
Eh, we don't want to do that.

76
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,958
Troops will come,
flood these woods.

77
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,428
They could scatter.

78
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,897
All right.

79
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,866
We ain't gonna
find him from here.

80
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,141
You ever been hunting, Marty?

81
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,010
Uh, yeah...

82
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,113
10-point buck
year before last,

83
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,749
50 yards.

84
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,884
I'm not talking about
sitting in a treehouse

85
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,686
waiting to ambush a buck coming

86
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,788
to sniff your gash bait.

87
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,490
Talking about tracking.

88
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,758
Jesus, you're a prick.

89
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,060
Look. We find the place.
We come back here.

90
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,961
We call it in.

91
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,631
One of us stays
surveillance, yeah?

92
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,601
I can live with that.

93
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,936
Let's go.

94
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,937
Now, you got a tip

95
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,606
where Ledoux cooks,
and Cohle came back

96
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,708
from wherever he was.

97
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,877
You knew it was
gonna get here, man.

98
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,714
Just the once,
the way you tell it.

99
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,851
I'll tell it the same way
that I told the shooting board

100
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,921
and every cop bar
between Houston and Biloxi,

101
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,891
and you know why the story
is always the same

102
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,159
17 years gone?

103
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,929
Because it only went down
the one way.

104
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,730
¶

105
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,766
Now, Rust's dad taught him
bowhunting.

106
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,670
You know, you had
to track game till you got

107
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,107
within maybe 30 yards of it.

108
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:42,753
Now, this enabled us
to discern the suspect's path

109
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:47,191
while sidestepping various
anti-intruder devices

110
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,226
they installed.

111
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,706
Tripwires back there.
Clearing is probably mined.

112
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,242
All right.
How you want to do it?

113
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:18,148
You go back. Call it in.
I'll wait here.

114
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,018
You're gonna hold position?

115
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,287
Yep.

116
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:30,094
Do it now, Marty.

117
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,695
Fuck you.

118
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,132
You ain't doing this without me.

119
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:50,914
All right.
Stay low.

120
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:57,054
We were just about to turn back,

121
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,990
call in parish, state, whoever.

122
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,258
I mean, we had the location.

123
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,928
We had our suspects identified
at the location, you know?

124
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,331
Might as well
just leave the shit be

125
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,266
and hand it off.

126
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,903
That ain't what happened.
Hmm.

127
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:17,441
No. As soon as we started
to back off, man...

128
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,308
Blam!

129
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,444
Bullets cut through
right near Rust's head.

130
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,448
We dove opposite ways
into the high growth,

131
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,050
but they'd already spotted us,

132
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,385
and they had something
high-velocity.

133
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,723
Boom! Blew apart this tree
between us.

134
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,124
I mean, it was on.

135
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,829
¶

136
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,230
Hmm. Heavy shit...

137
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,701
Like ferns and whatnot
bursting all around us,

138
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,835
bark flying off of trees.

139
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,238
I mean we were
in a bucket shitstorm.

140
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,263
Shit.

141
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:10,187
State police.

142
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,556
Put your hands on your head.

143
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,025
Put them on your head now.

144
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,394
Don't even think about it.

145
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,130
Put your hands
on your head right now.

146
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,033
Intertwine your fingers.

147
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,301
Do it.

148
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,436
Back up toward me.

149
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:34,077
Down on your knees.
Go on.

150
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,186
It's time, isn't it?

151
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,587
The black stars.

152
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,509
Shut the fuck up.

153
00:13:57,535 --> 00:14:00,971
They'd spotted us
before we crossed the forest.

154
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:05,475
So all we could do
was duck for cover, dig in,

155
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,346
try getting closer.

156
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,216
It was chaos.

157
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,936
The black stars rise.

158
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,405
Why the antlers?

159
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,578
Freeze, motherfucker.

160
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,083
Put it down. Hands up.
State police.

161
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,260
Set it down.

162
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,096
I know what happens next.

163
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,365
I saw you in my dream.

164
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,602
You're in Carcosa now with me.

165
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,038
He sees you.

166
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,676
Marty!

167
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,521
You'll do this again.

168
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,256
Time is a flat circle.

169
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,659
Listen, Nietzsche.
Shut the fuck up.

170
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,329
Put it down. Marty!

171
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,364
There you go.

172
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,000
Black star.

173
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:41,305
Put your hands on your head.

174
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:12,669
While I was hunkered down
behind this old, decrepit boat,

175
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,638
Captain America Marty Hart

176
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,540
decides he's gonna run
deep into the woods,

177
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,141
flank around the back
of the house

178
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,277
where Ledoux is firing
at us, right?

179
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,745
Well, he sneaks up behind Ledoux

180
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:26,583
and just as Ledoux turns,
bam, popped one off in him...

181
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,152
Head shot, clean...
Dropped him.

182
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,122
Now, his buddy Dewall,
he made a run for it,

183
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,493
and his homemade,
cracker-ass security system

184
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,629
took care of the rest.

185
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,499
¶

186
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,135
Oh, fuck.

187
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,104
Get the cuffs off him

188
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,372
before his blood settles.

189
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,375
We got to make this look right.

190
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:01,651
Goddamn. Fuck.

191
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,210
What do we do, Rust?

192
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,111
Oh, fuck him.

193
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,313
Good to see you
commit to something.

194
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,348
Now go see to the kids.

195
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,251
Don't bring them out
until I say so.

196
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:48,265
After we confirmed two deaths

197
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,168
and searched the rest
of the premises,

198
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,371
that's when we found
the two children.

199
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,373
I mean, we got very lucky.

200
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,243
We just as easily
could've been chewed to pieces

201
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:05,182
by an AK on approach.

202
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:20,630
I can say that I walked
away from the experience

203
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:27,571
with a greater respect
for the sanctity of human life.

204
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,872
Yeah.

205
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,373
Thank you, detective.

206
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,575
I believe I speak for the board

207
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,709
when I commend you
on the heroism

208
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,879
displayed by you
and Detective Hart.

209
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,347
¶

210
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,885
No. We were doing
our jobs, sir.

211
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,397
There were the twig sculptures

212
00:18:54,399 --> 00:19:00,504
and the LSD on hand matched
that in Dora Lange.

213
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:06,910
Everybody was pretty satisfied
that we got our man.

214
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:17,787
The boy
had been missing since January.

215
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,525
He'd been dead less than a day.

216
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,830
The girl, she hadn't been
reported yet.

217
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:32,469
She was from St. Landry,
catatonic when we found her.

218
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:41,778
Why should I live
in history, huh?

219
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,948
Fuck, I don't want to know
anything anymore.

220
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,285
This is a world
where nothing is solved.

221
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:53,290
Someone once told me,
"Time is a flat circle."

222
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,661
Everything we've ever done
or will do

223
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,896
we're gonna do over and over
and over again...

224
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,364
Good job, y'all.

225
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,867
And that little boy
and that little girl,

226
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:08,972
they're gonna be
in that room again...

227
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:13,543
and again...

228
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,545
and again...

229
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,914
forever.

230
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,750
Cohle, you couldn't
manage to get shot?

231
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,885
Next time.

232
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,654
Thanks for not doubting us.

233
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,355
Never did.

234
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,892
Here they come.
Marty, our hero.

235
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,861
Way to go, boys.

236
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,800
Little extra pouring

237
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,469
while I finish this up

238
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,471
with the semicelebrities?

239
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,873
There's plenty of news stories

240
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,742
if you care to find them.

241
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,512
I got promoted
to detective sergeant.

242
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,983
Rust got a commendation
for bravery,

243
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,718
basically because I insisted,

244
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,720
and things were pretty good
for a while, I guess.

245
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:03,960
¶

246
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,663
Come on.
Get your speed up.

247
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:12,369
Ooh. All right.

248
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,413
Maggie came around.

249
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,583
Just, you know,
a lot of talking, counseling,

250
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:31,421
and maybe being in a shootout
kind of opened her up

251
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:37,327
to forgiveness
or the possibility.

252
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,929
Right to the wall.
Right to the wall.

253
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,332
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh!

254
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,434
Oh, thank God.

255
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,935
All right.
Go take off your skates.

256
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:46,936
It's time to go.
No, no.

257
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,972
Please, please, Mom?
One more time. One more time.

258
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,708
All right. One more time around,
you take them off, OK?

259
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,310
Is Daddy coming home yet?

260
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,377
One more time around.

261
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,613
Go on. One more time.
One more time.

262
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,748
OK.

263
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:03,053
Thanks.
I needed that.

264
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,323
I think they did, too.

265
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,793
Were there others?
What?

266
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,829
Besides her, were there others?

267
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,067
No.

268
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:21,037
No...
and listen.

269
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,673
That was a different person.

270
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,510
I lost it, you know,
just a little.

271
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,446
I...

272
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,816
I'm back.
I'm begging.

273
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,117
I keep begging.

274
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,120
I'll go to my grave begging you.

275
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:41,491
It's not just the affair.

276
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,627
You used to be a good man.

277
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,698
Cut the booze, 5 weeks now.

278
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,069
I'm in a program...
Promise Keepers.

279
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:06,616
You have a long road to climb.

280
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,152
Yes. I do.

281
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:20,663
A few years,

282
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,866
good ones.

283
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,768
¶

284
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,870
Down the line,
one of those setups

285
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,140
Maggie was so intent on
finally hit,

286
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,708
doctor, no less.

287
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,178
Yeah. She and Rust
had a thing, few years.

288
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,546
Ha ha ha!

289
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,481
He's
conflict-oriented.

290
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,450
So when I deny him
small arguments,

291
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,420
it builds up his energy.

292
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:45,422
Wow.
Wow.

293
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:50,059
Yeah. Are you ever
a match for this dude.

294
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,595
Look.
You know about Rust.

295
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,532
During those 7 years,
he probably pulled more assists

296
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,535
than any other detective
in the state.

297
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,103
Word got around quick.

298
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,571
You want a confession,

299
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,541
see if State Detective Cohle
is available.

300
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,509
Your interview technique.

301
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:10,914
Sure there isn't some
secret you can pass on?

302
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:20,824
Look. Everybody knows there's
something wrong with them.

303
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,760
They just don't know what it is.

304
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,595
Everybody wants confession.

305
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,665
Everybody wants
some cathartic narrative for it,

306
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,701
the guilty especially...

307
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,971
oh, but everybody is guilty.

308
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,906
¶

309
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,654
You know the good years
when you're in them,

310
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,557
or you just wait for them
until you get ass cancer

311
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,129
and realize that the good years
came and went?

312
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:04,067
Because there's a feeling...
You might notice it sometimes...

313
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:10,940
This feeling like life has
slipped through your fingers...

314
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,646
like the future is behind you,

315
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:21,084
like it's always
been behind you.

316
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:28,258
You know, I cleaned up,
but maybe I didn't change,

317
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,593
not the way I needed to.

318
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,629
Give it back.

319
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:36,866
Give it back!

320
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,936
Remember what I said
about the detective's curse?

321
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:44,874
Solution to my whole life
was right under my nose...

322
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:49,112
That woman, those kids...

323
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:55,285
And I was watching
everything else.

324
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:05,762
See, infidelity
is one kind of sin,

325
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:10,300
but my true failure
was inattention.

326
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:14,037
I understand that now.

327
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:51,708
Hey, Audrey...
Audrey...

328
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,276
Ha ha.

329
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,380
So when do you
think things started to,

330
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,383
how you put it, change again

331
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,019
with Detective Cohle?

332
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:07,924
Early on, 2002,
but that was his life.

333
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,194
Mine was steady, like I said.

334
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,263
I'm just trying to understand.

335
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,265
What is it you're going for?

336
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,868
What's the message?

337
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,238
There is no message.
It's just me.

338
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,239
It's just...

339
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,374
Well, what's just you...

340
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,776
Your hair, your clothes, your...

341
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,245
I mean, I look at Macie...

342
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,813
Women don't have to look

343
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,415
like you want them to, Dad.

344
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,916
No. Women,
but I'm talking

345
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,351
about my teenage daughter,

346
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,786
and I'm not trying to tell you

347
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,887
what to wear or anything.

348
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:38,988
I'm just trying
to understand it.

349
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,758
Well, who told you
you had to understand?

350
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,292
Why would you?

351
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,872
So...

352
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,206
I hear you made cheerleader.

353
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,008
Yeah. There are,
like, 10 other girls

354
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,876
who didn't get it.

355
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:04,347
Hmm, I didn't know they had
eighth-grade cheerleaders.

356
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,048
Well...

357
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,217
Same as there's
football players.

358
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,320
¶

359
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:30,473
Tell us what
you know about his girl.

360
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,241
Yeah. Laurie. Yeah.

361
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:37,013
She became chief of something,
Lafayette General, I believe.

362
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,383
You know what
happened there between them?

363
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,153
What always happens
between men and women?

364
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,289
Reality.

365
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:09,912
Dad...

366
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,849
Tell it to your mother.

367
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:30,099
Deputy found her

368
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,201
parked in a car with two boys.

369
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:36,839
Come here.
Get over here.

370
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:42,211
What?

371
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:48,117
Yeah, in states
of undress, you know...

372
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,853
like fucking.

373
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,455
Boys are 19 and 20.

374
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,823
Got them in holding
for the night,

375
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:57,426
haven't decided whether to
press stat. rape charges.

376
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,561
What?
You can't do that.

377
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,231
I can do anything I
goddamn want to those boys.

378
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,800
You think about that.

379
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,870
Audrey, look at me.

380
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,839
Look at me.

381
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:13,276
What are you
thinking? God.

382
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,280
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh,

383
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,981
or is this one of those things

384
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,983
that I'll never understand,

385
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:25,588
you know, being the captain
of the varsity slut team?

386
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,824
Marty!

387
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:32,061
Fuck you.

388
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:36,966
¶

389
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,937
Get in your fucking room.

390
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,271
Ow!

391
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,511
Mom, she hit my head.

392
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,180
Go to bed.
This isn't about you.

393
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:56,152
Audrey, open the door.

394
00:30:56,154 --> 00:31:00,857
Open the door, Audrey.

395
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,363
Audrey, it's just
you and me, honey.

396
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,966
See...

397
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:14,370
you need to tell me
what's going on.

398
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,506
Audrey, open the door, please.

399
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,211
Years.

400
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,379
You ever heard
of something called

401
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,548
the M-brane theory,
detectives?

402
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,584
No. That's
over my head.

403
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,988
It's like in this universe,

404
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:38,261
we process time
linearly forward...

405
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:42,999
but outside of our spacetime,

406
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,936
from what would be a
fourth-dimensional perspective,

407
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,173
time wouldn't exist,

408
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:56,012
and from that vantage,
could we attain it...

409
00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:00,283
we'd see...

410
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:05,388
our spacetime would look
flattened,

411
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,623
like a single sculpture
with matter

412
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:12,561
in a superposition of
every place it ever occupied,

413
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:17,533
our sentience just
cycling through our lives

414
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:22,438
like carts on a track.

415
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,414
See, everything
outside our dimension...

416
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:34,383
that's eternity,

417
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,721
eternity looking down on us.

418
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:42,959
Now, to us,

419
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,194
it's a sphere,

420
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,230
but to them...

421
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,567
it's a circle.

422
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,609
Mr. Cohle?

423
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:12,021
Mr. Cohle, what
happened in 2002?

424
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:18,027
Guy Leonard Francis.

425
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:22,531
They say you killed two people
in Livingston.

426
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:27,203
They say you're
a drug store robber.

427
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:31,507
You know they already
got a nickname for you?

428
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:37,380
Southern Fried Pharmacy
Firearm Thief.

429
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,681
You like that?

430
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,283
Got a nice ring to it,
a bit of a mouthful.

431
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,352
Fuck, telling you, man,

432
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,653
the shit they got these days...

433
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,656
Technology, fingerprints, DNA...

434
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,125
You got to be a fucking genius

435
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,393
to get past that shit.

436
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,360
Let's face it, Francis.

437
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,030
You ain't no fucking
genius, are you?

438
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,364
First, you come in and say,

439
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,134
"I got the drugs
from somewhere else."

440
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,435
Then you say, "No.
I don't remember.

441
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:03,105
I don't remember
where I got the drugs."

442
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,573
You're making it
too complicated.

443
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,741
You're creating
a maze for yourself

444
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,610
that you ain't never
gonna get out of.

445
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,345
They got you.

446
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,314
You just got
to change your play.

447
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,284
You got to plead impairment.

448
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,386
You know what that means?

449
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,622
That means that you
cannot be held

450
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:23,159
accountable for your actions.

451
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,195
Well, I don't think
I ought to be blamed...

452
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,632
Well, entirely blamed...
For things I did

453
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,768
when I was under the
influence of anything.

454
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,338
I don't think
you should, either.

455
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,506
That's what I'm saying.

456
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,377
PCP. Stuff makes
a man crazy.

457
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,679
One time, famous case,

458
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,516
guy, he cut off his own
face on that shit.

459
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,784
For real?
Hell yeah.

460
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,119
You mix that with meth,

461
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,454
that's an insanity defense

462
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,288
if I ever heard one.

463
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,323
How you gonna say a man
who's not on anything

464
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,193
is insane because he
did something crazy

465
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,394
but a man who's on something

466
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,596
that made him crazy is sane?

467
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,164
You know what I mean?

468
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,466
Works both ways.
Yeah, exactly.

469
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,235
I mean, I'm not even saying
that I remember anything.

470
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,736
I was shit hammered.

471
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:08,671
There we go.

472
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,172
That's your play right there.

473
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,740
Fuck this amnesia story.

474
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:18,447
That dirt don't stick,
but an insanity defense,

475
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,350
that's your ticket.

476
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,619
That's your way out, all right,

477
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,588
because you're sobered up now.

478
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,224
You got your mind right.

479
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,825
You back.

480
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,861
You got to show them
the difference

481
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,830
between that madman
in that pharmacy

482
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,532
who blew them two people away

483
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:40,870
and the man who's
sitting here right now.

484
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,872
You got to show shock,

485
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,708
terror, and
re-fucking-morse.

486
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,811
I am. I do. I'm...

487
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,213
I'm scared, sir.
Oh, yeah.

488
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,182
You should be, right?

489
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,785
Yeah. What'd you say
to the pharmacist?

490
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:02,324
I said,
"Give me everything."

491
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,794
And then what?
Boom. Boom.

492
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:09,932
Blew that fucker
away, didn't you?

493
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,569
You want forgiveness for that?

494
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,872
Yeah.
Say it.

495
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:20,476
I want it.
You want what?

496
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,878
Forgiveness.

497
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:30,319
You see what you just did?

498
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:34,557
You just copped
to a double murder.

499
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:39,762
They got you now.

500
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:44,800
But...

501
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,204
I want to make a deal.

502
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,407
A deal about what?

503
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,908
I know things.

504
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,912
Oh, what you know
now all of a sudden?

505
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,516
I know...

506
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,419
I know who you are, and I know

507
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,921
about that woman y'all
found out in the woods

508
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:09,825
way back, the antlers.

509
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,428
Hmm.

510
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:14,897
That don't mean shit.

511
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,366
That was in the newspaper.

512
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,968
What you know?

513
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,703
You don't know shit, do you?

514
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:25,574
No. Y'all never caught
the man that did that.

515
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,245
He's been out there killing.

516
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,680
You're talking
out your ass, boy.

517
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,782
You don't know a fucking thing.

518
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,718
You're just trying
to buy some time,

519
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,453
ain't you?

520
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,289
I met him once.

521
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,792
There's big people
who know about him,

522
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,494
big people.

523
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,462
Ah, ain't no deal

524
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,896
because there ain't no people.

525
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,797
You make me a deal.

526
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,366
You deal with me
with these murders.

527
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,734
Ain't no deal.
You ain't got nothing

528
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,968
because you're full of shit,

529
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,570
and there ain't nobody alive

530
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,839
that did none of that killing.

531
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,941
He's dead, boy.

532
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:04,913
I'll tell you about
the Yellow King.

533
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:12,721
What the fuck you say, boy?

534
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,791
Give me a name.

535
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,359
Give me a fucking name.

536
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,995
You want to fucking play, boy?

537
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,698
The Yellow King!

538
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,499
Oh! Aah!

539
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,336
Get the hell off me!
Get off me!

540
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,671
Get off of me!

541
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,373
Deal with me,
you son of a bitch.

542
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,611
You deal with me!
I want a deal!

543
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,346
Easy. Come on, man.

544
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,514
Calm down, dude.

545
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,783
Now take a deep
breath, all right?

546
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,850
You got the confession.

547
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,885
Then you made it inadmissible.

548
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,453
What do you fucking mean?
He's still talking.

549
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,988
Shucking and jiving.
He knows exactly who you are.

550
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,523
You called me in here, huh?
You did.

551
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,024
I know, and if we need
anything else,

552
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:49,892
we'll let you know.

553
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,393
We appreciate the
assist, detective.

554
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,761
What the fuck is going on here?

555
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,996
We have to salvage
a double murder

556
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,365
confession, is what's going on.

557
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,667
If he wasn't just
running you in there,

558
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,669
you'll get anything we get.

559
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,071
You have my word.

560
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,772
Come on. Ease up, baby.
Calm down.

561
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,074
And I'll be back...

562
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,542
Oh, I got it.

563
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,976
Tomorrow.

564
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,012
Stay the fuck back.
I got it.

565
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:17,720
¶

566
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:39,041
In eternity,
where there is no time,

567
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,443
nothing can grow.

568
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,046
Nothing can become.

569
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,416
Nothing changes.

570
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,653
So death created time

571
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:55,691
to grow the things
that it would kill...

572
00:39:56,993 --> 00:40:00,562
and you are reborn

573
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,465
but into the same life

574
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,769
that you've always
been born into.

575
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:07,903
I mean, how many times have we

576
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,140
had this conversation,
detectives?

577
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,476
Well, who knows?

578
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:19,081
When you can't remember
your lives,

579
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,085
you can't change your lives,

580
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:30,025
and that is the terrible
and the secret fate of all life.

581
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:35,631
You're trapped...

582
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:41,603
by that nightmare
you keep waking up into.

583
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:49,611
You all right?

584
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,914
We got to go to Abbeville.

585
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,884
Well, I got a deposition
this afternoon.

586
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:56,718
Aw, push it.

587
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,220
I got somebody
we need to talk to.

588
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,456
I'll tell you on the way.

589
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,724
Come on.

590
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,828
You really think he's serious

591
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,930
about having something,

592
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,934
and if so, then what?

593
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:17,673
Reggie Ledoux deserved
to die, Marty.

594
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,808
That was justice.

595
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,911
I'm not ruling out
other agencies.

596
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,815
Mm-hmm.
What does that mean?

597
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,051
Guy Francis and Charlie Lange

598
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,186
both say the Yellow King.

599
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:36,792
Dora Lange said the Yellow King.

600
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:40,596
OK. Look.

601
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,498
If the killer
is still out there,

602
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,067
why haven't there
been more killings?

603
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,568
Well, maybe there have, Marty,

604
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,504
and we just don't
know about them,

605
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,074
hadn't put them together.

606
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,743
Ever wonder why that task force

607
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:58,847
was so hot to take
the case back in '95?

608
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,948
Ha ha ha!

609
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,284
Are you telling me you
think the task force

610
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:06,855
was in on it?

611
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:10,859
¶

612
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:21,036
Fuck.

613
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:28,577
How the fuck does this happen?

614
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,779
He knew what he was looking
at with the double murders.

615
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,550
Guess he thought about it
and made a choice.

616
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,052
You got a camera feed?

617
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:45,127
Here.
Go back. Play this.

618
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:49,965
Took a phone call
at 7:15, his lawyer.

619
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:13,755
You got audio on this, sound?

620
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,038
Nah, just the vid.

621
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:24,199
That's it, just
3 hours of nothing...

622
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:27,703
till you see the blood.

623
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:39,915
We don't know what somebody
might have told him

624
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,849
on that phone call.

625
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,719
I want to see your
incoming call logs now.

626
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,320
All right.

627
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,756
What are the two
officers' names?

628
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,725
Childress and Mahoney.

629
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,360
Give me their files, please.

630
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,195
Yes, sir.

631
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,098
¶

632
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:21,857
Terrence, get prints on this.

633
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:22,691
Yes, sir.

634
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,960
Prints?
That's a public phone.

635
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,430
No kind of lawyer
makes calls from here.

636
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,966
Francis have relatives?

637
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,670
Yeah... sisters, a few
nieces, nephews.

638
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,105
Connects to the suicide how?

639
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:40,442
Somebody might have
told him something,

640
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:44,346
gave him no choice.

641
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:48,250
Well, great.

642
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,452
So when he got
going on this thing again,

643
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,055
did he mention Billy Lee Tuttle?

644
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,322
You know that he did.

645
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:58,393
Tuttle died a
couple years back, 2010.

646
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,194
Yeah. Yeah.

647
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,798
What was that,
mixed medications? So what?

648
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,735
Right after Cohle showed
back up in the state.

649
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:11,239
Fuck this.

650
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,874
Fuck this bullshit.

651
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,909
You tell me right now

652
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:17,412
why you're all over Cohle,
or I'll walk.

653
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:21,783
¶

654
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:41,096
His record, his reports,

655
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,165
his stories, they don't add up.

656
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,066
So talk to him about it already.

657
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,835
Stop pissing in my ear.

658
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,936
We did.

659
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,306
Oh, you did?
What?

660
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,476
Well, if you two talked to Rust,

661
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,313
you weren't getting
a read on him.

662
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,951
He was getting a read on you.

663
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,020
¶

664
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:40,922
This is all you got?

665
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,024
Fuck, I already know all this.

666
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,560
That what we have so far.

667
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,295
You hadn't checked
old unsolveds.

668
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,531
Maybe you stop dancing with us.

669
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,634
Tell us what you
really been up to,

670
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,636
how you spend your time.

671
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,172
I already told you
how I spend my time.

672
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,940
Except you've been
bullshitting us

673
00:47:58,942 --> 00:47:59,574
all afternoon.

674
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,344
Excuse us for
one minute, please.

675
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,946
¶

676
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:17,252
These are from the crime
scene in Lake Charles

677
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,355
once folks got word.

678
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:27,028
Recognize anybody in there?

679
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,331
Lake Charles
is a bit out of the way

680
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,265
for you, ain't it?

681
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,734
How did you keep her
out of the papers?

682
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:37,405
Maybe you got some friends
in high places?

683
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,509
Your truck and a man
fitting your description

684
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,378
was spotted in the vicinity

685
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,146
of our crime scene 5 times

686
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:49,551
by 5 different people
over the last month.

687
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,759
Now, besides people seeing him

688
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,395
and his truck around
the location for weeks,

689
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,764
you know he was off the grid
after he left in '02,

690
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:07,402
didn't show up anywhere
till 2010... Louisiana.

691
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,171
Got his driver's
license renewed.

692
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,741
Nobody knows what
he's been doing

693
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,509
in the meantime.

694
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,312
Got a storage
shed near Church Point.

695
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,415
He won't let us see
what's inside.

696
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,635
How about you let us see

697
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,137
what you're keeping in storage?

698
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,373
Fuck no. You can't see
my storage unit.

699
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,108
Get a warrant.

700
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,511
Christ, try working a case.

701
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,312
We are working it.

702
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:51,746
Yeah?

703
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,481
See, how we work it is,
we think way back,

704
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,583
you put the case
on Rianne Olivier,

705
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,719
put it on her old boyfriend.

706
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,686
I don't know.

707
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,688
Maybe the Ledoux boys knew you.

708
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,158
Maybe you traveled
the same circles,

709
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,560
got the same hobbies.

710
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,462
Maybe they had something on you.

711
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,731
You just kept
pulling the right old murders,

712
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,233
take the case wherever
you wanted it to go.

713
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,537
You're a juicer.
Ever black out?

714
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,606
Ever wake up, don't
remember what happened?

715
00:51:25,714 --> 00:51:31,386
Look. Y'all want to arrest me,
go ahead.

716
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,456
If you want to follow me,

717
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,857
come on.

718
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:39,494
You want to see something,

719
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,796
get a warrant.

720
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,101
Thanks for the beer.

721
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:51,139
Beyond that, you wasted
my fucking day, company man.

722
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:38,820
Now, he bartends 4 days a week,

723
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,721
this roadhouse,

724
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:40,922
has a little
apartment behind it.

725
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,525
No other accounting
of this time.

726
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,361
Says he drinks.

727
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,762
You're wrong.

728
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,932
Nobody could change that much.
You are dead wrong.

729
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,567
Hey, you've
been telling us all day

730
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,636
about the kind of shit
he'd think up,

731
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:55,537
the way he'd talk.

732
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,804
We got a good earful
of that, too.

733
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,239
Are you gonna tell me

734
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,607
that's a stable individual?

735
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,609
Left a burnout, junkie rumors.

736
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,311
Do you think 10
years on the sauce

737
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,480
has made him more reasonable?

738
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,949
Think about this.
You said it.

739
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,817
He'd been there 3 months,

740
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:10,818
and you two catch a heater

741
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,854
like you've never
had before or since,

742
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,256
one that he shines on.

743
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:18,359
You're saying he did
such a great job.

744
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,595
Didn't he get you
every bit of evidence?

745
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,264
Didn't he push you
where he wanted it to go?

746
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,600
He brought you Rianne Olivier.

747
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,835
She wasn't one of Ledoux's.

748
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,971
She was one of his.

749
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,207
What'd he say,
"Life is a disease"?

750
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,942
When he heard the Abbeville
prisoner Francis

751
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,578
knew something, he got on it.

752
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,579
He shut it down.

753
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,646
You ever thought if he made

754
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,315
that phone call to the prisoner,

755
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:40,982
like... I don't know...

756
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,483
The guy was trying
to blackmail him?

757
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,352
He got on that, too, didn't he,

758
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,589
the idea that the Lange
killer was still out there?

759
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:51,893
Yeah.

760
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,761
Yeah. He did.

761
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:56,965
Looking for a new patsy, maybe.

762
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:41,976
Y'all given me a lot to absorb.

763
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,712
Goddamn right
it's a lot to absorb.

764
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,748
So help us out.
Yeah.

765
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,316
Whatever you can tell us

766
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,817
about, you know,
from when he got

767
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,487
on the Lange killer
you up to when

768
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,489
you two had your altercation.

769
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,924
Whatever that was about.

770
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,868
