00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,174
¶

2
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:44,402
I'm gonna go
make my rounds.
Only got in.

3
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:48,606
I'll check back
with you in about
20 minutes.

4
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,846
I... I didn't know
Audrey's dad's
a cop. I, uh...

5
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,614
I didn't mean no disrespect.

6
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,717
Yes, sir, we didn't mean
any disrespect.

7
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,552
Audrey's 16.

8
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:06,257
We got you on statch rape.
You know that, right?

9
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,593
You know what happens
to pretty boys like you

10
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:13,331
who go up to the farm
on statch charges?

11
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,577
Look at that.

12
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,813
Door come open.

13
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,316
Y'all want to step out a bit,

14
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,852
take some air?

15
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:40,258
No, sir.

16
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,528
I think that you're
a little angry right now.

17
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,898
You telling me how I feel?

18
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:51,903
That's patronizing.

19
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,505
Two choices:

20
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,841
we do this here
with an understanding

21
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,510
that not you or any
of your river rat boys

22
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,713
comes within a hundred
yards of my daughter,

23
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,417
or... file those charges.

24
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,787
Got a lot of brothers in Angola

25
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,591
who love to owe me a favor.

26
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,532
Now come on out here.

27
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,836
Come on.

28
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,809
¶

29
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,480
Come out here.

30
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:43,354
Man's game charges
a man's price.

31
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:47,458
Take that away from this
if nothing else.

32
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,393
Ohh!

33
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,803
Aah!

34
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,543
Please!

35
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,812
Look, I'm sorry.

36
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,780
Please!

37
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:48,686
GILBOUGH, VOICE-OVER:
Disciplinary reports say he was
acting unstable even before.

38
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,721
What happened, you and him?

39
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,923
Two formal reprimands,
suspension.

40
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:56,060
Your major back then, Salter...

41
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,029
wrote...

42
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,831
"manic state" right here.

43
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,667
No, he... he, uh,

44
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,337
started pulling
lost time more, but OK.

45
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,307
And for whatever reason, he...

46
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,344
started working something
that I didn't know about.

47
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,514
Old missing persons.

48
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,349
What you want, man?

49
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,550
Nothing here for you.

50
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,018
I'm with the
State Police Department.

51
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,357
If you're Terry Guidry,
I'd like to talk to you
about your boy.

52
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,028
Sheriff call for a search party?

53
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,998
They had a marine
unit out there.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,635
Spotlight, everything, and...

55
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,837
nothing.

56
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,609
Four weeks later,
wildlife fisheries
find his pirogue...

57
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,013
all broke up.

58
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:51,982
Said it coulda been a gator.

59
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,619
Where'd Sonny go to school?

60
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,855
Queen of Angels.

61
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,791
One of them Tuttle schools.

62
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:08,632
We didn't sleep
them first 4 weeks
Sonny was missing.

63
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:12,703
Drove his mama crazy.

64
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,506
Sh-she...

65
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,576
She thought she heard him

66
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,811
under the water...

67
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,615
calling for her.

68
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,720
Hey, man, look.

69
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,891
Why don't you just get
out of here, please?

70
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,429
I don't want
to get arrested.
Just... just get...

71
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,566
before I do something to you.

72
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,404
PAPANIA, VOICE-OVER:
If it's wrong,
I want it right.

73
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,972
It's all I got.

74
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,074
We're not gonna talk to you,

75
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,676
personal matters
like this, without you...

76
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:58,015
You don't want to talk
about something, it's OK,
no problem.

77
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,719
You sure
we can't get you
any coffee, a...

78
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,021
No, thank you.

79
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,756
You worried about your ex?

80
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:10,094
It's OK. We are
not looking at him,
and nobody wants to.

81
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,064
Well, what are you
looking for, from me?

82
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:18,702
Well, perspective, I guess.

83
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,838
Something went down, 2002.

84
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,175
Your ex-husband's
partner, Rustin Cohle.

85
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,777
In a former life,
I used to exhaust myself

86
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,947
navigating crude men
who thought they were clever,

87
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,849
so ask your questions
or I'm leaving.

88
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,686
Heh heh heh.
That's a cop's
wife, all right.

89
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,021
Not anymore.

90
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,057
We're not trying
to work you, ma'am.

91
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,559
Word of honor.

92
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,962
We need to know
about Rustin Cohle
in 2002.

93
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,964
Why he took off,
what he'd done
since.

94
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,068
Have you had any contact
with Cohle, Mrs. Sawyer,
since 2002?

95
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,004
No, I haven't.
But you knew him
well enough.

96
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,073
I mean, he was your
husband's partner.

97
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,576
Rust?
Yeah, I knew him.

98
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,110
Not as well as other people.

99
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,113
Why, exactly, are you
asking about him?

100
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,982
Something bad happened.

101
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,184
Maybe Cohle's involved.

102
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,521
More we look at him,
it don't look good.

103
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,725
Something went
real wrong with him
a long time ago.

104
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,828
I knew Rust to be a good man,

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,899
so I can't imagine
what I can offer.

106
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,611
I mean, Rust knew
exactly who he was...

107
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,015
and there was
no talking him out of it.

108
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,122
You know, Marty's
single big problem was

109
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,691
that he never really
knew himself,

110
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:52,229
so he never really knew
what to want.

111
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:57,301
But I'm big enough to not stay
angry at someone for that...

112
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,272
not after all this time.

113
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,691
Receipt in the bag?

114
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,826
Great.
Thank you so much.

115
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,664
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,737
Can I help you
with anything, sir?

117
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,940
Oh, yeah, uh, please.

118
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,777
I was thinking about this one.

119
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:44,815
¶

120
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:07,705
Fuck.

121
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:23,887
Excuse me. Can I get
a dirty martini, please?

122
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,725
Coming right up.
Thanks.

123
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,767
Big weekend planned?

124
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,769
Oh. Yeah.

125
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,870
Uh, heh! Yeah.

126
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:44,708
Has all the makings
of a good time.

127
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,679
You're a cop, aren't you?

128
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,148
How'd you know?

129
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,316
I, uh,

130
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,285
I think I saw you
before, years back.

131
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,288
You get in some trouble?

132
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,324
No. Uh...

133
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,893
you came
around this place
I was staying,

134
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,262
asking about a girl.

135
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,031
Oh.

136
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,932
Marty.

137
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,235
Beth.

138
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,952
We're closed.

139
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:35,959
You always hit
the bottle this early
in the day, Reverend?

140
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,137
Who are you?

141
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,973
You don't remember me?

142
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,941
Hmm?

143
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:55,813
I came to see you at
your revival tent,
January of '95.

144
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,381
Looks like you gave that up.

145
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,784
Mid-eighties.
You were still with
the Tuttle ministry then.

146
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,354
What do you know about
a Tuttle organization
that was set up

147
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,759
to finance rural schools?

148
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,030
It was called Wellspring.

149
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,934
It was an evangelical
initiative to provide
religious education

150
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,938
as an alternative
to public school in
the rural communities.

151
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,308
Yeah, part of the reason
there was so many
dropouts in the state,

152
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,179
a lot of kids had
to bus an hour or more.

153
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,783
You know about that school
on Pelican Island?

154
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,252
I don't know it specific,

155
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,388
but there was one...

156
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,759
in 1988.

157
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:47,798
Accusations
of children being
interfered with.

158
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,401
I never found anything on that.

159
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,805
It was... it was kept
internal, I think.

160
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,375
Maybe it was nothing,
maybe people was paid.

161
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,310
It's got nothing
to do with me, mind you.

162
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,113
I was going to school
in Baton Rouge.

163
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,349
Gossip around the seminary,

164
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,253
but we didn't give
credence to rumors.

165
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,956
Why'd you leave?

166
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,459
Bureaucracy.

167
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,529
Politics.

168
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,039
Don't lie to me.

169
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:33,043
Why'd you leave?

170
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:42,052
Part of our lay duties
was custodial.

171
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:49,560
One night, cleaned
the senior minister's
library.

172
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,930
I knocked over

173
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,898
a very old volume,

174
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,034
"The Letters
of Telios DeLorca."

175
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:02,506
Twelfth-century
Franciscan mystic,
very obscure.

176
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,146
When I picked up
the book, this little
folder falls out.

177
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:13,984
Little folder of pictures.

178
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:19,323
Pictures of children.

179
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,627
Naked.

180
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,064
Looked like they was sleeping.

181
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,433
And what'd you do?

182
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:34,238
I took it over to
the morals officer,
Deacon Farrar.

183
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,039
He was close to Tuttle,

184
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,208
vice president of the college.

185
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,043
He didn't do nothin'?

186
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,248
No, he seemed...
he got angry that
I brought it to him.

187
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,119
He even intimated
that maybe I was
confessing to something.

188
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:54,324
I mean, I had to prove
to him that I wasn't.

189
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:58,195
He promised to look into it...

190
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:03,467
I'd left by the time
Wellspring shut down.

191
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:10,474
Why'd you quit the revival, hmm?

192
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:15,979
Oh, our last two tents
was vandalized.

193
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,449
I lost heart.

194
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,986
Little too much of this.

195
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:30,494
All my life, I wanted
to be nearer to God.

196
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:35,499
But the only nearness...

197
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,136
silence.

198
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,137
¶

199
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,140
Oh, it wasn't
as bad as it seemed.

200
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,075
Better than most.

201
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,109
Jan was a decent lady.

202
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,578
I heard she sold
the ranch a while back.

203
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,281
I can't believe that was you.

204
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,250
Saved up money for a place,

205
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,485
got a straight job.

206
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,122
I'd run off
from a bad situation
when we first met.

207
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,692
Well, it's just...
Just so great

208
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,328
how you turned
everything around.

209
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,030
Look at you.

210
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,535
Well, you were
a big hero in the papers.

211
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,972
Aw, they made a bigger deal

212
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,374
of that than it was.

213
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,409
I ain't been...

214
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,312
too heroic of late.

215
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,448
Just...

216
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,484
You're a good man.

217
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,586
Anybody can see that.

218
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,457
I saw it
the first time
I met you.

219
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:38,595
God gave us these flaws,

220
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,998
and something I learned...

221
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,766
He doesn't see them as flaws.

222
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:47,437
There is nothing wrong
with the way He made us.

223
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:51,775
The universe forgives all.

224
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:00,584
You want some bourbon?

225
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,460
Mmm.

226
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,810
Oh, yeah.

227
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,780
Oh, yeah.

228
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:53,770
What happened in 2002?

229
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,374
You... you pulled
our last case?

230
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,643
Charmaine Boudreaux?

231
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,645
It was in all the papers.

232
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,582
"Marshland Medea."
You know who Medea was?

233
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,717
Yeah.
We had a lot of static

234
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,288
after that, me and him.

235
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,190
That was a bad one.

236
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,358
I always thought it contributed,

237
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,562
Rust's state of mind
when he walked.

238
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,198
SIDs.

239
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,799
What is that?

240
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,336
It's a 4-letter word,
S-I-D-S,

241
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,371
but, I mean...

242
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,374
what is it?

243
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,345
It's an old word,

244
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,881
like a curse.

245
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,485
Not a language anyone speaks.

246
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,255
But it's what happened
to Jessica,

247
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,390
your first.

248
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,561
They said... your second,

249
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:56,299
Jody, was 23 days old.

250
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:02,172
The autopsy showed
no signs of trauma,
so...

251
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,575
SIDs.

252
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:10,547
I lost one myself, Charmaine.

253
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:16,887
I lost a marriage, too.

254
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:26,463
Now your third,

255
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,532
and you had him last year.

256
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,536
Jesus, lady, you ever hear
of a fuckin' condom?

257
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,805
Birth control's a sin.

258
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,609
A child is a wonderful thing.

259
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,763
A child is wonderful.

260
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:04,234
You see, sometimes people...

261
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,437
mistake a child as an answer

262
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,271
for something,

263
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:13,543
you know, like a way
to change their story.

264
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:19,516
Charmaine,
have you ever heard
of something called...

265
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,652
Munchausen by Proxy?

266
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:27,490
No.

267
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,797
At exactly 4:49 a.m.,

268
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,534
the sleep apnea monitor
that was hooked up
to your child

269
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,970
was unplugged...

270
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,872
for 36 minutes.

271
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,609
Then it was
plugged back in,
and by that time,

272
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:50,347
the child's vitals
had flat-lined.

273
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,718
Charmaine, I need you

274
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,021
to talk to me about some things.

275
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,589
OK?

276
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,691
OK.

277
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,604
How's it going?

278
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,475
He's getting it.

279
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,546
You should sign that.

280
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,751
The newspapers

281
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,621
are gonna be tough on you...

282
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,892
and prison is
very... very hard

283
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:40,030
on people who hurt kids.

284
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:45,402
If you get the opportunity,
you should kill yourself.

285
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,773
What?

286
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:56,413
What? Please.

287
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:01,418
Oh, just... wait.

288
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,963
Jesus.

289
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,932
This evil bitch.

290
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,768
I called
Pennsylvania, tried
to get homicides

291
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,004
on the first two
kids, but looks like

292
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,639
we may only have the one.

293
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,542
Well,
it's still life.
Yeah.

294
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,610
Good job.

295
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,912
Listen, Marty,

296
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,348
type that up for me, will ya?

297
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,117
Excuse me?
You got somewhere to be?

298
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,553
This confession is,
like, 40 pages.

299
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,421
What, and you got
somewhere to be?
Come on, man.

300
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,492
You want me
to tie your shoes
for you, too?

301
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:47,597
Hey.

302
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:47,997
Hey.

303
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,834
I think we actually
need your signature

304
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,036
on the third page,
if you have it.

305
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,705
The fuck's with
the attitude, huh?

306
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,941
Like my time's less than yours?

307
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,676
Oh, you got things to do, Marty?

308
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,480
Need to go home
to the family,
play with the kids?

309
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,614
Don't get up my ass

310
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,716
just 'cause you ain't
gettin' any.
Oh.

311
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,018
You should have held on
to your woman.

312
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,554
Gettin' laid was good for you.

313
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,922
Goddamn.

314
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,924
You moron.

315
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,893
Goddamn.

316
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,762
You, these people, this place.

317
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,697
It's like you eat
your fuckin' young

318
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,966
and that's all just fine
as long as you got

319
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,602
something to salute, huh?

320
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,438
What's going on with you, man?

321
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,774
I mean, Salter asked about it.

322
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,075
Iberia called.

323
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,078
You been going around
bothering people,

324
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,147
trying to open up old cases.

325
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,149
I am working.

326
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,584
I have things to do.

327
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,753
So type the report, man.

328
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,754
That's how we do.

329
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,856
I get people to talk,
you write the stats.

330
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,126
It's worked out well
for you so far.

331
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,467
I'm the only one
ever took up for you.

332
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,568
Ever.

333
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,639
You know what it's like
being your partner, huh?

334
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,174
Fuck you.

335
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,677
No, buddy, without me...

336
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,580
there is no you.

337
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,217
So type the fuckin' report, man.

338
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,060
We've had
behaviorists
in with her.

339
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,062
It's regressive catatonia.

340
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:26,863
Seven years now.

341
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,666
If she shows
any distress, responds
in any way negatively,

342
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,101
we're gonna have
to ask you to leave.
Of course.

343
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,003
OK.
I was actually
one of the men

344
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,507
who found Kelly
at that place
7 years back.

345
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,542
She's right here.

346
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,213
¶

347
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:03,733
Kelly.

348
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:08,538
Now, you may not
remember, but you and I
met a long time ago.

349
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,542
I want to ask you
a question about
those men

350
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:16,045
that hurt you way back then.

351
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:21,150
Do you remember if there
were more than two?

352
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,921
Was there anyone else?

353
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:54,083
The man with the scars

354
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,554
was the worst.

355
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,822
My Lord.

356
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,091
What scars?

357
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,264
The giant.

358
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:13,570
He made me watch

359
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,639
what he did to Billy.

360
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:21,711
The scars on the giant,
were they... were they
on his face?

361
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,980
His face.

362
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,782
His face.

363
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,218
His face.

364
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,327
All right, Rose,
I need... I need Haldol.

365
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,597
Stat, please...

366
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:56,379
What are you doing, Cohle?

367
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,248
Riling up people,
opening old cases.

368
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,251
Iberia Sheriff's talking
jurisdictional complaint.

369
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,687
Something's going on, Major,

370
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,623
along the coast.

371
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,157
Women...

372
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,759
children disappearing.

373
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,829
Nobody hears about it,
nobody puts them together.

374
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,298
First I'm hearing
about it, Boss.

375
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,233
Puts what together, Cohle?

376
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,870
Someone, maybe more than one,

377
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,372
is killing people, Major,

378
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,408
and they've been doing it
for a long time.

379
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,677
Yeah, you got any bodies?

380
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,046
You got something actually
applies to your job

381
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,314
as a homicide detective?

382
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,816
Know what he did?
Know what he did?

383
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,885
Goes and visits Kelly Reider,

384
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,086
sent her into a screaming fit.

385
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,423
Look, either
we don't find them or
they don't get connected.

386
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,091
I don't know which,

387
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,027
and I can't decide
if it's a cover-up

388
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,996
or the garden-variety
incompetence here.

389
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,866
I mean, it has to do
with those boys we got

390
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,135
in '95, the Dora Lange killing.

391
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,970
We didn't get them all.

392
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,938
You're building
something in your head.

393
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Women, then children.

394
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,043
Now they're getting no press,

395
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,379
the way things
in the bayou get
no press.

396
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,448
And it's happening
in the same area

397
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,083
where that Voudon shit
goes down,

398
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,453
and it's happening
in the same area where
those schools were set up.

399
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,888
What the fuck schools
you talking about?

400
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,159
Tuition reimbursement
programs for rural
and Christian schools

401
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,394
founded by Billy Lee Tuttle.

402
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,462
Yeah.
Think about it.

403
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:23,733
Back in '95, why was he
so fired up to get
his ass down here?

404
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,169
He comes barging in
with his task force.

405
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:30,907
Fuck, before we even got
started on the case,
he took it over.

406
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:31,808
Why?

407
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,277
'Cause he recognized
something in it.

408
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,879
We're in a muddy
swamp here, man.

409
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,782
The alligators are
swimming around us,

410
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:44,120
and we don't even know
whether they're there.
You know why?

411
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,289
'Cause we don't see 'em.

412
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,158
I caught zero logic in all that.

413
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,426
And that last bit?

414
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,294
Pure gibberish.

415
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,230
How about we track
all the missing persons

416
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,099
within 10 miles
of every Walmart, huh?

417
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,501
Right along the I-10.
Why don't we go after
Sam Walmart?

418
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,071
I'm fixing to pull you
for mental exhaustion, man.

419
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,072
You want to stay on?

420
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:07,844
Do not ever, ever
say that to anyone
in State again.

421
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,480
Sure.

422
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,049
That's some fuckin' nerve
you got, buddy.

423
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:17,820
You need to take
a few steps back,
Rust, right now.

424
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,522
All right. Hey.

425
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,357
No more visiting
victims' families.

426
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,326
You will stop trying
to turn missing persons

427
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,328
into homicides, as you
do not have any bodies.

428
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,096
That's a direct fuckin'
order, you hear me?

429
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:32,335
You do anything else, I'll
have you on insubordination,
and I will suspend you.

430
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,369
Please, take some time.

431
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,404
Go on one of them
fishing tours or something.

432
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,241
All right?
Get yourself together.

433
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,792
And a little less
than two years ago,

434
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,228
Tuttle overdosed.
Accidentally,
supposed.

435
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,463
You mentioned that already.

436
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,964
Couple weeks before he died,

437
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,966
Tuttle's house
in Shreveport was
broken into.

438
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,536
Found out
his Baton Rouge
one was, too.

439
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,005
Wasn't reported.

440
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,173
So?

441
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,908
So your man gets a
hard-on for Tuttle.

442
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,544
Man's house
gets broken into
right after Cohle

443
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,012
turns back up in the state.

444
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,581
What's he been
doing since, here?

445
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,950
Drinking, bartending?

446
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,552
Dude with a mind
like that, you think

447
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,853
that's all he get up to?

448
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,990
Marty, he'd never went anywhere.

449
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,058
He never left.

450
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,962
He's been right here
doing bad things
a long time.

451
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:40,102
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hold up now.

452
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,573
Been in this room
a long time, gentlemen.

453
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,543
Whatever Rust is

454
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,846
or was or became...

455
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,349
don't call me again.

456
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,350
I won't help you.

457
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,587
We're trying to help him, Marty.

458
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:24,480
Hey, did you have a good day?

459
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,214
Mm-hmm.

460
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,582
Well, why don't you
get that bathroom
cleaned

461
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,485
finally, huh, get all
the toothpaste up?

462
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,154
Thanks.

463
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,658
Marty, I didn't know
you were home.

464
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,060
Oh, yeah, I'm just cleaning up.

465
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,063
Be out in a sec.

466
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:19,201
I'll heat up something.

467
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,404
Hey, those flowers came in nice.

468
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:26,375
You were right.
They really
brighten up the yard.

469
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:31,480
Hey,

470
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,483
I was thinking
we're due for
a date night,

471
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:39,055
don't you think, you and me?

472
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,290
I want to dress up and go

473
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,459
for a nice dinner,

474
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,061
the movies.

475
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,731
Yeah? Does that
sound good?

476
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,302
Honey?

477
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,705
Sure.

478
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,016
Ah.

479
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,725
Oh. Thanks, hon.

480
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,027
Nice.

481
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:28,170
So, is my eldest still
offended by my presence?

482
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,706
Huh?

483
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,343
I don't mind.

484
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,748
I'm happy just to sit here with
3 beautiful women watching...

485
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,317
What is this?

486
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,754
"Dumb Blondes
in Cracker Country"?

487
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:57,133
Hey, hon?

488
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,469
Do me a favor, find the game?

489
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,306
Here you go.

490
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,442
I have to study.

491
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,111
Good girl.

492
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,217
Rolls right onto
victory lane into Daytona U.S.A.

493
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,456
Davis with the steal.
Pops it in to Hudson.

494
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:25,761
Hudson trying to move
the ball down the court,
and a foul on Flowers.

495
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,565
What?

496
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,268
Nothing.

497
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,338
Now, this pasta is great.

498
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,740
Thanks.

499
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,409
You're welcome.

500
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:46,348
I love you.

501
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:49,785
Thank you.

502
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:55,091
You turn it down some, please?

503
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,126
Sure, hon.

504
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,462
Ahem.

505
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,200
How's that?

506
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:08,370
MAGGIE, VOICE-OVER:
We were talking once

507
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,272
about growing up parents.

508
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,742
I said something about
forgiveness, and he said

509
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,880
that there was no such thing
as forgiveness...

510
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,182
that people just have
short memories.

511
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,786
You think Cohle was
wrong about that?

512
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,654
Forgiveness?

513
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,357
Less and less.

514
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,560
¶

515
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:49,245
Hi.

516
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,819
Get you a drink, Miss?

517
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,221
Thank you.
Uh, sure.

518
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:03,259
A vodka martini, extra dirty.

519
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:05,728
Margaret.

520
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,897
Bruce. Hi.

521
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,932
Hi.

522
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:16,739
So you, uh, waiting for someone?

523
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,841
No.

524
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:24,313
You and, uh,
Marty split prior, right?

525
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,750
In '95?

526
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,886
Are either of you married?

527
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,922
- Got an ex.
- Mmm.

528
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,190
Still on the first.

529
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,260
It's difficult to admit defeat.

530
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,263
Marty quit drinking,

531
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,866
found religion for a while.

532
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,634
I didn't love that.

533
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,604
To be honest,
I preferred him before;

534
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,738
he had a sense of humor then.

535
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,410
But we stayed
together 7 more years,
some of it pretty good.

536
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,578
2002?

537
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,846
Cohle's bad year, too.

538
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:02,218
Rust was an intense man,
but he had integrity.

539
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,320
He was responsible.

540
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:09,258
Not a lot of responsible
people in the world.

541
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:17,466
Reverend, thanks for taking

542
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,335
the time to see me
on such short notice.

543
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,538
Of course, Detective, please.

544
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,841
It's a very
interesting... building.

545
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:29,011
This was the first.
Built it in 1980.

546
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,914
The rest of the campus
grew around it.

547
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,683
Now, I remembered
you, of course.

548
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,586
People of this state
owe you a great deal.

549
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,889
Not as much as they owe you.

550
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,891
Charitable organizations,

551
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,360
education initiatives.

552
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,762
Thank you.
We're very proud
of our ministries.

553
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,466
I don't do
as much preaching
as I used to,

554
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,269
but the legacy program
is more my focus now,

555
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:57,873
the things like
the State Policemen's
Charity... but...

556
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,376
what did you want
to talk about, son?

557
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,845
The Wellspring program,

558
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,781
mid-eighties through
the early nineties.

559
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,715
You remember that?

560
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,385
Well, of course
I remember, yeah.

561
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,954
I'm trying to locate
old personnel,

562
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,957
faculty, but I'm having
a little bit of trouble
acquiring names.

563
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,295
Well, the program was
shut down officially,
you know, maybe 10 years ago.

564
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,030
I never had much ground
contact with it,

565
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,999
but it involved a number
of private schools...

566
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,434
Enterprises, you understand...

567
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:29,471
That would adopt our
standard of curriculum
and, in return,

568
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,407
receive tuition reimbursement

569
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,975
for underprivileged students.

570
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,511
You got any files,

571
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,812
any list of faculty?

572
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,049
Well, that's what I'm
getting at, is that these
were private institutions,

573
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:44,019
so you'd have to track
down their administrators,
I believe.

574
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,054
That's the thing.

575
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,490
See, all the
schools dissolved
with the program,

576
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,859
and I'm trying
to find some tax info,

577
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,329
but there were
religious exemptions.

578
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,731
Well, there's our
archives, of course.

579
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,733
Now, we did lose a lot of files,

580
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,936
had some flooding of one
of the sub-floors.

581
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,706
But, you know, I think
I should put you
together with one

582
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:07,476
of our clerical workers
and see if they can't
help you find something.

583
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:11,513
Thank you. Listen,
before you do that...

584
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:16,785
former deacon of yours,
Austin Farrar.

585
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:22,091
That was very, very unfortunate.

586
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,992
Yet he was dismissed.

587
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,061
Evidence had accrued.

588
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,697
It became apparent
that Austin had

589
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,967
implemented
certain... funds.

590
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,670
Well, "embezzling" is the word.

591
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,872
We elected to handle it
internally,

592
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,775
rather than pursuing
formal charges.

593
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:44,413
And then he had
his... accident.

594
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:47,750
I'd heard he had taken it hard,

595
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,152
drinking.

596
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:55,124
I've seen more souls
lost down a bottle
than any pit.

597
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,825
At the same time,

598
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,396
it's hard to trust a man
who can't trust himself

599
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,532
with a beer, don't you think?

600
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,501
Hmm.

601
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,837
But what's this
all about now? Um...

602
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,440
Wellspring program,

603
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,808
Austin Farrar?

604
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,744
Dead women and children.

605
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,514
¶

606
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,416
Terrible.

607
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,551
That's terrible.

608
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,887
How is that what
you're working on?

609
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:30,726
Oh, I can't say
anything about it
at this point, Reverend.

610
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:35,864
I'd like to set you up
with a clerk.

611
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:40,803
You can look at, uh,

612
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:44,440
whatever information
we still have

613
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,709
from Wellspring.

614
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:53,949
Why'd the Wellspring program
shut down, Reverend?

615
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,585
It couldn't sustain its costs.

616
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,087
The whole idea
was to provide
an alternative

617
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,157
to the kind of secular,
globalized education

618
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,526
that our public schools
were promoting.

619
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,930
When we get
the school voucher
program instituted,

620
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,765
we'll reintroduce the idea.

621
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:14,636
People should have
a choice in education,
like anything else.

622
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,504
Hmm.

623
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,840
Steve, would you show
the detective

624
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,976
to our old archives
for outside ministries?

625
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,978
Yes, sir.
I'll call ahead.

626
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,546
I'm gonna come back for that.

627
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:28,484
Reverend, thank you
for your time today.

628
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:32,488
Godspeed, Detective.

629
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,926
You'll be in my thoughts.

630
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:38,994
¶

631
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,697
Oh, just the one more time.

632
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,500
I just need it... I just
need it one more time.

633
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,570
Beth, if you knew
the day I just had...

634
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:54,009
Oh, then tell me about it.
I want to hear about it.

635
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,246
Oh...

636
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,681
no, you do not.

637
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,285
I really wanted to see you.

638
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,622
I've been thinking
about something all week.

639
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,791
Don't.
Ever since last time.

640
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,126
Don't, OK?
I just...

641
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:15,764
Haven't been able to
think of anything else,
tell you the truth.

642
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,766
Ohh...

643
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,102
like what?

644
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,805
I've been thinking.

645
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:27,175
I think...

646
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:30,979
I want you to fuck me in my ass.

647
00:42:31,814 --> 00:42:33,181
Uh, Beth.

648
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,117
I've never done that before, but

649
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,320
I think I want you
to do it to me.

650
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,055
I want you to feel better.

651
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,226
You out
of your goddamn mind, hmm?

652
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,929
What'd I tell you?

653
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,765
You're fuckin'
unbelievable, boy.

654
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,832
You know about this?

655
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,835
Uh, I'm not sure
what we're talking
about here.

656
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,837
Your partner here,
he braced Billy Lee Tuttle.

657
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,173
Oh, "braced"?
Are you fucking
kidding me?

658
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,775
It was a friendly conversation.

659
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,742
Hey, dipshit,

660
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,246
you don't get
to decide what kind of
conversation it was.

661
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,948
Why'd you talk
to Billy Lee Tut...

662
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,784
And you,
look at... you look
like you haven't seen

663
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,285
your own bed
in a couple days, huh?

664
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,054
Yeah? The fuck is wrong
with you two?

665
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,657
Ahem.
Well, I... I can't
speak for Rust,

666
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,693
but I got the flu.

667
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,061
I didn't know
that was going around.

668
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,862
Look, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

669
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,165
If he was pissed off after
the conversation we had,

670
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,000
then I am on
to fucking something.

671
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,702
Shut the fuck up.
I told you.

672
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:27,936
I fuckin' told you!

673
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,638
And human tampon here heard me.

674
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,240
Badge and gun, Cohle.
You're suspended.

675
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,875
One month without pay.

676
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,210
Repeated rank insubordination,

677
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,346
misallocation
departmental resources.

678
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,680
- Come on.
- Leroy.

679
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,915
Come on, that's over the top.

680
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,818
Don't you fuckin' Leroy me!
I told you both!

681
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,387
Cut the shit!
It's done.

682
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,256
Badge and gun, Cohle.

683
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,928
Oh, and, uh, before
your official reinstatement,

684
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,298
you have 30 hours mandated
departmental counseling.

685
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,766
You fuckin' serious?

686
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,634
This guy, right?

687
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,935
I got to kick you
in the fuckin' head.

688
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,738
I'm the person least
in need of counseling

689
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,939
in this entire fuckin' state.

690
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,742
You ain't acting right,
you don't sound right.

691
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:10,212
You're up my ass,
and you were warned.

692
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:14,116
¶

693
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,418
What?

694
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,254
He's doing it again.

695
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,157
He's been doing it.

696
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,261
I can't live with it.

697
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,769
I can't live with it.

698
00:45:11,908 --> 00:45:14,076
I can't deal with it,

699
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,778
not again.

700
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,348
Did you know?

701
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,885
Did you know?

702
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,889
No.

703
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:50,011
What are you doing in here?

704
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,180
What happened?

705
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,383
I'm off the job.

706
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:03,291
That's not what I mean.

707
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,302
You can't live like this.

708
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,372
You know, people
that give me advice,

709
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,207
I reckon they're talking
to themselves.

710
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,342
What are you doing?

711
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:25,247
Some people, no matter
where they look,
they see themselves.

712
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:40,495
Be honest...

713
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,564
with me now.

714
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:11,453
What the fuck are you
doing here?

715
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,655
Huh?

716
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,458
I'm sorry.

717
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,060
You know...

718
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,329
it wasn't you.

719
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,565
Really. I...

720
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,935
I wasn't even sure
I could do it.

721
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:30,138
Seventeen years is
a long time.
Huh?

722
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,640
You know...

723
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,175
I almost went with a...

724
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:37,345
with a stranger, a bar.

725
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,446
I'm sorry, Rust.

726
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:43,618
He'll have to go,
you see, because this

727
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,020
he won't live with.

728
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,688
Get the fuck out of here.

729
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,957
This...

730
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,158
You get the fuck...

731
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,326
This will hurt him.

732
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,061
Get the fuck out
of here right now.

733
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,296
I'm sorry, but thank you.

734
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,966
You get the fuck out of here.

735
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:02,037
I'm...
Get the fuck
out of here!

736
00:49:09,278 --> 00:49:14,950
Do you know what
was going on with Cohle
around that time?

737
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:17,686
No.

738
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,422
I knew that he got suspended

739
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,090
and that he quit

740
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,393
after he and Marty had his...

741
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,429
they had their thing.

742
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,596
That's it.

743
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,000
So your split with Marty...

744
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,537
that had nothing
to do with Cohle?

745
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,473
No.

746
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,033
Hey, hon.

747
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:13,174
Hi, Marty.

748
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,377
How you doing?

749
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,712
Sit down.

750
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:20,682
OK.

751
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:24,452
I have to tell you something.

752
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:33,628
I saw the pictures
on your phone.

753
00:50:34,597 --> 00:50:36,564
"B"?

754
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,633
Now, honey...
Nice ass, Marty.

755
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,635
No, I...
I was maybe
always a little

756
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,237
too skinny for you.
No.

757
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,240
I cannot help it if some
crazy bitch sent...

758
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,575
I slept with someone.

759
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:56,084
And you know him.

760
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,587
You're close.

761
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:02,724
¶

762
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,793
Who?

763
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,594
It was Rust.

764
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:10,098
I fucked your partner Rust.

765
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,237
Oh.

766
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,572
Now, what... what
are you saying?

767
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,509
What... what are you...
what the fuck are you
saying to me?

768
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,345
I already told you.

769
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:29,484
You fucking whore.

770
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,219
You don't know the half of it.

771
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,488
To tell you the truth,
I haven't been fucked

772
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,790
like that since
before the girls.

773
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:44,399
Do it.

774
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,401
Do it!

775
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,672
At least I'll have
something to explain
to your daughters.

776
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:55,510
Get your fucking hands off me.

777
00:51:56,378 --> 00:51:58,513
Coward.

778
00:52:24,773 --> 00:52:26,508
Cohle's outside.

779
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,844
Does he know he's suspended?

780
00:52:55,604 --> 00:52:58,273
I was coming for
my files, Marty.

781
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,177
Hey, hey, hey!

782
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,645
Whoa!

783
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,447
Come on, guys, stop this shit.

784
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,483
Come on, Marty.

785
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,319
Come on, swing, Marty!

786
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,388
You're gettin' your ass kicked!

787
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,455
Oh, my God.

788
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,424
Get Salter.
Get Salter!

789
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,826
Hurry up! Stop them!

790
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,461
Hey!

791
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,629
Stop!

792
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:22,730
Oh!

793
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,933
Stay down, Marty.
Come on now.

794
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,634
Don't do it!
Hop up!

795
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:27,835
Get up, get up!
Work it out.

796
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,672
Calm down, Marty.
All right,
that's enough now.

797
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,408
Hey!

798
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,275
All right, back off!

799
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,611
Come on! Come on!
Get him out of here!
Come on, Hart!

800
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,413
Get him the fuck out of here!

801
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:38,947
Fuck you!

802
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,715
- Calm down, Marty!
- Cohle!

803
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,418
You better calm
your shit right now!

804
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,552
Get inside!

805
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,955
You standing around
watching this shit?!

806
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,523
Get the fuck inside!

807
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,991
I'm gonna
kill you, motherfucker!

808
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,492
Get him inside.

809
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:52,427
We ain't done here!

810
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,696
Get him inside.
We ain't done here!

811
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,564
Stop this shit.

812
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,235
I'm gonna need
some fuckin' detail
here, you two.

813
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,471
It's a personal
matter between us, Boss.

814
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,975
Is there anybody
pressin' charges?

815
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,010
Not me.

816
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:13,014
You want to say anything, Cohle?

817
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:15,516
No.

818
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,518
This man right here

819
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,953
is the only pal you had,

820
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,321
you understand that?

821
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,458
Fuck him.
I ain't his pal.

822
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,363
I quit.

823
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:28,997
You serious?

824
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,566
I'll send you a letter.
Yeah, fuck this.

825
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,435
Fuck this world, man.

826
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:37,739
Nice hook, Marty.

827
00:54:39,908 --> 00:54:42,410
¶

828
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:46,047
You're not gonna go
into this, huh? Really?

829
00:54:46,782 --> 00:54:50,618
You two fucked each
other up pretty good.

830
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,054
No shit.

831
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:02,997
What about when
he quit? Any idea why?

832
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:06,901
Maybe it was
old stuff between them...

833
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:10,805
the way they
always rubbed wrong.

834
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,475
I never learned
what it was about.

835
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:18,346
¶

836
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:10,098
Marty.

837
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,033
Rust.

838
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,102
Long time.

839
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:17,905
Long time.

840
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,974
Change your hair?

841
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,711
Thought maybe we should talk.

842
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,546
Yeah?

843
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,782
Buy you a beer?

844
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:34,489
Sure. I'll follow you.

845
00:56:42,664 --> 00:56:46,434
Actually, why don't you
buy me a beer?

846
