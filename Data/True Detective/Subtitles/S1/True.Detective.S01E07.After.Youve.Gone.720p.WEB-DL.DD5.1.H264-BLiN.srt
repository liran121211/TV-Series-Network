00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:16,006
¶

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,299
¶

3
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,614
¶

4
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:09,226
You look like you're
doing all right.

5
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,763
Father Time has
his way with us all.

6
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:17,201
Looks like you must
have pissed him off.

7
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,377
Ahem.

8
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,712
Why we here?

9
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,280
I got a thing

10
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:33,350
the State PD's asking about.

11
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,653
The Lake Charles murder.

12
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,222
I mean, shouldn't it
have been in the paper

13
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,290
to draw a line somewhere by now?

14
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,693
I mean, we can't trust them.

15
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:46,096
And, I mean, if they're
gonna cover something
like that up,

16
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:49,233
who knows what else
they've covered up?

17
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,068
What you think?

18
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,738
I think you don't look
particularly healthy.

19
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,940
Listening to you talk,

20
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,376
your eyes, you seem

21
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,311
kind of brittle, Rust.

22
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:05,816
Most of the last decade
I spent stone-drunk.

23
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,986
Functional, but hammered.

24
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,354
Went back to Alaska,

25
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,724
spent 8 years working
fishing boats, bars.

26
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,293
Oh, I thought you didn't
like the cold.
I hate it.

27
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:21,298
And then I come back
here to Louisiana for
the first time in 2010.

28
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,299
And why is that?

29
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:27,104
The same reason
I'm sitting across
the table from you now.

30
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,874
A man remembers his debts.

31
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:34,211
I don't dwell on the past.

32
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,913
Well, it must be nice.

33
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,817
I'm not interested
in whatever it is
you think you owe me.

34
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,452
Oh, I don't owe you.

35
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,955
We left something undone.

36
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,256
We got to fix it,

37
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:49,259
and I've been working
on this for two years.

38
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,027
Me, myself.

39
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,062
Never called you,
I never bothered you
with it...

40
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,765
Yeah, why would you?
Shit, man,
what did you do?

41
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,934
Alienate every other
person in your life,

42
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,869
and then finally
you came back to me
in the rotation?

43
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,306
You know, not for nothing,
but if you wouldn't have
clipped Ledoux back then,

44
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:06,043
we might have got
the whole fucking
story out of him.

45
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:10,314
You know, I think I'm
gonna finish this beer
and say so long.

46
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,915
Now, I'm not much of
a drinker nowadays.

47
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:15,385
In fact, I hadn't had
a drop in 3 weeks
till I ran into you.

48
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,821
Well, I don't need you
to drink, Marty.

49
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,857
I need you to help me.
Why would I?

50
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,392
They say you can't
account for your time.

51
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,828
They got eyewitnesses
placing you

52
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,196
at the Lake Charles crime scene.

53
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:29,433
You got some
storage shed that you
won't let them look at.

54
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,467
That's right.
Why not?

55
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:33,203
Why not shoot
straight with them?
You're innocent.

56
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:34,371
Help them stop
wasting their time.

57
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:39,076
Fucking since when
did guilt and innocence
define the State PD, huh?

58
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,277
Come the fuck on.

59
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,479
Now, I don't know
the sprawl of this
thing, all right?

60
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,915
The people I'm after,
they're all fucking over.

61
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,184
They're in a lot
of different things,

62
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,153
pieces, family trees.

63
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,421
The only way for you
to understand

64
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,791
what I'm on to here
is for me to show you.

65
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,193
You got to come see what I got.

66
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,394
No. You know what?

67
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,464
I don't think I've
been very clear
with you, Rust.

68
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,366
If you were drowning,

69
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,068
I'd throw you a fucking barbell.

70
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,206
Why would I ever help you?

71
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,915
Because you have a debt.

72
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,892
You got some fucking sack.

73
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:31,461
What's that mean,
I have a debt, huh?

74
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:35,232
Means the way
shit went down in '95,

75
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,169
this is on you, too, buddy.

76
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:49,446
What do you got to show me?

77
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:06,256
What you packing?

78
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,395
.38.

79
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,664
Hollow-point?

80
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,465
Yeah.

81
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,235
That'd do it.

82
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,246
You never be too careful.

83
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:45,195
All right.

84
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:48,265
Remember, there was
no physical evidence

85
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,634
connecting Dora Lange
to Ledoux's place

86
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,271
out in the woods,
meaning it probably
didn't happen out there.

87
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,707
Nobody was in a hurry
to bring that up.

88
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,610
Two... women and children
gone missing,

89
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,280
all taken from areas
within a 10-mile radius

90
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,217
of schools that were
funded by Tuttle's
Wellspring initiative.

91
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,186
We establish a connection.

92
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,420
Who's in, who's out, you know?

93
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:14,658
I mean, do people disappear
in equal numbers in
other parts of the state?

94
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,327
How many schools
were there?
14.

95
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,063
Now, I've covered
a surface area.

96
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,199
I pulled runaways in state

97
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,700
and missing persons,
and if you'll notice,

98
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:26,636
there's twice as many
along the bayous.
I don't know why.

99
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,172
Hell, someone should do
a study as to why.

100
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,308
Well, now you're just
throwing up stats.

101
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,544
Why was Tuttle
so interested in
the Lange case, huh?

102
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,514
Remember
Charlie Lange said
what Ledoux told him?

103
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:40,584
Said there's a group
of men, sacrifices.

104
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,419
Well, I think Tuttle
recognized the scene.

105
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,622
That's why he came down
there jiminy quick with
a fucking task force,

106
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:49,026
and that's why
he tripped out when
I talked to him in '02.

107
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,361
OK, so what happened to him?

108
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,463
I mean, I'm looking around here,

109
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,799
and I don't see or hear anything

110
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,302
that doesn't make this
all conjectural.

111
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:01,638
1988.

112
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,075
Accusations of child molestation

113
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,777
at a preschool funded by Tuttle.

114
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,212
Name of that school
is Shepherd's Flock.

115
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,716
It shuts down,
reopens two years later
on Pelican Island

116
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,552
under the name Light
of the Way Academy,

117
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,120
where Rianne Olivier went.

118
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:20,390
And I got
an enrollment list...
16 kids in the class.

119
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,493
One of them turned out
to be a young man
who'd just showed up

120
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:26,463
for solicitation in New Orleans.

121
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:30,400
¶

122
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:33,503
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Now, this is 2010.

123
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,739
His name is Toby Boelert.

124
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,810
Goes by the name
of Johnny Joanie.

125
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,153
Shepherd's Flock?

126
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,722
Why are you asking me
about that place?

127
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:58,328
You know, after that place
shut down, there was a lot
of talk going around.

128
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,765
You ever see that reverend...

129
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,266
Billy Lee Tuttle, around?

130
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:07,304
You know, I think so,
but who can remember
way back?

131
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,539
That's how it all started.

132
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,642
Memory be fucked.

133
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:15,745
I decided it all had
to be a dream anyways,

134
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:19,549
and I don't remember if it...

135
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:21,651
We'd go to sleep,

136
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,821
only sometimes I didn't
feel like I was asleep.

137
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:28,325
I felt like I was
still awake, but I
must have been asleep

138
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,193
because I couldn't move.

139
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:34,698
Just... sort of see
under my eyelids.

140
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,234
And what?

141
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,436
I don't know.

142
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,872
There were men...

143
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,908
taking pictures.

144
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,511
Sometimes...

145
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,912
other things.

146
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,914
Who were they?

147
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,616
I don't know.

148
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,484
They had animal faces.

149
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,720
That's why I decided
it had to be a dream.

150
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,891
They had animal faces,
well, it had
to be a dream.

151
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,393
Any other kids see this?

152
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:04,861
One girl.

153
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:07,297
I don't remember her name.

154
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,733
She first started
talking about it.

155
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,335
And she seen it, too, the faces.

156
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,504
I do not remember her name.

157
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,606
Marie Fontenot?

158
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,476
Maybe.

159
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,279
You ever see any of
these men's faces?

160
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:22,946
Once.

161
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,483
They didn't all have
animal faces.

162
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:30,854
Three younger men.
I don't remember them.

163
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,222
Just one.

164
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,558
He had bad scars
all around his mouth,

165
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,762
like the bottom half
got all burned up.

166
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,531
You know what?

167
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:45,602
I thought that man,
he was a dream, too.

168
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:50,240
No, I don't think
he was a dream.

169
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,609
I don't understand.

170
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,578
Are you saying that you think

171
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,713
that this hypothetical killer

172
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,616
was, uh, an old schoolteacher?

173
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,286
Or it might what,
involve State PD?

174
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:06,923
Goddamn. What happened
to you, man?

175
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,993
Remember him? Hmm?

176
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,727
Yeah.

177
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,296
Yeah. You and I were on
the case in Erath.

178
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:16,866
Girl comes forward
and says she was chased
through the woods

179
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,336
by a spaghetti monster
with green ears.

180
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,771
Now, I think
that this is our man

181
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,974
with the scars on his face.

182
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,977
We got 3 references
17 years ago: that old

183
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,547
revival church said
a tall man with scars
came through,

184
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,549
Kelly Reider in the hospital,

185
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,818
and now this hooker
from the quarter... Toby.

186
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,687
I don't know who he is,
I don't know where he
is, I don't know where

187
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,890
this whole thing
fucking starts,
but it ends with him.

188
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:44,728
All right, you know
the little township
down around Erath?

189
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,598
All right, that's
where the Tuttle
family is from.

190
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,268
Now, it used to be
a pirate hideout,

191
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,837
then turned
into plantations
and whatnot.

192
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,905
Had a very rural
sense of Mardi Gras,

193
00:12:55,907 --> 00:13:00,510
uh, you know,
the men on horses,
animals masks, such.

194
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,812
Courir de Mardi Gras.
That's right.

195
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,482
Now, they had
an annual winter
festival.

196
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,751
Went heavy on
the Saturnalia,
a place where

197
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,488
that Santeria
and Voudon all
mash together.

198
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,622
Have a look.

199
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,492
From the winter festival.

200
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,894
Blindfold...

201
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:20,997
antlers, mask.

202
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,402
I got these from a series
an artist did in Kenner,

203
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,770
right after Katrina.

204
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,839
Says he kept
running across these
"stick things,"

205
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,342
as he called them.

206
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,777
Look familiar?

207
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,348
Think our man had a
real good time after
the hurricane...

208
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,049
Chaos,

209
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,851
people missing, and people gone.

210
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,486
Cops gone.

211
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:46,323
I think he had a real good year.

212
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,991
What do you need me for?

213
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,361
You got friends on the force.

214
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,798
You have access
that I don't,
databases.

215
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,366
I need case files.

216
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,401
I need missing persons.
I need homicides.

217
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:00,704
I need
title transfers,
auto and home.

218
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,771
I got a list of names.

219
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:03,707
I'm gonna need
background checks,
tax records,

220
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,842
anything we can get on Ledoux.

221
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,843
Jesus Christ, man.

222
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,079
I wouldn't have called
you and I wouldn't have
fucking bothered you

223
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,482
if State wouldn't
have pulled me in on
this Lake Charles case.

224
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,784
Well, if you need help,
why don't you just

225
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,119
give it to Papania and Gilbough?

226
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,556
No, they may be pawns
in this thing and not
even fucking know it.

227
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,491
Come on.
Look, Eddie Tuttle is

228
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,093
the goddamn senator
of this state.

229
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,129
The late Reverend
Billy Lee Tuttle
is his cousin.

230
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,864
I'm telling you, it's
a fucking family thing.

231
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,799
That's what I mean
when I talk about
the sprawl, Marty!

232
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,737
Eddie Tuttle's the reason
that the Lake Charles thing
never made the wire.

233
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,906
Look, man, you have
some compelling stuff here

234
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:39,609
and you might have something,

235
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:41,778
but...

236
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,113
all this... this...

237
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,750
The "sprawl,"
as you call it, which
I would call conjecture,

238
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,686
this shit about
the Tuttles,
the State PD.

239
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,757
Do you know
how fucking crazy
that sounds?

240
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,159
It's like you've been
alone too long, you know,

241
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,629
like you maybe told
yourself this story

242
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,400
and kept drinking
until you believed it.

243
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,436
Marty...

244
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:12,709
I had my time where I
wondered if this was
all in my head.

245
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:16,146
That time passed.

246
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,114
Really?

247
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:25,722
What happened
to Billy Lee Tuttle?

248
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,561
There's something you're
gonna have to look at.

249
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,831
No other way around it.

250
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:40,069
You still take
your coffee black?

251
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:43,039
Oh, uh, green tea,
if you have it.

252
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,642
I've been trying to stay
away from coffee,

253
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,844
you know,
a little bit healthier.

254
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:52,115
So, Mace... is she, uh,
back from Chicago yet?

255
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,584
Mm-hmm,
3 months ago.

256
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,718
3 months.

257
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,088
Uh... and what
was it, that...

258
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,224
Americorps.

259
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,226
Oh.
Teaching.

260
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,195
And Audrey,
how... how's she?

261
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,497
She's fine, at the moment.

262
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,534
She sometimes decides she
doesn't need her meds.

263
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:13,503
I like her boyfriend.

264
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,004
He watches out for her.

265
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,841
She had an art show
in New Orleans,

266
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,609
sold some paintings.

267
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,911
Oh, that's good.
That's great.

268
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,680
I should buy one,

269
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,517
I mean, if I can afford it.

270
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,155
So the reason I, uh...

271
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,191
I mean, like I said
on the phone, I...

272
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,894
I want to ask you
about those cops.

273
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,965
They just wanted to know
about you and Rust.

274
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,733
Mostly Rust.

275
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:46,069
They wanted to know about

276
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,239
the fight in '02.

277
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,676
Mmm, did you tell them?

278
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:54,944
No...

279
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:58,114
but they think Rust
did something.

280
00:16:58,116 --> 00:16:59,916
I know.

281
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,584
He didn't.

282
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,821
I didn't think he did.

283
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:13,129
Have you...
talked to him?

284
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:17,100
No, not since.

285
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,568
Have you?

286
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,038
Yeah, I mean, after
they brought me in.

287
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,573
Yeah.

288
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,208
How is he?

289
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,976
Different, same.

290
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,546
I mean, he's lived rough

291
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,015
for a long time now.

292
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,919
He always did, it seemed like.

293
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,755
Taken a toll.

294
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,891
He needs my help.

295
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:45,161
Are you gonna help him?

296
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,233
Yes.

297
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,302
Why?

298
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,704
I have to.

299
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,340
Well, what is it?
What do the police
think he did?

300
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,076
I can't talk about that.
It's PI stuff.

301
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:03,680
He's hiring the firm,
I'm hiring him.

302
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,082
All this time, you two,

303
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:10,019
and just...
Just like that?

304
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:14,891
Oh, I took some convincing.

305
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:18,761
I looked in Billy's eyes.

306
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,697
He looked in mine.

307
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,266
He got me suspended.

308
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,235
Now, Billy Lee Tuttle

309
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:28,104
owns 3 houses in Louisiana.

310
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,740
One in Shreveport,
one in Baton Rouge,

311
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,141
one in New Orleans.

312
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,810
Also one in Florida.

313
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:38,314
I waited till he went
on his spring ministry
tour, 2010...

314
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,617
Look, Rust, I changed my mind.

315
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,286
If you did something,
I don't want to hear
about it.

316
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,623
Remember I told you
about my stint
in robbery?

317
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,026
I make a pretty ace B&E man.

318
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,263
Now, I staked
his places out for weeks.

319
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:56,833
Checked surveillance,
map security.

320
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,135
I found ingresses.
Now, here I am, you know.

321
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:02,138
My whole life is just one
expanding, circular fuck-up

322
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,242
and I think it's about
to close out with me getting
clipped in a home invasion.

323
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:13,216
I mean, what I'm saying is
I was aware that I might
have lost my mind.

324
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,863
But after the second home...

325
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:32,235
doubt got taken behind
the woodshed and put down.

326
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:38,141
Notice he never reported
the Baton Rouge break-in,

327
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,677
just the Shreveport house.

328
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,046
Found those in the safe there.

329
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,683
Paper stock's over 15 years old.

330
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,750
Goddamn it.

331
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:50,119
These...
they aren't as bad

332
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:53,890
if you don't know what
you're looking at.

333
00:19:57,695 --> 00:20:00,163
Motherfuck.

334
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:09,372
And...

335
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:13,476
there's a videotape.

336
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,728
Take a look.

337
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:45,434
No!

338
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:48,471
God!

339
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,506
Jesus!

340
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,842
Ohh!

341
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:55,845
Fuck!

342
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:02,852
Fuck!

343
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:07,890
You watch all of that?

344
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:08,524
Yeah.

345
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:13,229
Yeah, I had to,
see if any of the men
took off their mask.

346
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,531
None did.

347
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,500
Oh, fuck.

348
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,970
I won't avert my eyes.

349
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,506
Not again.

350
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:27,376
Jesus Christ.

351
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,548
That little girl is
Marie Fontenot.

352
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,120
Did you kill Tuttle?

353
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:39,355
No.

354
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,590
I assume that

355
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,259
he was thinking he was
gonna be blackmailed.

356
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,495
And I think some
people took him out
after they found out

357
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:51,300
what was taken
from the safe, before
he had a chance to.

358
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:57,139
What... can I do to help?

359
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:01,644
We start by pulling
everything there is
on Dora Lange.

360
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,212
And I got names,

361
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,382
I got family members,
Tuttle connections.

362
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,051
Any information that we can get

363
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,454
on Reggie or Dewall Ledoux.

364
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,523
All right,
we can coordinate
out of your offices

365
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,193
if you want.

366
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,335
You shouldn't have that.

367
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,942
Nobody should have this.

368
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:44,053
I'm glad
that you're doing
good, Maggie.

369
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,223
It seems like
everybody's happy,
you know.

370
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,358
It's... ahem.

371
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,694
It's good to see.

372
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,196
Thank you

373
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:56,933
for everything.

374
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:02,104
I haven't seen you
in over two years,
Marty.

375
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:07,543
Did you come here
to say good-bye?

376
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:12,048
Thank you, Maggie.

377
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,550
I mean that.

378
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,311
There's not gonna be
a bunch of people

379
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:45,214
coming in and out of
this place, is there?

380
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,550
What do you think, Rust?

381
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,090
Practical terms,
we're doing an identify
and locate.

382
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,659
Now, I can't afford
to subscribe to all

383
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,428
the databases that I used to,

384
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,365
but I got Auto Track XP

385
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,400
for motor vehicle records.

386
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,102
I got Flat Rate Info

387
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:09,271
for the QI National
People Locator,

388
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:12,041
public records, of course.

389
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,275
All right.

390
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:16,045
That sounds good.

391
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:23,152
How you been? Ahem.

392
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,221
You know, besides work,

393
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,490
what do you do?

394
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:31,360
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't ever remember
you asking me

395
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:34,330
a personal question before.

396
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,799
Uh... you know,

397
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:40,036
I just stay busy, uh,

398
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,538
fish, girlfriends.

399
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,107
You seeing anybody?

400
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,443
Not really.
Some dates.

401
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:51,247
You know, it's all
pretty casual.

402
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:54,350
I did have something
going for a while,

403
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:59,221
this Filipino girl,
but that didn't pan out.

404
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:06,729
Quiet life.
I don't stay out late.
I just... I go home.

405
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,411
You?

406
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,713
Ah, I'm about the same.

407
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:26,515
No girlfriend.

408
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:29,819
Just go to work, go home.

409
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,476
How about that girl
you were seeing in '02?

410
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,411
What ever happened with her?

411
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,114
Yeah, that was never gonna last.

412
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,783
Never should have started.

413
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,518
Yeah. Boy.

414
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,820
She, uh, she had problems.

415
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:07,690
Oh, you always liked them crazy.

416
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,159
Yeah, that I did.

417
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,761
Why'd you quit, Marty?

418
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:16,866
Yeah, you could have
been boss, you know.

419
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,401
LT, at least, captain.

420
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:23,139
I did another 4 years
after you left, and I...

421
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:27,543
I guess the job
just kind of ran
its course with me.

422
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,478
How is that?

423
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,149
I was gonna play
baseball, ride bulls.

424
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,217
You know, you end up becoming

425
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,386
something you never intended.

426
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:43,225
Uh, I guess you never
really even know why.

427
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:47,796
I suppose I could
have been a painter,

428
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,765
you know, a historian.

429
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,401
Old scenes, new details.

430
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:55,804
Yeah, yeah. You do
much painting?

431
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:56,438
Nah.

432
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,642
Little late in the game
to start something
like that, I reckon.

433
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,612
Life's barely long enough
to get good at one thing.

434
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:05,514
If that long.

435
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:09,752
Yeah, so be careful
what you get good at.

436
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,593
What do you call
a black man who
flies a plane?

437
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,428
I don't know.

438
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,763
Pilot, you racist bastard.

439
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,731
What else would you call him?

440
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:28,404
Well, speaking of,
you know, I been taking
some writing courses?

441
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,206
Heh heh!
And, uh... no.

442
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,309
I have, and I been
tinkering around

443
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,412
with this thing off and on.

444
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,580
True crime.

445
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,682
And that's the genre,
not the title.

446
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,816
You serious?
Yeah.

447
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:44,987
You know, what happened
in '95 and some other
old cases,

448
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,957
and all I need from you, Bobby,

449
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:51,894
is some old copies
of case files.

450
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:57,766
You still like your
single malt, don't you?

451
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:02,504
Ah, I guess I do.

452
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,908
Oh, business gotten
so bad you got to
become a writer?

453
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,345
Nope, I've always
wanted to do it.
I just never had the time.

454
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,982
And regards the files,
I'd like to avoid
Fuck and Suck,

455
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,884
the two dicks I spent
last Saturday with.

456
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:19,388
Hmm. Papania
and Gilbough.

457
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,789
I hear ya.

458
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,292
'Course, man.
Whatever you need.

459
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,994
Ah!

460
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,729
Appreciate it, Bobby.

461
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,731
Not a problem.

462
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,333
Missing persons, mostly.

463
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:33,669
Maybe far back as the eighties.

464
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,671
Well, anything
before '05 that never

465
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,274
became part of an
official investigation,

466
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,342
it isn't gonna be
in the computers.

467
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:43,946
You're gonna have to
sort through the files.

468
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:56,425
Thank you.

469
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:24,019
¶

470
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:26,822
Found something, background.

471
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:29,625
Dewall Ledoux
transferred title
on a truck

472
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,659
to a Jimmy Ledoux.

473
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,828
Appears like that
might be a cousin.

474
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,031
I found him in White Castle.

475
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,767
Owns an auto shop.

476
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,069
All right.

477
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,372
Did you pull that
Marie Fontenot file?

478
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,774
There wasn't one.

479
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:49,411
Report's gone.
Backtracking that.

480
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:59,555
Marty, this
is Robert Doumain.
He owns the place.

481
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,024
Hey, how's it going?

482
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,460
Nice spot.

483
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,062
He's not a cop no more, Robert.

484
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:10,599
You got something against cops?

485
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,968
Bob had a little boy.

486
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,071
Been missing since '85.

487
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:21,443
Sorry.

488
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,913
Jimmy Ledoux came up spotless...

489
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,049
3 kids, wife's a teacher.

490
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,619
He coaches his boys'
pee-wee football team.

491
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,156
Any relation?

492
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,059
So many Ledouxs around,
I never had to worry
about a connection.

493
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,696
But, yeah, my dad's
second cousin
or something.

494
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,064
My pops didn't like them none.

495
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,768
Said they weren't
white enough
to be white trash.

496
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,470
What's this about, exactly?

497
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:50,105
Man asked us
to locate his daughter.

498
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:54,176
It was a long time ago,
but it looks like she
might have known Dewall.

499
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,477
Sorry to hear that.

500
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:57,946
Must know what happened to them.

501
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:00,015
Sick shits.

502
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,583
Pop said they died too quick.

503
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:05,854
Is there anything
you remember that you can
tell us about these guys?

504
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:08,957
Just they were nuts.
Looked at you funky.

505
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:12,194
Reggie was always
asking about the
girls in my school,

506
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,931
and couple times I
saw Dewall, he just
said kooky stuff.

507
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:19,535
Any chance you ever saw
a third man with them,

508
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,471
a man who had a bunch of scars

509
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,874
on the bottom of his face?

510
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:31,947
It's weird you say that.

511
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,683
I remember that face.

512
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:37,786
My pop let them use
our deer camp once.

513
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,922
Took me with him.
I was, like, 11.

514
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,124
They were maybe
10 years older
than me.

515
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,560
They introduced us to the guy.

516
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,163
His face, underneath
his nose and cheeks,

517
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:49,731
scarred.

518
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,867
Gave me funny looks all night.

519
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,771
Every time
I glanced at him,
staring at me.

520
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,142
Any chance this man
with the scars was
another Ledoux?

521
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:04,146
No. I don't know.
I don't think so.

522
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:07,916
Next morning, men were
too hung-over to hunt.
Pop and I went home.

523
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:13,655
You, uh, ever see him
again, guy with the scars?

524
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:15,991
Never again.

525
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,660
I'd remember.

526
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:34,910
Fuck, I don't like this place.

527
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:39,047
Nothing grows in
the right direction.

528
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:43,552
Where'd this woman come from?

529
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,920
Tax records.

530
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,090
Drew a paycheck from
Tuttle's father.

531
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:52,060
Uh, some kind of domestic.

532
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,162
How'd you find her?

533
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:58,200
Well, had to get federal
income tax records

534
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,802
from '40 to '59.

535
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:03,772
I matched Social
with a credit check run

536
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:05,874
in the late nineties

537
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:09,311
for Section-8 housing
in Alexandria.

538
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,079
Mmm, good job.

539
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:13,615
Look at you. Heh!
Hmm.

540
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:17,085
High praise from a bartender.

541
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:20,989
¶

542
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:24,219
Cops.

543
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,869
She gets tired easy,

544
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,671
'specially hot as it is.

545
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,173
Now, I don't understand
what this is about.

546
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,308
Thank you.

547
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,343
We're private investigators,

548
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:45,013
hired to do, uh,
ancestral research.

549
00:34:45,015 --> 00:34:48,083
M-mineral rights
along the coast.

550
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:48,750
Hmm.

551
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:52,821
I never knew
them Tuttle people,
but I heard stories.

552
00:34:52,823 --> 00:34:54,056
No, thank you.

553
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:57,125
You think she might get
some money out this?

554
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:59,061
Uh, quite possible.

555
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:03,031
Depends on what we find out.

556
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,269
Miss Delores?

557
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,205
You worked
for Mr. Sam Tuttle

558
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:12,341
19 years, right?

559
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,775
Yes.

560
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:15,143
Erath.

561
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:16,912
Mm-hmm.

562
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,347
Then Shreveport.

563
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,150
So you knew his son,
Billy Lee, right?

564
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,619
Mm-hmm.

565
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,686
A cousin, Eddie?

566
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:27,623
Little boys, mm-hmm.
I remember.

567
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,024
What about extended family?

568
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,761
Cousins, you know,
that might have been
close to the boys?

569
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,631
Those days,
families were bigger.

570
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:41,236
Oh, all sorts
of brothers, cousins,
kids just running around.

571
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:43,639
Did, uh, Sam Tuttle have

572
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,341
kids outside
his marriage that
you know about?

573
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:48,944
Hmm!
Don't you know it.

574
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:53,882
Now, people kept
their own back then.

575
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:58,253
I mean, a man's house
was his own.

576
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:00,288
Mr. Sam?

577
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,225
He had lots of children.

578
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,861
All types.

579
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:09,865
He didn't like a woman...

580
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:14,403
See, once she had it
done to her,

581
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,407
he didn't like them
but that one time.

582
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,341
Not after that.

583
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,278
Hmm, and out
of all these kids
running around,

584
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,049
you remember one
that maybe had scars

585
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,685
all across the
bottom of his face?

586
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,789
I... I think that was
Mr. Sam's grandchild.

587
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,359
His daddy did that
to him, that poor boy.

588
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,763
I... I think that child
was a... a Childress

589
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:44,866
or what, Fi, he was
a LeBeau or a Childress?

590
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:49,004
From Mr. Sam's
other family?

591
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:53,709
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

592
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,044
That's OK.

593
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,379
Miss Delores.

594
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:01,116
Could you have a look
at something for me?
One thing.

595
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:05,320
Just have a look.
See if you recognize it.

596
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:16,164
You know Carcosa?

597
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,734
What is it?

598
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:27,876
Him who eats time.

599
00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:32,280
Him robes...

600
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:35,317
it's a wind of invisible voices.

601
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,321
Mineral rights, my ass.
What you all doing?

602
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,922
Rejoice.

603
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,224
Death is not the end.

604
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,259
- Rejoice.
- You need to leave, now.

605
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:48,029
Death is not the end.
You need to leave.

606
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:50,332
You know Carcosa?

607
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,768
You rejoice.

608
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,770
Carcosa.

609
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:26,034
Rest of the family,
they don't really
talk to Aunt D.

610
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,435
She crazy.

611
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:28,570
Dementia.

612
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,572
She never had any kind
of good life,

613
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,208
but most days, she can't
even make sense.

614
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,377
Yeah? She sure
made sense to me.

615
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:39,381
That should worry you, mister.

616
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:52,060
Sure hope that
old lady was wrong.

617
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:53,195
About what?

618
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,998
About death not being
the end of it.

619
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:03,872
¶

620
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:08,009
Did some backtracking
on the Marie Fontenot stuff.

621
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,010
Got some old sheets.

622
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,880
Sheriff signed off on
the "report made in error,"

623
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:16,117
but he didn't take the
original complaint on her.

624
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,353
Deputy did.

625
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,288
Got a name?

626
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,892
You ain't gonna
believe this shit.

627
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,493
Steve Geraci.

628
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,262
So I did some
double-checking.

629
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:32,133
Before CID, he was
with Vermillion
Parish Sheriff's.

630
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:34,035
Erath was his beat.

631
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:37,305
If it got covered up,
Steve might know something.

632
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:41,209
Didn't say
a fucking word when we
asked about it in '95.

633
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:45,213
Oh, I never did like
that cocksucker.

634
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,015
Where is he now?

635
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,418
Well, uh, this is the thing.

636
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,488
He's from Iberia originally.

637
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,991
After CID, he went home.

638
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:59,461
He's Sheriff of Iberia Parish.

639
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,062
Shit.

640
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:01,529
Yeah.

641
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:04,399
Rust, the only person
can arrest the sheriff

642
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:06,167
in this state is the governor.

643
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:09,571
Well, we ain't looking
to arrest him, Marty,

644
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,940
just have a little chat.

645
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,408
Well, he ain't
gonna talk with you.

646
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,212
I got a car battery
and two jumper cables
argue different.

647
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,447
Don't even start with that shit.

648
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,383
What do you recommend, Marty?

649
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,418
Well, fuck, why don't
you talk to him?

650
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,420
You two always liked each other.

651
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:28,323
Well, what can I say?
I'm a people person.

652
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,927
Well, start with that, then.

653
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,131
Oh.

654
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,432
Oh, come on.

655
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,602
Just try to relax.
Take your time.

656
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:45,407
There you go.

657
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,309
OK.
Nice shot.

658
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,678
What was that, 15 on the green?

659
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,548
Ha ha ha!
I don't know.

660
00:40:55,551 --> 00:40:57,118
Hey, you know, on the phone,

661
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,021
you were saying
something about
that Fontenot girl.

662
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:02,524
Yeah.
Why's that
on your radar?

663
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:06,127
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just, uh,

664
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:09,564
extended family wants a locate.

665
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,200
I didn't remember at the time.

666
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,468
Back in '95,

667
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,271
I was hitting
the bottle a lot
back then.

668
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,139
Yeah, who wasn't?

669
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:21,443
20 years ago, you know.

670
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,212
My recall,

671
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:26,348
girl's mom was single,

672
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,084
drug charges.

673
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,453
Uh...

674
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:36,257
Little girl went to live
with her birth daddy,

675
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,126
I think.

676
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,628
That is, if I'm
remembering right.

677
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,064
Uh, Mama didn't make
a fuss after

678
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:47,669
the first notice,
so she was fine with it.

679
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:53,308
And you talked to
the family directly
back then?

680
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:58,713
No. Ted Childress,
the sheriff.
He knew them.

681
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,649
Childress?

682
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:04,753
Now watch this.

683
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:07,789
Whew!

684
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,557
You like that?

685
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,128
Seized it off
a good old boy, had a
quarter-bag of weed.

686
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,664
Ooh. You got to love
this country.

687
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,100
Good to see you again, man.

688
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:21,636
Good to see you.

689
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:24,439
Hey, uh,

690
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,241
that client you got,

691
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,243
asking about the Fontenot girl.

692
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,546
You let them know
I'll be happy
to talk to them.

693
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,715
Oh, yeah, distant relatives.

694
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,818
St. Louis.
Trying to settle
a tiny inheritance.

695
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,320
Don't worry about it.

696
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:40,422
OK.

697
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:44,059
Well, they want to talk,
you let them know.

698
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,795
Yeah. Don't go
too fast, Sheriff.

699
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,064
Not me.

700
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,832
Let's do it again sometime.

701
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,401
Yeah, I'd like that.

702
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,245
Hey.

703
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:07,482
Better get those
jumper cables ready.

704
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,785
The motherfucker's lying.

705
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:17,392
¶

706
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,164
Rust.

707
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,366
It's good to see you.

708
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,768
Bullshit.

709
00:44:06,575 --> 00:44:08,676
I talked to Marty.

710
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:11,613
I hear you talked
to the cops, too.

711
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,748
Yes, them, too.

712
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,917
How are you?

713
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,752
What'd Marty tell you?

714
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:19,821
He wanted to know what
the police asked me about.

715
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:24,425
He said he was helping you
with something. That's it.

716
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:27,395
How long you been back?

717
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:29,464
Hear you got a big house.

718
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,500
Marty says the girls
are doing fine.

719
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:34,602
That's good.

720
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,471
Rust,

721
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:40,608
just tell me it's
something that's not
gonna get him hurt.

722
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,911
Well, I can't tell you that.

723
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:47,882
It never sat right with me,

724
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:53,454
and it doesn't now,
you asking me to lie
to you about him.

725
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:55,857
Now, get on out of here.

726
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,494
You're classing the place up.

727
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:08,336
Why'd you quit, Marty?

728
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,673
What's the real reason?
What happened?

729
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,776
You tell me why you
come back, for real.

730
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,512
Mmm, you first.

731
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,548
Why'd you quit?

732
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,852
Well, I saw something.

733
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:27,388
Baby.

734
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:32,360
HART, VOICE-OVER:
Tweaker tried
to dry the kid

735
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,929
in a microwave.

736
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:47,275
Saw that, what he'd done,
and I thought...

737
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:51,879
never again.

738
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:54,882
I thought I... I never
want to look

739
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:59,921
at anything like that anymore.

740
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:02,924
Ahem.

741
00:46:04,493 --> 00:46:06,427
Your turn.

742
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:11,266
Why'd you, uh,
why'd you come back?

743
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,273
This.

744
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,509
Something I had to see to...

745
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:25,813
before getting on
with something else.

746
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:33,788
My life's been a circle

747
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,858
of violence and degradation

748
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,395
long as I can remember.

749
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:44,432
I'm ready to tie it off.

750
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:49,604
See you on the boat.

751
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:02,984
After the other day,
I was thinking,

752
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,688
"Why don't I see Steve
and the boys more?"

753
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,392
Ain't been out
to my camp in a while.

754
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,595
You know, if I
don't get out here

755
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:16,831
3, 4 times a year...

756
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,767
I'm a basket case.

757
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:22,403
I hear ya.

758
00:47:23,105 --> 00:47:24,639
Ah.

759
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,708
I do love a reason to drink beer

760
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,444
first thing in the morning.

761
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:32,013
Oh.

762
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,549
Say, Steve, mmm,

763
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,651
I been wanting to ask,

764
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,753
you know that Fontenot girl?

765
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,923
Remember, going off
with her daddy?

766
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,425
I... I just wasn't clear.

767
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:46,894
Was it you knew for a fact

768
00:47:46,896 --> 00:47:49,063
that she went with her daddy,

769
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:51,899
or somebody told you that
that's what happened?

770
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:55,103
The family talked to
Sheriff Childress.

771
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,573
The girl's aunt and uncle,

772
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,075
he knew them.

773
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:03,578
Mm-hmm.

774
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,681
Who were they?

775
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:12,920
Starting to think
this wasn't just

776
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:15,923
a friendly invitation
from an old pal, huh?

777
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:18,426
It's definitely that.

778
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,395
Well, then try this, then.

779
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,096
I said all I remember
about the girl.

780
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:26,467
Let's just have
a good time, and
don't ask again.

781
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:30,405
I'm with you 150% on that.

782
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,106
All right.

783
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,109
Thing is, Steve...

784
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:37,945
I ain't gonna ask you.

785
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:41,983
He is.

786
00:48:46,054 --> 00:48:49,557
No, I wouldn't
if I was you, Steve.

787
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:53,027
You're out of
your jurisdiction, Sheriff.

788
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:56,130
You realize who I am
now, you assholes?

789
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:59,834
Yeah, I wouldn't
be here if I didn't.

790
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:01,669
Marty.

791
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:05,106
Don't look at me.
I ain't never been
able to control him.

792
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,774
Come on.

793
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:08,776
But you're done after this.

794
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:12,113
I'll have boss
crackers splitting
your ass in Angola.

795
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,615
Yeah, we'll talk about that,

796
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,617
and some other things.

797
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,920
Come on.

798
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:36,771
That church
Cohle talked about's
supposed to be right here.

799
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,906
We're lost.
We're not lost.

800
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:42,043
We're going in
the right direction.
We're heading south.

801
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,511
And that's gonna head us to 49?

802
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:44,912
No, we're not
looking for the 49.

803
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:46,147
We're looking for the church.

804
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,649
I know we're looking
for the church; we ain't
got to no church.

805
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,585
Ain't seen nothing that
even resemble no church.

806
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,887
Ain't nobody
out here to even ask
where anything is.

807
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,724
Let me know when
you see something.
There ain't nothing to see.

808
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:03,197
Hey! Hey!

809
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,635
Yes, sir?

810
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,037
You know there's
a little church
around here?

811
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,206
Pretty old?
Black minister?

812
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:15,009
You must mean Son of Life, sir.

813
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,011
That place shut down.

814
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:21,582
'05, I think, just after
all them hurricanes.

815
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:22,683
Mmm.

816
00:50:22,685 --> 00:50:24,652
You live around here?

817
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,588
No, sir.
I live in St. Martin.

818
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,990
Got a parish contract.

819
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,259
Take care of some cemeteries,

820
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,827
public schools.

821
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,128
All right. Thanks.

822
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,164
Hey, you know
how to get to 49
from here?

823
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:38,032
Sure.

824
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:41,135
About a half-mile,
you'll see a left.

825
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:43,271
PR 1435.

826
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,572
Take that.

827
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,074
About... 7 miles
of fields.

828
00:50:47,076 --> 00:50:49,744
You'll hit 49 before Crowley.

829
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,279
Know your way around, huh?

830
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,146
Oh, yeah, boss.

831
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:55,283
I know the whole coast.
My family...

832
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,251
Thanks.

833
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:20,608
My family's been here
a long, long time.

834
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:43,925
