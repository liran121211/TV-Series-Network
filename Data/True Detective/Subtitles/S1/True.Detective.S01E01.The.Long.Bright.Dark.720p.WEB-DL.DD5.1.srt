00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:10,608
¶

2
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:53,478
¶

3
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:22,306
What'd you think,
you paired up
with him?

4
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,776
What'd I think?

5
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,146
Well, you don't pick
your parents,

6
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,915
and you don't pick your partner.

7
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:36,787
You know, they used to
call him The Tax Man
for a while?

8
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:41,225
He'd come out of Texas,
so nobody knew him.

9
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,427
Seemed a bit...

10
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,664
raw-boned to me, edgy.

11
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,332
Took 3 months till we got him

12
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,402
over to the house for dinner.

13
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,637
Around our big 419.

14
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,473
That's what y'all want
to hear about, right,

15
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,209
Dora Lange, kids in the woods?

16
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,280
Yeah, sure,
but, uh, talk about Cohle.

17
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,681
We heard some stories.

18
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,318
Kind of a strange guy, huh?

19
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,556
Strange. Uh... heh heh heh.

20
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,623
Yeah.

21
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,860
Rust would pick a fight
with the sky

22
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:20,464
if he didn't like
its shade of blue,

23
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,701
but when we finally got
him over to the house...

24
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,703
This is when that case
was hot...

25
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,406
Poor bastard looked like
he was on his way

26
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,676
to the firing squad.

27
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,345
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Dora Lange.

28
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,548
Yeah. Occult ritual murder.

29
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,885
You can thank
the "Advertiser" for that.

30
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,986
Could you, uh, hold off on that?

31
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,989
All right. Yeah.
You can't do that
here no more.

32
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,959
Huh?
Uh-uh.

33
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,260
Don't be assholes.

34
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,230
You want to hear this or not?

35
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:12,350
Vermillion sheriff
requested assistance
with a 419,

36
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,953
cane fields outside of Erath.

37
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,289
I'd been on the job
about 3 months till then.

38
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:23,728
Two previous cases
were open and shut.

39
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:30,268
It was January 3, 1995,
my daughter's birthday.

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,669
I remember.

41
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,007
¶

42
00:04:55,794 --> 00:05:00,031
Hart and Cohle, State CID.

43
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,866
Who found her?

44
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,700
Farmer and his son.

45
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,468
This spread wasn't
scheduled for a burn.

46
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,572
Let's keep them here,
and let's tape off
this road,

47
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,576
and give me your log.

48
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,315
You take the log.

49
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:17,882
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,319
Make sure you get
everything down.

51
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,500
Go ahead.

52
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,725
You ever see
something like this?

53
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:05,363
No, sir,
in 8 years of CID.

54
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,699
Them symbols, they's Satanic.

55
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:13,070
They had a "20/20"
on it a few years back.

56
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,505
I.D.?

57
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,607
No, sir.

58
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,611
We're gonna need
more men for a grid search,

59
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,949
set up a perimeter
wide as possible
on those 3 roads,

60
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,951
post up, take license plates

61
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,388
of anything that passes.

62
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,921
I-23.

63
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,990
Go ahead,
I-23.

64
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:37,628
We're gonna need
investigator assist
on that 419,

65
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,864
all you can spare for a canvass.

66
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,765
Roger that, detective.

67
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,901
CID is taking over.
Get anybody who's
free up here.

68
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,537
OK. Tell me
what you see.

69
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,975
Ligature marks
on her wrists, ankles,
and knees.

70
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,712
Multiple shallow
stab wounds to the abdomen.

71
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,514
Hemorrhaging around throat,

72
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:01,452
lividity at the shoulders,
thighs, and torso.

73
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,556
She'd been on her back a while

74
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,492
before he moved her.

75
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,934
HART, VOICE-OVER: That's why
they called him The Tax Man.

76
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,938
The rest of us had
these little note pads
or something.

77
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,873
He had this big ledger.

78
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:28,078
Looked funny walking
door to door with it
like the tax man,

79
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,183
which ain't bad
as far as nicknames go.

80
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,986
COHLE, VOICE-OVER: Yeah.
Of course I've always
taken a lot of notes.

81
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,990
I mean, you never know
what the thing's gonna
be, do you?

82
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,993
A little detail
somewhere way down the line

83
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:48,098
makes you say, "Ohh!"
breaks the case.

84
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,901
You know, I've seen
all the different types.

85
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,938
We all fit a certain category...

86
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,745
The bully, the charmer,
the, uh, surrogate dad,

87
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:06,784
the man possessed
by ungovernable rage,

88
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,551
the brain...

89
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:13,057
And any of those types
could be a good detective,

90
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:18,729
and any of those types could be
an incompetent shitheel.

91
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,698
Which type were you?

92
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,504
Oh, I was just
a regular type dude

93
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,573
with a big-ass dick.

94
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,778
A lot of it had to do
with how they manage authority.

95
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,913
¶

96
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:42,520
There can be a burden
in authority, in vigilance,

97
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,156
like a father's burden.

98
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,659
It was too much for some men.

99
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:53,163
A smart guy who's steady
is hard to find.

100
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,232
I was all right,
better than some,

101
00:08:55,234 --> 00:09:02,573
but I knew how
to talk to people,
and I was steady.

102
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:07,177
Rust... now his
Texas files were classified

103
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:11,882
or redacted,
and he wasn't big on talking

104
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,953
except when you wanted
him to shut up,

105
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,123
but he was smart.

106
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:25,796
Yeah. Second week
we were together,

107
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,232
I saw where he was living.

108
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,335
Kind of made me feel
for the guy.

109
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,839
¶

110
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,616
I'd offer you a seat,

111
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,718
but, uh...

112
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,656
Don't mention it.
I, uh... I can't stay.

113
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:56,760
HART, VOICE-OVER:
Yeah, I'll tell you guys...

114
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,129
And believe me,
past a certain age,

115
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:05,002
a man without a family
can be a bad thing.

116
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,768
COHLE, VOICE-OVER: We'd
encountered a meta-psychotic,

117
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,671
which I had to explain to Marty,

118
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,642
what meta-psychotic was.

119
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,778
¶

120
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,180
This is gonna happen again,

121
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:56,854
or it's happened before, both.

122
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,223
Go on.

123
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,327
It's fantasy enactment, ritual,

124
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,897
fetishization, iconography.

125
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,298
This is his vision.

126
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,836
Her body is
a paraphilic love map.

127
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,038
How's that?

128
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,906
An attachment of physical lust

129
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:20,878
to fantasies
and practices
forbidden by society.

130
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:25,416
You get that from one
of your books?

131
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,252
I did.

132
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,156
Her knees are abraded,
rug burns on her back.

133
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,391
Cold sores, gum line recession,

134
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,125
bad teeth.

135
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,295
There's decent odds
she was a prost.

136
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,732
He might not have
known her, but...

137
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:47,438
this idea goes
way back with him.

138
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,407
You... you got a chapter
in one of those books

139
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,343
on jumping to conclusions?

140
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,113
You attach an assumption
to a piece of evidence,

141
00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:01,351
you start to bend
the narrative
to support it,

142
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,288
prejudice yourself.

143
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,793
Wait and see
on the I.D.

144
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:13,731
All right.

145
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,769
This kind of thing
does not happen
in a vacuum.

146
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,873
I guarantee this
wasn't his first.

147
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,042
It's too specific.

148
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,251
Uh...

149
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:41,024
listen, uh... ahem,
this is

150
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,760
a...

151
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,830
stupid time to mention this,

152
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,465
but...

153
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,035
you've got to come to dinner.

154
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,937
Can't put Maggie off anymore,

155
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,407
so you just got to.

156
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,415
All right.

157
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:09,920
¶

158
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,525
Gordon, thanks for coming.

159
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,026
Marty.

160
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:16,994
Yeah. So...

161
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,296
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Anyway, that evening,
wasn't even sundown,

162
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,500
he decided it was a good time
to invite me over for dinner,

163
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,035
which I got a problem with,

164
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,570
all right, because I'm
thinking about Marty's wife

165
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:32,276
and this two kids
and how it's my
daughter's birthday,

166
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,278
and I know...

167
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:37,548
there's nothing I can
do about it,

168
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,519
maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but...

169
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,222
I'm gonna have a drink.

170
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,025
Let me get up!
Heh heh!

171
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,559
Daddy!

172
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,361
You're gonna meet him.
I got to get the door.

173
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,201
Hey.

174
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,337
Santa Claus is coming!

175
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,942
Aah! Jump!
Ha ha ha!

176
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,184
People out here,

177
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:20,424
it's like they don't
even know the outside
world exists.

178
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,428
Might as well be living
n the fucking moon.

179
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,132
There's all kinds
of ghettos in the world.

180
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,536
It's all one ghetto, man,

181
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,373
giant gutter in outer space.

182
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,146
Today, that scene,

183
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:48,151
that is the most
fucked up thing
I ever caught.

184
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,555
Ask you something?

185
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,093
You're a Christian, yeah?

186
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,361
No.

187
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:02,466
Well, then what do you
got the cross for
in your apartment?

188
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:07,137
That's a form of meditation.

189
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,039
How's that?

190
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:14,611
I contemplate
the moment in the garden,

191
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:20,350
the idea of allowing
your own crucifixion.

192
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,656
But you're not a Christian.

193
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,058
So what do you believe?

194
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,326
I believe that people
shouldn't talk

195
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,561
about this type of shit at work.

196
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,097
Hold on, hold on.

197
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,067
Uh... 3 months
we been together,

198
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,102
I get nothing from you.

199
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,040
Today, what we're into now,

200
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,007
do me a courtesy, OK?

201
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,509
I'm not trying to convert you.

202
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,511
Look. I consider myself
a realist, all right,

203
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,682
but in philosophical terms,
I'm what's called a pessimist.

204
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,584
Um, OK.
What's that mean?

205
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,321
Means I'm bad at parties.

206
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,256
Heh. Let me tell you.

207
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:03,493
You ain't great outside
of parties either.

208
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,134
I think human consciousness

209
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,704
was a tragic misstep
in evolution.

210
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,605
We became too self-aware.

211
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,176
Nature created an aspect
of nature separate
from itself.

212
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:24,014
We are creatures
that should not exist
by natural law.

213
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,683
Huh. That sounds
god-fucking-awful, Rust.

214
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,354
We are things that labor
under the illusion

215
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,588
of having a self,

216
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,726
this accretion
of sensory experience
and feeling,

217
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:41,631
programmed with total
assurance that we are
each somebody

218
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,367
when, in fact,
everybody's nobody.

219
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,403
I wouldn't go around
spouting that shit,
I was you.

220
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,406
People around here
don't think that way.

221
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,307
I don't think that way.

222
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,176
I think the honorable
thing for species to do

223
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,680
is deny our programming,

224
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,515
stop reproducing,

225
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,318
walk hand in hand
into extinction,

226
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,021
one last midnight,
brothers and sisters

227
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,724
opting out of a raw deal.

228
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,696
So what's the point
of getting out bed
in the morning?

229
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,197
I tell myself I bear witness,

230
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,236
but the real answer
is that it's obviously
my programming,

231
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,506
and I lack the constitution
for suicide.

232
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,676
My luck, I picked today
to get to know you.

233
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,147
3 months, I don't hear
a word from you, and...

234
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:30,814
You asked.
Yeah.

235
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:35,585
And now I'm begging you
to shut the fuck up.

236
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,196
I get a bad taste
in my mouth out here.

237
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,466
Aluminum, ash,

238
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,803
like you can smell
the psychosphere.

239
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:53,570
I got an idea.

240
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:58,075
Let's make the car
a place of silent
reflection

241
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,212
from now on, OK?

242
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:14,224
What should I bring for dinner?

243
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:22,232
A bottle of wine
would be nice,
I guess.

244
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,534
I don't drink.

245
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,237
Well, no, of course not, Rust.

246
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,638
Listen. When you're
at my house,

247
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,173
I want you to chill
the fuck out.

248
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,844
Don't even mention
any of that bullshit
you just said to me.

249
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,878
Of course not, Marty.

250
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,215
I'm not some kind
of maniac, all right?

251
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,884
I mean, for fuck's sake.

252
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:45,388
¶

253
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,835
What'd you hear?

254
00:18:58,837 --> 00:18:59,836
Ask Cohle.

255
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,538
You mean The Tax Man?

256
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,173
You know, he's IA.

257
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:08,645
This is State CID Homicide...
Detective Geraci.

258
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,247
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,782
I'm calling to ask
about that night...

260
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,153
I mean, you never heard
any shit like this before.

261
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,255
She had...

262
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,924
antlers. Um...

263
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,625
Fuck.

264
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,461
This is... this is
the real thing,

265
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,598
some "Halloween" shit.

266
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:35,272
Well, we're
gonna have to do
a press conference.

267
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,575
What about him?
What do you think?

268
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:46,483
Smart...

269
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,717
aloof.

270
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,387
Doesn't care
about making friends,

271
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,422
but he's already
running with it.

272
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:58,495
He's got a real...
Real mind for it. Yeah.

273
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,464
So you'd keep him on then?

274
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,438
Both of us, yeah.
I would.

275
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,541
All right.
You're still lead.

276
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,643
The incident room is yours,

277
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,913
and, uh, you do
the briefing tomorrow.

278
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,716
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

279
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,590
Hello, sir.

280
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:31,761
Fuck that prick.

281
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,396
All I'm saying
is it doesn't make any sense

282
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,465
for her to be dumped
in a cane field. Hello?

283
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,767
Apparently
she had all kinds
of weird markings...

284
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,502
Yeah. No. I couldn't
hear you there.

285
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,604
Antlers and shit.

286
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,639
That's my point.
They wanted you to see her.

287
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,007
Yeah. You don't mark up
a body like that...

288
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,644
She had antlers?
What does that mean?

289
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,413
It was a crown.

290
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,817
We'll do the briefing
tomorrow, guys, early.

291
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,952
My guy does the AP Wire
asked about Satanism.

292
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,823
It got Speece here.
You're gonna have his
nose up your ass.

293
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,559
Major was saying
something about
a press conference.

294
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,829
Well, guess I can
count my blessings,
fellas.

295
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,831
Thanks for that.

296
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:23,046
Hey. You mind
if I skate? Ahem.

297
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,684
I got some names
from Vice, prost farms.

298
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,887
Check around on our DB.

299
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,456
You want me to go with you?

300
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,559
Nah. Just something to do.

301
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:41,498
Yeah. You go ahead.
I'll take care
of the paperwork.

302
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,367
¶

303
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,670
COHLE, VOICE-OVER: Like I said,
I'm feeling a lot of stuff

304
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,705
hit me at this time...

305
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:53,076
My daughter's birthday,
this dead woman,

306
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,979
and, um...

307
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,848
figured I'd work
the case, you know,

308
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,687
till DiCillo called
or we got an I.D.

309
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:07,624
State Vice gave me
some addresses to follow up on.

310
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:12,395
So far, nobody'd...
Nobody'd talked to me.

311
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:40,623
¶

312
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,465
Evening, ladies.

313
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:53,403
I was hoping
to ask y'all
a few questions.

314
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,971
Oh, come on, man.

315
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,005
I'll get the next round.

316
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,708
Heh. You making
trouble for us then?

317
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,678
No. I'm just
looking to get
some information

318
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,712
on a woman.

319
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,147
Might be you know her.

320
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,615
Who's that?

321
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,684
Hold on.

322
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:13,156
Mmm. We'll take two
large Long Island
ice teas, please.

323
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,459
Ma'am.

324
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:56,966
I'm Rust, by the way.

325
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,570
I'm Anette, she's Lucy.

326
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,139
Either one of you know a woman

327
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,876
about your age,
works the same place,

328
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:11,181
about 5'5", blond like you?

329
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,783
What kind of tits she have?

330
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,553
¶

331
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,656
Medium, a little larger
than yours,

332
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,091
proportion to the body natural.

333
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:22,725
Hmm.

334
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,894
Gee. I don't know.
We see a lot
of girls

335
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,697
like that around.

336
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,765
Any girls like that

337
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,969
you haven't seen
around lately,
missing like?

338
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,005
People come and go.

339
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,509
What do you want them for?

340
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,680
I wouldn't bust
somebody for hooking

341
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,748
or drugs.

342
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,520
I'm murder police.

343
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,490
Somebody got killed.

344
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,824
There's a girl named Liza,

345
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,725
another called Destiny,

346
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,229
but I seen Destiny
yesterday at McDonald's.

347
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,797
What about Liza?

348
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,499
She's here.

349
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,910
Anette, go get
a couple more drinks

350
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,913
from the bar, will you, please?

351
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,184
All right.

352
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:29,626
You get pills pretty easy?

353
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,999
Relax. I want some.

354
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:38,167
Speed?

355
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,905
No. Quaaludes,
anything-barbital.

356
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,106
Uppers are easier to get,

357
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,974
and they last longer, too.

358
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:48,011
Yeah, but it's not like that.

359
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,647
What's it like?

360
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,750
I don't sleep.

361
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,785
Hey.

362
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,752
Oh.

363
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,087
Hey, Lone Ranger.

364
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:36,159
Hey. Ugh. Dreaming.

365
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,761
Why you out here, huh?

366
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,864
Why didn't you come to bed?

367
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,700
Um...

368
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:53,042
Caught a... bad one
yesterday.

369
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,644
Just couldn't sleep.

370
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,013
You got that woman from Erath?

371
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,915
Yeah.
Yeah?

372
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,984
Saw it on the news.

373
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,756
Girls will be up soon.

374
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:11,060
Missed you the last couple days.

375
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:15,264
Oh, shit.
I got to shower.

376
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,066
Got a debriefing today

377
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,703
and maybe
a press conference later.

378
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:26,743
And if Speece calls,

379
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,678
tell him I'm debriefing
the squad all morning.

380
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,780
Well, Marty said
he was doing that.

381
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,814
He is.

382
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,849
Hey, beautiful.

383
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,051
Ha ha ha!
Morning, baby.

384
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,853
Marty, how you want
your coffee, doll?

385
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,988
Strong and black
just like you.

386
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,125
Prints came back.
Dora Kelly Lange.

387
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:46,663
Priors for shoplifting,
possession, and...

388
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,864
solicitation.

389
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,098
Address outside
of St. Martinville.

390
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,035
Landlord says she
hasn't lived there
in almost a year.

391
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,102
She's got an ex Charlie Lange,

392
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,738
who's doing 8
in Avoyelles
for bad checks,

393
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,740
mom's outside of Breaux Bridge,

394
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,876
DMV license expired,

395
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,211
and DiCillo called.

396
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:06,349
DiCILLO, VOICE-OVER:
She was washed clean,

397
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,717
not a print on her.

398
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:11,354
We got ligature marks
on the wrists and ankles,

399
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,122
was bound
by a half-inch rope,

400
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,957
maybe 10, 20 hours.

401
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,161
Evidence of vaginal intercourse.

402
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,228
Bound upright,

403
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,698
hadn't eaten
in a day,
maybe more.

404
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,703
Toxicology hit
for lysergic acid
and methamphetamine.

405
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,439
Crystal and LSD.

406
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,441
How much LSD?

407
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,742
Hard to say.

408
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,411
Got to wait for a mass spec.

409
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:39,782
So she was drugged, bound,

410
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,251
tortured with a knife,

411
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:47,256
strangled, posed out there.

412
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,725
Yeah.

413
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,394
¶

414
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,929
What about this stuff?

415
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,065
Well, the crown,
for lack
of a better word,

416
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:01,204
rose thorns,
early cane,
switchgrass

417
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,006
wrapped around a bent branch,

418
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,477
and the horns are deer antlers.

419
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,879
Again, no prints on anything.

420
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,782
Symbols are painted
with acrylic
basic blue

421
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,350
using a thick glove finger.

422
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,452
Ideas what any of this means?

423
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,221
I don't know.

424
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,891
And it's all primitive.
It's like cave paintings.

425
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,428
Maybe you ought to talk
to an anthropologist.

426
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,878
Lot of trouble this guy went to.

427
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,313
Seems real personal.

428
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,849
I don't think so.

429
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,952
Was iconic, planned...

430
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,822
and in some ways,
it was impersonal.

431
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:56,092
Think of the blindfold.

432
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:01,397
This place is
like somebody's memory

433
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,066
of the town,
and the memory's fading.

434
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:07,970
It's like there was never
anything here but jungle.

435
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:12,074
Stop saying shit like that.
It's unprofessional.

436
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,844
Oh, is that what
I'm going for here?

437
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,947
I just want you to stop
saying odd shit,

438
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,549
like you smell a psycho's fear

439
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,552
or you're in someone's
faded memory of a town.

440
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,286
Just stop.

441
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,288
Well, given how long
it's taken for me

442
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,323
to reconcile my nature,
I can't figure

443
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,959
I'd forgo it
on your account, Marty.

444
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,407
Ahem.

445
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,312
You get any sleep last night?

446
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,314
I don't sleep.

447
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,016
I just dream.

448
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:56,419
Occult.

449
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,922
Now, I don't know if this shit
is anything but crazy,

450
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,357
but Speece
and the Superintendent,

451
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,595
they're paying attention,
the newspapers are making hay,

452
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,864
church groups.

453
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,932
Detective?

454
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,167
Ahem.

455
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,102
All right, here's
what we got so far.

456
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,372
Deceased's name is
Dora Kelly Lange, 28...

457
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,041
MAN, VOICE-OVER:
You stay busy now, the business?

458
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,211
HART, VOICE-OVER: Well, yeah,
I got the security firm,

459
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,547
P.I. stuff. Routine.

460
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,216
Lotta guys leave the job,

461
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,952
cemetery within 10.

462
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,288
No family, idle hands.

463
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,959
Some advice: you make it out,
you stay busy.

464
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,494
Hit the corners.

465
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,130
Ask about anybody
she was seeing:

466
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,333
regular customers, meth dealers,

467
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,169
and rough johns, anything.

468
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,273
Any questions?

469
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:19,235
You believe in ghosts?

470
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:25,608
What'd we say about
silent reflection?

471
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:36,719
You happen to hear
anything out of the ordinary

472
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:40,389
between 10
and 1 a.m., out back?

473
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,692
No, no, but, uh,

474
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,728
sometimes they, uh,
dove-hunt out there.

475
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,065
They found a woman?

476
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:51,734
Is it the Fontenot girl?

477
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,468
Who?

478
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,338
And why would you
ask that?
Don't know.

479
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,074
Went missing
around here years back.

480
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,176
Last time something happened.

481
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,211
Just thought maybe it's her.

482
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,280
How old was she, this girl?

483
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,183
I don't know.
Little.

484
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:10,519
You know where the family lives?

485
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:24,600
Had a place couple streets down.

486
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:27,503
They moved out, though.

487
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,240
Do you know the Fontenot
girl, one went missing?

488
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,641
Her?

489
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,211
Her family come to our service

490
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,680
once or twice,
5 or 6 years back.

491
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,649
Is that the girl?
Oh, Lord.

492
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,552
No, sir,
it's not.

493
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,388
Excuse me.

494
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,057
I want to ask y'all
something. Y'all think

495
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,227
maybe this have
something to do
with those cats?

496
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,261
What cats?

497
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,330
Two of 'em... one,
and a couple

498
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,798
of weeks later, another.

499
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,033
Somebody cut 'em up,

500
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,335
turned their insides out,
then nailed them

501
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,569
to the front door, twice.

502
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,705
Now, I called
and told the police,

503
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,308
but we're predominantly
African American
congregation.

504
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,045
I asked for it
to be investigated.

505
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,049
We're not those type
of police, sir.

506
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,485
Well, who is, then?

507
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:23,092
Can I ask you something?

508
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:28,064
Any of these look
familiar to you?

509
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,498
Seen them anywheres?
No.

510
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,667
No, they look like
something that might be

511
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,070
carved into a tree or something.

512
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,571
Mm-hmm.
How about these?

513
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,641
Now, that look like
something my old auntie

514
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,310
taught us how to make
when I was a tyke.

515
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,212
What are they?

516
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,347
Some folks call them bird traps.

517
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,650
Old Auntie told us that
they were devil nets.

518
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:52,188
You put them around
the bed, catch the devil
before he get too close.

519
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,756
That's interesting.

520
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,158
Hmm.
She was a wonderful woman.

521
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,328
Loved her some Jesus,
but had a bit

522
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,264
of that Santeria
in her, you know?

523
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,333
I always just thought
it was something

524
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,168
for children to do,
keep 'em busy,

525
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,439
tell them stories why
they're tying sticks together.

526
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,709
Then
that's all we got
on the Fontenot girl.

527
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,644
There was
nothing in there.

528
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:18,481
Says, "Possible
report made in error."

529
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,582
Now, that was 5 years ago.

530
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,484
Ted Childress was
sheriff back then.

531
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,385
He's set up in Gulf Shores
now, I think.

532
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,455
Ten-year-old girl
goes missing and that
doesn't go state-wide?

533
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,424
Now, hold on now.
My understanding,

534
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,559
the little girl went off
with her birth daddy.

535
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,795
Now, did you check
her mom's record?

536
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,697
Possession, solicitation.

537
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,500
I believe Ted knew the family,
and the feeling was

538
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,568
the little girl was
better off with her daddy.

539
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,538
Mom seemed to agree;
she filed a complaint,

540
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,640
then never bothered
with it again,

541
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,308
took off with her boyfriend.

542
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,878
R&I said you had
a complaint these parts

543
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,779
around December...
Little girl

544
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,615
getting chased
through the woods.

545
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,919
Oh, yeah, I pulled
that one for you, too.

546
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:05,461
What the hell is this?

547
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,397
Little girl said
a green-eared spaghetti monster

548
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,599
chased her through some woods.

549
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,435
Now, we had her work
with a sketch artist,

550
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,337
and she told us
that looked exactly right.

551
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,909
Now, you want to call an APB
on that, you go right ahead.

552
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,510
Listen, boys.

553
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,612
I'm gonna have to call
a timeout, make a beer run.

554
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:28,284
Well,
why don't you hold off
on that for a while?

555
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:32,221
All right, well,
why don't you get it, then?

556
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,423
We really don't want to do that.

557
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,860
Well, is this supposed
to be admissible? Huh?

558
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,764
If you want to pick
my brain, work a room,

559
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:46,302
you buy me a cheeseburger
and a Coke, don't you?

560
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:49,338
I'll take a sixer
of Old Milwaukee

561
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,806
or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

562
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,409
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

563
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,979
'Cause it's Thursday
and it's past noon.

564
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,448
Thursday is one of my days off.

565
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,219
On my off days, I start
drinking at noon.

566
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:07,723
You don't get to interrupt that.

567
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:23,639
Ahem.

568
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:26,575
I'd appreciate a little
hustle up on that.

569
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,312
QUESADA, VOICE-OVER: Yesterday,

570
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,947
at approximately 6 a.m.,

571
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,584
civilians came across
the body of a female

572
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,854
in a sugar cane field
outside of Erath.

573
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,824
Now, this person,
we believe, was murdered,

574
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,493
and we are not yet in
a position to

575
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,563
release the identity
of the victim or to offer

576
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,366
details of the crime.

577
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,668
Our investigators

578
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,037
have several leads,
and hopefully we'll...

579
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,641
We'll have a suspect
for you in custody soon.

580
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,343
QUESADA, VOICE-OVER:
Now, this perpetrator

581
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,379
will be apprehended,
and he will know

582
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,849
swift Louisiana justice.

583
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,751
- Charlie?
Mm-hmm?

584
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,720
Let's talk about
your ex, Dora Lange.

585
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,856
You want to talk Dori?

586
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,292
What's she said I've done now?

587
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,494
Nothing. We're just
curious if you knew

588
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,764
what she's been up to and
maybe where she's living.

589
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:22,865
Nope.

590
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,933
Got her divorce papers
pushed through

591
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,069
after I been here about a year.

592
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,872
I don't blame the bitch.

593
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,640
She got a habit?

594
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,343
Yeah, a few.

595
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,912
Weed, meth, juice.

596
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,614
Name it.

597
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,316
Charlie,

598
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:40,983
how'd y'all meet?

599
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,320
Growed up together,
dropped out the same time.

600
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,954
Hitched up way too quick.

601
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:50,659
You know how it is... you want
a wife, but only half the time.

602
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,327
Hmm.

603
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,729
Why are you saying
you hadn't heard from her?

604
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,066
She called up here
for you not too long ago.

605
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,468
She couldn't help me
anyway, man.

606
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,969
She sounded all fucked up.

607
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,871
You see, that's exactly
the kind of thing

608
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,674
that we do want to know
about, though, Charlie.

609
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,608
Oh. All right.

610
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,411
Uh... I needed
some scratch for my store,

611
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,748
and Dori owes me money,
she ain't got no fuckin' phone,

612
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,351
so got a number to
her friend Carla, got her

613
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,387
to call me back, and she ain't
made no fuckin' sense.

614
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,091
Ahem.
Carla's full name
and phone number.

615
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,394
What you mean,
she didn't make sense?

616
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,931
Like she could duck-hunt
with a rake.

617
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,733
High, yeah.

618
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,902
Talkin' 'bout
she's gonna become a nun.

619
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,940
Why a nun?
I don't know, man.
She was high.

620
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,541
Fucked up, uh,

621
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,545
talkin' 'bout...
she met a king.

622
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,880
Shit.

623
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,849
Anyway...

624
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,518
I don't need no
snitch jacket up in here.

625
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,020
Give me a break.

626
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,556
This is Avoyelles.

627
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,925
It's a goddamn day camp.

628
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,495
Spend some time in Angola.

629
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:03,499
Surprised you even got
Aryan Nation here.

630
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,636
What'd Dori do?

631
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:12,941
Dori's dead.

632
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,878
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Thank you, boys.

633
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,548
We almost had a moment there.

634
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:30,893
Mmm.

635
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:35,164
So you want to talk the whole
case through or just the end?

636
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,865
No, whole story

637
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:37,966
from your end, you don't mind.

638
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,869
You know, like he said,
files got ruined.

639
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,971
Hurricane Rita.

640
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:49,011
What he didn't say is that this
is about something else.

641
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:54,116
Something new. That one
in Lake Charles, maybe?

642
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,651
Now, why you say that?

643
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,654
Get the details
out of the paper.

644
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,788
Yeah, we did.

645
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,925
You know anything about that,
about Lake Charles?

646
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,661
Well, let me see

647
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,163
what you got, jog my memory.

648
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,165
Well, let's hear
your story first,

649
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:14,236
see how it fit with what we got.

650
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:17,573
Well, your dime, boss.

651
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,008
Talking Cohle,
what about that dinner

652
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,878
you mentioned, he turn up drunk?

653
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,980
Oh. Yeah.

654
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,982
Well, ahem.

655
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,485
That dinner,
that was a bit later.

656
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,221
It was kind of funny.

657
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,989
The flowers, you know?

658
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,593
Like, he read somewhere that
if you get invited to dinner,

659
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,095
you're supposed
to bring flowers?

660
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,164
HART, VOICE-OVER:
The hell?

661
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,000
You can barely stand up.

662
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,568
What is it?

663
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,071
You don't drink
with me or the boys,

664
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,973
and you got to get a load on

665
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,774
before you visit my family?

666
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,577
No, Marty, it's not like that.

667
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,213
And I didn't mean to,

668
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,849
all right?

669
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,752
And I don't drink
'cause I've had trouble

670
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:07,856
with it before;
I didn't mean to.

671
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:11,793
I was checking on a CI.

672
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:15,864
I ended up hanging around a bar.

673
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,066
I was sitting there.

674
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:22,271
I couldn't think
of a good reason not to.

675
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:25,741
Usually I can.

676
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,048
Don't worry about it.

677
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,683
Have some more coffee

678
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:38,587
and just try to make 10
minutes of conversation.

679
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,821
You got it.

680
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,824
I'll call Chris or somebody,

681
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,661
get you out of here.

682
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:50,065
Marty.

683
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:54,570
I'm sorry, man.

684
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,572
Forget it.

685
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,576
We'll try this some other time.

686
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:14,156
Well, uh, Rust, it is
so nice to finally meet you.

687
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,991
Sorry it took so long.

688
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:19,728
Well, I tried to tell her
you aren't big on socializing.

689
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,063
I said that your life's

690
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,831
in this man's hands, right?

691
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,133
Of course
you should meet
the family.

692
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:29,671
Well, not quite
as dramatic as that, hon.

693
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,174
I've never fired my gun.

694
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,610
Have you fired your gun?

695
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,178
Audrey.

696
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:40,983
Yes.

697
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,085
You shot people?

698
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,353
Macie.

699
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,621
Ahem.

700
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,023
Dad's never shot anybody.

701
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,026
Well, that's good.

702
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,228
You don't want to shoot people.

703
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,631
But you have.

704
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:59,101
Marty says you're from Texas.

705
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,303
Yes, south Texas.

706
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,406
I grew up in Alaska.

707
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,909
Just been working here
the last 10, 12 years.

708
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,911
What kind of work?

709
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,948
Narcotics, mostly.

710
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,016
Um...

711
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,719
was on the Robbery Squad
in Houston until '89.

712
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:22,024
Ahem. Oh. Be right back.

713
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,793
Y'all keep eating.

714
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:31,800
Do you like your job?

715
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:36,171
Not exactly,

716
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,373
but it's worthwhile.

717
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,308
I'm good at it.

718
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,111
You're not married?

719
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:45,781
Once.

720
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,949
Uh, not anymore.
Mm-hmm.

721
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,987
Did you do this
while you were married?

722
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,689
Hey, Chris.

723
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,391
Hey, thanks for the page.

724
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,928
Yeah, well, he'll appreciate it.

725
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,230
Well... all right,

726
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,233
then I appreciate it.

727
00:45:11,307 --> 00:45:13,875
Children?

728
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,144
One.

729
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,080
She passed.

730
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:22,818
Marriage didn't last
long after that.

731
00:45:24,253 --> 00:45:26,822
Sorry.

732
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,292
Ahem. Chris Demma's
on the phone for you.

733
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,729
Something about a CI or...

734
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,164
Back there to the left.

735
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,900
Excuse me.
Of course.

736
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:45,173
Ahem.

737
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,780
What was that?

738
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,149
What were y'all talking about?

739
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,517
Your job.

740
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,287
What do you know
about him, Marty?

741
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,859
Um, not a lot.

742
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,128
He could be a good detective.

743
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,298
He's running on this
thing, but, uh...

744
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,900
uppity.

745
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,436
What?

746
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:19,541
Jeez. Have you ever
asked him about himself?

747
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:21,910
Baby, trust me.

748
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:26,148
You do not want to pick
this man's brain.

749
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:31,086
What was that?

750
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:35,557
Oh, some details
on the CI. Ahem.

751
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:40,829
Thank you for dinner, Maggie.

752
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,431
This looks great.
My pleasure.

753
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,500
I don't like
that broccoli.

754
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,102
Mind your manners.

755
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:51,072
So you, uh, need to go or what?

756
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,343
No, it's nothing can't
wait till tomorrow.

757
00:46:55,578 --> 00:47:01,049
Rust, uh, what
you were saying before?

758
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:06,188
Oh, we can find something
nicer to talk about.

759
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,091
Marty, I saw
your table in there.

760
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,993
You fly-fish?

761
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,462
Little bit.

762
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:19,367
MAN, VOICE-OVER: So you
and Cohle went bad in '02, huh?

763
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,169
Heard about that.

764
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,506
Yeah, well... what happened
between me and him

765
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:29,544
don't have nothing to do
with Dora Lange.

766
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:33,448
I worked with Rust Cohle
for 7 years.

767
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,317
People change.

768
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,620
Relationships change.

769
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,456
You stay in touch?

770
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,291
No.

771
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:47,963
No, I haven't talked
to Rust in...

772
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,432
10 years.

773
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,034
Yeah.

774
00:47:54,604 --> 00:47:57,172
Look, however we...

775
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,541
he was a good detective,

776
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,879
and it don't matter how
he ended it. I mean...

777
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,216
I can say that
because it's the truth,

778
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,952
and I don't hold grudges.

779
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,555
I believe that's the shit

780
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,125
that leads to cancer.

781
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,530
But why am I talking
about dinner?

782
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:28,536
Y'all want to walk through
the Lange case, fine.

783
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:33,308
This other stuff...
Well, what's going on?

784
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,211
Sorry. We just heard
some stories.

785
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,480
Well, personally,
I heard he was

786
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,415
an ace case man, right?

787
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,519
I'd like to understand
his process.

788
00:48:46,622 --> 00:48:48,957
"His process."

789
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,358
Sure.

790
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:53,528
The other landlord
says she trashed the place,

791
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,463
so she lost her deposit.

792
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,232
And the neighbors check out.

793
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,701
Those that remember her
said that she, uh,

794
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,537
used to come in early
in the morning,

795
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,007
if she came home at all.

796
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:11,479
You guys canvass the bars
pretty good today?

797
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,317
You know,
up your ass, Cohle.

798
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:18,086
Why don't you do your
own fuckin' leg work,

799
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,588
you rat fuck?

800
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:26,461
Say it again, rummy.

801
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,430
Hey.

802
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:34,069
You know what, man?

803
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,237
Fuck you,

804
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,640
Tax Man.

805
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:43,378
What the fuck?

806
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,114
Ahem.
Back to point.

807
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,083
Got 3 hits on working girls.

808
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,318
No one close to her, naturally.

809
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,455
A few names recognized
her as occasional.

810
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,423
Like she tricked
now and then, show up

811
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,526
at a couple of truck stops
when she needed cash.

812
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,562
You got some names.
Which ones?

813
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,265
I heard from my AP guy,
Ray Fontenot.

814
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:07,135
Said her uncle's
Danny Fontenot...

815
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,169
The pitcher, LSU.

816
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,106
Yeah, I watched him
play. Great player.

817
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,175
Well,
he lives close by.
Ahem.

818
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,410
Well, thanks, guys.

819
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,580
What about you two?
Did you get anything today?

820
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,449
Not much, sir.
Well...

821
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:24,285
You might know
the Reverend Tuttle.

822
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,354
He runs our state-wide
charity drive.

823
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,490
This is Detective Hart,
Detective Cohle.

824
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,225
Pleasure to meet you, officers.

825
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,326
Nice to meet you.
Cohle.

826
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,329
Your case has a lot
of people taking care,

827
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,432
doors locking where
they used to not.

828
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,601
Eddie's been speaking
to me about it.

829
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,602
Concerned, very concerned.

830
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,471
We've been discussing
the viability of a task force

831
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:46,608
to investigate crimes with
an anti-Christian connotation.

832
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,278
You what?
Really?

833
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,282
Yes.

834
00:50:55,785 --> 00:50:59,421
I don't mean to tell men
of your positions,

835
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:04,292
but there is a war
happening behind things.

836
00:51:05,194 --> 00:51:07,429
Thank you for doing your part.

837
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,432
Thank you, sir.
Yeah.

838
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,600
Well...

839
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,670
Eddie's going to be
very, very pleased

840
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:19,841
to have such good men
working on this.

841
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,279
Are you kidding me?

842
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,748
Un-fuckin'-believable.

843
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,084
"Anti-Christian."

844
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,854
Fucks. And who
the fuck's Eddie?

845
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,522
Huh?

846
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:36,357
Is he serious?

847
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,293
Well, he doesn't
have a television.

848
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,528
Who's Eddie?
And he's from Texas.

849
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,597
He's the fuckin' governor...

850
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,566
Edwin Tuttle.
Ah.

851
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,601
They're first cousins.

852
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,502
Well, that makes sense.

853
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,637
Yeah, that's the
sound of The Big Machine,

854
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,807
Cohle, that's gearing up
to pound your ass.

855
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:53,541
Heh!

856
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,643
The sound of a gaggle of hens.

857
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,579
Yeah, you better
watch your mouth

858
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,782
or they're gonna
peck your eyes out.

859
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:02,851
Hi.
Hi.

860
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,120
I am looking for Detective Hart.

861
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,122
I have a stack of
depositions for him.

862
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,656
Judge Sutpen told me to
make sure and give them

863
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,126
to Detective Hart
and no one else, so...

864
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,827
Oh.
Is that the, um...

865
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:13,862
The, uh, depositions.

866
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,597
I thought I should
walk you through them.

867
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,534
Oh. Great, great.
Let's just find
a place to talk.

868
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,602
Thanks, Cathleen.

869
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:22,537
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

870
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,906
Right through here.

871
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:28,810
¶

872
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:53,768
MAN, VOICE-OVER:
Your victim was
Dora Lange,

873
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,172
but you all checked
on Marie Fontenot.

874
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:57,939
Why?

875
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,175
Missing girl, 5 years gone,

876
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,342
report made in error?

877
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:05,313
She had an uncle
who lived nearby...

878
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,682
and call it intuition.

879
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,487
Sometimes he's
more responsive.

880
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,590
I'd like to help.

881
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,598
Mr. Fontenot.

882
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,203
Uh, ahem.

883
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,406
We met,

884
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,708
oh, maybe 7 years ago.

885
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,477
I was visiting
Skip Hays.

886
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:38,513
I'd played for USL.

887
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:42,684
Thing of beauty, sir,
watching you throw.

888
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:43,618
Hmm.

889
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,588
Danny, this man's a detective

890
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,323
with the police.

891
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:54,862
Uh...

892
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:58,233
I'm actually...
Ahem. Sorry, uh,

893
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:02,337
we wanted to ask you
about your niece, Marie.

894
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:02,704
Hmm.

895
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:06,841
"How much could You put on
one family?" I ask the Lord.

896
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,444
We try to get by.

897
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,614
Did you know Marie's
birth father?

898
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,581
Len?

899
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,883
Len Stroghes was her daddy.

900
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:16,851
Hmm.

901
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,386
It's OK.

902
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,555
We're asking
because, uh,

903
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,258
we had heard that Marie
ran off with him

904
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,928
and that... she wasn't
really missing.

905
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,432
That's what Debbie said.

906
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:35,603
Oh. Well, uh...
anybody heard from Len?

907
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:40,275
Anybody maybe knows
where he's at?

908
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:45,546
Uh, sorry.
The last thing.

909
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,782
Do you know where Debbie is now?

910
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,651
She married
another man.

911
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:53,354
Not the one she's
with when Marie...

912
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:57,425
She was in Vegas, last we heard.

913
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:21,983
Marie must have loved it here.

914
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,917
Yeah.

915
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,786
All this for her?

916
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,788
Danny loved her so much.

917
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,723
We weren't her legal guardians,

918
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,592
but she played here
all the time,

919
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,027
more than her Mama's.

920
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,962
I can see why.

921
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:39,033
What is it Dan has,
if you don't mind my asking?

922
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:43,638
All they ever told us was
"a cerebral event."

923
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,874
Series of strokes, like.

924
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,784
Marty?

925
00:55:57,453 --> 00:56:00,755
Excuse me for one sec.

926
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:14,802
Inside on the floor
on the right.

927
00:56:32,654 --> 00:56:34,422
I don't know
what that is.

928
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:38,793
I haven't looked in there
since the police first came.

929
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:49,537
COHLE, VOICE-OVER: Bet you want
to hear the hero shot, huh?

930
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:53,174
That place we carried
the kids out?

931
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,943
Eventually, sure.

932
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,615
So what did she look like...

933
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:04,051
that one in Lake Charles?

934
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:30,044
Can you, uh, tell us

935
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,847
anything about that,
Mr. Cohle?

936
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:38,853
That looks a lot
like the one from '95,

937
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,589
but... well,
you knew that already.

938
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:46,194
Yeah, there are
specifics consistent
to the '95 case,

939
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,730
details that weren't
public knowledge.

940
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,733
You were off the grid
for 8 years, right?

941
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,903
Show back up here 2010.
My question is...

942
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:59,907
How could it
be him...

943
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:04,579
if we already caught him in '95?

944
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:08,983
How indeed, Detectives?

945
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:13,588
I figured you'd be
the one to know.

946
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:25,066
Then start asking
the right fuckin' questions.

947
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:29,003
