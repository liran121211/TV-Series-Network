00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:11,142
¶

2
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,332
¶

3
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:18,903
You were as blind to Him
as your footprints in the ashes,

4
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,339
but He saw you.

5
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:26,377
He saw you
in those dark corners.

6
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,545
He heard you...

7
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:31,182
Oh, my brothers,
He heard those thoughts.

8
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,484
Yes!
Preach it.

9
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,420
Amen!
Yes!

10
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,288
Yes.
Glory.

11
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,425
You are stranger to yourself,
and yet He knows you...

12
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,627
Amen.
Yes. He does, sir.

13
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,630
And when your heart hardened,
made you liken to the stone,

14
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,566
and broke you from His body,

15
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,503
which is the stars
and the wind between the stars,

16
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,905
He knew you.

17
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,540
Yeah!
Yeah!

18
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,542
He knew you.
That is forever.

19
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,610
Amen, brother!

20
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,914
This world is a veil...

21
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,216
Amen.
Yeah.

22
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,785
Tell them.
Hallelujah.

23
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,622
And the face you wear
is not your own.

24
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,859
Parish FD said
the church burned down

25
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,396
4 months earlier, no prints,

26
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,666
put out an APB
on Friends of Christ.

27
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:26,938
Week later, we were in Franklin,

28
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,808
um, Revival Ministry,

29
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,777
old-time religion.

30
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,746
You can imagine what
Mr. Charisma thought of that.

31
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,848
It is merely the limitation
of your senses.

32
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,750
What do you
think the average IQ

33
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,386
of this group is, huh?

34
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,557
Can you see Texas up there
on your high horse?

35
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,493
What do you know
about these people?

36
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,363
Just observation and deduction.

37
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,533
I see a propensity
for obesity, poverty,

38
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,602
a yen for fairy tales,

39
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,704
folks putting what
few bucks they do have

40
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,372
into little, wicker baskets

41
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,540
being passed around.

42
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,908
I think it's safe to say
that nobody here

43
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,811
is gonna be splitting
the atom, Marty.

44
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,481
You see that?
You're fucking attitude.

45
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,517
Not everybody want to sit
alone in a empty room

46
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,820
beating off to murder manuals.

47
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:20,591
Some folks enjoy
community, the common good.

48
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,260
Yeah? Well,
if the common good

49
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,661
has got to make up fairy tales,

50
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,297
then it's not good for anybody.

51
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,533
Your sorrows
pin you to this place.

52
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,303
They divide you
from what your heart knows,

53
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,938
and there are a lot
of good hearts out there.

54
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,805
I'm looking out there.

55
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,308
I'm seeing a lot
of good hearts out there.

56
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
I see a lot of joy out there.

57
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,379
I mean,
can you imagine

58
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,447
if people didn't believe,

59
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,716
what things they'd get up to?

60
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,885
Exact same thing they do now,

61
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,388
just out in the open.

62
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,957
Bull... shit.

63
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,426
It'd be a fucking
freak show of murder

64
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,894
and debauchery, and you know it.

65
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,829
If the only thing
keeping a person decent

66
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,499
is the expectation
of divine reward,

67
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,733
then, brother, that person

68
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,569
is a piece of shit,
and I'd like to get

69
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,605
as many of them out in the open

70
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,706
as possible.

71
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,575
I guess your judgment
is infallible

72
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,678
piece-of-shitwise.

73
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,817
Do you think that notebook
is a stone tablet?

74
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,855
What's it say about life, hmm,

75
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:30,027
you got to get together,
tell yourself stories

76
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,531
that violate every law
of the universe

77
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,833
just to get through
the goddamn day?

78
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,801
No.

79
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,537
What's that say about
your reality, Marty?

80
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,074
When you get
to talking like this,

81
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,476
you sound panicked.

82
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,511
You figure
it's all a scam, huh,

83
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,347
all them folks?

84
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,414
Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,749
They just wrong?

86
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,683
Oh, yeah.

87
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,087
Been that way since one
monkey looked at the sun

88
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,088
and told the other monkey,

89
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,959
"He said for you to give
me your fucking share."

90
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:06,664
People so goddamn frail
they'd rather

91
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,966
put a coin in a wishing well

92
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,468
than buy dinner.

93
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,706
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,
Your arms open and close.

94
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,742
The echoes of my life
could never contain

95
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,009
a single truth about You.

96
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,578
You move the feather in the ash.

97
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,980
You touch the leaf
with its flame.

98
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:23,748
Amen!
Amen.

99
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,384
Transference of
fear and self-loathing

100
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,753
to an authoritarian vessel.

101
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,488
It's catharsis.

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,023
He absorbs their dread
with his narrative.

103
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,925
Because of this, he's effective

104
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,528
in proportion to the
amount of certainty

105
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,063
he can project.

106
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,765
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah.

107
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,867
Certain linguistic
anthropologists think

108
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,669
that religion is
a language virus

109
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,973
that rewrites
pathways in the brain,

110
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,641
dulls critical thinking.

111
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:55,079
Well, I don't use
$10 words as much as you,

112
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,016
but for a guy who sees
no point in existence,

113
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,620
you sure fret about it
an awful lot,

114
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:07,124
and you still sound panicked.

115
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,994
At least I'm not racing
to a red light.

116
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:15,633
every self-doubt
because he knows it.

117
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,570
See, we all got
what I call a life trap,

118
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,841
this gene-deep certainty
that things will be different,

119
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,010
that you'll move to another city

120
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,978
and meet the people
that'll be the friends

121
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,113
for the rest of your life,

122
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,183
that you'll fall in love
and be fulfilled.

123
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:37,521
Fucking fulfillment,
heh, and closure,

124
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,089
whatever the fuck those two...

125
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,160
Fucking empty jars
to hold this shitstorm,

126
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,630
and nothing is ever fulfilled

127
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,501
until the very end,
and closure...

128
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,639
No. No, no.
Nothing is ever over.

129
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,483
Minister Theriot,

130
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,685
do you recognize this girl?

131
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,053
I don't know for sure.

132
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,054
Wonderful sermon.

133
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,555
Well, thank you for coming.

134
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,023
Thank you.
Thank you.

135
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,926
I want to say it's...

136
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:17,862
Thank you.

137
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,996
I don't remember the name,

138
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,999
came pretty regularly
when we was in Eunice,

139
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,501
but I can't be sure.

140
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,636
We get around since then.

141
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,971
You? Oh, hello.

142
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,240
No. You're right.
We saw her in Eunice.

143
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,509
Tina might know her.

144
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,610
Mm-hmm.

145
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,613
How long
were you in Eunice?

146
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,047
About 6 months.

147
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,250
Widow in Opelousas
leased us cheap.

148
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,684
We left when it caught fire.

149
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,887
Any idea
how that happened?

150
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,256
Your people said
criminal mischief.

151
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,892
If I was to lay odds,
maybe one of the widow's sons

152
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,861
wanted us off the land,
but we move on.

153
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,796
We seek no title
nor retribution.

154
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,865
I'm gonna go find David.

155
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,733
OK.

156
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,635
Yeah.
Great preaching.

157
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,069
How long you been doing this?

158
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,206
Been preaching almost 20 years.

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,775
We've had Friends of Christ
for the last 8.

160
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,677
You with a church before that?

161
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,313
Independent evangelical.

162
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,814
I came up under
Billy Lee Tuttle,

163
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,218
went to his college in
Baton Rouge a couple years.

164
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,920
So back in Eunice,

165
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,789
who painted the mural
on the church wall?

166
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:23,027
Children from our
congregation painted it.

167
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,896
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,698
Something happen to this girl?

169
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,699
You looking for her?

170
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,901
Mr. Theriot, can we see
the identification

171
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,337
of your staff members?

172
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,707
You ever see her
with anybody?

173
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,043
Wasn't she with
someone the one day?

174
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,346
You remember?
The tall man.

175
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,114
Yeah,
but I don't know

176
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,584
if she was "with him" with him.

177
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,288
Well, can you describe him?

178
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,024
I just saw them talking.

179
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,826
I didn't get close or anything.

180
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,763
He was hunched forward
talking to her,

181
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:04,001
kind of a strange face, I think,

182
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,337
skin shiny around his jaw.

183
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,741
Ah, what, like burned?

184
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,144
Uh-huh.

185
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,814
So did she leave with him?

186
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,083
Yeah, maybe like that.

187
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,085
Arrested 10/89 on a 314,

188
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,922
spent last year in solitary
after a gang altercation.

189
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,390
Print and hold.
Thank you.

190
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,659
Copy that.

191
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,079
Everything check out?

192
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,281
For the most part.

193
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:55,653
Burt, you spent two
years in Angola...

194
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,122
Indecency, public exposure,

195
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,959
whacking off outside a school.

196
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:06,296
They gave me bad medicine.
I didn't know.

197
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:10,834
I paid for that.
I paid for that.

198
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,904
Can you account
for his whereabouts

199
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:17,007
December 25 through January 3?

200
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,409
Yeah. Christmas
to New Year's,

201
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,343
we was in New Roads.

202
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,744
Shouldn't be a problem
to find people

203
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,880
who'll vouch for
Burt's whereabouts.

204
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,915
We had a good turnout there.

205
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,949
Good turnout in...

206
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:31,021
Detective, what is it
you think happened?

207
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:34,358
Someone killed this girl,
made a big show of it...

208
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,896
left a painting
of the crime scene

209
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,131
on one of your old churches.

210
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,134
"I am the resurrection
and the light

211
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,938
for those
who believe in me."

212
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,178
Was she raped, detective?

213
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,183
Why would you ask that?

214
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:06,757
If you speak to Burt alone,

215
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,059
I believe you'll be
adequately convinced

216
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,129
of his innocence, detective.

217
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,065
OK. Let's do that.

218
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,870
Burt, go with the detective.

219
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,307
The ontological fallacy
of expecting

220
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,975
a light at the end
of the tunnel,

221
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,045
well, that's what
the preacher sells,

222
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,980
same as a shrink.

223
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,783
See, the preacher, he encourages

224
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,985
your capacity for illusion.

225
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,955
Then he tells you
it's a fucking virtue.

226
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,991
Always a buck to be had
doing that,

227
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:47,131
and it's such a desperate sense
of entitlement, isn't it?

228
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:53,003
"Surely, this is all for me.

229
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,239
"Me.

230
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,508
"Me, me, me. I, I.

231
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,510
"I'm so fucking important.

232
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,814
I'm so fucking important,
then, right?" Fuck you.

233
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,884
Excuse us
for a second.

234
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,431
I didn't know.

235
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,168
Easy. I am not
gonna hurt you.

236
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,070
I'm not gonna hurt you.

237
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,207
Oh.

238
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,082
Compassion is ethics, detective.

239
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,986
Yes. It is.

240
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,888
I ran checks
on all of them.

241
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,925
Everyone has got a clean
record except for Burt.

242
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,194
I could see
this being some kind

243
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,995
of retard job...

244
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,232
Pays for it, gets ashamed,

245
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,301
overreacts,

246
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:03,373
tries to redeem the act,
like, you know?

247
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,342
That's not bad, Marty...

248
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,143
Well, yeah.

249
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,179
I got all the way there
without your help.

250
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,348
But it's not him.

251
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,418
He did a deuce at the farm
for dick wagging.

252
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,921
Should've been in
a mental ward to begin with.

253
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,556
Give me the second half.

254
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,357
Angola.

255
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,060
Some Bloods caught him
in the shower,

256
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,429
took his balls off with a razor.

257
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,431
They were sloppy about it.

258
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,467
Oh, Jesus.

259
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,871
Still...

260
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,505
I braced him.

261
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:39,176
He shit himself, literally.

262
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,982
We can put some
troopers on this place,

263
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,183
have them surveil it,

264
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,319
but I think we should move on,

265
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,221
the tall man.

266
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,390
Well, that could be bullshit.

267
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,324
One threw it out,

268
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,159
and the other one
picked up on it.

269
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,262
No. Burt knew.

270
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,598
He saw the tall man, too.

271
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
This,

272
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,234
that Marie Fontenot thing,

273
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,236
there's no way Lange
was his first,

274
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,972
no fucking way.

275
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,241
¶

276
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,512
Rosie, can you
help them get out, please.

277
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,993
We haven't
matched any signatures.

278
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,530
One guy in the fed
database used crowns,

279
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,500
another a set of antlers...

280
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,235
Michigan lifer.

281
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,338
Then he called
the signature wrong.

282
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,208
We don't know that
there's any connection

283
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,411
to Marie Fontenot.

284
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,249
Yeah, but the lattices,
the symbology...

285
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,286
Some kind of culture
to it, Marty.

286
00:15:56,621 --> 00:16:00,457
I mean, he wanted
us to find this one,

287
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,292
like he was showing off.

288
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,296
That cane field is our stage.

289
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,432
Make a suggestion, then.

290
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,234
We start at zero,
they're gonna hand it

291
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,637
to the task force.

292
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,505
Well, somebody missed something.

293
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,341
We need to go back,
check all files.

294
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,743
Any DBs in state
the last 5 years,

295
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,545
we start there.

296
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,681
We don't have the hours.

297
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,717
Shit, man. Look.

298
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,387
I've noticed you have
a tendency toward myopia,

299
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,490
tunnel vision,
blows investigations.

300
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,194
Vision skews, twists evidence.

301
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,263
You're obsessive.

302
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:45,002
You're obsessive, too,
just not about the job.

303
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,371
Not, me, brother.

304
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,074
I keep things even, separate,

305
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,143
like the way I can
have this one beer

306
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,378
without needing 20.

307
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,679
People incapable of guilt

308
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,616
usually do have a good time.

309
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,623
Try not to be
too hard on myself.

310
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,725
Well, that's real big of you.

311
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,029
You know the real difference
between you and me?

312
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,731
Yeah. Denial.

313
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,701
The difference is
that I know the difference

314
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,103
between an idea and a fact.

315
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,807
You are incapable
of admitting doubt.

316
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,611
Now, that sounds
like denial to me.

317
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,515
I doubt that.

318
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,485
We'll put out an APB

319
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,722
on any tall man
with facial scarring...

320
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,756
OK.

321
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:43,593
Telex the hospitals
for patients that fit.

322
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,328
Good.

323
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,297
¶

324
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:02,212
So Cohle was trying
to keep it from the task force.

325
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,316
Looking back,
you ever think maybe

326
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,385
he tried to push things

327
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,221
where he wanted them to go?

328
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:15,792
No. We went where
the case led us.

329
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,328
But you took it up, though,

330
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,563
his serial theory.

331
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,732
Well, as arrogant
as he could be,

332
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,733
he was right.

333
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:28,572
I mean, that's how
we got our man.

334
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,107
¶

335
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,141
Uh-huh,

336
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,210
but I like it
this way, you know?

337
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,177
It's steady.

338
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,445
Bullshit, really.

339
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,447
Look. I did all the
counseling and stuff.

340
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,118
This is just the way things are.

341
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,519
No. Things don't
stay the same.

342
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,722
Pick up what you keep, and
you leave the rest behind.

343
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:46,690
People get better.

344
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,827
Well, that's the thing.
I think I am better.

345
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,629
You really think so?

346
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,564
Uh, trust me.

347
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,533
Maybe you just think
you prefer it this way

348
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,635
because it's
what you're used to.

349
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,604
Your life accommodates you.

350
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:05,208
You don't have to be
afraid of loss.

351
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,811
Those are the guys
I was telling you about.

352
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,414
They get a dog, fish,
what have you.

353
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,551
You start with that.
You live with it.

354
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,404
Hell, I suppose
you could set me up

355
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,608
with a nurse, get me
some of the good drugs.

356
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,809
Mm-hmm.

357
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,246
New start.

358
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,582
Daddy.
Daddy.

359
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,883
Hey, kids.

360
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,251
Hey, honey.

361
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,787
How you doing, Marty?

362
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,194
What's going on, Rust?

363
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,397
Brought the mower back.

364
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,698
Mow my yard?

365
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,800
Yeah. I saw
it needed mowing,

366
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,803
returned the favor, borrowing.

367
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,338
We got etouffee,

368
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,675
trying to get Rust
to stay for dinner.

369
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,443
Oh, yeah?

370
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,845
Stay for dinner, Rust.

371
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:20,317
Nah. I think
I got to get.

372
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,620
Maggie, thank you for the tea.

373
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,890
Sorry to hear that.

374
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,759
See you Monday.

375
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,563
I'll walk you out.

376
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,865
Hey.

377
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,767
Hey!

378
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,605
What?

379
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,474
What the hell do you
think you're doing, man,

380
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,378
at my house when I'm not here?

381
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,280
Returning the mower.

382
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,315
You know what I mean.

383
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,952
You mow my lawn? Hmm?

384
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,954
Just what'd you think
I'd be doing over here

385
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,856
when you're not around, Marty?

386
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:04,327
What's our problem, you and me?

387
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,729
No problem.

388
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,364
I just don't ever want you

389
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,032
mowing my lawn, all right?

390
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:13,837
I like mowing my lawn.

391
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,968
Oh.

392
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,069
That is your team, Daddy?

393
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:50,340
Yeah, baby. That...
I want them to win.

394
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,689
Uh, hey, Audrey, your mom and I

395
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,590
want to talk to you
a minute about

396
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,561
those drawings you
did in school, yeah?

397
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,030
Mace, run to your room.

398
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:14,798
Why?

399
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,599
Because I said so.
Run to y...

400
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,868
Go. Go on.

401
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:21,638
Go.

402
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,345
Go. Run.

403
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:35,085
Look.

404
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,755
You don't have to get
upset, honey, OK?

405
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,690
We just want to talk to you.

406
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,861
Where'd you see that
before, hmm?

407
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,097
Why'd you draw that?

408
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,499
Because other girls liked it

409
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,569
and they thought it was funny.

410
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,471
That's all.

411
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:59,943
Yeah, but where'd you
get that idea, hmm?

412
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:04,647
The girls dared me to do it.

413
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,682
Oh, God.

414
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,651
That upsets people, Audrey.

415
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,521
It's ugly.

416
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,758
It makes something
that should be nice

417
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,026
ugly.

418
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,896
I'm sorry. Oh...

419
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,966
Shh. That's OK.
It's OK.

420
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,004
It's OK, sweetie.

421
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,141
Well, I'm not saying
that I got any room to talk,

422
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,744
but do you know what it means
to be a father?

423
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,581
It means you are accountable
for other people.

424
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,552
You are responsible
for their lives.

425
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,455
Now, past a certain point,

426
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:50,460
there's a futility
in responsibility.

427
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,776
Hey.

428
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:09,712
That's the extent
of your concern?

429
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,747
Well, no.

430
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,017
I just don't know what
looking at it any more

431
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,652
is gonna do.

432
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,154
It's her.
I'm concerned.

433
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,758
Well, she's just trying
to get attention,

434
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,726
and the other girls...

435
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,896
Jesus, how do they even know
about that stuff yet?

436
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:30,133
Girls always know before boys.

437
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,234
Why is that?

438
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,603
Because they have to.

439
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,073
Listen to me.
She's withdrawn.

440
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,908
She asks about you,
and she wants to know

441
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,910
why you're working so much now.

442
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,147
Well, I should be working less.

443
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,749
Task force is gonna
take that case,

444
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:51,154
and I'll be around more.

445
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:55,859
Last week?

446
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,163
I'm sorry about that.
I should've begged off.

447
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,832
We were having a good night.

448
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:07,103
Don't stop me. Talk.

449
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,175
I'm close, Marty.

450
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,777
Do you hear me?
I'm close.

451
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,515
Um, they're gonna
pull that case from us,

452
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:23,820
and I'll be around more,
and we'll do things.

453
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,524
Why is there all this
space between us, Marty?

454
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,526
I don't know what you mean.

455
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,627
You do know what I mean,

456
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,829
and you won't say,
and that's it.

457
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,998
That's what I'm talking about.

458
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,934
This last year, you've
been a sulky teenager.

459
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,903
You know it.

460
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,739
I'm trying to be
your friend, Marty.

461
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:51,881
I'm just not good
at... expressing.

462
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,550
We change, don't we,

463
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,852
and sometimes not for long.

464
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,756
And here I'm thinking people
don't really change at all,

465
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,325
not who they are at heart.

466
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,160
I try to remember things
because I feel

467
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,828
like I should, like it's my job

468
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:11,034
or something,
you know, early days,

469
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,836
and I'm tired of
trying to remember.

470
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:18,575
Part of this...
And I'm not talking

471
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,777
about the part
that's all my fault...

472
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,314
But part of it, it's just life.

473
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:28,618
We used to spend weekends
without leaving my room.

474
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,219
That's not what I mean.
Remember that?

475
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,856
Of course we don't
screw like we're 19.

476
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,193
God, you want low expectations.

477
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,228
You put a ceiling on your life,

478
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,333
on everything, because
you won't change.

479
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:47,670
You were so much smarter
when I met you,

480
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,073
you know?

481
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:56,879
I'm sorry, Maggie.

482
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:01,217
I'm sorry for everything...

483
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,885
For not being here,

484
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:07,690
for taking all this for granted.

485
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:13,896
What have you been doing, Marty?

486
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,834
I...

487
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:26,342
Work, home, cases.

488
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:30,146
Just...

489
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:34,984
I get to feeling like...

490
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,955
Look. I can see 40...

491
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,094
and it's like I'm that coyote

492
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,663
in the cartoons,

493
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,831
like I'm running off a cliff,

494
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:54,704
and if I don't look down
and keep running,

495
00:27:54,706 --> 00:28:00,977
I might be fine, but, um...

496
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:06,015
I think I'm all fucked up.

497
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:12,855
You are.

498
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,291
Yes. You are.

499
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:30,099
Marty?

500
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:38,341
Anyway, well, we pulled
a few hospital patients...

501
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:43,246
Tall, scarred, sex offenders.

502
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,547
One kid did B&Es.

503
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:50,953
He had to tug one out
before he could leave a scene.

504
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:55,258
Phew. Yeah.
A lot of room work then.

505
00:29:56,827 --> 00:30:00,263
Which one of you guys
is the box man?

506
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:03,966
You, yeah?

507
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:08,037
I used to be pretty good
in there myself,

508
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,473
not as good as Rust.

509
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,141
I know, son.

510
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,878
I can read this off you.

511
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,814
¶

512
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,851
You're not bad.
It's not you.

513
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,052
There's a weight,

514
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,153
and it got its fishhooks

515
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,189
in your heart and your soul.

516
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:42,839
Now, what you did
is not your fault.

517
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,941
It's not.

518
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,375
You was drug to the bottom

519
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,078
by that same weight,
the same weight

520
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,980
that won't let you
get along in a job,

521
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,949
and same weight that
wouldn't let you

522
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,319
get along at school...

523
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,958
same weight that
wouldn't let you

524
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,427
have a mom.

525
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:10,433
I know these things, Chris.

526
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,904
I'm weak. I'm sick.

527
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,875
I get into the houses,
and I can't leave

528
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,445
until I go all over the drawers.

529
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,982
Listen to me, son.

530
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,017
You got one way out,

531
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,386
and it's through
the grace of God.

532
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,190
You're only how
the Lord made you.

533
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:38,661
You are not flawed.

534
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,463
We, you, me, people,

535
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,599
we don't choose our feelings.

536
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,903
There's grace in this world,

537
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,571
and there's forgiveness for all,

538
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,641
but you have to ask for it.

539
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,376
I do. I do.
I want that.

540
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:59,415
I want it. I want that.
I'm asking. I'm asking.

541
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,516
Tell me. Tell me.

542
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,385
Please just tell me what to say.

543
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:08,124
I want to confess.
I want to confess.

544
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:18,534
Sorry about that.

545
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:24,073
Your assist record, man,
that's something else.

546
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,642
Any pointers?

547
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,111
Oh, I never really
found it that hard.

548
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:34,550
You just look at somebody
and think like they think,

549
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:38,988
negative capability.

550
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,425
I mean, I guess it's a skill.

551
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,693
Most times,
you don't even need that.

552
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:48,631
You just look them in the eyes.
The whole story is right there.

553
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:54,236
Everybody wears their hunger
and their haunt, you know?

554
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:59,141
You just got to be honest
about what can go on up here,

555
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,011
a locked room...

556
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,183
but then again,
I'm terrible at cards.

557
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,585
Ha ha!

558
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:13,990
Yeah. So while we were grilling
B&E jerkoffs and burn victims,

559
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,727
I decided to put insomnia
to good use.

560
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,162
¶

561
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,490
People.

562
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:52,561
I've seen the finale
of thousands of lives, man...

563
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,296
Young, old.

564
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,566
Each one is so sure
of their realness,

565
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:03,806
that their sensory experience
constituted a unique individual

566
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:08,210
with purpose, meaning...

567
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:15,551
so certain that they were
more than a biological puppet.

568
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:21,490
Well, the truth wills out,
and everybody sees

569
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:26,162
once the strings are cut,
all fall down.

570
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:41,243
¶

571
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,752
Maggie says he's shy.

572
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,455
I wouldn't say that.

573
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,624
Definitely not shy
about speaking his mind.

574
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,326
Well, that's not what I mean.

575
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,629
His personality.
He's edgy.

576
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:05,267
Yeah, intense,
more like, introverted.

577
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,169
I don't want
another drunk.

578
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,237
The last cop you showed me...

579
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,273
No. Wait. Steve was going
through a tough time.

580
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,441
He threw up in my lap.

581
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,375
Don't worry about that.

582
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,512
Getting him near you lap
is gonna be the challenge.

583
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,249
Oh, hey, speak of the devil.

584
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,685
Hey, Rust.
Martin.

585
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,121
Hey, Maggie.
Hi, Rust.

586
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,555
Jennifer.
Rustin.

587
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,824
Nice to meet you.

588
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:33,696
Well, you walk over here?

589
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:43,706
Well... OK.

590
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:51,280
¶

591
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,250
Just when I thought he
couldn't get any stranger.

592
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,584
Are you serious?

593
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,353
He tastes colors.

594
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,422
So what is synesesia?

595
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,423
Synesthesia.

596
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,628
It's a misalignment
of synaptic receptors

597
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,899
and triggers...
Alkalis, colors,

598
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,867
certain metallics.

599
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,603
It's a type
of hyper sensitivity.

600
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,340
One sense triggers
another sense.

601
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,709
Sometimes I'll see a color,

602
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,511
and it'll put a taste
in my mouth.

603
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:27,383
A touch, a texture, a scent
may put a note in my head.

604
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,617
I've heard that.

605
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,353
It can be a side effect
of a statin.

606
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,655
It's not a side effect.

607
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:33,856
So when something feels good,

608
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,592
does that mean it
feels twice as good,

609
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,529
like from two different ways?

610
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:45,401
It could.
Yeah.

611
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,603
The waitress
will bring them, babe.

612
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,740
Why wait?
I'll be right back.

613
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:03,686
Refill and two rums.

614
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:09,959
Ohh...

615
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:17,366
Hi. Can I have
another beer?

616
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,801
Thank you.

617
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,369
¶

618
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,904
What are you doing?

619
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,739
What's it look like?

620
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,609
I'm on a date.
Aren't you?

621
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,409
Heh.

622
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:32,514
So are you gonna go home
with this guy? Huh?

623
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:36,018
It's really none
of your business.

624
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,687
Do you fuck your wife?

625
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,857
What do you
want me to do? Look.

626
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,860
Is this your way of
trying to talk divorce?

627
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,463
My God, Marty,
I don't want to marry you.

628
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,867
That's my whole point.
It's just run its course.

629
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,437
No, it hasn't. Come here.
Have a shot with me.

630
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,039
Gonna play
a little something

631
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,475
everybody should dance to.

632
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,578
¶

633
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:12,354
Hey, I didn't just
come here to drink, you know.

634
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:16,525
Let me just set this down.

635
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,695
It'll be fun.

636
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,997
Yeah.

637
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:39,481
What?

638
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,749
Oh, nothing.

639
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,988
Thought I saw a guy who
supposed to be in parish.

640
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:54,930
So what's Alaska like?

641
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,932
It's beautiful.

642
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,935
It's not Paris, but it's clean,

643
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,404
and it's clear.

644
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,673
You've been to Paris?

645
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,842
For a month.

646
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,944
What'd you do in Paris?

647
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:14,116
Mainly just got drunk
in front of Notre Dame.

648
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,385
¶

649
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:24,626
Each stilled body
so certain

650
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:29,531
that they were more than the sum
of their urges,

651
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:34,002
all the useless spinning,
tired mind,

652
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:38,407
collision of desire
and ignorance.

653
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:43,445
You asked
about the interrogations.

654
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,115
You want to know the truth?

655
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:50,552
I never been in a room
more than 10 minutes

656
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,689
I didn't know whether
the guy did it or not.

657
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,993
How long does it take you?

658
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:02,498
Rust spent a lot of off duty
running DBs,

659
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,835
weeks of it,
coon hound in another life.

660
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,670
Coon hound?

661
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,540
I meant raccoon hound.

662
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,511
Everybody is a fucking
drama queen nowadays.

663
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,513
Jesus. Look.

664
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:21,784
If working his theories,
if his job

665
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,186
was his idea of himself, fine.

666
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,756
I mean, the rest of us
had families,

667
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,526
people in our lives,
good things.

668
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,728
People give you rules.

669
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,532
Rules describe the shape
of things.

670
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,040
Come on!

671
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,876
Fuck you!

672
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,916
Fuck, Marty, get out of here.

673
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,784
"Fuck, Marty." Is that
all you got for me?

674
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,920
Stop it. Go home.
I don't want this anymore.

675
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,888
You got that little
shitbird in here?

676
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,190
Go away.
I'll call the cops.

677
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,125
Well, let's see how that
works out for you.

678
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,861
I know other cops.
OK.

679
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,764
Get out.
Marty, get out.

680
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,098
But she said she was single.

681
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,469
Marty, God!
Stop! Stop it!

682
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,037
Did she suck your dick, huh?

683
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,904
Stop it!

684
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,105
She suck your fucking dick?

685
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,209
Stop it!
Get out! Get off.

686
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,210
Get off!

687
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,911
Yeah.
You try it?

688
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,079
Oh, you tell me, or I'll have

689
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:28,650
some Ninth Ward prison queen
wearing your face for a condom.

690
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,621
Did she suck your dick?

691
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:36,091
Just for a little bit.

692
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,494
Get off.

693
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,497
Please stop it.

694
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:45,267
Sorry I got
in your face, guy.

695
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:49,972
I wouldn't have really
done something like that.

696
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:54,042
I'm not a psycho.

697
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:03,952
That's why I always said
I think Rust needed a family.

698
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:09,258
It's boundaries.
Boundaries are good.

699
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,222
This is Cohle.

700
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,157
Rust, you're home.

701
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,160
It's me.
Yeah. What's wrong?

702
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,028
I'm sorry.

703
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,130
Steve Geraci said
he caught something.

704
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,765
He needed help.

705
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,935
I almost called the station,
but what's the point?

706
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,203
You know they lie.

707
00:42:57,106 --> 00:43:00,242
I got to put you on the spot.

708
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,579
You know if it's true?

709
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,749
I didn't hear anything,

710
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,618
but then again, I wouldn't.

711
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,287
I mean, Geraci wouldn't pull me.

712
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,090
He hates me.

713
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,932
You drop Jen at home?

714
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:28,937
Yeah. I walked her
to the door.

715
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,205
You didn't go in?

716
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,673
You don't have to fall in love

717
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,008
at first sight, you know.

718
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,242
Yeah. I know. Look.

719
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:37,045
She's nice, pretty.

720
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,214
There's comfort there, Rust.

721
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,216
I think you guys
would be good together

722
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,885
if you gave it a chance.

723
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:47,623
You guys don't
give things chances.

724
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,024
I don't know why that is.

725
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,994
That's because we
know what we want

726
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,663
and we don't mind being alone.

727
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,401
Go to bed, Maggie.

728
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:03,872
Marty'll be home.
Take care.

729
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,915
Holy shit,
3 days in a row.

730
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,184
Is that a new personal record?

731
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:16,985
Fuck off.

732
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,388
I will take my first shit
through your sunroof.

733
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,824
Hey, hey, I found one, I think,

734
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,193
another girl from earlier.

735
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:28,296
Come here.

736
00:44:29,332 --> 00:44:31,767
3 years ago,
a flood in Abbeville,

737
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,169
they pulled this girl
out of the river.

738
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:34,870
Hold it.

739
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,105
It says here that her
death was accidental...

740
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,207
Drowned, water in the lungs.

741
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,208
How's that him?

742
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,145
Coroner says the branches
and debris from the flood

743
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,279
caused these injuries,
all right?

744
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,116
I understand the ribs and
the arms, but the hyoid?

745
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,217
Still...
No fucking way.

746
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,353
Look at this,
lacerations to the abdomen,

747
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,923
plus she was positive
for meth and LSD.

748
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,827
They said she was high, fell in.

749
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,762
Hmm.

750
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:04,866
Look at the posterior.

751
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,436
Holy shit.
Yeah.

752
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,171
I.D.ed
as Rianne Olivier...

753
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,339
22, lives in Pelican Island,

754
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,908
population 300.

755
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,878
Grandpa is still there,
got a phone at the dock.

756
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,182
I don't know if I
can sell this shit.

757
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,884
Two days, we dig
in this direction.

758
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,088
If this is his, it's
some kind of archetype.

759
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,191
DB, Ville Platt,
machinist. You're up.

760
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,060
Hey, we caught a break
in the case, boss.

761
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,362
I thought you were
handing that off.

762
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,063
What break?

763
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,499
KA of the victim.
Might've known the killer, boss.

764
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,401
Might've seen him.
We follow up.

765
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,437
We still got a few days.

766
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,807
Two days, and it
goes to task force.

767
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,910
You two catch again.

768
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,947
We'll try that serial
theory out on him,

769
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,982
he will pull you just for spite.

770
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,952
Pelican Island
is two hours away.

771
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,854
Here we go.

772
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,021
¶

773
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,492
Put your hand in his hand.

774
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,527
The good church teaches

775
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,029
that the Christian church
does not teach that,

776
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,998
the Catholic church does not...

777
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,241
Hey.

778
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:19,975
Mm-hmm?

779
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:25,881
Think a man can love
two women at once,

780
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:29,184
I mean, be in love with them?

781
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,888
I don't think that man can love,

782
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,057
at least not the way
that he means.

783
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:41,329
Inadequacies of reality
always set in.

784
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,399
This pipeline is
carving up this coast

785
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,267
like a jigsaw.

786
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:50,205
Place is gonna be
underwater in 30 years.

787
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,810
Do you think...

788
00:46:54,812 --> 00:47:01,116
Do you wonder ever
if you're a bad man?

789
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:05,086
No. I don't wonder,
Marty.

790
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,455
World needs bad men.

791
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:15,030
We keep the other
bad men from the door.

792
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:53,101
That's him.

793
00:47:55,504 --> 00:48:00,408
When's the last time
you saw your granddaughter?

794
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,379
She left 4 years ago,
like her ma.

795
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,415
Wasn't surprised they
found her like that.

796
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,351
Yeah. Everybody
think they gonna be

797
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,619
something they not.

798
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:14,222
Everybody, they got
this big plan.

799
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:18,026
She had a boyfriend
you know about, a man?

800
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:21,363
Eh, she took up with
that Ledoux fella...

801
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,366
Older boy, shit family...

802
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,167
Run off with him.

803
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,371
I ain't never had nobody
ask me about him before.

804
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,574
He just tell me she
died in the flood.

805
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,977
That Ledoux family,
they still live around here?

806
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,980
Oh, maybe a cousin or two.

807
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,682
Been shrinking every year.

808
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,450
Hurricane Andrew wiped most

809
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,419
of the folks out around here.

810
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:49,925
So you got a full name
on that Ledoux boy?

811
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,559
Reggie.

812
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,395
Reggie Ledoux.

813
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,597
Father is Bart Ledoux...

814
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,667
Works offshore, drunkard.

815
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,069
I heard he died.
Heh.

816
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,104
So where'd Rianne go to school?

817
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,507
Light of Way when it was open.

818
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,608
Kids either went there

819
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,677
or they were bussed
to Abbeville.

820
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,679
State said a kid
got to be bussed

821
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,048
two hours away to school.

822
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,717
I ain't too big on
them God botherers.

823
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,153
Between them
and the government...

824
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,256
How about her parents,
other relatives?

825
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,459
Father is a merchant seaman.

826
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,028
Mother is in California,
last I heard.

827
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,497
Do you have anything of hers...

828
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,600
Possessions,
anything that'd give us

829
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:36,171
an idea what he
might have been like?

830
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:39,541
What you boys looking
all this up for?

831
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,677
I was told she drowned
in the flood.

832
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,746
Now, I ain't no idiot.

833
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,649
You telling me she
ain't done drowned?

834
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,616
We don't know that, sir.

835
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:52,220
We're just looking for a man
who might have known her.

836
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,089
Who?

837
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,691
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

838
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,261
He ended up having
a little box of her stuff,

839
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,732
had her last yearbook,
tenth grade,

840
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:07,669
not a hint of feeling
from the old man,

841
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,172
kind of got blinders,

842
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:15,176
but why'd he keep the box, huh?

843
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,545
Did he ask himself?

844
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:21,750
Anyway, I guess,
that's one way to do it...

845
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:25,286
Keep your eyes
on the crab traps.

846
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:29,491
Kind of reminded me
of Rust a little bit.

847
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:36,531
This school is small,

848
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,267
grades one through 12.

849
00:50:39,668 --> 00:50:45,473
Rianne Olivier.
Here she is, tenth grade.

850
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,743
Hmm.

851
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:55,650
This school was part
of Tuttle's foundation.

852
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,473
Good afternoon.

853
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,274
Afternoon.

854
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,643
This place shut down '92, right?

855
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,212
Yeah, the way I heard it.

856
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,513
What'd you hear?

857
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,582
Oh, Andrew blew it out.

858
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,684
Guess they didn't think

859
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,287
it was worth cleaning up.

860
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,589
Do you work here, then?

861
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,791
No, sir. I work
for the parish,

862
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,760
cover several properties.

863
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,830
I-23?

864
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,201
I-23. Go.

865
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,169
I've got comeback on your R&I.

866
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,873
Reginald Ledoux...
DOB 11/13/60.

867
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,509
You know anybody who went here

868
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,611
or worked here back then?

869
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,580
Mm, no, sir.

870
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,282
I only been coming here
the last few months.

871
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,686
Parish added it
to my work order.

872
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:16,498
Thank you for your time.

873
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:22,637
Who walks
that fucking slow?

874
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,340
What you got?

875
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,875
R&I just came back.

876
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,777
Reggie Ledoux skipped
parole 8 months ago.

877
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,813
He's got a stat.
Rape complaint,

878
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,883
charges dropped,
but '93, he's busted

879
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,352
in connection to a narcotics lab

880
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,254
used to make meth and LSD,

881
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,557
which Dora Lange and
Rianne were full of.

882
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,591
Right.

883
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,493
Ledoux did two years
at Avoyelles,

884
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,495
and guess who his cellmate was

885
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,863
the last 4 months.

886
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,565
Charlie Lange.

887
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,800
I got to give you this one.

888
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:55,703
I started to believe
you were going

889
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,305
a little off your nut.

890
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:00,241
I mean, you're bonkers,
just not on this.

891
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,776
All right.
Where was Ledoux?

892
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,845
Getting a list
of relatives, KAs.

893
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,215
Been out of pocket
since jumping parole.

894
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,383
We'll find him.

895
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,584
This makes sense.

896
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,585
Looks good, baby.

897
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,253
All right.
We are on our way.

898
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:12,954
To Avoyelles.

899
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,455
Fuck, yeah, Martin.
Let's go.

900
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,757
I'm calling the interstate APB

901
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,792
and the U.S. Marshals
on this.

902
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:18,927
I-23 to dispatch.

903
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,262
Come in, I-23.

904
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:21,829
What can I say?

905
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,531
I thought for a minute,
you just liked looking

906
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,599
at pictures of dead people.

907
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,969
I need an all-state APB
on one Reginald Ledoux.

908
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,437
R&I came back with info.

909
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:30,939
All U.S. Marshals
and Highway Patrol,

910
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,341
be advised, detain
on sight, over.

911
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,876
Roger that, detective.

912
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,412
We've got that sent now.

913
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,581
Mm mm mm.

914
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:39,981
¶

915
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:47,689
And finally, we arrive
at Reginald Ledoux. Heh.

916
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:52,627
Come on, man.

917
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:56,464
You want to ask me,
ask, goddamn it.

918
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,701
You ever been in a gunfight?

919
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,703
No.

920
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,303
¶

921
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,805
Well, then how the fuck
you gonna know

922
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,708
what I'm talking about?

923
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:12,647
Man, that place...
I never...

924
00:54:12,848 --> 00:54:18,519
That day, it reminded me
of my pop talking about 'Nam

925
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,922
and the jungle thing.

926
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:24,692
Look. Me talking about
what happened back then,

927
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:28,896
that ain't gonna do you
any good now.

928
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,269
This...

929
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,372
This is what I'm talking about.

930
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,040
This is what I mean

931
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:43,678
when I'm talking
about time and death

932
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,581
and futility.

933
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,383
There are broader ideas at work,

934
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,619
mainly what is owed
between us as a society

935
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,621
for our mutual illusions.

936
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,724
14 straight hours
of staring at DBs,

937
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:01,496
these are the things
you think of.

938
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:05,400
You ever done that? Hmm?

939
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:09,337
You look in their eyes,
even in a picture.

940
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,072
Doesn't matter
if they're dead or alive.

941
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:15,643
You can still read them,
and you know what you see?

942
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:20,815
They welcomed it,

943
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,351
mm-hmm, not at first,

944
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,753
but right there
in the last instant.

945
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:31,326
It an unmistakable relief,
see, because they were afraid

946
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,761
and now they saw
for the very first time

947
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:39,033
how easy it was to just let go,
and they saw...

948
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:45,473
In that last nanosecond,
they saw what they were,

949
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,076
that you, yourself,
this whole big drama,

950
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,445
it was never anything
but a jerry-rig

951
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:55,483
of presumption and dumb will
and you could just let go

952
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:59,754
finally now that you didn't have
to hold on so tight...

953
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:05,827
to realize that all your life...

954
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,028
You know, all your love,
all your hate,

955
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:11,099
all your memory, all your pain...
It was all the same thing.

956
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:14,869
It was all the same dream,
a dream that you had

957
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,673
inside a locked room,

958
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:24,445
a dream about being a person...

959
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,722
and like a lot of dreams...

960
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:42,830
there's a monster
at the end of it.

961
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,066
