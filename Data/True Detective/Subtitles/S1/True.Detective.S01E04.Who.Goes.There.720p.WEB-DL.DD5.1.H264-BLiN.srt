00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:11,442
¶

2
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,200
What you doing?

3
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,669
You fucked with us, Charlie.

4
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,238
I did not, sir.

5
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,340
Reggie Ledoux.

6
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,375
Hey, I don't even want
to know that freak, man.

7
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:55,613
Y'all ain't asked
nothin' about Reggie.

8
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,250
Fuck, man, my...
My wife just died...

9
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,252
Ex-wife!

10
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,554
You had Reggie Ledoux
take her out,

11
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,323
didn't you?

12
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:05,890
No.
Hmm?

13
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,425
What are you
talking about, man?
Hmm?

14
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,228
Reggie? Put her out there
with them antlers on? I...

15
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,429
You have Reggie do it?

16
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,864
What are you
talking about?
Hmm?

17
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,699
Reggie Ledoux did this?

18
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,300
Reggie Ledoux?

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,237
Reggie motherfuckin'
Ledoux did this?!

20
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,405
Fuck, man! Shit!
Let me out, man!

21
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,207
Let me out!
Fuck, man!

22
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,142
Hey, Charlie?

23
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,279
We're not gonna give you
the Oscar no matter
how hard you try.

24
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,882
Oh, fuck you, man.
You don't know me.

25
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,918
You don't know
what I been through.

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,587
And what are you talking
about? You talk to me!

27
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,892
Ledoux knew about her, right?

28
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,293
You talk about her to him?

29
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,862
Yeah, man... yeah,
the way you do
sharing a house.

30
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,265
Yeah, you talk pussy,
talk scores.

31
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,733
That's what you do.

32
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,701
Showed him pictures of her, hmm?

33
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,602
Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

34
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,305
I had some she give me
when I first went down,

35
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,307
stuff for me to look at.

36
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,809
You know, like Polaroids.

37
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,611
He was a big guy...

38
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,214
A lot bigger than you.

39
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,416
Do you tell me you
didn't get along?

40
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,484
Nah, I mean, I did, most part.

41
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,519
You've got to,
you're sharing a house,

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,654
like I'm saying.

43
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,891
I mean, he gets you high,
man, but he's creep.
I ain't want to know him.

44
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,460
Tell me about Ledoux.

45
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,262
How is he creep?

46
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,731
He's a cook, you know,
like a chemist?

47
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,467
He used to, uh, make shit
out of kitchen stuff...

48
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,870
Cook down cleansers and whatnot.

49
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,972
Used tater skins
and fry grease to make
high-test sour mash.

50
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,609
He got mad knowledge
for that shit, but,
like, I don't know, man,

51
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,778
he talk like a short-eyes,
like something.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,215
How you mean?
He wouldn't talk
that shit up in here.

53
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,750
No, man, he didn't.
Like, me and him
at night,

54
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,320
blasted up on one of his mixes.

55
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,522
I mean, he could
brew some shit up

56
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,856
put you up out your head, man.

57
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,958
That's a big deal in here.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I mean, fuck, man,
it's a big deal
out there, too.

59
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,998
So, uh, what kind
of shit was he talking?

60
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,834
He said that there's
this place down south

61
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:01,239
where all these rich men
go to, uh, devil-worship.

62
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,274
He said that, uh...

63
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,444
they... they sacrifice
kids and whatnot.

64
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,778
Women and children all got...

65
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,880
All got murdered there, and, um,

66
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,983
something about someplace
called Carcosa

67
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,618
and the Yellow King.

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,855
He said there's all
these, like, old stones
out in the woods,

69
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,859
people go to, like, worship.

70
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,294
He said, uh...

71
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,497
He said there's just
so much good killin'
down there.

72
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,267
Reggie got this
brand on his back,

73
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,835
like in a spiral?

74
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,271
He says that's their sign.

75
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,639
What the fuck ever,
you understand?

76
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,940
I don't listen
to the man, but he's big,

77
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,542
so I don't tell him
to shut the fuck up,
neither!

78
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,446
You remember
any buddies he ever
talked about?

79
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,614
So we checked the records here,

80
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,450
and he hadn't ever
had any visitors.

81
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,486
We both know Tyro Weems.

82
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,323
Tyrone like to tell you
where he's at.

83
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,727
Look, man, Reggie's
crazy, like, for real.

84
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,538
Had to be tough,

85
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,608
living with
somebody spouting
insane shit

86
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,977
in your ear all day long.

87
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,614
You gonna give me
something for what
I told you just now?

88
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,816
Parole board nod.

89
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,352
Fair's fair.

90
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,696
Hey. Hey!

91
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:36,867
You think 'cause I talked
to him about Dori that...

92
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,604
I might have got her killed?

93
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:44,775
You probably had
something to do with it.

94
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:49,647
I don't think you
should have shown him
those pictures.

95
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,017
Do you?

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,403
We need to find
this Tyrone Weems,

97
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,638
see what he knows about Ledoux.

98
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,674
Yeah.

99
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,642
Ahem.

100
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,914
You didn't have to
tell him it was
his fault.

101
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,916
Guy was already low.

102
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,720
Yeah, he asked
about his end first.

103
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,556
Parole board.

104
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,525
So?

105
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,594
So fuck him.

106
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:41,165
¶

107
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,868
You're funny, Marty...

108
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,870
The shit you get soft about.

109
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:50,674
HART, VOICE-OVER: I wanted
every member of that family
that I could find.

110
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,443
Turns out...

111
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,778
there weren't any.

112
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,648
You know how weird
that is in Louisiana?

113
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,452
A cousin, what was it,
Dewall, was

114
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:07,491
not on paper except
for a, uh, trucker's license.

115
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,428
Ledoux had turned into a ghost

116
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,031
from the time he skipped
parole check.

117
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,467
Tell me, young studs,

118
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,472
what would you do
when you hit a wall like that?

119
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:26,510
Responding to the complaint,
I approached the house.

120
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:33,083
Seeing that the screen door
was broken and the inner door...

121
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,454
ajar, I... I felt that entrance

122
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,624
complied with standard
procedure.

123
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,928
Upon entering
the domicile, I noticed

124
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,966
what appeared to be marijuana
and a white powder

125
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,203
on the coffee table.

126
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,476
Hey, Martin.

127
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,910
We don't have to talk, Lisa.

128
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,744
The hell we don't.

129
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,646
You don't get to do
what you did to me
last week.

130
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,984
Look, I'm sorry.
I was hurt
and real drunk.

131
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,720
Talk to me now.

132
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,523
OK. Ah, I wish you
a great life

133
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,559
and good luck with
your new friend.

134
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,728
You philandering
fucking asshole.

135
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,229
Hey, look.

136
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,699
There is no pageant
to perform, OK, and

137
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,168
your disappointment
is irrelevant.

138
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,505
You don't get to act
like that, Marty,

139
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,272
or like this.

140
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,740
The fact is it's nice
to know you got him,

141
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,610
and I don't want to
have this conversation
with you.

142
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,079
You need to respect me, Marty.

143
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,982
This is respect.

144
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:43,020
Rust figured a connection with
an earlier death, suspicious...

145
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,889
Rianne Olivier.

146
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:49,793
Led us to the DB's old
boyfriend, Reginald Ledoux, 35.

147
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,730
Statch rape charge
against a 12-year-old,

148
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,298
acquitted for lack of testimony.

149
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,269
Did a bit for manufacturing
meth and LSD,

150
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,604
which fits the tox screen
for Lange.

151
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,041
His old cellmate
was Lange's ex-husband.

152
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,778
He showed him some
cheesecake pictures
of her.

153
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,280
Uh, from what we know about him,

154
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,114
the way he talked,

155
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,917
he sounds like he's
real good for it.

156
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,652
No line on any of his people.

157
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,587
Swamp folk, dug in off the grid.

158
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,591
We are tracking
a KA, Tyrone Weems.

159
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,093
He's in the sheets
that we passed out.

160
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,962
Any questions?

161
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,132
I didn't think so.
Let's get to work.

162
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:33,037
¶

163
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,797
Are you Theresa Weems,

164
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,098
Tyrone Weems' mom?

165
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,734
Tyrone ain't been around
in a while.

166
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,702
You know, a few months.

167
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,138
We got in a fight 'cause
he sold my microwave.

168
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,074
And what about his friends?

169
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,943
You know where they hang out?

170
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,912
I don't know, he dated
this girl Kelsey

171
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,113
for a little while.

172
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,683
Kelsey,
when's the last time
you saw Tyrone?

173
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,219
Months.
We've been broke up.

174
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,888
I don't ever hear from him.
I don't want to.

175
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,790
I heard he got
Shawnda Miller pregnant.

You think it's OK what you do?

207
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,954
All of you think it's OK

to treat women the way...

that he only cook
for one client now.

Some bike gang.

They buy all his product.
Bulk order, no mess.

Iron Heroes or some shit.

I don't keep up
with them gearheads.

Yup. Them ones.

sharpened in the interim.

Listen to me, Mags.

I said the other
night, every word.

Oh, my God.

You think your
betrayal's removed
by its interruption?

She was disgusting.
You're disgusting.

I don't give a shit

You need to get out
of our lives, Marty,
me and the girls'.

304
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,680
Read the note. It's all there

You don't mean that.

Yes. Yes, I do.
You don't mean that.

Listen, I...

307
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,621
You are not gonna
break up my fuckin'

Everything's fine, Doc.
I'm State Police.

I appreciate that,
but are you here
in that capacity now,

313
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,470

Get your hands
off me, goddamn it,

317
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,994
and call your
commanding officer.

318

You're making
a scene, Marty!
No!

There is no scene,
unless Mall Patrol

with my wife!

322
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,839
Private in a pretty
public way, man.
Easy, easy.

323
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,875
This is none of your
fuckin' business.
No, no.

324
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,311
It's none of my business,
but we got to work.

325
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,845
You hear me, Marty?

326
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,414
I got a line on Ledoux.

00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,481
I got it right fuckin' now.

00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,985
I need you to come in,
leave this shit till later.

Come on.

332
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,699
We can get to Ledoux.
Marty, it's gonna be dirty.

333
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,903
I just need her
to give me another shot.

334
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,505
If I could just get
another shot...

335
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,642
Listen, can I
tell you something?

336
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,609
Yeah.

337
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,611
This is none of my business.

338
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,381
I don't want to hear it.

339
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,084
All right. I'm sorry.

You can't just slide
into my life,

creating tensions, judging me...

345
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:50,767
What, I make you tap
some bimbo, looks like
a young Maggie?

346
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,902
I make you flaunt that shit?

347
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,871
Fuck, that night
at the Longhorn,

348
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,773
you were so obvious,
man, checking her out,

349
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,709
and she looked
crazy enough to have
followed you there.

350
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:05,615
With all the dick
swagger you roll, you
can't spot crazy pussy?

351
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,585
I fucked up.

352
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,620
I just...

353
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,923
I like something wild.
I always did.

354
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,459
I just...
it feels like it...

355
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,095
It smoothes out
the other parts
of my life most of...

356
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:23,633
Listen, Marty,
one more time. It's none
of my fuckin' business.

357
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,135
Ah, fuck.

358
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,604
Look, we got a job to do.

359
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,173
Off-book.
That's the only play
I can think of.

360
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:34,911
I... I got to straighten out
things with the family.
I got to fix it.

361
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,880
That bike club.
I know 'em.

362
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,716
I had deals
with 'em when I was
working narco.

363
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,119
We can get to that
motherfucker Ledoux.

364
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,489
So, enough with this
self-improvement,

365
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,892
penance,
hand-wringing shit.

366
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,427
Let's go to work.

367
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,062
Do you think you're...

368
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,499
Fuck!

369
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,902
Hell of a bedside manner
you got, Rust.

370
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:02,505
Ah, you know being
stupid's different
than callin' in sick,

371
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,742
and this is a bar,
not a fuckin' bedside.

372
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,445
Friend in need.

373
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,847
Every time I think
you hit a ceiling,

374
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,115
you just keep raising the bar.

375
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,452
You are like
the Michael Jordan of
being a son of a bitch.

376
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,855
Let's go. Come on.
Really gonna love
this jacket I got.

377
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,162
Holy shit.

378
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,730
You visit a lot of gun shows?

379
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:33,002
Ah, it's just some stuff
I kept in case some work
came back on me.

380
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:38,241
These boys Ledoux deals to,

381
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,577
they're out of east Texas.

382
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,747
I worked 'em when I
was DEA task force.

383
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:49,018
They know you're 5-0?

384
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,153
No.

385
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:50,987
I wasn't sure,

386
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,756
so I checked with
my old handler.

387
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,625
As far as my cover goes,

388
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,928
I took 3 slugs in a DEA shootout

389
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,763
in Port Houston.

390
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:05,101
Anybody
that gives a shit
figures I'm dead.

391
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,970
Major said

392
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:11,741
the task force used
to call you Crash.

393
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,577
I'm gonna have to take
some personal time

394
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,613
on this, Marty,
a couple of weeks.

395
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,649
Got to get out there
and get seen, drop
some lines.

396
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,785
I mean, badges ain't
gonna get us near
these people,

397
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:27,223
so the plan is
we make 'em an offer...

398
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,726
we get a line on their supplier,

399
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,861
confirm it's Ledoux,

400
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,897
bring him in.

401
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,999
And then, once we're out there,

402
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,768
all right, it's just
you and me on this.

403
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,538
I don't like that.

404
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,275
What happens, they clock
you're not you?

405
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,709
Mmm.

406
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:51,047
No, I can't do
what I need to do
if we got watchdogs.

407
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,183
Besides, like you said,
Quesada'd pull me.

408
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,786
The stakes ain't
that high anyway.

409
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,690
I get found, I take
a bullet to the head.

410
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,159
This cartel I worked
on the border,

411
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,195
they, uh, they had this routine.

412
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:11,334
They'd duct-tape you
to a chair that was
bolted to the floor,

413
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,869
use a couple rolls,

414
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,105
make sure you couldn't
budge a fuckin' inch.

415
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:19,809
And they'd cut around your face,

416
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,979
grip your scalp, yank down,

417
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,182
rip your face off.

418
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,017
Hmm.

419
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,254
And they'd put a mirror
in front of you

420
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:35,158
so you could get
a good look at yourself.

421
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:40,763
And they'd cut your dick
and your balls off...

422
00:26:42,232 --> 00:26:44,701
shove 'em down your throat

423
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,970
until you bled and choked out,

424
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,839
while you were watching.

425
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,276
So...

426
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,179
as far as high stakes go,

427
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,281
bullet to the head?

428
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,917
It ain't that.

429
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,251
Hey.

430
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,122
You sure you want to do this?

431
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,892
Not exactly.

432
00:27:13,697 --> 00:27:17,634
¶

433
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:35,051
Realize you got
a upstairs here, right?

434
00:27:44,728 --> 00:27:47,096
What is that?

435
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,699
Ink and cayenne.

436
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,135
Irritates the skin,
looks contused.

437
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:57,106
How long they have you
out there, working
the corridor?

438
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,676
Almost 4 years.

439
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,911
4? What the hell?

440
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:06,683
UCs ain't supposed
to do more than
11 months.

441
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:10,286
Yeah, but I... I'd
fucked up on the job,

442
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,691
and to make it better,
they went with me.

443
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:19,095
That's a long time,
being like that.

444
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:29,906
I need a good story
to move fast, and I
think I got one.

445
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,976
All we need now is
some good coke.

446
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:37,313
Where you gonna get that?

447
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:41,317
Don't worry about it.

448
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,787
So you got a suspect,

449
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,457
and you take a leave of absence?

450
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,391
Yup.

451
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,861
Like I said, to see my pops.

452
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,363
Had leukemia.

453
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:59,001
¶

454
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,339
Favre. Ahem. I get
the evidence key
from you?

455
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,075
Yeah. Heard you
were taking time.

456
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,811
Thank you.
Leaving tonight.

457
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,847
Sign the log.
Yep.

458
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,783
¶

459
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:30,226
You supposed to see
both eyes in this one?

460
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:34,130
¶

461
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,024
They really should have
a better system for this.

462
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,627
We looked
at your old partner's
history.

463
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,130
And coincidences keep
mounting, Detective.

464
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,867
Oh, coincidences like what?

465
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,003
Well, I don't know
if it would qualify
as coincidence, but,

466
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,205
near as we could tell,
his pops never had
leukemia.

467
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,276
No hospital records of that.
Fact, nobody in
that town in Alaska's

468
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,413
seen Travis Cohle
in more than 30 years.

469
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,915
That it?

470
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,151
You still angry
at him, your pops?

471
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,453
No.

472
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,321
He's dead.

473
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,023
You were, though.

474
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,259
I mean, why you two didn't talk.

475
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,528
We never really liked
each other.

476
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,965
There's a difference.

477
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,169
He was in 'Nam.

478
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,206
Met my mother on leave
in Galveston.

479
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,642
Time he came back, I was two.

480
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,110
She dumped me on him,

481
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,280
then she hauled ass,
and he and I moved to Alaska.

482
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:02,018
He was a survivalist,
I guess you'd call it.

483
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,622
Had some very fucking
strange ideas.

484
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,630
Oh, there's nothing like
the night sky out there, though.

485
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,934
But I couldn't handle
the cold, so...

486
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,270
I headed back to south Texas
'cause all I could remember

487
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,374
was at least it never got cold.

488
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:31,981
My old man always made
like I let him down
that way.

489
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,986
Said I had no loyalty.

490
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:38,421
¶

491
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,357
A clean break
is best now, while
they're still young.

492
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,459
Look, that's none
of my business.

493
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,395
I mean, but I do need him
to watch my back on this.

494
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,631
This is how you all get warped.

495
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,368
You always short-change
the wrong things.

496
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,669
Short-change?

497
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,037
Mm-hmm.

498
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,539
What else?

499
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,643
He wanted me to pass
a tide of apologies

500
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,112
of which I'll skip...

501
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,548
and he wants to see the girls,

502
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,151
if you can make time for it.

503
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:17,360
Kids are the only thing
that matter, Maggie.

504
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:21,998
They're the only reason
for this whole
man-woman drama.

505
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,432
I'm sorry.

506
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,135
What are you
suggesting, exactly?

507
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,338
Just that people fuck up.

508
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,207
We age.

509
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,143
Men, women... it's not
supposed to work

510
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,113
except to make kids.

511
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,281
So, if you can imagine

512
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,184
Marty's behavior
as an expression

513
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,620
of weakness, pain,

514
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,589
you'd see that it's
not about you.

515
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,092
So, end of the day,
you duck under
rationalization,

516
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,161
same as any of them.

517
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:56,632
You must have been
a great husband.

518
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,436
People have been
seeing me around
for about a week.

519
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,273
Guy I used to run
with, he wants
to meet me tonight.

520
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,809
Now, if I can get him
alone, we snatch him up,

521
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:43,612
work him over,
maybe get to Ledoux.

522
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,747
OK.

523
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,515
All right?
Great.

524
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:47,183
Listen...

525
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,286
Phone's fully charged.
And remember,
it's real simple.

526
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,154
Green... answers,
red... hangs up.

527
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,157
All right.
I'm the only one that's
gonna be calling.

528
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,127
Yeah.
And keep it charged.

529
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:03,466
Listen, uh, how was she?

530
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,768
What'd she say?

531
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,839
She was better.
I could see her
softening.

532
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,740
She didn't use the "D" word.

533
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:16,612
My odds, I could see
you two back together
within a couple months.

534
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,815
That your honest read?

535
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:22,885
That's my honest read, Marty.

536
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,589
¶

537
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:47,376
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Look, I don't know

538
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,312
how this guy I'm
meeting tonight
feels about me.

539
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,380
OK?
What does that mean?

540
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:55,284
It means, if you lose
track of me tonight,
keep this fucker handy

541
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,854
and be listening
to Beaumont police
channels.

542
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,823
Yeah.
You got it?

543
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,824
Yeah.

544
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,225
You got it?

545
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,494
I got it.
Are you gonna be
all right?

546
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,730
Yeah.

547
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,866
¶

548
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:47,570
Crash, here for Ginger.

549
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,367
Well, after Houston,

550
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,536
I got to a doc in Eagle Pass,

551
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,006
then a coyote got me
across the border.

552
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,809
Past two years, I been
working security

553
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,478
for a group in San Miguel.

554
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,549
Feds never ID'd me,
you know, so I figured,

555
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,719
hell, two years pass,
things chill down,

556
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,022
it's cool for me
to come back,
stick my head up.

557
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,725
That'll be tough, man...

558
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,928
thinkin' you been dead
this whole time.

559
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,430
I look dead, motherfucker?

560
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,401
I'm lookin' to get with you.

561
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,769
You or Miles.

562
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,338
Miles ain't gonna want
to see you, Crash.

563
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,408
Oh, I think
he might.
Well, yeah.

564
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,277
Then I'd say

565
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,612
I don't think
you want to see Miles.

566
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,448
Man, I ain't here
to start a thing,
all right?

567
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,550
Boys I been running
with in Mexico,

568
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,620
there could be
a hell of a deal
for both sides,

569
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,889
fuckin' money to be made.

570
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,691
Real money.

571
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,394
What kind of money?

572
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,733
¶

573
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,935
Goddamn Rust.

574
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,638
What the fuck?

575
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,802
My boys are looking
to trade, all right?

576
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,671
Coke for meth.

577
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:10,913
What you got there?
Ahem.

578
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,115
This one's just for you.
Just for me?

579
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,117
Uh-huh.

580
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,553
What'd you cut it with?

581
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,987
Oh, you'll see.

582
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,690
You'll dig it.

583
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:26,695
After all I meant to you, huh?

584
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:39,108
Now, who exactly are these guys?

585
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,014
Uh, they, uh...

586
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,516
ex-Mex Army.

587
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,952
They got a Colombian connection.

588
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,589
They need meth for
the maquiladoras.

589
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,091
Yeah, they could
cook it themselves,

590
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,893
but then the cartels
would take notice,

591
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,796
and that ain't what
they're lookin' for.

592
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,731
Hmm.

593
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:07,970
Here.

594
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,140
Taste that, homie.

595
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,149
That ain't no
fuck-around shit.

596
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,751
Goddamn.

597
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,659
Whew.

598
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,660
You keep it.

599
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:36,765
I've got bulldozers'
worth of that shit
where I came from.

600
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:41,637
The thing is...

601
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,672
we got one cook.

602
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,141
Does all our work,
exclusive-like.

603
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,577
He's real specific about that.

604
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,981
Now, what's this
worth to you, Crash, me
selling Miles on this?

605
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,618
Well, I'd go you one
better, brother.

606
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,721
We don't take that shit
to Miles at all.

607
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,790
You and me work the supplier,

608
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,059
the cut's
whatever the fuck
we want it to be.

609
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,028
Now, now, that's
tricky shit, bro,

610
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,863
and I don't know you
like I used to.

611
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,865
Yeah, I don't know you
like I used to, either.

612
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,166
That's why the fuck I'm here.

613
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,469
Well, let me tell you
why I came, Crash.

614
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,604
I need something
from you, tonight.

615
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,507
I had a 4-man team
for a big grab,

616
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,075
lost one to smokies.

617
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,810
I came looking to replace him,

618
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,945
if you're still
a bad-ass.

619
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,547
I don't do A&R, man,
no fuckin' bank jobs.

620
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,216
It ain't nothin' like that.

621
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,750
I need a good soldier.

622
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,886
Now, you do this with us,

623
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,489
we talk about
puttin' you with my man.

624
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,923
Look.

625
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,959
I don't ride cowboy
no more, Ginger.

626
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,660
Oh.
I don't do
this small-time shit

627
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,942
like this thing
you're talking
about, all right?

628
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,100
What, you get neutered
down south, huh?

629
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,636
I embrace the outlaw life.

630
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,673
Now, you dress the part still.

631
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,243
That just an act?

632
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,245
When in Rome, brother,

633
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,648
but I do clean up
real fuckin' pretty.

634
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,151
Motherfucker,
I need a gunslinger.

635
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,989
Now, you ain't too timid,
get on this shit with me.

636
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,126
Then we can talk
about doin' business.

637
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:16,732
Where?

638
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,135
My place.

639
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:24,172
Down the bayou.

640
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,208
All right.
I got my truck.

641
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,644
It'll be safe here.

642
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:34,583
Members only.

643
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,986
I'm just lookin' for a friend.

644
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,102
¶

645
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,657
Hey. What the fuck?

646
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,593
Look, look, look,
my buddy's not here.

647
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,161
You ain't listening!
I'm his sponsor, and

648
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,697
I'm worried that he
might have started
drinking again.

649
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,132
You better worry
that we don't pull
your head off

650
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,701
and shit down your neck!

651
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,069
He's been 20 years sober.

652
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,638
Just give me one second.

653
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:35,811
What the hell!

654
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,913
I'm leaving, sir.
A guy can just come
in here and say,

655
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,016
"Lookin' for a fuckin' friend"?!

656
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,620
Ought to worry more
about your balls, faggot!

657
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,922
Get the fuck outta here!

658
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,890
I'm leaving.

659
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,225
Jesus Christ.

660
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,694
Run, motherfucker!

661
00:43:55,031 --> 00:43:57,699
That's good.

662
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:23,058
Son of a bitch, man!

663
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,192
Fuck is that?
That there?

664
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:28,030
That's Tigger
the nigger.
Name's
Tiger Thomas.

665
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,166
Dealer in them
Hoston Projects.
You know them?

666
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:35,137
That's like them
bungalowed, flat-like
joints, right?

667
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,071
Yeah.

668
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,406
They keep a stash house there.

669
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,175
I'll get you, you fucking dicks!

670
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,378
Hey, why don't you
shut the fuck up,
nigger?

671
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,279
Fuck you!

672
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,115
So you all gonna
take a stash house

673
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,184
in coon country, huh, 4 guys?

674
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,821
Well, how big's
the projects, man, like
square block-wise?

675
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,061
Get the gear, mates.

676
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:05,233
Wait till you see this.
You're gonna love it.

677
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:18,380
Oh, you're going in
as cops, huh?

678
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,482
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

679
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:23,018
You know where
the stash house is?

680
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,821
Tiger's gonna take us there.

681
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,857
Well, you got an exit plan?

682
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,058
Hmm?

683
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,094
Timetable?

684
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,763
The real cops come,
then what, huh?

685
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,233
I mean, you say
you're going in
the one fuckin' car?

686
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,201
Uh-huh.

687
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,203
Far as I remember, man,

688
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,271
the place is blocked in.

689
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,840
That is one way in, one way out.

690
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,076
It could be fuckin'
Mogadishu, man.

691
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,778
We hit trouble,

692
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,881
you're just gonna
fuck it in the ass.

693
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,751
You scoop out the soft brains

694
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,819
inside the skull.

695
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:03,391
Well, so you have
thought it out.

696
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,128
My bad.

697
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:24,379
I come through
for you on this tonight,

698
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,515
I got to know you're
gonna hook me up,

699
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:31,219
'cause I got a real job
I was supposed
to be doing.

700
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:31,853
Hmm?

701
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:37,259
You got my word.
You back me on this,
I'll back you.

702
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,071
Fuck it. Let's go.

703
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,574
Up and at 'em, eggplant.

704
00:46:54,977 --> 00:46:56,545
Motherfuckers.

705
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,580
Fuck you!
Come on.

706
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:05,420
Y'all are dead!
Y'all are dead!

707
00:47:10,993 --> 00:47:15,197

Over Zone 6, Hoston Projects.

711
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,318
Pretty quiet, possible 507s.

712
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,620
Everything's Code 4.

713
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:42,524
Copy that.

714
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:47,229
Man, you got
two ways of lookin'
at it, Tiger.

715
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,131
You can die and lose your shit,

716
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,967
or you could live,

717
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,270
go make some more shit.

718
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:05,180
¶

719
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:51,426
What's up?
Y'all get back
in your house, now. Police.

00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,596
Sheriff's Department!
Get back in your house.
Do it.

721
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,631
There's nothin' to see here.

722
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,266
Sorry son of a bitch.

723
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,536
Fuck out of here
and start going...
Fucker, start moving.

724
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,339
Tiger, man, yo.
What's up, man? What's this?

725
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,341
Yo! Fuck! Lamar!
Sheriff's Department.

726
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,944
Lamar!
Freeze, motherfucker.

727
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,445
Come on...

728
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,212
Aah!

729
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,480
Get up there, big boy.
Get on the door.

730
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,082
Tell them
that it's safe.
Lamar.

731
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,583
Get the fuck off me!
Come open the door,
Lamar.

732
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:19,020
Tell them who you are.
Fuckin' door, man.
It's Tiger.

733
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,189
Get up here. Get back!

734
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:24,292
Police!

735
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,660
Fuck!

736
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,562
Everybody down, now!

737
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,698
Sheriffs!
Hands behind your head!

738
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,000
Shut up!
Get the fuck down!

739
00:49:44,513 --> 00:49:47,248
Don't move.

740
00:49:56,225 --> 00:49:58,660
Get in the tub.
Listen, listen.

741
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,529
You lay down.
Don't you move.

742
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,433
Got no shit!
Let me outta here!

743
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,002
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

744
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,770
- Look on the left.
- It's right there.

745
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,039
No, no, no, no.
Ginger, no.
Don't touch it.

746
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,374
It's in there.
You open it, motherfucker.

747
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,076
Get that gun
out of my face.
I'll put something else

748
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,144
in your face, you don't shut up.

749
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,581
Get your fuckin' ass
over there! Start movin'!

750
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,082
Come on!

751
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,283
Ginger.

752
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,719
You motherfucker!
Get that shit off of there!

753
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:28,056
Come on!
Hurry your ass up!
Fuck.

00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,090
Fuck you!

755
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,558
All right, 30 seconds,
in and out.

756
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,527
30 seconds, in and out, Ginger.

757
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,495
Get that safe open.

758
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,197
Watch it, watch it.
I'll nuke you,
motherfucker.

759
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,066
Keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

760
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,068
I'm gonna fire on you,
motherfucker.

761
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,636
Get the fuck off my dawg!

762
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,805
- Fuck!
- Easy, easy.

763
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,641
Just get in and get
the fuck out, Ginger.

764
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,543
It's Christmastime, Crash!

765
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,711
We got this shit!
Easy.

766
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,047
Fuck that fake-ass po-po!

767
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,783
Stay calm. Get it,
Ginger. Get the fuck
out of here.

768
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,385
Ginger, man, they're
gathering out there...

769
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,488
Aah!

770
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,322
Come on, Ginger!

771
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,825
They're animals
out there, man.
Easy, easy.

772
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,161
Easy, motherfucker.

773
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,695
Easy. Easy.

774
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,065
Ginger, let's fuckin' go!

775
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,533
You sorry-ass
motherfucker!
Easy.

776
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,235
I told your cracker ass!
You're dead!

777
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,838
Don't fucking
fire! Do not...

778
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,406
Goddamn it.

779
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,374
Lamar!

780
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:23,478
Ginger! Ginger!
Stop fuckin' around!

781
00:51:25,548 --> 00:51:26,708
Fuck!

782
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,486
Fuck!

783
00:51:33,856 --> 00:51:36,324
What the fuck!
Ginger!

784
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,094
I fuckin' knew it!

785
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:41,329
Aah!

786
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:45,533
Wish I could have done
this from the start,
you fucking moron!

787
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,537
Oh, fuck! What the fuck
are you doin', man?

788
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,573
Shut the fuck up.

789
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,641
Motherfucker!

790
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:00,415
Hey!

791
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,318
Get up.

792
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,787
Freeze. Who else
is in the house?

793
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,889
Nobody.
OK. Get in the bathroom.

794
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,191
In the bathroom.
Lay down.

795
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,840
Marty, OK.

796
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,876
I need you to meet me
at Amelia Street

797
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,311
between 18th and 19th
in 90 seconds.

798
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,747
You got it?
You got it?

799
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,516

800
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,251

00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,821
Ooh, one right there!

Aah!
Here comes

804
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:47,829
Aah!

00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,765
Get your ass up!
Come on!

806
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,605
Aah!

807
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,875
Ginger.

808
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,579
You stupid mother...

809
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:05,947
The neighborhood...

810
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:12,620
Come on, man!
Police behind us, man!

811
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:15,323
Come on.

812
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:23,698
Keep going, man!
Come on! Hurry up, man!

813
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:33,741
Put the weapon down!

814
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,910
You motherfucker!

815
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:36,678
I'll get you!

816
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,982
You'll get yours,
fuckin' Crash,
you motherfucker.

817
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,350
You'll get... aah!

818
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,420
Come out with your hands raised!

819
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:47,555
Get down on your knees!

820
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:10,411
Quick, hide. Here.

821
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,347
Oh!

822
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:16,351
Oh, shit!

823
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:22,757
Hey!

824
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,366
Go!

825
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,773
Go.

826
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:02,297
Go, go, go!

827
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,936
What the fuck happened?

828
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,673
Remember that meth contact now?

829
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,441
You rat motherfucker!

830
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,044
You're gonna give me
the location for Ledoux,

831
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,813
I'm gonna let you slide, Ginger.

832
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,081
Bullshit.

833
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,418
What the fuck you think
I want with you, huh?

834
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,087
Oh, goddamn.

835
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,824
I am so done talking
to you like a man.

836
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:33,961
Go, go.

837
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,564
We have multiple gunshots.

838
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,534
