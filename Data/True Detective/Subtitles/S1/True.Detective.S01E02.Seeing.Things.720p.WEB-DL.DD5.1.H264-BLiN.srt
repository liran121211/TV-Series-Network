00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:15,839
¶

2
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:40,698
Back then, I'd sleep and

3
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,000
I'd lay awake thinking
about women.

4
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,369
My daughter... my wife.

5
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:51,008
I mean, it's like... something's
just got your name on it,

6
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,876
like a bullet

7
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:56,714
or a nail in the road.

8
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,250
Shit.

9
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:02,119
Sorry. I drift...

10
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,923
sometimes when I've
had a few. That's...

11
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,759
That's why I like
to drink alone.

12
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,628
One reason, anyway.

13
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,765
About that
sculpture thing.
Hmm.

14
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,868
Kind of strange
it turns up like that

15
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,869
years later.

16
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,139
Yeah, nobody knew why
that thing was in the playhouse.

17
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:29,079
I mean, the aunt reckoned
maybe it was something

18
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:33,150
she made in school, you know?

19
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,788
COHLE, VOICE-OVER: To me,
it was like someone was

20
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,892
having a conversation, you know?

21
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:49,767
Girl's... school
shut down in '92.

22
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,070
It closed down after Andrew.

23
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,407
That mean anything to you?

24
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,849
Oh, we notified
the deceased's mother.

25
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:10,120
HART, VOICE-OVER:
Do you remember the last time

26
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,823
you saw your daughter Dora?

27
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:17,127
WOMAN, VOICE-OVER: It was
a horrible, horrible thing.

28
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,230
We saw it on TV,

29
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,299
what we're in the clutches of,

30
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:27,237
and I prayed and prayed
for that woman's family.

31
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,874
And it's me.

32
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,377
It's me.

33
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,080
Mrs. Kelly.
Hmm?

34
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,848
What about her father?

35
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,417
Did they have a relationship?

36
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,986
Why?
What have you heard?

37
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:45,489
I heard he passed.
Is that correct?

38
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,893
Why wouldn't a father
bathe his own child?

39
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:56,200
Ahem.

40
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,368
We, uh, we were just wondering

41
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,137
how they got on, ma'am.

42
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,905
He died on the road.

43
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,207
He drove a Peterbilt,

44
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,175
and he took an exit too fast.

45
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:09,747
Rolled over
near Rowan, Oklahoma.

46
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,216
May 11, 1984.

47
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,151
When was the last time
you talked to her?

48
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,855
You know, she's always been
in some kind of trouble.

49
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,791
I thought things were
getting better.

50
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,159
Got away from Charlie.

51
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,929
She came by not too
long ago, maybe a month.

52
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,332
She didn't talk
about her daddy none.

53
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,902
Said she'd been going to church.

54
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:32,870
Do you, um,

55
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,472
do you remember where
that church was?

56
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:38,408
Oh...
Mrs. Kelly?

57
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,010
No.

58
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,979
Ow.

59
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,951
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

60
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:50,420
Hail Mary, full of grace.

61
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,555
Mrs. Kelly...

62
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,024
I... I get
these headaches.

63
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,260
It's like storms. Oh.

64
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,897
I worked in dry-cleaning
for 20 years.

65
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,465
The chemicals.

66
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,968
That's what's wrong
with my nails.

67
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:14,011
Piece of work, huh?

68
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,181
My mother...
Donna Reed type.

69
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,583
Packed lunches,

70
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,320
bedtime stories.

71
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:28,325
Your mom still alive?

72
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:31,929
Maybe.

73
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,000
PAPANIA, VOICE-OVER:
Cohle ever talk
about his parents?

74
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:41,238
HART, VOICE-OVER: No.
Little bit about his dad.

75
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,472
Alaska, 'Nam.

76
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:47,578
You know, my dad, I had
about 6 inches on him,

77
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,613
and even in the end,

78
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,050
I still think
he could have taken me.

79
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,453
Yeah, Marines, Korea.

80
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,521
Never talked about it.

81
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,489
You know, there was a time that

82
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:02,059
men didn't air their
bullshit to the world.

83
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,896
You know, it just wasn't
a part of their job.

84
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,099
Well...

85
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,101
family.

86
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,103
Well, I mean, I...

87
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,205
I think a part
of Rust's problem was

88
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:21,545
there was things he needed
that he couldn't admit to.

89
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,247
Afternoon, men.

90
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:28,518
HART, VOICE-OVER:
So we talked to the victim's
friend next, I believe.

91
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,553
Miss Carla?

92
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,622
CARLA, VOICE-OVER:
I guess she always
had her mom's place,

93
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,525
but, uh, I thought
maybe she'd gotten
into somethin',

94
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:40,497
you know, like, uh,
like gamin' again.

95
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,000
Havin' a rough time.

96
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:47,604
What all did y'all talk
about? How was she?

97
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,007
Thin, loopy,

98
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,174
like high,

99
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,143
usually on somethin'.

100
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:57,047
She says she
found a church,
but, uh... heh!...

101
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,016
Her eyes.

102
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,051
Somethin' wrong with 'em.

103
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,688
Now, do you remember
where this church was?

104
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,423
No.

105
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:09,526
You know where she might
have been staying?

106
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,195
Her landlord said she'd
moved out last summer.

107
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,531
That's when I stopped
seein' her so much.

108
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,567
She mentioned someplace
down south,

109
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,504
like around Spanish Lake, a...

110
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,241
shelter, girls used
to stay there,

111
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,643
something, all she said.

112
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:27,377
Hmm.

113
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,547
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
She sounds sad, Marty,

114
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:35,352
like a torn-up person
on her last legs.

115
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:40,390
She was just
an easy target for him.

116
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,693
What do we know about him?

117
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,494
Hits prosts, artistic,

118
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,663
religious in some kind of way.

119
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,266
Every person within
a thousand miles of here

120
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,736
is religious in some
kind of way, except you.

121
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,706
How many DBs have antlers,

122
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,240
blindfolds,

123
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,376
painted symbols
on their back, hmm?

124
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,478
Yeah, you know what
tweakers get up to.

125
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,214
Shit, man, this dude
in New Orleans

126
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,549
cut up his girl, felt remorse,

127
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,552
tried to piece her
back together
with Krazy Glue.

128
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,420
That's just drug insanity.

129
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,723
Ah, that's not this.
This has scope.

130
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,359
Now, she articulated
a person with vision.

131
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,329
Vision is meaning.
Meaning is historical.

132
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:24,167
Look, she was just chum
in the water, man.

133
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:40,384
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Days of nothing.

134
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,554
That's what it's like,
you work cases.

135
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:51,161
Days like lost dogs.

136
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,769
HART, VOICE-OVER:
Goes on like that.

137
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,805
You know the job.

138
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,542
HART, VOICE-OVER:
You're looking for narrative,

139
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,645
interrogate witnesses.

140
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,614
Wake up, Daddy.

141
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,549
Parcel evidence,

142
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,751
establish a timeline,

143
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:19,222
and build a story day after day.

144
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,393
No! No!

145
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,343
Hey, the other night,

146
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,612
when you were over for dinner,

147
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:46,850
why didn't you leave
when I had Chris call?

148
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,756
Mmm, I don't know.

149
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,860
I guess I had
sobered up a little.

150
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:00,864
Besides, it wasn't
as bad as I thought.

151
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,300
And being around your family,

152
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,168
I liked talking to them.

153
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,473
"Bad"?
Why'd you think that?

154
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:15,645
I was married, Marty,
for 3 years.

155
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,448
We had a... baby girl.

156
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,749
She died.

157
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,886
Car accident.
She was two years old.

158
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,890
Marriage couldn't handle it.

159
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,261
Your kid died?

160
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,133
Oh, I...

161
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,569
I'm sorry, man.
I am so sorry.
I didn't...

162
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:44,908
No, I mean, it wasn't
you guys. It was just me.

163
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,677
I was worried...

164
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,614
you know, being around
that kind of thing.

165
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,884
GILBOUGH, VOICE-OVER:
Hey, you were married
the once, just the once?

COHLE, VOICE-OVER: Uh-huh.
Came close another time.

167
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,526
Laurie.

168
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:07,297
Maggie introduced us,

169
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,166
and it... it broke off.

170
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,937
It was for the best, you know.
I gave her cause.

171
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:18,241
I can be hard to live
with. You know, I...

172
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:22,412
I don't mean to,
but I can be... critical.

173
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:25,615
And sometimes
I think I'm just
not good for people,

174
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:30,687
you know, that it's
not good for them
to be around me.

175
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,958
You know, I...
I wear 'em down,

176
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,394
you know, they...

177
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,730
they get unhappy.
Hmm.

178
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,867
Yeah, I think the job does
that to a lot of guys.

179
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,470
Changes you. Some guys
just notice, that's all.

180
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:50,574
Well I can't say
the job made me
this way.

181
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:55,512
More like me being this way
made me right for the job.

182
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,315
And I used to...

183
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,517
think about it more, but...

184
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,689
you know,
you reach a certain age,
you know who you are.

185
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,592
Now I live in a little room

186
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,461
out in the country,
behind a bar.

187
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:15,465
Work 4 nights a week;
in between, I drink,

188
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:20,270
and there ain't
nobody there to stop me.

189
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:25,275
I know who I am.

190
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:29,779
After all these years,
there's a...

191
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,782
there's a victory in that.

192
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:34,651
¶

193
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,586
Third day
on the job,

194
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,688
stopped this cutie for speeding.

195
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,392
52 minutes later,
back in her dorm room.

196
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,461
I got my...

197
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,963
uniform around my knees.

198
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,865
Ha! I'm occupied,

199
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,835
so I don't hear
anything.

200
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:55,839
I don't know that her
roommate has come home

201
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,742
and snuck up behind us.
Oh, shit.

202
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,511
You know how I knew that
she was in the room?

203
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,848
She stuck her finger up my ass!

204
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,620
Ruined me. Now I can't
do without it.

205
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:16,359
HART, VOICE-OVER:
You miss some things on the job.

206
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,328
You know what I mean.

207
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,363
You got to... decompress

208
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:24,834
before you can go being
a family man.

209
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,037
What you get into working,

210
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,374
you can't have
the kids around that.

211
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:36,946
So, um, sometimes you got
to get your head right.

212
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:38,848
Mind if I stop by?

213
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,785
I don't know. Where are you?

214
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,986
Elks.

215
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,021
So you're drunk.

216
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:45,955
No, I'm not,

217
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,525
and I've hardly had
anything to drink.

218
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,729
You never hardly have
anything to drink.

219
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:56,099
I have a surprise for you.

220
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,701
Oh, yeah?

221
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,569
Yeah.

222
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,838
Is that a yes?

223
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,741
I, uh, might stay up.

224
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,975
Ah.

225
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:11,948
HART, VOICE-OVER:
It's for your wife
and kids, too.

226
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,820
You got to take your release
where you find it

227
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,655
or where it finds you.

228
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:23,660
I mean, in the end, it's for
the good of the family.

229
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:44,814
What's that?

230
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:47,717
Oh, well, I, uh,

231
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,020
got you a present.

232
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,524
¶

233
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:08,972
Don't move a muscle.

234
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,775
I shan't.
Just the fingers.

235
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,044
The finger muscles.

236
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:17,180
Mmm.

237
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,183
Oh, stop.

238
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,986
Oh, you're very naughty.

239
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,489
Yes.

240
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,530
You have the right
to remain silent.

241
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:35,932
Anything you say

242
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,602
can and will
be held against you
in a court of law.

243
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:42,038
You have the right
to an attorney.

244
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,808
If you can't afford an attorney,

245
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,811
the state will provide you one.

246
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,746
Do you understand your rights?

247
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,817
You definitely
have a career
in law enforcement.

248
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,722
Well, I thought I was
gonna put these on you.

249
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:02,025
You want this?
Ah.

250
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,526
Yeah?

251
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,828
You want it?

252
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,597
Yes.

253
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,895
Mmm.

254
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,708
Mmm.

255
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:06,089
GILBOUGH, VOICE-OVER:
Now, what do you mean, exactly,
these visions you mentioned?

256
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,025
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Oh, shit. I thought you knew.

257
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:14,097
I told Marty about them,
you know, down the line.

258
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,739
Uh, chemical... flashbacks,

259
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,141
neural damage, you know,

260
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:27,844
from my time in the HIDTA,

261
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:33,683
as in High-Intensity
Drug Trafficking Area.

262
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:49,832
I spent 4 years undercover.

263
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:53,136
You know what that means?

264
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:58,708
That's where they got them
Fed rumors, I first come in.

265
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:03,279
What, you two
don't know about them?

266
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:07,884
Those files are still
sealed, huh?

267
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,287
Shee-it.

268
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:16,292
Just what have you two
heard about me?

269
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,726
You wanted blues?

270
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,294
Quaaludes.

271
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,930
Downers?
Dopey stuff.

272
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,032
Oh.
What's it run?

273
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,770
I'm thinking blue go
for three a pill.

274
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:05,174
We'll say 200 for the bottle.

275
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,950
I thought you might
just take 'em.

276
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:19,722
Or that you wanted
somethin' else.

277
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,193
Some kind of somethin' else?

278
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:30,066
No.

279
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:35,838
Then I was thinking,
you're a good-looking man.

280
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,076
You wouldn't need
a shakedown to get some.

281
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:44,080
What about
rough trade,
scary guys?

282
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,349
You girls talk.

283
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,818
Around here, they're rough

284
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,353
or whiskey-limp.

285
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,754
Seen plenty of guys
that get touchy.

286
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:55,992
Something sets them off
and they're like
little boys.

287
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,862
People always go away
around here.

288
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:02,365
Where would I look,

289
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,368
working girls might know
the blonde?

290
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,273
If she was gaming I-10
south side, I heard
of this place.

291
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,208
Kind of trailer park.

292
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,413
Girls work and stay.
They call it "The Ranch."

293
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:18,715
Where's that?

294
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,384
Like, south of Spanish Lake,

295
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,920
supposed to be.

296
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,723
You know the place?

297
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,462
What's your deal?

298
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:36,766
I don't have a deal.

299
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,869
I mean, what do you do?

300
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,940
Never mind. I thought
you were gonna bust me.

301
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,310
I told you, I'm not interested.

302
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,046
Yeah, I know.

303
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:52,448
Kinda strange,

304
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,417
like you might be dangerous.

305
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,053
Well, of course I'm dangerous.

306
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,321
I'm police.

307
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:02,458
I could do
terrible things
to people...

308
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,128
with impunity.

309
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,764
You know,
what'd you do
last night?

310
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,866
I called up here late.

311
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,968
What were you doing?

312
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,770
Working.

313
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,472
Was thinking about dropping by.

314
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,341
Where were you?

315
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,276
I was out with girlfriends.

316
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,412
Uh-huh. Well,
I don't like that.

317
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:26,549
What, you're jealous?

318
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,819
Don't be stupid.

319
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,855
I just mean that there's

320
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,224
a crazy man out there,

321
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,126
and he's killing women.

322
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:40,029
Wait, you mean that girl
again, that Satanic thing?

323
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:44,500
Everyone's still
talking about that
at the courthouse.

324
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:47,270
It's not just her.

325
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,071
There's more.

326
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:51,941
There's more?
Really?

327
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,277
Yeah, well, we're not saying,

328
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,380
keeping it out
of the press, but...

329
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:02,051
we're thinking that
he's been doing this
a while.

330
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:04,387
Wow.

331
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:08,391
Yeah, so no need to go out.

332
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,360
You just have a drink here.

333
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:15,998
I can't meet a nice man at home.

334
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:20,336
That hurts me

335
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:24,941
when you speak to me
in a passive-
aggressive way.

336
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,243
I always talk straight to you.

337
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,179
Excuse me. I meant that
since you're married,

338
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,583
I need to be
considering my options
as a young woman.

339
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,619
I want things, Marty.

340
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,924
I want things, too.

341
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:44,527
Yeah, you just want your cake

342
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,930
and to eat it, too.

343
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,134
How good is cake

344
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:54,937
if you can't eat it?

345
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:57,907
Mmm.

346
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:07,583
Morning.

347
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:11,254
Hey, I think I might have
found something good.

348
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,289
Bunny ranch down south,

349
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,291
round Spanish Lake.

350
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,095
I thought we were
pulling old johns today.

351
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,098
Yeah, we should do this first.

352
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:25,968
What?

353
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,106
You wash up.
You got some pussy on you.

354
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:35,411
Key to a healthy marriage.

355
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,514
Oh, that's Maggie, huh?

356
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:41,684
Hey.

357
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,253
What's with your fucking nose?

358
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:48,257
Nothing, man.
Sorry. Forget it.

359
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:52,028
I get a connotation
being implied here

360
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,262
about my wife?

361
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:57,366
Are you saying that's wife,
that high tide you're
walking in with?

362
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,702
You got some idea

363
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,071
how my wife's pussy's
supposed to smell?

364
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:07,643
No, I just meant you're
wearing the same clothes
as you did yesterday,

365
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:11,080
coupled with the fact
that I ain't stupid.

366
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,216
Wasn't making no comment
as to the...

367
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:18,220
particularity of the scent.

368
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:22,325
You don't say fuck-all
about my wife.

369
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:25,127
Don't say her name.

370
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:29,732
You got
some self-loathing to do
this morning, that's fine,

371
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:33,035
but it ain't worth
losing your hands over.

372
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,571
How would that work, exactly?

373
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:41,077
Well, I'd just apply
a couple pounds of pressure,

374
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,980
snap your wrists.

375
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,450
You're Senior Detective.

376
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,654
Think I'm lying?

377
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,431
You got a specific
location for this place

378
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:39,201
or are we just gonna
wander around
till we find it?

379
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,103
We got some names.

380
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:45,241
I'm gonna have to ask
for directions.

381
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,313
Maybe you could just
follow your nose.

382
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,385
HART, VOICE-OVER:
Wherever he picked them up,

383
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,387
I mean, I won't lie.

384
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,489
However we left it,

385
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:03,359
he had some moves.

386
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:07,229
He knew a few Cis
from his narco days.

387
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:10,433
They knew these parts,
put us in touch

388
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:14,103
with some names,
people to talk to.

389
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,805
How we doing, boys?

390
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:16,705
Hey.
Hello.

391
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,675
We're looking for
a little bunny ranch

392
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:21,577
down around these parts.

393
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,779
Y'all know where
we could find it?

394
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,148
No, sir.
Never heard
about it?

395
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,384
Little whorehouse?
Nuh-uh.

396
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,085
Sorry, man.

397
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,820
Supposed to be stuck up
in the woods around here?

398
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,755
HART, VOICE-OVER:
And I'll tell you this,

399
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,392
Rust had about as sharp
an eye for weakness

400
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,161
as I ever seen.

401
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:47,570
I'll be right back.

402
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,144
It's my bad, boys.

403
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,614
Think we got started
on the wrong foot there.

404
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,382
Aah!

405
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,587
Aah!

406
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,591
You remember where that
little whorehouse is, huh?

407
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,726
¶

408
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:25,274
Take 353 South.

409
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,510
Gonna exit off the shoulder
before we get to the 14.

410
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:33,282
From there, we take
a dirt fishing road
to Bayou Chenault.

411
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,151
OK.

412
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,824
¶

413
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:14,623
That it?

414
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:17,359
Mm-hmm.

415
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:33,509
Cop car, y'all.

416
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:37,246
Just trying to get
some freebies.

417
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:50,960
I don't do no cops...

418
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:53,862
Hello, ma'am.

419
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:58,767
Martin Hart,
Rustin Cohle... State CID.

420
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:01,670
This your place?

421
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,572
It's my lease.

422
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:06,775
What is this, some kind
of hillbilly bunny ranch?

423
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:08,010
Excuse me?

424
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,812
You might want to talk
to Sheriff Bilson

425
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,981
'fore you start tossin'
accusations around.

426
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,949
No, I ain't got nothing
against hillbillies.

427
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:17,386
Relax.
That's not why
we're here. We, uh,

428
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,021
well, something
happened to a girl,

429
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,891
and we need
to know if any
of you knew her.

430
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:31,767
Yeah. That's Dori.

431
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,702
Somethin' happened?

432
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:38,307
You know about
that woman found
outside of Erath?

433
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,410
Oh, no.

434
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,947
Did something
happen to Dori?

435
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:50,386
Were you pretty good
friends with her?

436
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:53,756
She was nice to me when
I first came around.

437
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,825
Gave me tips and stuff.

438
00:29:56,827 --> 00:30:01,030
Tips? About what?

439
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:05,934
Nothin'.

440
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:09,705
You know, just how to be.

441
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:18,580
You got any idea where
she might have been staying
the last few weeks?

442
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,849
I don't.

443
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:23,552
Her ex is in prison.

444
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:27,089
I guess maybe
she got a new place.

445
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,658
She'd been going to church.

446
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,631
I was hoping maybe
she just turned
things around.

447
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:40,536
We're gonna need
to question any girls
might have known her.

448
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,839
That's a tougher ask
than you think.

449
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:46,508
Folks'll be stayin' away,
they hear y'all
are out here.

450
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,813
Well, ma'am,
it's the best way
to get us to leave.

451
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,552
You said she left a bag.

452
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,387
Yeah.

453
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,656
Can I see it?

454
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:07,629
Sure.

455
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,108
That girl's not 18.

456
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,478
The sheriff know you got
underage working here?

457
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,048
What do you know
about where
that girl's been,

458
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,916
where she come from?

459
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:30,486
You want to know
Beth's situation,

460
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,689
'fore she ran out on her uncle?

461
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,658
There are other places
she could go.

462
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,096
Such holy bullshit from you.

463
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:43,932
It's a woman's body, ain't it?

464
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:45,467
A woman's choice.

465
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:48,504
Well, she don't look
like a woman to me.

466
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,939
At that age, she is not equipped

467
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:52,875
to make those kind of choices.

468
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,778
But I guess
you don't give a shit
what kind of damage

469
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,481
she's doing to herself,
as long as you're
making your money.

470
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:02,184
Girls walk this earth
all the time

471
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,019
screwin' for free.

472
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:06,488
Now, why is it you add
business to the mix,

473
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,491
and boys like you can't
stand the thought?

474
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:10,793
I'll tell you.

475
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,529
It's 'cause suddenly
you don't own it

476
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,832
the way you thought you did.

477
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,438
Ahem.

478
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:26,942
Ma'am, you've both
been very helpful.

479
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,677
We'll be in touch.

480
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,747
Yes, thank you...

481
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,917
for your help.

482
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:46,762
Do something else.

483
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:01,210
That a down payment?

484
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:05,848
Is shitting on
any moment of decency

485
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,218
part of your job description?

486
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,789
"I closed my eyes
and saw the king

487
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,925
in yellow moving
through the forest."

488
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:20,062
This is her diary, Marty.

489
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,064
Believe this shit.

490
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,665
A girl that young.

491
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:28,103
You know the sheriff
has got a stake
in this place, too.

492
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,805
Fucking Christ.

493
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,974
"The king's children
were marked.

494
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:36,945
They became his angels."

495
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:44,953
The yellow king, Carcosa.

496
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,855
Nut job.

497
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:49,591
Fried her brain on
whatever she was on.

498
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,995
Sounds like she
didn't have much
to begin with.

499
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:56,698
Well, it reads like a fantasy.

500
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,735
What if he was
dosing her regular,

501
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,170
and over a period of time,
upping the dose

502
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:04,706
little by little
without her knowing it?

503
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:08,243
We should stay out here
today, check around

504
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:09,711
for johns

505
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,880
maybe knew her.

506
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:14,583
Look at this.

507
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:17,920
Oh, yeah.

508
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,255
Man, a lot of these type places.

509
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:24,126
Expect the flock
to canvass for 'em.

510
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,961
You know, we should go there.

511
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,563
Could be the church
everyone mentioned.

512
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,699
Well, let's check
around for johns
while we're out here

513
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,169
and pick up the church
on Monday.

514
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:38,974
GILBOUGH, VOICE-OVER:
Most of your stuff's
still redacted.

515
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,244
Now, what's Northshore?

516
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,682
Northshore Psychiatric Hospital,

517
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,816
Lubbock, Texas.

518
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,752
I spent 4 months there in '93.

519
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:54,222
You feel like talking
about that?
Well, sure.

520
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:57,326
Who gives a shit?

521
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:03,899
Sofia... my daughter.

522
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,969
She was on her tricycle

523
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:11,206
in our driveway. Um...

524
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:20,816
We lived down a...
where a little bend
in the road, and...

525
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:25,220
They said that...

526
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:31,393
Anyway, afterwards, uh,

527
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,262
Claire and I turned
on each other, you know?

528
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:38,133
We... we resented each other

529
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,970
being alive, you know?

530
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:48,877
I transferred
from robbery to narco.

531
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:52,347
Started hitting it,
you know, 24/7.

532
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:56,385
Street rips, knocking down
doors, and within 3 months

533
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:00,188
I was ripping off couriers
or ending up in a Ramada Inn

534
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,358
with a couple
of fuckin' eight-balls.

535
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,994
Oh, yeah.

536
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,165
Somewhere in there, Claire left,

537
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,001
and somewhere in there,

538
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,137
I emptied a 9 into a crankhead

539
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:20,008
for injecting his infant
daughter with crystal.

540
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:24,012
Said he was trying
to purify her.

541
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,182
State attorney gave me
one chance to stay out
of jail.

542
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:32,387
He said, "You can keep
your profile, but we want to
make you our wild man junkie."

543
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,957
So they did. They made me
a floater, like a trick.

544
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:41,163
You know, any agency
or department needed
a deep undercover narco,

545
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,330
they got me,

546
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:46,401
and there was no fuckin'
expiration date, baby.

547
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:49,371
And they kept you
out there for 4 years?

548
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,039
Mm-hmm.

549
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:53,175
And then, February of '93,

550
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:57,012
I killed 3 cartel men
in Port Houston.

551
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,248
I took three 25s
in the side and ended up

552
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,753
at Northshore Psychiatric
Hospital in Lubbock, Texas,

553
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,723
which is kind of funny
in its own rite...

554
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,192
Psych ward being
in Lubbock, Texas. Heh!

555
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:15,097
You ever been there?
They offered me
a psych pension.

556
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,165
Jackpot, right?

557
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,366
And I said no.

558
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:22,104
I said, "Put me
on homicide somewhere."

559
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,173
By then, I was owed
quite a few favors,

560
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:30,412
and, uh, Louisiana was
what they had.

561
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:38,920
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Yeah, for a long time after,
I... I didn't really sleep.

562
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:41,456
Nightmares, PTSD,

563
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:45,026
exhausted nerves, whatever.

564
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:18,794
Yeah.

565
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,798
Why homicide?

566
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:27,302
Oh, something
I saw at Northshore.

567
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:31,206
Quote from Corinthians.

568
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:38,980
"The body is not
one member, but many."

569
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:46,154
"Now are they many,
but... of one body."

570
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:49,524
What's that mean, though?

571
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:53,395
I was just trying to stay
a part of the body now. Heh!

572
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,464
The fishing
pole's not working.

573
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,400
Just ask Grandpa.
No.

574
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,269
Yeah.
Grandpa, I can't tell
if it's working.

575
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,973
You'll know, honey.
It'll yank at you hard.

576
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,175
OK.
Why don't you...

577
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:11,279
How's that case going?
The big one?

578
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:15,450
Working it, you know.

579
00:39:16,285 --> 00:39:20,055
Things like that didn't
happen these parts
when I was young.

580
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,524
People said "ma'am"
and "sir."

581
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,893
Families stayed together.

582
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:28,897
Yeah, that's how
it was, huh?

583
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,199
Not all the time.

584
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,868
There was more dignity.

585
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,472
Everyone wasn't out
in the street, yelling
about their rights.

586
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:41,076
Well, if things were so great,

587
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,045
they never would have changed.

588
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:44,980
Hmm.

589
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,014
Nothing is going on.

590
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,415
I'm just saying,
if there's a problem,

591
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,050
you can talk to me.
You know that.

592
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,953
If I have a problem
with someone, I talk
to them, Ma.

593
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:53,955
Well, you should be able
to talk to me.

594
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:56,658
I know what it's like
to be married to a man.

595
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,494
You think they're all
the same, huh?

596
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:01,363
I don't know why you're
so rude to me.

597
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,598
If you're frustrated,
don't take it out on me.

598
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,201
I think that you need
to get your cable fixed

599
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,970
and stop confusing me
with your soap operas.

600
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:11,907
Well, you beat up on
what you can't control.

601
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,075
Makes it bad for everybody else.

602
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:17,479
I don't know how.
I don't care.
Just try.

603
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,381
You do it.
I can't.

604
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,149
You have smaller fingers.

605
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:24,219
Macie, just do it.

606
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:27,589
So you're telling me
the world isn't
getting worse?

607
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,558
I seen kids today, all in black,

608
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,361
wearing makeup,
shit on their faces.

609
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:35,530
Everything's sex.

610
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:37,532
Clinton.

611
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:40,035
You know, throughout history,

612
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:44,239
I bet every old man
probably said
the same thing.

613
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,941
And old men die,

614
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,344
and the world keeps spinning.

615
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:52,981
How are the girls?
I got this lead...

616
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,318
I got this lead
I wanted to check up on.

617
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,452
I told you about it.

618
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,188
Maybe your dad
could bring you back.
No.

619
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,390
You didn't tell me
anything about it.

620
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:04,693
This is a family day.

621
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,128
I did tell you about it.

622
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,533
I mentioned it.
It's the new case.

623
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:17,272
OK, well, how about we
all head back, then?

624
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:20,508
Hmm. All right,
sweetheart.

625
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,243
Come on! Let's go!

626
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,979
My line's tangled.

627
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,580
Just paddle in.

628
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,682
OK. Told you!

629
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:30,385
Thanks for
the lovely afternoon.

630
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,054
Oh.

631
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,157
Thank you.

632
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,694
¶

633
00:41:59,448 --> 00:42:01,516
Afternoon, sir.

634
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:05,420
How you doing
today, officer?
I have a question for you.

635
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,589
You ever seen this girl?

636
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,690
You never seen her before?

637
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,093
Never before.
Hm-mmm, not here.

638
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:18,733
¶

639
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,619
Question.

640
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:41,222
I'm looking
for this young lady.
You recognize her?

641
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:44,492
I might need a memory jog.

642
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:46,795
Dora.
Young blonde?

643
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,431
Dora. Dora, Dora,
Dora, Dora.

644
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,698
Dora.

645
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,567
Have any guys come
around lately,

646
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,436
looking for anything
more than a good time?

647
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,839
You might be able
to remember for
a little more money?

648
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,240
I might.

649
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:01,342
You might?

650
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:05,246
¶

651
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:11,252
Years we've been through this.

652
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:13,488
Sweetheart, listen to me.

653
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,524
There is nowhere else
I want to be.

654
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,861
I wonder if you even
know you're lying.

655
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,596
Oh, come on!

656
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,298
Shh.

657
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,432
Bad enough,

658
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:28,103
the shit I got to wade
through on a daily basis,

659
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,705
bring me this
"feel bad for me" crap

660
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:34,709
when I work 30 hours
straight and spent
the weekend

661
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:37,512
listening to
your dad's bullshit?

662
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,148
I come home, the one place

663
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,817
where there's supposed
to be peace and calm,

664
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,786
and you throw this shit...
Who told you that?

665
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,755
It's not always that way.
It's not supposed to be.

666
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:52,293
It's supposed to be
what I want, it's
supposed to help me.

667
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:53,628
We do help you!

668
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,397
All the goddamn time!

669
00:43:57,766 --> 00:44:00,568
OK, well, what do you
want me to say?

670
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,506
You want me to talk about
the woman, had antlers?

671
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,375
Do you want me to tell you
about the kids disappearing,

672
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:12,614
and maybe you'll stop
with the "poor me"
little whiny bullshit?

673
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:16,417
Is that what you're saying, hmm?

674
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:19,454
That I'm trying to make
you feel bad for me?

675
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:23,291
Is that really how you
want to play this?

676
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,259
No, honey.

677
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,428
I think you're
the greatest woman
I ever met,

678
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,832
and you're the
greatest thing that
ever happened to me.

679
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,768
But, yeah, you know, sometimes

680
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:37,372
I think you might
have a penchant

681
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,706
for self-pity.

682
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,576
And right now,
I need you to be strong

683
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,879
so that I can do my job.

684
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:49,517
You have developed
some sort of
selective deafness.

685
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,255
You used to not be such
a chicken shit, I swear.

686
00:44:56,792 --> 00:45:00,929
Even your mom thinks
you're a ball-buster.

687
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:12,540
Tell the girls dinner.

688
00:45:18,214 --> 00:45:20,548
Mmm.

689
00:45:24,587 --> 00:45:27,855
You don't have
a mommy or daddy anymore.

690
00:45:27,857 --> 00:45:31,426
Yours just died in an accident.

691
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,927
How?

692
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:35,396
In a car accident.
Someone...

693
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:38,800
Dinnertime, kids.
Go to the kitchen.

694
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,501
Are you coming?

695
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:42,904
Yeah, of course.
I'm starving.

696
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,805
Really?

697
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:48,409
- Yeah, really.
- Good.

698
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:05,293
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
You know how I think
about my daughter now?

699
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:08,863
You know what...

700
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:12,300
what she was spared?

701
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:18,306
Sometimes I feel grateful.

702
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,412
Doctors said

703
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,414
she didn't feel a thing.

704
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,284
Went straight into a coma,

705
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,854
and then, somewhere in that...

706
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:37,692
blackness, she slipped off
into another,

707
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,728
deeper kind.

708
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:48,736
Isn't that a beautiful way
to go out? Heh!

709
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:52,740
Painlessly,

710
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:56,311
as a happy child.

711
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:59,747
Hmm.

712
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:03,851
Yeah, trouble with...

713
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:06,387
dying later is you've
already grown up.

714
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:10,024
Heh! Damage is done.
It's too late.

715
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:13,761
You got kids?

716
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:16,931
Mmm.

717
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:21,369
Well, you got the hubris

718
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,838
it must take to...

719
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,775
yank a soul out of nonexistence

720
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:31,546
into this meat.

721
00:47:31,814 --> 00:47:37,952
And to force a life
into this thresher.

722
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:44,726
And as for my daughter,
she, uh...

723
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,396
she spared me the sin

724
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,132
of being a father.

725
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,700
Hey, Cathleen,

726
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:53,601
you little vixen.

727
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:57,138
Any chance
of some coffee?

728
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,140
Of course.
OK.

729
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,541
Who are these guys?

730
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:04,445
Some assholes
Quesada brought in.
Coffee on its way.

731
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:05,980
Hey, morning, Marty.
Hey.

732
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:08,916
Major's
introducing me.
New flying squad.

733
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:12,820
You know
Mark Daughtry,
Ted Bertrand.

734
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,489
Daughtry.

735
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,757
Ted.

736
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,558
Jimmy Dufrene.

737
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,393
What's up?

738
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:22,663
We've been tasked
with investigating crimes
with possible occult links.

739
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:25,600
There's been a rash
of animal mutilations,

740
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,567
cemeteries defiled.

741
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:29,103
And they want
to see what we have
on the Lange case.
Uh-huh.

742
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:31,873
Well, this task force is
important to the commander

743
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,508
and to the governor's office.

744
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,677
You know, a lot of people
are concerned about it.

745
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,613
You know, me, I don't
see the connection

746
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,916
between two dead cats
and a murdered woman.

747
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,652
But then, I'm from Texas.

748
00:48:44,654 --> 00:48:45,586
Heh!

749
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:47,188
We're not stepping
on your toes, Marty.

750
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,758
We just got the mandate.
We got to compare notes
with what you got.

751
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,526
Yeah.

752
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,428
Here you are,
Detective.
No. Oh.

753
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,196
Thanks, Cathleen.
You got it.

754
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,899
Xerox all you want.

755
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:01,736
Make you feel like good cops.

756
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:11,746
You two, my office.

757
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,584
Cohle, we got
a new rule around here,
especially for you.

758
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,487
You got an opinion
about anything,

759
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,988
you hold on to it.

760
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,058
You hold on to it
or you tell it to Marty.

761
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,627
Otherwise, button
your big, fat mouth.

762
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:30,698
However smart you are,
you're not as smart
as you think.

763
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,600
Be serious, boss.

764
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,969
This God-bothering shit.

765
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,972
It's a political
circle-jerk.
You know this.

766
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,007
Is this a place you live?

767
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:41,843
Where are you, huh?

768
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,813
You had anything
in the last weeks?
You got a suspect?

769
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:46,848
Give us some more guys

770
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,616
to follow up KAs, track records.

771
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:52,920
No, our bosses don't want you
at all, you understand?

772
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:53,855
I don't want you.

773
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:58,493
You are upright only by
the grace of this man's
reputation.

774
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,227
Goddamn, Cohle.

775
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:04,532
How many ways
are there for me to say,
"Shut the fuck up"?

776
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,069
I mean, we work
under command, right?

777
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:13,574
Now, our betters want
a public, high-profile
show of response.

778
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:14,842
Shit, I got a state senator,

779
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:17,812
he's trying to label
Satanic graffiti
as a hate crime.

780
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:22,550
That has nothing to do
with our DB, and that's
the fact of it.

781
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,551
OK, OK. Fine.

782
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,152
Let's say that's true,
all right?

783
00:50:25,154 --> 00:50:28,122
Let's say that you guys get
the case all to yourselves.

784
00:50:28,124 --> 00:50:31,259
You ever solve a murder, been in
the red more than a week?

785
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:35,196
You ever clear one where
two rounds of questions didn't
hand you the fucking answer?

786
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,033
Oh, come on...
No, no, you got leads,
you got a timeline.

787
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,902
You know what I got?
I got a whodunit

788
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,236
where my two detectives
are stalling,

789
00:50:42,238 --> 00:50:47,108
and I got a brand-new
task force wants to
take it off our hands.

790
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:47,909
We have a lead...

791
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:51,112
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Fuck off, Cohle.

792
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,083
Christ.

793
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:58,886
It's your call.

794
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:01,055
You want to dump this one off?

795
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,190
You know, I'd think about it,
given the spotlight.

796
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:08,596
You know, Teddy Bertrand's
a good detective.
You know him.

797
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:14,068
Well, you're a smart-ass
with your mouth shut.

798
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,870
I was just gonna say

799
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,672
we've got a lead on a church.

800
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,774
Our vic was spending
a lot of time there.

801
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,910
That's where we were headed.
It could be the break we need.

802
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:25,980
Inside, whatever they're
putting over you,

803
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,649
how much more time
could you get us?

804
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:30,851
Right now, it's up
for discussion, but,

805
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:33,020
you know, Tuttle's lighting
a fire under this.

806
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:35,623
Without a suspect,
they're just gonna

807
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:39,694
stop asking questions, Marty,
and they're gonna give orders.

808
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,795
That's that.

809
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,097
Give us the rest of the month

810
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,032
before they lump it
into whatever

811
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:49,070
the play is with
the task force, yeah?

812
00:51:51,106 --> 00:51:52,106
I'll try.

813
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:56,177
Two weeks, and then you two
start catching again.

814
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,012
Yeah.

815
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:01,682
HART, VOICE-OVER:
Let's cut to the point.

816
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:04,085
As the crow flies,
y'all are wanting to ask

817
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:08,189
about that big throwdown
in the woods, yeah?

818
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,023
Eventually, sure.

819
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,325
Right now,
we're just trying
to track the case.

820
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:14,895
How Cohle worked it, especially.

821
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:20,067
Which indicates you think
I'm too thick to realize

822
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:23,404
that y'all are trying
to jam somebody up.

823
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:27,375
You're on to something new.

824
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:32,313
So Cohle
didn't want to give it
to the task force.

825
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,849
Did you?

826
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:41,856
No, I did not.

827
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,863
¶

828
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:55,269
It don't make sense.
There is nothing out here.

829
00:52:55,704 --> 00:53:01,042
According to this map,
it should be within
these few miles.

830
00:53:03,812 --> 00:53:06,247
Well... ahem... I guess
if it's one of those

831
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:10,117
tent revival places,
they move around.

832
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:11,919
Yeah.

833
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,089
Tents usually do.

834
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:20,695
There's no date on this
flyer, which is strange.

835
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,902
Something up there.

836
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,950
PAPANIA, VOICE-OVER:
Wait, wait, back up.

837
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:20,020
Are you saying you were
hallucinating on the job?

838
00:54:20,022 --> 00:54:20,755
Mmm.

839
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,290
No. I mean, I could
always tell what was real

840
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:24,258
or what wasn't, you know.

841
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:29,830
So when I'd see things,
like, man, I'd just...
... roll with it.

842
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:32,199
You still see things?

843
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:35,202
No.

844
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,806
No, they stopped altogether

845
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,976
after I was clean
a couple years.

846
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,379
No numbers
on this place.

847
00:54:45,814 --> 00:54:49,984
Fire must have happened
a long time ago.

848
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:24,819
OK.
Place is trashed.

849
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,823
This ain't no kinda anything.

850
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:36,230
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
Yeah, back then, the visions.

851
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:42,036
Yeah, most of the time,
I was convinced
that I'd lost it.

852
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:45,439
Marty?

853
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,023
COHLE, VOICE-OVER:
But there were other times...

854
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:13,000
I thought I was mainlining
the secret truth
of the universe.

855
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:16,403
