1
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,800
Here she is, hon.

2
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,600
Thanks for letting me stay close.

3
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,280
Absolutely.
Just please don't tell anyone.

4
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,240
Sign here.

5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,520
Be careful. It's hot.

6
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,040
The doctor says we have to
limit contact to ten minutes.

7
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,520
He's still in withdrawal,
so go easy on him. Okay?

8
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
All right.

9
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
Did you know Clark from before?

10
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Otis?

11
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Did you know him?

12
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
No.

13
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,960
I knew about Tsalal
but I didn't know the men there.

14
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,000
What did he want with you?

15
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,640
He was asking
how I survived my injuries.

16
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,000
And how did you?

17
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,200
Fuck, man, does it really
look to you like I did?

18
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
All right.

19
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,600
Where's Clark now?

20
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
I don't know.

21
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
But you said...

22
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
You said that he was...

23
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,200
he was going back
to the Night Country.

24
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
- I did?
- Yeah. At the dredge.

25
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,520
- What'd that mean?
- I don't know.

26
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,240
He was crazy as shit, man.

27
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,680
All right. What else did he say?

28
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
"She's awake."

29
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
<i>She's awake.</i>

30
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,520
He said that a bunch of times.

31
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,880
He said, "I have to hide.

32
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
She's out there."

33
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,560
Creepy motherfucker.

34
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
All right.

35
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,120
Let's talk about back then.

36
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,560
What happened
on the day of your injuries?

37
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,960
Shit was 30 years ago.

38
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
What does it matter?

39
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
It matters.

40
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Tell me.

41
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,960
There was a cave in.

42
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,800
Men died trapped in the ice.

43
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,800
We ran out for help

44
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,280
but there was a blizzard.

45
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
I heard...

46
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Otis?

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Something...

48
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,840
Screaming. Howling.

49
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
The other men started
following the sound.

50
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
I tried to go after them, and then...

51
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Nothing.

52
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,880
Nothing? What does that mean?

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,640
I woke up in the hospital.
My eyes were burned.

54
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,280
My ears, all gone to shit.

55
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
All right.

56
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
So...

57
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,840
this the cave system
you were mapping?

58
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
Can you point to
where the entrance is?

59
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,680
It's right at the end of Bear Creek.

60
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,440
Here. But you can't go on your own.

61
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,920
The caves collapse.

62
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,040
That ice,
it's like crawling on thin glass.

63
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah. Well, you're gonna
take us there.

64
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I can't like this.

65
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,920
You're gonna be better in a few days.

66
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
That's not what I'm saying.

67
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,200
You can help me get well.

68
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,640
I can't get you heroin.
You know that.

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Your time's up.

70
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,240
I found the entrance.

71
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,960
You sure you're up for this?

72
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Yeah.

73
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,920
You want to talk about it?

74
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
No.

75
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
All right.

76
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
What's this?

77
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,320
That's your bag.

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,640
Please don't come back tonight.

79
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,600
- No. Hold, Kayla, you can't...
- Please, just go.

80
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,000
No... Kayla.

81
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,080
You can't just kick me out, Kayla.
This is my fucking family, too!

82
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,040
So, this cave is
on Silver Sky property?

83
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,840
Yeah, they own the entire region.

84
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
How's Leah?

85
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
She's got a girlfriend.

86
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,960
So? I've had a bunch of those.

87
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Yeah, I guess.

88
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
Girlfriend thing is okay.
It's just...

89
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
Lee's turned into one of these...

90
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,840
crazy radicals.

91
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,160
Splashing the black paint
all over the place.

92
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,280
They're not crazy.

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,040
It's the fucking water.

94
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
- It's poisoning them.
- I know, all right? I know.

95
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Is this it?

96
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,960
Probably. It looks like
somebody blew the entryway shut.

97
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,280
Because, of course, they fucking did.

98
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
- Fuck!
- Hey!

99
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,760
Fuck this shit!

100
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,000
<i>There is no love</i>

101
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,360
<i>None lost, none found</i>

102
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,360
<i>There is no God</i>

103
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,680
<i>No hallowed ground</i>

104
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,160
<i>You are forever bound...</i>

105
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,840
<i>To lose</i>

106
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,520
<i>So what's...</i>

107
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,960
<i>The use</i>

108
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,880
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

109
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,440
We were here before! Gonna stay...

110
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

111
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,280
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

112
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

113
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,160
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

114
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,520
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

115
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,920
- Land back! Water back!
- Land back! Water back!

116
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
- Land back! Water back!
- Land back! Water back!

117
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,000
- Land back! Water back!
- Land back! Water back!

118
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,720
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

119
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,920
We were here before!
Gonna stay when you're gone!

120
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
We were here before!

121
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,000
<i>Stand back!</i>

122
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Stand back!

123
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
Land back! Water back!

124
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
Land back! Water back!

125
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,040
Stand back! Get back!

126
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Don't touch me!

127
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
- Get off of me!
- Get off me!

128
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Hello?

129
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,560
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- Hey.</i>

130
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Hey.

131
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
What... what are you doing?

132
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,120
Oh, I'm just doing some work
on my truck.

133
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
What's... what's going on?

134
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Kayla...

135
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,280
she thinks we need
a little time apart.

136
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
And...

137
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,120
I was wondering
if it's not too much trouble

138
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,480
could I... could I crash with you?

139
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Yeah.

140
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,120
It ain't exactly the Radisson,
but come on over.

141
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,240
<i>Okay. Great.</i>

142
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,520
Probably like five minutes away.

143
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
<i>Okay.</i>

144
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Okay.

145
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,760
- Land back! Water back!
- Land back! Water back!

146
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,040
- Land back! Water back!
- Land back! Water back!

147
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
- Land back! Water back!
- Land back! Water back!

148
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,280
Hey! Move! Let him go!

149
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,320
Let him go, now. Move back.
Get down. Move.

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Hey. No. Break it up.

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,560
- Land back! Water back!
- Land back! Water back!

152
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,200
Get over here, you fucking bitch!

153
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,480
Get off of me, you fucking pig!

154
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Sheri!

155
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
Sheri!

156
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Sheri!

157
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Stay back!

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,680
Hey! She's a fucking kid!

159
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
You okay?

160
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,400
Fuck the police!

161
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,040
What the fuck, Navarro?

162
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Come on, Ted.

163
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
It was a protest.
What do you want from me?

164
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,680
<i>Kate's fucking furious
and wants answers.</i>

165
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Well, why me?

166
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,520
It's not even our jurisdiction.
It's the troopers' job.

167
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
<i>She wants you there.</i>

168
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
<i>You're the Chief of Police,
for Christ's sakes.</i>

169
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,240
Fine, I'll go to her office.

170
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,560
<i>- I'll see you there.</i>
- Wait.

171
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
You're gonna be there?

172
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
What the fuck is going on, Ted?

173
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,880
<i>Just fucking be there.</i>

174
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Fine.

175
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,280
- Navarro.
<i>- I got some shit news for you.</i>

176
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Really?

177
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,520
'Cause I fucking will.

178
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
All right.

179
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
What'd she say?

180
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
How's your head?

181
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Fine. Stopped bleeding.

182
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
That's a shame.

183
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,160
Put on your seatbelt.

184
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
What the fuck were you doing there?

185
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,280
What the fuck were you doing there?

186
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,720
I mean, whose side are you on?

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Liz, I get it. But you know the shit
that's happening in this town.

188
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,240
What were you thinking?

189
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,000
Jesus Christ, I'm actually
feeling for Danvers right now.

190
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,560
Just take me home.

191
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,280
You're not going home.

192
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,360
What are you talking about?

193
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,760
She wants me to take you in.

194
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,160
Are you fucking kidding me?

195
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,560
Fucking pigs. All of you.

196
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,040
- Hey.
- Hey. I was looking for you.

197
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,280
Did you know that Leah
was going to that protest?

198
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,176
- No... Is she okay?
- 'Cause if you're covering for her

199
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,256
- I swear to God...
- No, no.

200
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,560
I'm not... in the house.
Kayla kicked me out.

201
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,720
Wow, that's...

202
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,920
That's... that's hard.
Do you need a place to stay, or..

203
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,840
No. No, moving in with you

204
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,600
would basically fast track me
to a divorce, so...

205
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,280
It's not all bad, though.

206
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,960
Here. Take a look at this.

207
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
What's this?

208
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,520
That is the thing
you've been looking for.

209
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
Liz.

210
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,800
- Don't look. No.
- What's going on?

211
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,120
- Coop!
- Yeah?

212
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,520
- Book me, will you?
- Yes, ma'am.

213
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,560
- Seriously?
- Hey. What am I looking at?

214
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,600
The LLC that paid the grants
that fund the station.

215
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,880
- Yeah.
- I followed their tax returns

216
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,480
and they trace back to Tuttle United.

217
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
You remember them?

218
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,640
Yeah, the palm oil,
video games, cruise lines.

219
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,520
Yeah. And four deals in Canada

220
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,680
and two in China
with Norbank Securities

221
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
which is a founding partner of...

222
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,720
Silver Sky Mining.

223
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
This is evidence.

224
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That means...

225
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,680
the mine bankrolls Tsalal

226
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,680
and then Tsalal pushes out
bogus pollution numbers for them.

227
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,680
It's definitely possible.

228
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,560
Hey, sorry about the divorce.

229
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,440
- It's not a divorce, Chief.
- Whatever.

230
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,960
You know I hate Pepsi, Prior.

231
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
Yeah, well, the machine
was out of Mountain Dew, so...

232
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Fine.

233
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
You okay?

234
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Yeah.

235
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Thanks.

236
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
What about Sheri?

237
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,320
- She okay?
- Fuck Sheri.

238
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,240
Fuck Sheri? Why?

239
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
Heard you got kicked out.

240
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
You knew?

241
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,160
She couldn't stop crying, Prior.

242
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,560
You're an asshole.

243
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
You know, she told me about
when she first fell in love with you.

244
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,040
She saw you play.

245
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,880
Senior year? Finals?

246
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,080
No. This game you lost.

247
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
You fell on your ass

248
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,320
- and then...
- Huey Larson scored.

249
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
She said that
everyone gave you so much shit

250
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,280
and you just had this stupid,
idiot smile on your face.

251
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
And then she found out that
Huey's dad had had a stroke.

252
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,880
You fell on purpose, didn't you?

253
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
No.

254
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,120
She just misses that guy, Prior.

255
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,800
Don't let Liz ruin that guy, okay?

256
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,360
She's not good
with people she cares about.

257
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
You're not really keeping her
in there, are you?

258
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,960
She needs to get
how vulnerable she's making herself.

259
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,800
I mean, come on, Liz.

260
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
She's just young.

261
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,680
She's trying to do the right thing.

262
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
No, she's not.

263
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,920
She's just doing it to piss me off.

264
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,360
You know what? Don't come
telling me how to handle my shit.

265
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,216
You know how many
phone calls I had to field

266
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,440
about you kicking the shit
out of another trooper today?

267
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,520
That asshole hit Leah.

268
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,960
Yeah. He's fucking suspended.

269
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
You okay?

270
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Not okay.

271
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Where are you going?

272
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,920
Going to meet Kate McKittrick
and Connelly about the protests.

273
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
What? Why?
That's the troopers' job.

274
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Exactly.

275
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
You know what?

276
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm kind of glad that
I'm going over there

277
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
'cause I have something
I want to discuss with her.

278
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Look at that.

279
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
You're gonna like it.

280
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Hi.

281
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,240
- Can I take you to the...
- I'm good, thanks.

282
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,800
Liz. Thanks for coming.

283
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,040
Yeah, so first of all

284
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,080
we all know that...

285
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,360
the mess at the protest,
that's on troopers.

286
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
Running a shitty outfit.

287
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,360
Not on APF. It's not on me.

288
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,680
- So, as long as we're here...
- As long as we're here...

289
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Shall we?

290
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,600
So, this came from
our security cameras up north.

291
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,280
It's 9.15 this morning,
during the lead up to the riot.

292
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,720
Why are you and Trooper Navarro

293
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,640
in a remote section
of Silver Sky land?

294
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,760
It's just a question, Liz.

295
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
It's police business.

296
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
It has to do
with the Tsalal investigation.

297
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,840
On Silver Sky property.

298
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,120
What led you to that location?

299
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Well...

300
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,920
we got some intel about the area.

301
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,240
There's an abandoned cave

302
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,880
and we located an engineer
who had some information

303
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,400
about Raymond Clark.

304
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,840
The missing scientist.

305
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,640
Who's the engineer?

306
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,720
Otis Heiss.

307
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,640
Well, the good news for you
and Mr. Heiss is that

308
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,480
it turns out,
this isn't a murder case after all.

309
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,000
All right, what do you mean?

310
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
What does she mean?

311
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,000
Forensics came back.
It was a weather event.

312
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,600
Slab avalanche.

313
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,960
They're sudden and can move
at a hundred miles an hour.

314
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,240
An avalanche? Come on.

315
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
It was the last sunset
before the long night.

316
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,360
Theory is they went outside
to watch it.

317
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,856
What about the ears
and the eyes and...

318
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,520
Ruptured eardrums
and damaged soft tissue

319
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,080
are common during a flash freeze.

320
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,640
- Yeah, okay...
- And... And...

321
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,680
fatal hypothermia
causes hallucinations.

322
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
You're... you're saying
the official word from Anchorage

323
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
is they froze to death?

324
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Well...

325
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,480
I know it's a relief for all of us

326
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,400
that there's not some killer
out there on the loose.

327
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,776
Well, that's convenient, isn't it?

328
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,320
'Cause the mine bankrolls Tsalal.

329
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Well, of course.

330
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,080
I mean, we donate to a lot of
worthy research projects

331
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,080
and Tsalal is in our own backyard.

332
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,896
You know what?
Their work was an incredible...

333
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,040
Yeah, incredible work.

334
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,120
But the funding

335
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,160
is for an independent outfit that
verifies your pollution numbers.

336
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,600
You don't think
that's a conflict of interest?

337
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,520
Well, I'll have to look into it,
but I...

338
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I don't see what possible relation
it could have with a weather event.

339
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,800
Oh, fuck you
and your fucking weather event.

340
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,416
You know what? I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

341
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry
Bill's such a terrible lay.

342
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,640
You have my sympathies.

343
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,600
Are you out of your fucking mind?

344
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,520
The Annie K case, remember?

345
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Look, that location, the cave

346
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,040
that's where she was killed.

347
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
The two cases are linked.

348
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
We're almost there.

349
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,280
Three years ago,
you and your partner

350
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,680
Evangeline Navarro

351
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,240
responded to a domestic violence call
in Linden Village.

352
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,840
William Wheeler, 43, white male.

353
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,440
It was a murder-suicide.

354
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,880
Except there was no suicide,
was there?

355
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,520
- I don't know what you're talking...
- Stop.

356
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
This case is closed, Liz.

357
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
What happened to you?

358
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,680
A woman was murdered.

359
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,280
Go home to your daughter.

360
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,600
- Hey, Henry.
- Hey.

361
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,240
How's Peter?

362
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
Well...

363
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,520
Kids shouldn't be getting married
that young, you know?

364
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,400
Danvers is not gonna let this go.

365
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,600
She's looking for the location
of the Kowtok murder.

366
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,720
She can't find that cave.

367
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,680
I don't know
what I can do about that.

368
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,680
The engineer, Otis Heiss.

369
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,360
He could take her there.

370
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,480
You should take this to Connelly.

371
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,720
Connelly is a political animal.
He's weak.

372
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,320
And he's fucking her.

373
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,280
Okay, well, I did something for you.

374
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,400
- You broke your promise.
- Yeah. We paid you well.

375
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,560
That money's gone.
You promised me chief of police.

376
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,200
Look, I couldn't have known
Danvers was gonna be exiled here.

377
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,120
The bureaucracy was a mess.
I had no control.

378
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,240
This time it's different.

379
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm not a killer.

380
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,720
I didn't say those words.
Do you understand me?

381
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,280
- I need to hear you say it.
- You didn't ask me to kill anyone.

382
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,320
Otis Heiss is a drug addict.

383
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,720
Drug addicts get lost.

384
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,160
I don't need to know the details.

385
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,280
I don't know where to find him.

386
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,560
So, you follow Danvers.
She'll lead you to him.

387
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
You do this and the job is yours.

388
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,600
I'm counting on you, Henry.

389
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,960
You okay?

390
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Yeah.

391
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Yeah.

392
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Your grandma okay?

393
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,800
Yeah. I'm just covering for her.

394
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,440
She went to the dentist in Fairbanks.

395
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,840
What about you? Are you okay?

396
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,240
Kenny, she's here.

397
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,920
I found her. Come here.

398
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Evangeline.

399
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,360
Kenny, tell her what you told me.

400
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,920
- Tell me what?
- Well, my grandpa

401
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,040
he told me to walk away
when I saw those.

402
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
People would leave them
as a warning for hunters.

403
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
What kind of warning?

404
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Places where the ice
would swallow them whole.

405
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,200
Underground ice caves?

406
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Yeah.

407
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,080
Truth is, sometimes we kids
would crack the ice on purpose

408
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,360
to go down into the caves.

409
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
My grandma, she was so pissed
when she found out.

410
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,440
Said the Night Country
was gonna take us.

411
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,680
I know how to get us in the caves.

412
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,200
It's so obvious. We just have to find
the highest point on the cave maps.

413
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,720
That's how you get into
an underground cave system.

414
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,896
- Navarro...
- You find the place

415
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,160
closest to the surface,
and you crack in.

416
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,120
Otis can point it out for us,
and we can just...

417
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,040
- Listen... to me.
- You listen.

418
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,400
This is big, Liz.
This connects everything.

419
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,520
People call those caves
the Night Country

420
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,240
- and then every...
- No. It's over.

421
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,520
What are you talking about?

422
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,040
Forensics came back
on the Tsalal men.

423
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,600
It was a freak weather event.

424
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
What?

425
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,720
- Are you kidding?
- Look.

426
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,480
It doesn't matter what you believe.

427
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,000
Connelly's shutting us down.

428
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Fine.

429
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Fuck Tsalal.

430
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,401
- Annie's a whole separate case.
- He knows about Wheeler.

431
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
What did he say?

432
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
He knows.

433
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
All of it.

434
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
I don't even know how.

435
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,480
You know what? I don't even care.

436
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,296
If I can find where Annie died...

437
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,856
What do you think you're gonna find?
A signed confession on the wall?

438
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,360
A murder weapon, DNA

439
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,696
- anything that's gonna
- Even if you found something

440
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,776
- help us find...
- he's gonna block it.

441
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
No, you gotta stop now!

442
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Stop?

443
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,960
What are you even saying?

444
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,800
It ends here, all right? It's over.

445
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
No.

446
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,880
I'm gonna go talk to Otis.

447
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,480
- He can point it out on the map
- No.

448
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,080
- And he can find it for us.
- You're not gonna go to Otis

449
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,920
because The Lighthouse isn't gonna
let you in after what you did.

450
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,720
You just gotta...
please, you just... it's over.

451
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Just let it go.

452
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Just let her go.

453
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
It's time.

454
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
No.

455
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,080
You carry her now.

456
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,280
Like I did, all this time.

457
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,040
You carry Annie.

458
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Every day.

459
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,800
You're leaving her. Alone.

460
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,640
In that cave.

461
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,880
In the dark.

462
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
You.

463
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,720
She's yours now.

464
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,160
Is Liz letting me go?

465
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
Fuck Liz.

466
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,640
- Hey.
- Hey.

467
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,800
What the hell was that all about?

468
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,920
It's just family stuff, you know?

469
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
You...

470
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
You need anything?

471
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,360
Me? No. I'm...

472
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,640
I...

473
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,960
I was thinking about that time
when you were nine

474
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
when you were skating
and you fell through the ice.

475
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,040
You know, I...

476
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,800
I don't really remember
a lot of that. So...

477
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,680
You don't? Oh, I do.

478
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,720
I wake up dreaming of it sometimes.

479
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,920
One second you were there,
I turned around

480
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,320
and boom, you were gone.

481
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,560
Under the ice. Current took you.

482
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,560
I had to run on ahead of you

483
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,840
and try to break through
with an ice axe.

484
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,960
I kept hacking until I got through,
and then I pulled you out.

485
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,520
Then on the way to the hospital

486
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,440
I knew I had to keep you awake.

487
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,040
Just keep you awake.

488
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,840
Felt like we were
driving for days. Just...

489
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
I was...

490
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,400
Family stuff, right?

491
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,400
Fuckin' family.

492
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
There!

493
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,040
I think that... that should do it.

494
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Thanks, Rose.

495
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,600
Do you want me to stay with you?

496
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well, the weather is shit,
so don't be long.

497
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,560
They're saying we're getting
a category four.

498
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,440
Here you go, baby girl.

499
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,480
I thought if you wanted
to be in the ocean...

500
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,400
<i>Evangeline...</i>

501
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,360
<i>Listen...</i>

502
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Lie down!

503
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Towards me.

504
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Lie down.

505
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,560
Slowly.

506
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Towards me.

507
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Take that.

508
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,640
You're all right.

509
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,360
You're okay.

510
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,880
What the fuck were you doing
walking into the sea like that?

511
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,960
I called you back.
Didn't you hear me?

512
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Peter's not here.

513
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
I'm looking for Leah.

514
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,120
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

515
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Please.

516
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Lee?

517
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,760
What do you want?

518
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,520
Why are you doing this?

519
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,600
Just to mess with me?

520
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,240
Not everything's about you, Liz.

521
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,800
What the fuck?

522
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,920
- Is that bruises?
- Don't worry about it.

523
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,880
You could've been killed.

524
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,440
Don't be dramatic.

525
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,440
It's not like you.

526
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,600
I'm working on this case.

527
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
Annie K?

528
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,880
Everything she fought for
is still happening.

529
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,016
Do you know how many
stillbirths there were

530
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,680
in the villages
in the past three months?

531
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,280
- I know about Aviaq Carter's...
- Nine.

532
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,200
That's nine moms, Liz.

533
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Leah...

534
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,160
will you please just come home
for New Year's?

535
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,080
Come on. Please.

536
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Liz?

537
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,880
You know, I haven't given up on you.

538
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,560
It'll be another three months
before we can dig any graves.

539
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
So, they're stuck here.

540
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,400
At least they keep
each other company.

541
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,720
Especially the little ones.

542
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
You want me to stay?

543
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,680
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

544
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Hey, Chief.

545
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,680
Did you talk to Connelly?

546
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,680
In my office.
Bring that thing, now.

547
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,600
Close the door.

548
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,520
Who'd you talk to about Wheeler?

549
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
No one.

550
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,680
Well, Connelly knows,
'cause your father knows.

551
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,760
What's the password to your computer?

552
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,160
- Is it your birthday?
- No.

553
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Oh, let me guess. It's Darwin's.

554
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,800
How many times I gotta tell you?

555
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Your father only seems
like an idiot. Sit.

556
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Sit!

557
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,640
What do you think you know
about Wheeler?

558
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,520
Fine.

559
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,960
You want to do it differently?

560
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,040
You make up the questions.

561
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,680
You just had to know, right?
You had to keep digging.

562
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,560
That's what Hank found in there.

563
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,040
I bet he was asking you.

564
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,840
What do they know about the mine?

565
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,520
And then bingo,
his kid gives him a little present.

566
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,896
- I wasn't digging for anything...
- Yeah, go.

567
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,136
- Ask me questions. Question me.
- I don't wanna do that, Chief.

568
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,000
- Ask me questions.
- No. I don't want to.

569
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,000
You wanted to know.
Ask me the fucking questions.

570
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,600
Ask the questions, Prior!

571
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
All right, fine.

572
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,200
How many times did you and Navarro
visit the Wheeler household?

573
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
I'm not sure.

574
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
- Three.
- Ten.

575
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,720
Ten times you were there.

576
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,360
And what was the situation

577
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,840
- on those visits to the Wheeler?
- Wrong question. Ask again.

578
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Ask again.

579
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,160
- Did Wheeler ever show any signs...
- Wrong question.

580
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,096
Did you think Wheeler was capable...

581
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,680
Wrong question. Ask again.

582
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,360
Did you know
Wheeler was left-handed?

583
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
No.

584
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
I did not.

585
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,440
What direction are the blows in?

586
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,600
Right to left. All of 'em.

587
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,360
This is her senior yearbook photo.

588
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,440
You see the birthmark, right?

589
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,120
Someone flipped

590
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,320
every single photo in her file.

591
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
That bullet wound...

592
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,440
on his right-hand side.

593
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,360
Everything else, the ballistics,
forensics report

594
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,160
it's all gone in the flood.

595
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,320
Ask the real question, Prior.

596
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Go on.

597
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,160
Did you and Navarro

598
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,040
shoot William Wheeler

599
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,240
and make it look like a suicide?

600
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,520
You see?

601
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,680
Smart as you are...

602
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,480
you need to learn
when to stop asking questions.

603
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,800
You can't stay at Hank's.

604
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,480
This is to the shack

605
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,480
in the backyard of my house.

606
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,960
I don't have to see you.
You don't have to see me.

607
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,480
Just don't be stupid. Stupider.

608
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
Take the key.

609
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,040
- Pete?
- Get the fuck away from me.

610
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
Hey.

611
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,200
Do not fucking touch me.

612
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
Thank you.

613
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,400
Fuck! No! No!

614
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,120
Come on. You're coming with me.

615
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,200
I'm not going anywhere.

616
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,640
I got you what you wanted.

617
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,920
All right, we're gonna
get you feeling better

618
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,080
and you're gonna guide us
through those caves.

619
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,440
Come on.

620
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,280
Show me.

621
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,480
Give it over.

622
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,120
I'm not letting you get high
in my truck, in public.

623
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,760
Then fuck you and fuck your cave.

624
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,960
Hey, you walk out that door

625
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,760
and I'm sending your ass
right back to jail.

626
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
What's it gonna be?

627
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,480
All right.

628
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,960
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey. Meet me at my place.

629
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,496
We're going to where Annie died.

630
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,040
I thought you said
the case was closed.

631
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,640
<i>I was wrong.</i>

632
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,280
You're not gonna stop me?

633
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,120
Just come back. Okay?

634
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
Come back.

635
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,000
The bathroom's over there.

636
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
Show me.

637
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,200
Show me.

638
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,480
Here. Off Niksik Pass.

639
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,400
That's the highest point.

640
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,640
Take it easy.

641
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,720
And don't leave a mess.

642
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,880
Navarro?

643
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,520
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

644
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,440
Connelly wants me
to bring in the engineer.

645
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,480
What are you talking about?

646
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,040
The junkie. Otis Heiss.
I'm supposed to take him in.

647
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,400
- What for?
- Something about

648
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,520
an outstanding warrant. He skipped
bail in Noatak or some shit.

649
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,160
Why didn't Connelly
just ask me himself?

650
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,360
I don't know.
Maybe it's below your pay grade.

651
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,080
Come on.

652
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,720
You think I wanna be here
on New Year's Eve

653
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,160
collecting some junkie?

654
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,120
How'd you know Otis Heiss was here?

655
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,560
Oh, he's here?

656
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,840
In the house? I was just wanting you
to point me in a direction.

657
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,600
Yeah. I'm calling Connelly.

658
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,120
Just give him to me.

659
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,520
Jesus Christ, Liz. Does everything
have to be a fucking battle with you?

660
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,880
What the fuck's going on?

661
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,320
- You're coming with me.
- No... you're not.

662
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,880
Listen, look, I don't know
what's going on, Hank.

663
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,600
But you can still walk out
that front door

664
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,040
and everything can still be okay.

665
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,720
Fuck this. I'm outta here.

666
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,880
- Do not fucking move.
- No.

667
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,880
Do... Put the gun down. Hank.

668
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,800
No, I'm taking him.

669
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,520
I'm gonna do this
the way you did Wheeler.

670
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,800
Look, I don't know
what they have on you

671
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,480
but whatever it is, we can fix it.

672
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,856
- Okay? We can fix this.
- You turned my kid against me.

673
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,160
We can't fix that, can we?

674
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,280
Your son loves you. He loves you.

675
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,280
He doesn't wanna see you
do anything fucked up, okay?

676
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Hey!

677
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,600
Back up.

678
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,000
- Back up, Liz.
- Okay.

679
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,080
Stay there.

680
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,040
Jesus Christ.

681
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,680
What's going on?

682
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,440
Lower your weapon, Pete.

683
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,880
Prior, don't. Think about it.

684
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,360
Think.

685
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,360
- Dad?
- I gotta get him out of here.

686
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,280
Prior. Think.

687
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,600
Think.

688
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,280
Come on.
Let's get him in my truck.

689
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,000
Prior. Don't. Think about it.

690
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,360
Come on. I need your help, son.

691
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,960
Prior.

692
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,040
Help me.

693
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,040
You should know something.

694
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,800
I didn't kill Annie K.
I just moved her body.

695
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,880
Blood is blood, Peter.

696
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,160
Remember that.

697
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,920
No!

698
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,880
It's okay.

699
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,440
I'm gonna call Connelly.

700
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,856
- No... You're not calling anyone.
- Yeah, I'm gonna call him right now.

701
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,880
Listen!

702
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,840
If you bring Connelly into this

703
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,120
that kid's going down.

704
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,760
Connelly is in on this.
He will bury every single one of us.

705
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,280
No. This...

706
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,120
- This didn't happen.
- What?

707
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,360
Hank was never here.

708
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,040
He snatched Otis and he shot him

709
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,360
but when he tried
to get rid of the body

710
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,320
he had an accident.

711
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,600
His truck'll be there

712
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,680
but he'll never be found.

713
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,376
- We can't fix this. This is too big.
- Listen, Liz.

714
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,680
- We can't fix it.
- Hank was sent here

715
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,640
to stop us from finding
where Annie died.

716
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,000
We are this close.

717
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,720
The storm will help cover our tracks.

718
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,960
That's why we have to go right now.

719
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
She's right.

720
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,920
We gotta clean this up.

721
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,840
No. I'll clean.

722
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,840
No.

723
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,840
- No...
- No.

724
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,960
- No, Pete.
- You gotta go.

725
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,240
You can't do that.

726
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,616
She can't go into those caves alone.

727
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
I can't leave you alone.

728
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,840
She can't make it
in those caves alone. You know that.

729
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,080
- That's your dad.
- Listen.

730
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,880
You clean. You clean good.

731
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,760
You know what to do.

732
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,080
Then get the bodies
to Rose Aguineau. Okay?

733
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,400
Tell her I said take you to Julia.

734
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,200
Say it.

735
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,840
Take me to Julia.

736
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,040
Please. Just go.

737
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,840
Move it, Liz.

738
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,360
This is mine.
