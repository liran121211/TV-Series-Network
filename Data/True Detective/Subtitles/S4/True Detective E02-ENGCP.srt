1
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,800
There's a burnt cornea.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,440
Let me see.

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,760
Yeah, like ice burns.

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,960
Why are they naked?

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
It doesn't make any sense.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,080
It's a ruptured eardrum.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,960
- See that blood?
- Yeah, but how?

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,720
Pressure?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,000
It could be.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,760
Over here, too.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, that's Lund.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Look at that.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,960
Oh, god.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,680
This guy scratched his own eyes out.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,880
You think?

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,800
This case...

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,800
it's gonna be a shitbowl.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,640
No answers,
just bunch of angry people.

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,440
We don't even have
a forensic technician.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,080
We should send this thing
back to Anchorage.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,840
I thought that's what we were doing.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,880
Yeah, we're keeping it.

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,720
- Fuck Anchorage.
- Really?

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,760
Hey!

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Three feet! Three feet.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,560
Need to tie it down.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,920
Hey! No photos!

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
- Delete that right now!
- Sorry.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,840
Come on, Liz.
They're just blowing off steam.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,400
All right, shut up, Hank.
All right, everyone.

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,440
Everyone, stop fucking around!

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,200
All right, this is a crime scene.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,320
I want you to pretend like you know
what you're doing.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,600
Fuck's sake.

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,880
You should go home.

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
I can't.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
Maybe leave this one
for someone else, Missy.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,480
It's tied to Annie's case, Rose.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,480
Then you're screwed.

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,880
Come and see me later.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,200
No, don't use that.
You're gonna damage the tissue.

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,400
- What do I use?
- Yeah, just go back to the brush.

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,416
You get a little air pocket in there

44
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,400
and then you can just slide it
into the side.

45
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
All right.

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,616
- Just don't touch the skin.
- Oh, shit!

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,240
That's it. Wilson!

48
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,760
What the fuck?

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
What the fuck?

50
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,760
<i>It's not looking good, ma'am.</i>

51
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,760
<i>We'll have to amputate
at least one leg.</i>

52
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,000
How soon can we talk to him?

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
<i>Definitely not today.</i>

54
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,680
<i>He's in an induced coma.</i>

55
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,800
<i>- Chief?</i>
- Thank you, nurse.

56
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,680
- Just hold on. Hold on.
<i>- Chief? Over.</i>

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,840
Prior? Did you fit him in?

58
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,880
<i>No, they're kind of in a weird shape.</i>

59
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,120
<i>Unless you want us
to break them apart? Over.</i>

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,440
No, don't break anything.

61
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,840
<i>Ma'am? I have to go.
We're starting surgery.</i>

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,000
<i>- Chief?</i>
- Okay.

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Just... just hold on
one second, nurse.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Prior, go ahead.

65
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,240
<i>I know how we can move 'em.</i>

66
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
The heart?

67
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
No. That's...

68
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,680
That's not an emoji, Haydn.

69
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,240
Try again.

70
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Merry Christmas, kids.
Class dismissed.

71
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,280
Hey, hey. No, no.

72
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,320
Guys, class is not dismissed.

73
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,440
I assure you, class is not dismissed.

74
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,016
Where are you going?
I'm gonna call your mom.

75
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,296
- I'll call your father...
- Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,776
- And yours, too. I promise.
- Merry Christmas!

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
- Yeah, call her.
- I promise I will.

78
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,120
Carla? You too? Really? Really?

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
Sorry.

80
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,480
You gotta be kidding me.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
I told you to stay away.
I work here, and I meant it.

82
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
I work here.

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Oh, come on, Bryce.
I'm not here for that.

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,160
I need you to explain to me
what Tsalal Station does.

85
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Tsalal?

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Why?

87
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,560
And why not just go out there

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,120
and talk to Lund
and the rest of them?

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,400
That's not gonna be possible.

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,520
Do you see him often?

91
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
Travis?

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
No.

93
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Death didn't change him.

94
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,720
The fucker only comes
when he wants something.

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,640
Did he say goodbye?

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
Before he went into the ice? Yes.

97
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
He knew he was dying.

98
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,960
He didn't want the leukemia
to take him.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,040
He brought me croissants.

100
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,200
Fucking croissants.

101
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,760
He had made them himself.

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,760
We ate them.

103
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,640
He sang a little.

104
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
We fucked a little.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
He didn't say much.

106
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,840
He was so tired.

107
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
But then...

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,200
we talked so much
all those years he came to me.

109
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Then he left.

110
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
And then I found him.

111
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,280
Yeah.

112
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,160
One last gift from Travis Cohle...

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,280
I got to meet you.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
Can I ask...

115
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
you seeing the dead...

116
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,960
when did that start?

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,440
With Travis.

118
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,480
But I know people
who are born with it.

119
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,656
And then, of course, there's Ennis.

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,160
It happens around here all the time.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,920
I think the world...

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
is getting old

123
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,320
and Ennis is where the fabric
of all things...

124
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,680
is coming apart at the seams.

125
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,840
And when you see them...

126
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,560
hear them...

127
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,440
how do you stay okay?

128
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
The thing about the dead

129
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,840
is that some of them come and visit

130
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,240
because they miss you.

131
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
Some come
because they need to tell you

132
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
something that you need to hear.

133
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,840
And some of them
just want to take you with them.

134
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,600
You need to know the difference.

135
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

136
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,320
What do you...
What do you think happened to them?

137
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,920
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

138
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,960
So, what were they up to at Tsalal?

139
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,640
I'm a geologist,
so not really my field

140
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,040
but they were madmen.

141
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,160
Very reclusive.

142
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,360
They didn't come into town,
and received no visitors.

143
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,560
Other Arctic Stations
rotate crews but not Tsalal.

144
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,280
They... No one comes in,
no one goes out.

145
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
And what were they doing?

146
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,400
They spent decades

147
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,360
trying to sequence the DNA
of an extinct microorganism

148
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,880
that potentially
could stop cellular decay.

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,680
All right, try it in English, nerd.

150
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Well...

151
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,320
If you want English,
you should have...

152
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Fucked?

153
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah, fucked the English teacher.

154
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,640
He wasn't my type.

155
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Neither were you.

156
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,520
But, you know, desperate times.

157
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,720
So, what were you saying?

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm saying the work they were doing
could end up curing cancer

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,720
autoimmune diseases,
genetic disorders.

160
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,000
Just an absolute
fucking game changer.

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,520
So, what was taking them so long?

162
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,880
I mean, they've been out there
like forever.

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,600
I mean,
it's not making hot dogs, Liz.

164
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,480
Ice-coring
for that type of microorganism

165
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,400
is extremely difficult.

166
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,680
It requires delicate robotics,
careful digging.

167
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
You know, drills break.
Deposits run dry.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,120
The fact is...

169
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,760
the permafrost is too hard

170
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,120
and it damages chromosomal material
upon extraction.

171
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,360
So, it was never gonna work.

172
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,280
Like... like never.

173
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,280
<i>Chief. I think you wanna
come by the station.</i>

174
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
<i>Over.</i>

175
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Copy.

176
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,520
My sister sees people following her.

177
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,080
She... she can't sleep.

178
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
She has these breakdowns.

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,040
She says my dead mother
is calling her.

180
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,520
I brought her to Ennis last year
to keep her close.

181
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
But...

182
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm worried.

183
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
Don't confuse

184
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,640
the spirit world
with mental health issues.

185
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,680
Sounds to me
like she needs treatment.

186
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,496
Have you talked to the people
at The Lighthouse?

187
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,120
She doesn't wanna go
to The Lighthouse.

188
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,840
Doesn't even want to talk about it.

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,360
She went to a place in Nevada
like four years ago

190
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,960
and they medicated
the shit out of her.

191
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,720
She fucking hated it.

192
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,000
You sure don't want something to eat?

193
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,320
No. I've got a shift coming.

194
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,640
Hey...

195
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,920
Did you see that thing
on his forehead?

196
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,280
I've seen that before.

197
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,560
Years ago.

198
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
What is it?

199
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,120
It's old, Missy.

200
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,200
Older than Ennis.

201
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,480
It's older than the ice probably.

202
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,360
Yep. We got the cellphone records.

203
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,520
There's nothing there.

204
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
- Radios?
- Yeah.

205
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,536
- Radio logs, nothing there either.
- Chief, how are you today?

206
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Hey, Lulu.

207
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,560
What's this?

208
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,280
Liz! How you holding up?

209
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
What a fucking mess.

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,040
But don't worry.
I'm moving it out to Anchorage.

211
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
You don't have to do a thing.

212
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Oh, great.
That is Chief Danvers's specialty.

213
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,000
You know what?
The families need to be notified.

214
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,176
Hank, can you get
Chief Danvers the...

215
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,240
No.

216
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,760
No?

217
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,720
No, you're not taking
my case away from me

218
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,720
Captain Connelly Sir.

219
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
- What are you doing?
- My job.

220
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,880
All those men died
in Ennis jurisdiction.

221
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,336
- Unless you want to call State...
- Stop...

222
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,440
You don't want this case.

223
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,560
I know you.
What's that thing you say?

224
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Shitbowl?

225
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,840
This is a shitbowl.

226
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, it's my shitbowl.

227
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,880
You don't have any resources.

228
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,080
No forensic department, no fucking...

229
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,520
You're doing it just to fuck with me,
aren't you, Lizzie?

230
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,240
You sent me to Ennis.

231
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,520
Actually, no.
You... appointed me to Ennis.

232
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,760
You gave me this nice office
in this lovely ex-dental building

233
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
so that I could handle
the unique issues

234
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,920
that arise in an isolated community
during the sunless season.

235
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,760
- I'm here to serve.
- Cut it out.

236
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,280
Those bodies are going to Anchorage.

237
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,280
Hank, get the guys
to rig the chopper.

238
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,640
We're flying the bodies.

239
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,880
- Section nine, chapter four.
- Hello?

240
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,440
Proper handling of frozen remains.

241
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,000
What is that?

242
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,120
Don't worry.

243
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,040
That is the Alaska Forensic
Crime Detection Laboratory Manual

244
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
that you gave to me along
with the regulation bibliography

245
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,760
for my promotion, Captain Sir.

246
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,280
It says, "Frozen bodies
are not to be manipulated

247
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,520
beyond the absolutely imperative

248
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,400
until properly thawed at a constant
temperature of 38 degrees

249
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,880
or the forensic results will be
compromised and useless in court."

250
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Right.

251
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,200
And how long do they take to thaw?

252
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,440
48 hours.

253
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,240
Where are you even gonna
put 'em, Chief Danvers?

254
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,160
Liz!

255
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Hey.

256
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,920
Did you see me play?

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,400
No. Did you see the manager?

258
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Hank?

259
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,040
Hank, did you find him?

260
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Even better.

261
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,200
Hello.

262
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,360
Hi, good to see you.

263
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,520
Janet, how are you?

264
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,920
Hi, Henry.

265
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
Ma'am.

266
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,640
How's Pete?

267
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
He's good.

268
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,136
You need to get that son of yours

269
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,600
to do some private skating coaching
for my boys.

270
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,920
Good money in it,
you know, for a young dad.

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
I'll try and talk some sense
into him.

272
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
I'm counting on you.

273
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Oh, god.

274
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Kate.

275
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,320
Liz.

276
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,616
You wouldn't come talk to me

277
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,440
unless this was really serious,
would you?

278
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Nope.

279
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,880
Hey, Mom!

280
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,360
Go get dressed.
Wait in the car, okay?

281
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Is this about those poor scientists?

282
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Yep.

283
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,680
So horrible.

284
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,680
Yeah.

285
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,600
They're frozen into a giant
block of flesh as we speak.

286
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Christ.

287
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
We need some place to thaw the bodies

288
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,960
that's big enough, at the right temp.

289
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,600
And since the mine owns the rink
and the rink fits the bill...

290
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,640
Well, just so we're clear

291
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm doing this
because I love this town.

292
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,200
Oh, yeah. Of course.

293
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
Careful when you lift it.

294
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,040
Lift it up. High as you can.

295
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,800
- Oh, a little higher here.
- Higher.

296
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
Up.

297
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
Don't damage the soft tissue.

298
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Good.

299
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,400
Jesus.

300
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,200
God.

301
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,760
That fucking bitch!

302
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
Trooper Navarro.

303
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,680
Hey, Chief?

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
That's teeth marks.

305
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,840
I think they bit their own hands.

306
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,640
What the fuck?

307
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,880
Hey. Get out of here!

308
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,056
Well, I just wanted to tell you...

309
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,160
Now! Go!

310
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Fine.

311
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,320
I'm gonna be
at your place, all right?

312
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,680
Okay.

313
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,280
All right.

314
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,320
Let's have a little dig
around the autopsy files in the area.

315
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,360
You know, look for similar injuries.

316
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,560
The burnt eyeballs, the busted ears

317
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,240
and the self-inflicted bite wounds.

318
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,560
Yeah?

319
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,800
That one's Molina.

320
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,120
Yeah. Jie is here.

321
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,160
And Merens.

322
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,520
This one? This one's...

323
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Kotov?

324
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,080
No, that's Kotov.

325
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,600
See with the ring?

326
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's... he's Russian.

327
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,400
They wear it on the right hand.

328
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,360
How many do you count?

329
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,240
Five heads and nine feet.

330
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,240
The rest of them are buried.

331
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,760
Why are they climbing
on top of each other?

332
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
It's like there was
something chasing them.

333
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,560
Well, hate to break it to you, kid.

334
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
There's no Yetis.

335
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,760
Hypothermia can cause delirium.

336
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,560
They panic, they freeze,
and voila, corpsicle.

337
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,840
Hey, we still got that retired guy
up in the North Bay?

338
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
The forensic tech?

339
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Get him down here. We...

340
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Prior?

341
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,720
Yeah, I have an idea.

342
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,600
What ide...

343
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Okay.

344
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,520
That mine bitch hates you
even more than she hates me.

345
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
I might've dated her husband.

346
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,240
Before or after the divorce?

347
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
What do you want?

348
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,800
This tattoo was on Annie's body.

349
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,840
- So?
- It was on the forehead

350
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
of one of your guys.

351
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,240
I don't know. Maybe.

352
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,280
- So what?
- So what?

353
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,440
It's the same case.

354
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,520
We can work together
and figure out Annie.

355
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,600
No. I'm not working
with you again ever.

356
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,216
You think I want to work with you?

357
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,200
I do, actually. Yeah.

358
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,040
Take a look in the mirror, Liz.

359
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,560
No one can stand you
except for that poor kid Prior.

360
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,440
But you'll be breaking
his heart real soon.

361
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,920
Get out of my scene.

362
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,720
Go on.

363
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,320
Fuck off.

364
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,120
You know where to find me.

365
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Prior?

366
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,040
Take a look at this. Go show it...

367
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,520
Hey, hey, what are you, what are...

368
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Yeah.

369
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,200
Hey, baby girl.

370
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,160
Oh, hey. Want some lunch?

371
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,880
Nah. <i>Bachelor</i> later?

372
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,480
- Evangeline.
- Qavvik.

373
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,320
Hey, Ryan. You got a sec?

374
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,360
Sure.

375
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
So, no?

376
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
No.

377
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,560
I don't think I ever saw him.

378
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,200
You sure?

379
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,080
Yeah. I don't know.

380
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,360
If she was seeing him,
she never introduced him.

381
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,840
Hey. Can I talk to you?

382
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,640
Chuck, come on.

383
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,200
No. She's bringing up all that shit.

384
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,960
You understand I'm trying to find
who killed his sister, right?

385
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,600
You know this man?

386
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,080
No. Never seen him.

387
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
Fuck you! We ain't poisonin' nothin'!

388
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Hey!

389
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,480
- You motherfucker!
- Hey! Bob!

390
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,160
Hey. Shit, man.

391
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,720
Hey, no, fuck you!

392
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,960
You think my kids don't drink
the same water?

393
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,400
You mining people
are poisoning your own kids

394
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,160
and we're sick and tired of you
pretending you don't see it!

395
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,280
We fucking feed your kids!

396
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
- Come on, man.
- Fucking moron!

397
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
- Chuck. Come on.
- We pay for that school!

398
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,880
Go, get out, man.

399
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Fuck.

400
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
What? Hey!

401
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
Fuck you all, motherfuckers!

402
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
Fucker didn't even pay his tab!

403
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,680
- Did you get the lab report back?
- Yeah.

404
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,401
- The DNA on the clothes?
- Yeah, that's gonna be a while.

405
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,520
How 'bout the prints?

406
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,880
Here you go.

407
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
It was on one of the shoes

408
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
and we didn't come up
with any matches.

409
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,520
All right.

410
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,840
All right, so we know
that a sudden drop in pressure...

411
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,040
can rupture eardrums,
damage soft tissue.

412
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,760
We know that hypothermia
can cause delirium

413
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,760
and irrational behavior

414
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,840
and that could explain
the self-inflicted wounds.

415
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,640
They drop everything,
run out there in the first place.

416
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Why?

417
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,800
- Gas leak?
- Nope.

418
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,960
No gas at the station.
It's all electric.

419
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,880
- Then what?
- Well, I don't know, kid.

420
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,760
Start asking questions.

421
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,440
'Kay.

422
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,640
Polar bear?

423
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,720
The doors don't lock, right?

424
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,800
- To avoid accidents.
- Okay.

425
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,640
It comes in, the men panic,
they run out.

426
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,680
And they undress. Why?

427
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
Paradoxical undressing.

428
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,560
People with severe hypothermia,
they feel hot, they undress.

429
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,080
You've been studying.

430
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,880
All right, keep asking.

431
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,760
'Kay, who drew the sign
on Lund's forehead?

432
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,920
Wrong question.

433
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,920
Okay.

434
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,560
When was it drawn?

435
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,000
Was it before they ran out,
or was it after?

436
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,840
Well, if it's before,
it could be a prank or a game.

437
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,600
If it was after?

438
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,800
Then someone was out there
on the ice with them.

439
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,456
No one stops to draw
on their own forehead

440
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,760
while they're freezing to death.

441
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
That's right.

442
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,960
Keep asking.

443
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
'Kay, what about the clothes?

444
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,080
I mean, they don't even match
the bodies.

445
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,400
There's only five pairs of pants.

446
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,280
Three shoes are missing.

447
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,400
Okay.

448
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Maybe they weren't fully dressed
when they ran out.

449
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,200
What's the question?

450
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,256
Why weren't they fully dressed?

451
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,600
No. Ask again.

452
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,776
How scared do you have to be

453
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,560
to run out on the ice
without any shoes?

454
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
And?

455
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,880
And why are the clothes
folded like that?

456
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,360
So?

457
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,320
So maybe the killer folded them.

458
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,360
A killer.

459
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,360
Why would he fold them?

460
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,280
I don't know.

461
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
Was he taunting them? Did he...

462
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,000
Did he make 'em fold them?

463
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,040
It doesn't make any sense.

464
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,080
Oh, no, it does.

465
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,920
We're just not seeing it.

466
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,520
Not asking the right questions.

467
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,640
I told you this was a shit case.

468
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,840
Yeah, you did.

469
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,976
Then you went ahead
and made it your shit case.

470
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
I won't even ask why.

471
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,960
- Yeah.
<i>- Ma'am?</i>

472
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
<i>The station supply guy
and the cleaning ladies</i>

473
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,200
<i>are ready for questioning. Over.</i>

474
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,800
Thanks, Lulu.

475
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,896
You get the supply guy.
I'll get the cleaners.

476
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,000
<i>- Mayonnaise, a lot, okay?</i>
- Chief.

477
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
<i>Guys, a lot of mayonnaise.
Like that, yes.</i>

478
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,280
<i>Do you want to see
the final product? Yes?</i>

479
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,936
<i>- Look at this, are you ready?</i>
- Now that's... that's the 17th.

480
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
That's the day they died.

481
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
<i>Hey, Clark, are you okay?</i>

482
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,240
<i>She's awake.</i>

483
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,040
That's a good girl.

484
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,000
You stubborn lady, ain't ya?

485
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,640
Picking fights with those big boys,
you dummy.

486
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,480
Homebrew in here?

487
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
No.

488
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,760
And what homebrew?

489
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,120
Qavvik's is a respectable
food service establishment

490
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,240
with an FF1 license.

491
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,856
And that's why
you have drunken fights in it.

492
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,040
Drunken fight, singular

493
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,240
was because of the bad water
in the Villages.

494
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,960
Nothing to do with illegal spirits.

495
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,896
The water thing's getting bad, huh?

496
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Yeah.

497
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,080
The whole thing
went to shit last week.

498
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,040
It turned black in some homes.

499
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
Poor fuckers
are too close to the mine.

500
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
Now there's talk of protesting.

501
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
Again?

502
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,520
How's my sister doing?

503
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,520
She's doing all right.

504
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,520
I mean, it's only one in town
that doesn't love my pancakes.

505
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,640
Hey...

506
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,840
Cut it out.

507
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,920
One of these days,
those dogs are gonna eat you.

508
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Nah.

509
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,880
Me and this girl, we go way back.
Huh, gorgeous?

510
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,120
She thinks she's real tough,
you know?

511
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,000
You come close, she snaps at ya

512
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,520
but deep down, she's a softy.

513
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,600
Yes, she is.

514
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,440
She just needs
a little love and affection.

515
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,760
Then she's gonna melt.

516
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,680
For fuck sakes, Qavvik. Cut it out.

517
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,920
- Will I see you tonight?
- No. Busy.

518
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,560
Great. I still need my toothbrush!

519
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,800
So, you do the cleaning
at Tsalal Station, is that right?

520
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,280
Yep, two shifts a month.

521
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,840
Did you ever see Annie Kowtok there?

522
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Annie K?

523
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,160
No, never saw her at the station.

524
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,280
But then, why would she, you know?

525
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,800
She was a midwife, right?

526
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,920
What about this?

527
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,760
What is that, a cult sign?

528
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,520
No. Witchcraft?

529
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,520
Hey, Blair.

530
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,560
You ever seen anything
like that devil sign?

531
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,600
No.

532
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,120
So, when you were
cleaning at the station

533
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,160
- you never saw this?
- No.

534
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,480
They were weirdos, all right?

535
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,400
I mean, you have to be a little off

536
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,160
if you wanna spend
your life out there

537
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,000
locked up in the ice,
you know what I mean?

538
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,400
Very quiet boys.

539
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
Played video games.

540
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,200
But they were all very obsessed
with their work.

541
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,800
Dr. Lund once screamed at me
for moving his notebooks.

542
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,280
Well, were they acting strange at all
the last time you saw them?

543
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,520
Did they say anything weird?

544
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,200
Say?

545
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,520
They never spoke to us.

546
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,960
We're just the cleaning ladies.

547
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,520
Clark was weird. He was always weird.

548
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,960
But last couple times
I went out there

549
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,520
he... he was talking to himself.
He was staring into nothing.

550
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,120
You know, I just,
I... I don't think the guy was right.

551
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,160
And once,
I saw him hanging out <i>au naturel</i>

552
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,040
skinny ass just hanging out.

553
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,600
He would be locked in his room.

554
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,520
We couldn't go clean in there.

555
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,040
He wouldn't come out.

556
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,920
I heard him crying.

557
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,440
What did the other men do
when he was acting off?

558
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,480
They just ignored him.

559
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
It was sad.

560
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,880
I thought I saw somebody
when I got to the station yesterday.

561
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,840
But it couldn't be, right?

562
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,200
Wait, you saw somebody
at the station?

563
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,680
No, I didn't see no one. Nope.

564
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,736
Bill, come on, this is serious.
If you saw somebody

565
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,440
- you got to tell me.
- This is Ennis, man.

566
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,400
Yeah, you see people sometimes.

567
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,120
Know what I mean?

568
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,320
Jesus, Pete, you grew up here,
you know this.

569
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,560
You see people
who are gone sometimes.

570
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,160
It's a long fucking night.

571
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,000
Even the dead get bored.

572
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,080
Hey, have you seen this before?

573
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,520
Yeah. Clark had that thing.

574
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Had it?

575
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
He had it tattooed on his chest.

576
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,120
<i>The guy you're looking for
is Chuck Mosley.</i>

577
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,680
<i>Block 16C, room 43,
Silver Sky Mining Barracks.</i>

578
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,520
<i>I texted you the location. Over.</i>

579
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,720
Thanks, Lee. Owe you one. Over.

580
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,560
Oh, shit!

581
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,280
Hey, Jules! You hear that, sis?

582
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,200
It's our song, baby girl!

583
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,440
<i>I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really
Really, really wanna zigazig...</i>

584
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Fuck.

585
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Fuck.

586
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,800
I told you I don't know him.

587
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,920
You're lying.

588
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,240
Don't make me arrest you
for stiffing the bill at Qavvik's.

589
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,760
He bought my cousin's trailer.

590
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,280
A Golden Eagle from the fucking '90s.

591
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,320
But my cousin made
this idiot shell out ten grand.

592
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,720
Guy paid in cash, right there.

593
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Boom.

594
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,840
And when was this?

595
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,320
I don't know.

596
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,960
Seven years ago?

597
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,520
Can't you ask your cousin?

598
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,800
Dead.

599
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,880
Bone cancer.

600
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,040
This fucking town.

601
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,760
Write the description of the trailer
and your cousin's name.

602
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,440
Why didn't you tell me when I asked?

603
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,560
'Cause I don't like you, ma'am.

604
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,000
No.

605
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,880
It's because you didn't
like Annie, isn't it?

606
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,600
You're okay
with what happened to her.

607
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,120
Don't worry, babe.

608
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,040
I've still got a little cash left.

609
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,320
I'll send you some more
for your mother's medication.

610
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,240
Can't wait to see you.

611
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,440
All right.

612
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,360
Wallis said he had
the spiral tattooed on his chest.

613
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,640
Why was Wallis looking at his chest?

614
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Clark was walking around naked,
talking to himself.

615
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Yeah.

616
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,200
He was not okay.

617
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,560
I don't get why the other guys
were putting up with him.

618
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,360
That's exactly the question.

619
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,360
All right, well,
did you get a hold of the family?

620
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
Yeah. I spoke to his mom in Dublin.

621
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,840
She hasn't seen him for 10 years.

622
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,000
Says he's dead to her.

623
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,120
Well, he is dead.

624
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Jesus.

625
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Okay.

626
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,840
What did we learn about the money?

627
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,120
So, who's paying Tsalal's bills?

628
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,200
'Kay, so the NGO
that funds the Station, right?

629
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,960
If you follow the taxes

630
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,800
you can trace it back
to a shell company

631
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,080
called NC Global Strategies

632
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,560
which in turn
belongs to Tuttle United.

633
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,736
Tuttle United, what do they do?

634
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Oh, everything.

635
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,400
I mean, glass, tech, video games

636
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,440
shipments, palm oil, cruise lines.

637
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,400
Okay, thanks, Petey, 'cause that...

638
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,400
that was really not helpful.

639
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,960
I'm here to serve.

640
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,840
All right, okay.

641
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,040
Chief, can I ask you a question?

642
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah.

643
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,640
What did Navarro do to you?

644
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,480
You worried
you're gonna fuck up, too?

645
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,880
Well, don't fuck up.

646
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,720
Go watch the corpsicle.

647
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,336
I'm gonna go pick up Leah
at your place

648
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,960
- and I'm gonna go back to work.
- No, I... I gotta go home.

649
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
I can't. I... I promised
I'd put Darwin to bed.

650
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Kayla will kill me. I...

651
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,720
You're not going home tonight.

652
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,440
What did I just say?

653
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,280
Don't fuck up.

654
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,280
What do you mean, no?

655
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,960
You said you were giving Darwin
a bath tonight.

656
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
<i>Well, can't you...</i>

657
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,680
No. He wants you doing it, not me.

658
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,560
<i>Come on, help me out here.</i>

659
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,336
I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

660
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,600
<i>I promise I'll do it next time.</i>

661
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,240
Yeah, that's what you said last time.

662
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,520
<i>Well, I'm sorry.</i>

663
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,456
I don't know what you want me
to tell you. He's waiting for you.

664
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,440
- Hey, hi, Darwin.
- Hey, your boss is here.

665
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,680
Making Legos?

666
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,320
- Yeah.
<i>- I'm sorry, babe.</i>

667
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,680
- Whatever.
- Whatcha making?

668
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,840
- A house.
- A house for the fish?

669
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,960
So, you taking my man again tonight?

670
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,480
You don't know this, Kayla,
but I'm doing you a big favor.

671
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,736
Pretty soon, you're gonna get sick
of having the husband around.

672
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,320
Thanks, but you can save
your favors for your family.

673
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,880
She's in the kitchen with my grandma.

674
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,240
Come on, baby. Bath time. Let's go.

675
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,040
Leah, we gotta go. I gotta get...

676
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,200
Hi, Liz.

677
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,520
Leah wanted to see how <i>kakiniit</i>
looked like on her beautiful face.

678
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,240
Hey! Wash it off.

679
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,320
- No.
- It's just marker.

680
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,520
- It'll come right off.
- Go get in the car.

681
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
Go!

682
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
<i>Ah-ha ah-ha nah-kooo nah-kuh-nookh.</i>

683
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,560
You don't get to doodle
on my kid's face.

684
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,800
She's 17.

685
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,000
And she wants
to understand her heritage.

686
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,320
<i>Ee-eh tabbur-lah.</i>

687
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,056
What? So, she can be
a night nurse like you?

688
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,200
<i>- Zrah nah-naahng kay-mehm...</i>
- Yeah, don't... don't give me that

689
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,600
Laundromat Grandma.

690
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,320
You need to leave my house.

691
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,640
Now!

692
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,280
<i>Ayh nohhh loopay-ah-tak
ah nahnaahng kay mehm.</i>

693
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
Really?

694
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,120
I mean, since you're paying,
I'm getting my nutrients.

695
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,280
Nutrients.

696
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,040
Twenty for some damn cookies?

697
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
Arctic prices, babe.

698
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
Remind me again why we're here.

699
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,440
Good job benefits.

700
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,920
Good job benefits.

701
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,600
Hey, so I've been thinking.

702
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,640
That place, The Lighthouse?

703
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,296
Maybe we should go by
and talk to someone.

704
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm not going back into a hospital.

705
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,360
Those pills...

706
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,480
- You don't get it.
- Hey... Listen. Listen.

707
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,160
Hey, look at me. It's not a hospital.

708
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,000
It's a community center
for addictions and other issues.

709
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,840
Okay? I think we should
go check it out.

710
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,400
I mean, there's other meds. And...

711
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,520
No.

712
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,120
Listen, I'm not Mom.

713
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,320
- Please, Angie.
- Okay. Okay.

714
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,640
You got to let me live
like a normal person.

715
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Okay.

716
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,160
Of course, baby girl.

717
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,160
Lee! Help me put up
this stupid fucking Christmas tree!

718
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,600
You do it! I'm in bed!

719
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,640
Hey, get in here.

720
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,840
This place is crazy.

721
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

722
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,920
- You did it.
- No, they're just temporary.

723
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,360
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

724
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,880
Fuck.

725
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,000
I see you.

726
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,400
I'm the one eye.

727
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,520
I see you. I see you.

728
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,120
Fuck.

729
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,720
- Hey, Chief.
<i>- Pete.</i>

730
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,736
<i>Did you get the scientists'
credit history?</i>

731
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,800
Yeah.

732
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,080
<i>All right. Send me Clark's.
As far back as you can go.</i>

733
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,760
Okay. You want me to include the...

734
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,600
You don't go into my house to steal.

735
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
You know better.

736
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,360
Look at me.

737
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,520
Look at me.

738
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,720
Even your mother didn't steal from us
when she left.

739
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,960
Now, listen.

740
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,440
Danvers doesn't own you.

741
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,400
You have a family, and she's not it.

742
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,520
Blood is blood, Peter.

743
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,240
Remember that.

744
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,840
So, you fuck me with the bodies
then you come to actually fuck me.

745
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,840
You want to or not?

746
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,400
Yeah.

747
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,360
Knew you didn't stay in town
for the lovely weather.

748
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,480
- I can't!
- No, no, don't you dare.

749
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,040
Don't you dare. No, wait...

750
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,240
You're sweating on me.

751
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,480
Do you wanna say it first
or should I?

752
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,960
That's the last time we do this.

753
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,000
That's 15 years of last times.

754
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Nineteen.

755
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,200
What? No.

756
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,920
Nineteen years ago,
I just got married, and...

757
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,080
Nineteen years.

758
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,400
You were with Jake?

759
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,280
Yeah, we were on a break.

760
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,600
One of them.

761
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,280
Fuck.

762
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,080
This is the last time we do this.

763
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,040
Yeah.

764
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,680
What are you doing
with the Tsalal thing, Liz?

765
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,080
Really.

766
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,080
I know you don't want the case.
I know you.

767
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,160
Oh, you do?

768
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,120
What am I thinking right now?

769
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,880
You're thinking,
"Know why I want the case?"

770
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,120
- Why?
- "'Cause fuck you. That's why."

771
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,960
I guess you do know me.

772
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,280
- You sent me to Ennis so that...
- No, I gave you a promotion.

773
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,720
For whatever reason.

774
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,280
I... I mean, mostly because
you're an insecure asshole

775
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,160
and because you're scared of me,
but whatever.

776
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
I'm just doing my job.

777
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,840
You're not "doing your job."

778
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,200
You're messing with me.

779
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,600
Why are you so hellbent
on keeping a lid on it?

780
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,000
Well, I just don't want it
to turn into a fucking disaster

781
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,120
for no reason.

782
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,200
Weird circumstances?
Dead bodies?

783
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,040
Come on.
Let's run it out of Anchorage.

784
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,120
No.

785
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,760
I'm gonna keep control of it.

786
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,040
- I've got control.
- Yeah. Well, I don't think you can.

787
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,800
- Well, I can.
- You can't.

788
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,720
- Says who?
- Me.

789
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,280
- And I swear, if you don't...
- What?

790
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,120
Are you fucking threatening me?

791
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,400
Fucker.

792
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,360
Yep. I'm looking at it right here.

793
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,480
It's a 600-dollar charge...

794
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,000
Fairbanks Ink Tattoo, April 22, 2017.

795
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,640
<i>Clark, you said, yeah?</i>

796
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,800
Yeah, Raymond Clark.

797
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,240
This tattoo was on his chest.
It's a spiral.

798
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,440
I can send it to you right now
if you want.

799
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,400
<i>No need. I have it right here.</i>

800
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,440
<i>Yeah, I remember him.</i>

801
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,200
<i>Weird guy. English, right?</i>

802
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,720
- He was Irish.
<i>- He cried a little when I finished.</i>

803
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,080
<i>Not because it hurt, you know?</i>

804
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,600
<i>Just sentimental, maybe?</i>

805
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,400
Was he alone?

806
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,280
<i>He was alone, yeah.</i>

807
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,560
Did he tell you what it meant,
the... the tattoo?

808
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,720
<i>That I don't remember.</i>

809
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,480
<i>Wait, I can send you
a photo of the tattoo.</i>

810
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,080
<i>I keep them for my records.</i>

811
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,600
<i>And here's one showing
the model for the work.</i>

812
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,640
<i>Lady? Hello?</i>

813
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,480
Guess I should start locking.

814
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,680
He took this photo
to a studio in Fairbanks.

815
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,080
He got the same tattoo as her.

816
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,520
That's four days after she died.

817
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,240
Here's the DNA results.

818
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,960
That was Annie's tongue at Tsalal.

819
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,520
Tissue has some unusual
cellular damage.

820
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,720
Possibly from freezing.

821
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,800
Did you change
where you put the cans?

822
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,680
Where do the cans go?

823
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,640
Well, it looks like
your case is my case.

824
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,560
What are you doing here?

825
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,721
Well, you know Annie better
than I can get from the files.

826
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,680
And now it matters
because it's a bunch of white men?

827
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You want in or you just wanna
go fuck yourself?

828
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,240
Listen, The Wheeler thing was...

829
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Shut up.

830
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,096
No. We did exactly
what we needed to do...

831
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,720
No, we're not doing that, all right?

832
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,520
We're just doing this one thing.

833
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,320
We're gonna crack it, close your case

834
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,400
I close my case, and then
that's it for the two of us.

835
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
It is.

836
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,360
Fuck!

837
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
Hi.

838
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,800
Jesus Christ, Leah. Fuck.

839
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,200
Oh, dude, you got the...

840
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,280
- Oh, yeah. They're temporary.
- Yeah?

841
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,560
- Temporary?
- Yeah.

842
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
Oh. They look cool.

843
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,760
So...

844
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,600
Liz make you stay and watch them
in case they wake up?

845
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,400
Don't.

846
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,400
Don't, you don't want that shit
in your head.

847
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,960
Seriously, Leah.

848
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,160
What happened to you?

849
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,200
Fuck, Prior.

850
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,600
He's an animal.

851
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,760
Yeah, well, he was raised by
an animal to be an animal, so...

852
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,840
It doesn't matter.

853
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,560
I mean, you come from the same shit

854
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,240
and you managed to be nice.

855
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,880
A fucking dork.

856
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,480
But nice.

857
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,696
- A dork? Really? A dork?
- Yeah, you're a dork.

858
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,040
- Yeah.
- Ah, you're a dork.

859
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,520
You know, my dad and Liz
used to dance to this all the time.

860
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,720
- What?
- Yeah.

861
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,320
Nah. No way.

862
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,600
Yeah.

863
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,440
My dad was, like, a stoner.

864
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,080
Like a wannabe artist.
And he was so chill.

865
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,400
And they used to love
to dance together.

866
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,160
I'm pretty sure
that Liz smoked weed, too.

867
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Nah.

868
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,680
- Nah, Come on. Fuck.
- I'm so serious.

869
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,720
- Can you imagine?
- No.

870
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,960
I don't wanna.

871
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,400
You know, Hank was a musician.

872
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,160
What?

873
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,280
He played the guitar.

874
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,680
- No.
- In a band.

875
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,840
- No.
- Yeah.

876
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,680
Well, was he any good?

877
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,680
I don't know.

878
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,040
I've actually never heard him play.

879
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,960
Yeah, not once.

880
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,520
My mom said he wasn't
good enough to have a career

881
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,440
but she kinda felt he wasn't...

882
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,280
Good enough. Period.

883
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,440
Yeah.

884
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

885
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,080
That sticks with you, doesn't it?

886
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,480
Not being good enough.

887
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,480
Fuck. Gee, you said
you weren't coming!

888
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,080
Hey, Qavvik.

889
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,600
You could've given me a heart attack!

890
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,160
Changed my mind.

891
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,960
Want to fuck?

892
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,160
Oh... you jerked off.

893
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,320
- Watching porn?
- I'm... No! I was just...

894
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,840
What kind of porn were you watching?

895
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,880
Can we just, like,
watch a movie and...

896
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
A porn movie?

897
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,320
Get out. I'm getting dressed.

898
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,880
And now she wants me on the case.

899
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,960
But I don't have anything.

900
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,640
That can't be true.

901
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,000
If you didn't have anything

902
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,120
she wouldn't want you,
so you have it all.

903
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,440
Yeah. I mean, I know everything
about Annie, every single detail.

904
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,760
Somehow, I had no idea
about the Clark thing.

905
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,800
I mean, they kept it a secret.

906
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,960
Well, why?

907
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,080
That's not the right question.

908
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,160
What?

909
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,760
That's what Danvers would say.

910
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,600
The right question is...

911
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,080
The right question is how.

912
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,720
That's why he got the trailer.

913
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,480
To keep it a secret.

914
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,160
Fuck.

915
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,080
Yes. Where do you keep
a trailer to fuck in secret?

916
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,680
- The Nook.
- Nook.

917
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,160
Talk to me, Raymond Clark.

918
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Danvers.

919
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,040
<i>You have to see this.</i>

920
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,240
Jesus.

921
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,120
Are those bones?

922
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,080
Yeah. Animal.

923
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,880
Seal.

924
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,360
Caribou.

925
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,440
I think.

926
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,480
How'd you find this place?

927
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,160
My Spirit Animal showed me
in a dream, remember?

928
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,280
Hey.

929
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,080
Yeah.

930
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,760
That's her phone.

931
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,200
I checked.

932
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,080
It was not with her body.

933
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,800
Holy fuck.

934
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,480
- Danvers.
<i>- Chief?</i>

935
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,040
<i>We have a problem.</i>

936
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,040
Hey.

937
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,760
There's only six of them.

938
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,960
See?

939
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,400
Jie, Merens...

940
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,520
Molina, Kotov...

941
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,840
Mehta...

942
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,200
Emerson.

943
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,360
He's not here.

944
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,280
Clark's not here.

945
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,440
Maybe he got separated.

946
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,120
No. He didn't.

947
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,040
He's alive.

948
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,680
He's out there.
