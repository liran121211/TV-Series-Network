1
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:35,506
APF, open up, please.

2
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:44,720
APF, open up, now!

3
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:55,059
Please help!

4
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,900
Anne Masu Kowtok?

5
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,833
{\an8}- Yeah?
- You're under arrest for trespassing

6
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:02,734
{\an8}and the destruction
of private property

7
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:04,402
{\an8}at the Silver Sky
Mining facilities.

8
00:01:04,403 --> 00:01:06,137
Turn around
and hands behind your head.

9
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:07,872
- I'm gonna need a minute.
- Ma'am.

10
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:11,511
Ma'am, I said turn around
and hands behind your head.

11
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:13,412
She's 10 centimeters
dilated.

12
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,313
Contractions
every two minutes.

13
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:17,584
Shoot me, but I'm getting
that baby out of her.

14
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:20,889
Is this a clinic?

15
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:25,222
It's a birthing center.
The last one in the region.

16
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,160
Do you wanna arrest me
for that too?

17
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:38,003
Grace, Grace.

18
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,671
Okay?

19
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:42,108
What's that bitch
doing here?

20
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,283
She's helping.
Bring hot water.

21
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:50,281
Grace, Grace.
Breathe, breathe.

22
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:57,390
Okay? Breathe, breathe.
Take some deep breaths.

23
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:59,523
Deep breaths, okay?

24
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:05,798
- Put the water in.
- You're doing good. You're doing great.

25
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,865
{\an8}Deep breath,
deep breath.

26
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,999
{\an8}Grace, Grace.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,133
{\an8}On the next big one,
you push, okay?

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,624
{\an8}Give it a really good push, okay?

29
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:25,785
- Okay, give me a good push.
- Push.

30
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,288
Push!

31
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,589
{\an8}Push!

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,863
It's here, it's here.
Okay, okay.

33
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:43,903
It's a little baby girl, Grace!

34
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,044
My baby.

35
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,575
I wanna hold my baby.

36
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:55,451
- I wanna see her.
- Takes a few minutes sometimes, Grace.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,484
Give me that.

38
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:03,015
Why isn't she,
why isn't she crying?

39
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,092
- She'll be fine.
- It's okay. It's okay.

40
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,426
But she's not crying!

41
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:11,497
- Annie, why isn't she crying?
- She's coming. She's coming.

42
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:14,083
- Annie!
- We have to do CPR.

43
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,669
Annie, I wanna hold her!

44
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,203
- Okay, come on.
- One, two, three.

45
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:19,375
What's happening?

46
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:25,010
What's happening?!
Please! Please!

47
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:03,181
You take her
from here, okay?

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,803
Now we can go.

49
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:46,408
Here we go.
Hey, hey.

50
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,592
- Hey, Paulie!
- Ha, ha!

51
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:52,030
Alright. Lookin' good here.
Yeah, yeah, Scotty.

52
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,260
Gotta lock and load.
Lock and load, buddy.

53
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,936
What's up, Paulie?
Bringin' out the big guns, huh?

54
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:00,366
What the fuck
are you doing?

55
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,579
This is a task op.
Your boys here are a liability.

56
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,310
I'll take all
the help I can get.

57
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,052
Okay, everybody,
gather around.

58
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,729
Alright, listen up.

59
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:26,598
Suspect is Raymond Clark,
5'11, brown hair, brown eyes.

60
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,770
Last seen wearing
a pink parka.

61
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,606
Consider him armed
and dangerous.

62
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:36,408
He's got at least a 48-hour head start on us,
so we gotta move.

63
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,980
We're gonna break
into search groups.

64
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,814
Agents Cooper and Lee
are in charge of sweeping the tundra.

65
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,181
They'll proceed
north together,

66
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,783
then fan out
at three-mile intervals.

67
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:49,021
Trooper Davis is gonna inspect
the mining dredges.

68
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:50,922
Checkpoints go up
at 15 miles.

69
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:53,993
Radio chain maintained
at all times.

70
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,962
Now let's go
get this fucker.

71
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,672
Hey, we want
him alive.

72
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:05,574
Do we?

73
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,461
Hank, this is Danvers, over.

74
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,500
Hank, answer
the fuckin' radio.

75
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,535
Your father's
recruiting civilians.

76
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,901
- Hey, Lulu?
- Yeah?

77
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:45,136
Will you get
a trooper on the phone

78
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:48,473
and have him get Hank
on his fuckin' radio?

79
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:50,642
- Okay!
- Alright, where's my forensic technician?

80
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:53,245
He's booked
on the evening charter.

81
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:56,715
And Lund is
still in a coma.

82
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,918
They had to amputate
both his legs.

83
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,122
Still might lose
his left forearm.

84
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:04,059
Oof. I still need
to talk to him.

85
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:07,325
Yes, ma'am.
And good luck with that.

86
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:09,999
When's Clark's stuff
comin' from the trailer?

87
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,371
What's Clark's shit doin'
in the evidence room?

88
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:17,769
Well,
it's evidence.

89
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,505
Yeah, well, move it
someplace sanitary.

90
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:23,775
The place is
disgusting. Stinks.

91
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:25,811
Alright, I'm gonna
need a tetanus shot

92
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:28,747
just to look
at this shit.

93
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:31,449
- How many boxes we got?
- Nineteen.

94
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,489
Nineteen.
Alright, well...

95
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,159
call Navarro.

96
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,524
Hit up her Trooper command
and tell him

97
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,797
I'm requesting
a transfer for her.

98
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,029
Okay? Just temporarily.

99
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,265
Uh, I thought you
hated Navarro.

100
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,504
I do.
I hate everyone.

101
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:51,654
Hate you,
especially now.

102
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,971
Here.
Annie K's cell.

103
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:56,245
- Crack that, will ya?
- Crack it?

104
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,343
- Yeah.
- I'm not a hacker.

105
00:08:58,344 --> 00:09:01,616
Well, you're under 30.
You got friends.

106
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,419
Why don't you just
figure it out?

107
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,923
Figure it out, yeah.

108
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:08,357
What?

109
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:11,027
What?

110
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,499
Ask the question.

111
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,009
What happened the last case
you worked with Navarro?

112
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,140
The Wheeler case...

113
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,380
'cause that was it
for you guys, right?

114
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,119
Alright.

115
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,923
Only one bedtime story.

116
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:45,361
It was a murder-suicide.

117
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,197
William Wheeler.

118
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,701
He was a bad,
bad motherfucker.

119
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:55,404
Sexual assault...

120
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,169
armed robbery,

121
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,808
assault and battery.

122
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,645
He was in and out a bunch.

123
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,609
The last time he came out,

124
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,883
he took up with
an 18-year-old girl.

125
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:11,254
He beat her, hard.

126
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,953
Sent her to the hospital...

127
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:15,992
twice.

128
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:18,910
Broken arm...

129
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,763
smashed jaw...

130
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,333
some other things.

131
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:26,932
We went to his place
a buncha times

132
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,972
but she wouldn't report him.

133
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,308
His story was
always the same.

134
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:34,943
"Ah, she was drunk, Officer."

135
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:37,280
"Fell down the stairs, Officer."

136
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:40,816
We knew how that
was gonna end...

137
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:44,150
but there was
nothin' we could do.

138
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:48,191
Then we got the call.

139
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,713
<i>We were too late.</i>

140
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:12,815
<i>He killed her</i>

141
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,683
<i>and he shot himself.</i>

142
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:36,205
They were both dead
when we got there.

143
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,307
Navarro couldn't
get over it.

144
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:43,307
Uh, she was

145
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:46,109
convinced that there was
somethin' we should've done.

146
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:51,183
She blamed me, of course.
And it got nasty.

147
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,656
Transferred over
to Troopers, and...

148
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:57,760
end of story.

149
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,364
Gotta keep icin'
that thing, huh?

150
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:04,600
It's funny.

151
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,527
League hockey champion

152
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,074
fallin' on his face
in the ice rink.

153
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,442
Alright, go on.

154
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,778
Go get her.
Go get Navarro.

155
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:27,318
Go tell your dad
to get rid of his hillbilly friends,

156
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,323
or I'm gonna call immigration
on his Russian mail-order bride!

157
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,496
No, nothing!
What about over there?

158
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,302
Nothin', man!

159
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:02,258
<i>Help us.</i>

160
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:22,307
<i>Navarro. Calling Navarro.</i>

161
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,943
<i>Are you there, Navarro?</i>

162
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,614
Navarro here.

163
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,429
Let's do this.

164
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:42,391
What are we
missin' here?

165
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,697
Oh... this.

166
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,733
Spring 2016.

167
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,734
They must've started
their relationship before then.

168
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:56,405
Yeah, how do
you know that?

169
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,141
See that?
Ariana Grande.

170
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:02,906
That came out
in May 2016.

171
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:05,411
And Leah played it all the time.
Her birthday.

172
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:07,283
Drove me nuts.

173
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,320
And, um, alright,
look at this.

174
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:13,885
Here her hair's
changing color.

175
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:16,489
Here she's got the blue tint,
and, uh,

176
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,560
and now it's
fading, see?

177
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,364
- That's a long time.
- Hm.

178
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:26,735
I mean...
she looks happy.

179
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,442
They look happy.

180
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:38,281
This...

181
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,817
hot, fun girl

182
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,820
and this total weirdo.

183
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,724
Yeah.

184
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,791
No one sees
'em together.

185
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,662
A secret affair.

186
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:56,312
Ask the question.

187
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,029
Fuck your games.

188
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,269
Come on,
ask the question.

189
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,841
Why keep it a secret?

190
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:15,880
Are you still fuckin' that dog runner
bootlegging guy, Qavvik?

191
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:19,122
- Or are you back with girls?
- You still fucking C...

192
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:22,458
Anything that can't
run fast enough?

193
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,128
What, freshman?

194
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:30,596
Hey, yo, freshman,
you better learn how to run faster.

195
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:31,634
Hey.

196
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,001
Nobody here knows
about Ted, alright?

197
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:42,045
Come on, Liz...
everybody knows.

198
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,912
Well, you think nobody knew
about their relationship?

199
00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:49,114
Nobody knew they were together?

200
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:50,553
- Nobody.
- Alright.

201
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,018
Look at this.

202
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,062
Everything else
is selfie or timed.

203
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:04,462
That's a candid photo.

204
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:06,702
Somebody was there
with them that day.

205
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,970
There has to be
more like this one.

206
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,377
Yep.

207
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,188
See that?
Ya think that's her hair dye?

208
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,690
It's not a print.

209
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:33,029
Yeah, we don't
need a print.

210
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:42,367
Hey, I'm gonna be another 20!

211
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,255
What was that color
you used on Annie's hair?

212
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,590
Ah, right here.

213
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,897
Electric Blue,
wasn't it?

214
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,301
You lied to me.

215
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:16,705
<i>Yeah, I knew Ray.</i>

216
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,738
And you just decided
not to tell me.

217
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:24,410
- Your friend was dead.
- Yeah... 32 stabs.

218
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:26,078
It's a pretty clear message.

219
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,750
Mommy?

220
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:36,059
Mac and cheese.

221
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,118
You got any mac and cheese?

222
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,593
- Uh, yeah. It's in the, uh...
- Yeah, I'll find it.

223
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:46,866
Hey, do you know what the name of
that unicorn is on your sweater?

224
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,566
That's Puddles.

225
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,605
That's what they called her
'cause she cried a lot.

226
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,322
All the mean unicorns
called her that

227
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:55,306
but she was just super hungry.
Come on.

228
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:57,476
- It's okay.
- We're gonna go make some mac and cheese.

229
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:59,096
- Does that sound good?
- Yeah.

230
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,716
I'ma tell you
all about Puddles.

231
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:04,253
All her story about how
she cooks mac and cheese.

232
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:07,924
- Here, sit down on this.
- Okay.

233
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,429
You need
to start talkin'.

234
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:21,433
I went to Tsalal to give
haircuts to the men there.

235
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:23,539
Annie came
with me one time.

236
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:25,441
Once.

237
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,941
I didn't wanna bring her.
Sh-She wouldn't take a no.

238
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:32,361
She was, like,
obsessed with coming.

239
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:35,782
So, fuck it,
I could use the company.

240
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,150
And what happened
that one time?

241
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:39,816
Annie and Ray
hit it off.

242
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:42,955
They talked all night.
She showed him her tattoo.

243
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:45,394
He was, like, fixated on it.

244
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,268
This one?

245
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,907
Yeah, that's it.

246
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,174
- Do you know what it means?
- She dreamt it.

247
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,815
We were in high school.
A buncha times.

248
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,351
She got the tattoo,
the dreams stopped.

249
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,852
<i>Alright. Stir, stir, stir.</i>

250
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:16,321
And then, all the unicorns
went skating on the lake

251
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:19,358
that Puddles had made
with her rainbow tears.

252
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,031
Ugh, I love skating.

253
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,754
I thought it was gonna be
a one-night thing.

254
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:30,236
Pretty soon, they were
hangin' out all the time.

255
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:33,942
And what about Clark?
Was he... violent?

256
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,875
Anything to make
you think he might

257
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:39,611
- do something?
- No. He was, he was quiet.

258
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:42,347
He was... I mean,
he was a little weird,

259
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:44,983
but... he was crazy about her.

260
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:47,623
But Annie changed when
they started goin' out.

261
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:50,054
Changed how?

262
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:53,059
She didn't want anybody to know
they were together.

263
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,863
And that was weird.

264
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,369
You could've
told me back then.

265
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:02,939
I would've
protected you.

266
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,036
I was terrified.

267
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:07,740
Plus, I was seeing
a guy from Tsalal.

268
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:09,612
Wait... who?

269
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:11,948
Oliver Tagaq.

270
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,951
Oh, there-there's,
there's no Oliver that works at Tsalal.

271
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,153
He was
the equipment engineer.

272
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,756
He left right
before Annie died.

273
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:24,489
Um... and, um...

274
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,529
do you know where we
could find this Oliver?

275
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,197
Last I heard,
somewhere out on the ice.

276
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,636
Probably hunting.
I don't think he's lookin' to be found.

277
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,612
After they found her,
I did call the police.

278
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,279
I just didn't wanna talk to you 'cause
you'da known me.

279
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,433
So, I didn't
leave my name.

280
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,587
But I told 'em about Clark.

281
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,990
Who'd you talk to?

282
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,888
<i>Prior, where's your dad?
Over.</i>

283
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:59,823
<i>He's still out
in the search, Chief.</i>

284
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:01,892
There's plenty of radio signal out there,
he's hidin' his ass.

285
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:03,960
<i>I'll get him to call
the minute he gets back.</i>

286
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:07,632
Yeah, okay, you do that, and, um,
see if you can find an Oliver Tagaq.

287
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,970
He was an engineer
six years ago at Tsalal.

288
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,308
- Got that?
<i>- On it, over.</i>

289
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,777
That son of a bitch
takes me off the case,

290
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,677
and then he
buries this lead?

291
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:22,915
- Question is, why is Hank fuckin' around...
- Don't "Ask the question" me!

292
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:26,118
Okay? I'll tell you
why he did it right now.

293
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,157
It's the fucking
mine behind it.

294
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,322
You know I'm right.

295
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:33,358
- I don't know shit.
- Well, then you're a shit detective.

296
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,999
Yeah, well, whatever.
Whatever you say.

297
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:40,498
Annie protests against the mine,
Annie gets murdered,

298
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,669
the police shush it all,
do the fucking math.

299
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,269
You do the fuckin' math.

300
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,705
Alright, without the mine,
there's no town.

301
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,339
50% of the population
works for it,

302
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,094
which means half the people
who live here

303
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:53,849
have got a reason
to silence Annie K.

304
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,487
And what about Clark,
creepy boyfriend?

305
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:00,756
What, you think
the mine's responsible for him too?

306
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:04,055
According to your
conspiracy theory,

307
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:07,159
Tsalal and Clark had
nothin' to do with it.

308
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,197
Is that it?

309
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:11,966
Not sure yet.

310
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:13,831
And what about
her tongue?

311
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:15,968
Now, what's-what's your explanation
for her tongue

312
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,552
poppin' up six years
after she dies?

313
00:23:17,553 --> 00:23:19,137
And what about
the men on the ice?

314
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:20,243
Why'd they
go out there?

315
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:27,578
Oh.
Come on.

316
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:33,384
Don't give me that
voodoo, E.T., cosmic

317
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:37,322
- choompa-loompa bullshit.
- Are you tryna say "chupacabra"?

318
00:23:37,323 --> 00:23:40,360
Whatever, the magic. It's no magic.

319
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,399
Alright, there's a, there's
a real explanation for this.

320
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,496
Alright.

321
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:51,307
- I'm listening.
- We're just not askin' the right questions.

322
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,738
We will.
We'll find it.

323
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:57,413
Who's the one that believes in miracles?

324
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,051
Fantasy Football?

325
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,286
No, Tinder.

326
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:07,552
- You're on Tinder?
- Yeah, I'm on Tinder.

327
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:10,349
Who the fuck is
on Tinder in Ennis?

328
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,593
Fuckin' Old Norman Naki
and, ugh, Hank Prior?

329
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:17,466
No, he's taken.
Poor bitch.

330
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,533
Yeah, I set my Tinder
radius for Fairbanks.

331
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,902
Ya know, I'll take
some personal trips.

332
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:25,072
I don't fuck where I eat.

333
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:27,243
You mean, anymore.

334
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,245
Fuck you.

335
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:32,044
What do you do
when you're lonely?

336
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:33,682
I watch Netflix.

337
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,481
Come on. For real.
What do you do?

338
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,527
I pray.

339
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:52,168
You pray?

340
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:56,886
What do you mean, like,
like, get on your knees,

341
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:59,882
"Our Father, who art in heaven,"
pray?

342
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:02,878
Oh, come on. You kiddin' me?
You talk to God?

343
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,182
No.

344
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:09,018
I listen.

345
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,491
Oh.

346
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:22,064
Don't you ever...
get this feeling, like...

347
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:27,336
that sometimes you just
wanna just disappear?

348
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:33,042
Just walk out...
never stop?

349
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,913
Just go.

350
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:40,779
Just go.

351
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,635
Hey.

352
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,538
- Chief Danvers wants you to call...
- She can wait.

353
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,241
Come here
for a second.

354
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:17,186
Uh, I was cleanin' out the garage
and I found these.

355
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:22,686
Yeah, I know,
Darwin's only four,

356
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:25,325
but, uh, you were already a pretty damn
good little skater

357
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:26,963
by that age, so.

358
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:31,730
If ya...

359
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:34,370
take him out,
shoot me a text, huh?

360
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:37,773
Yeah, sure.

361
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:42,273
What's Danvers up to?

362
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:46,582
Uh, she's goin' through
the trailer's evidence.

363
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,614
She and Navarro?

364
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:53,118
Yeah.

365
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,486
I don't know
what the hell

366
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,854
they're doin'
together.

367
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,821
I thought they
hated each other.

368
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,359
You know
what happened there?

369
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,131
She won't tell me.

370
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:04,633
No idea.

371
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,233
Hey!

372
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,300
You received
a direct call

373
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:11,971
about Annie K's
and Raymond Clark's relationship.

374
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:14,290
A direct call,
and you didn't report it?

375
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:16,609
Danvers, tell your girl here
to stand down.

376
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,810
You talk to me.

377
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,096
Tell me why the fuck
you withheld information

378
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,841
- from a murder investigation?
- Oh, please.

379
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,586
That woman was sleeping
with half of Ennis.

380
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:27,819
What did you
want me to do?

381
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,620
Log every dude
she was banging in the region?

382
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:31,322
You piece of shit.
I swear to God, you're gonna join

383
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:33,326
- your boys over here.
- No, no, no. No, no, no. Calm the fuck down.

384
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:34,397
Calm!

385
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:37,797
And you, go back
to your fuckin' search...

386
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:40,065
and get rid of your
hillbilly friends.

387
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,267
Or you're gettin'
a negligence report

388
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:44,469
for your mishandling
of the Kowtok case.

389
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,722
Maybe I oughta file
a report on you

390
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:48,975
for playing
Mrs. Robinson with my kid.

391
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:50,279
Hm?

392
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:02,525
You do your fuckin' job.

393
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:14,365
That's it?

394
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:17,240
"Do your fucking job"?
That's all he gets?

395
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:21,010
- Hey, where you goin'?
- Fuck outta here.

396
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,847
Who's Mrs. Robinson?

397
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:29,347
Where's my forensic tech?

398
00:28:29,348 --> 00:28:31,900
Well, there's a blizzard
out in North Bay.

399
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:34,453
Visibility's shit.
No planes are takin' off,

400
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:36,822
so they're gonna
try again tomorrow.

401
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:38,723
Ah, tomorrow's
no good.

402
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:41,794
They're gonna thaw.
And they're gettin' shipped out to Anchorage.

403
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:43,432
Well, I have an idea.

404
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:45,296
What?

405
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:47,670
- I don't know if you're gonna like it.
- Well...?

406
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:51,337
My cousin lives
in White Lake.

407
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,042
He's a vet.

408
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:58,681
Works a lot
with large animals.

409
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,885
How long before you
can get him here?

410
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:06,419
- Well, I can call him right now and see.
- Yeah.

411
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,091
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

412
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,234
Qavvik!

413
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,468
Shh!

414
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,446
Fucker.

415
00:30:04,646 --> 00:30:06,878
What can
I do for you?

416
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:09,082
Do you know
Oliver Tagaq?

417
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,287
He worked at Tsalal for a bit.

418
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,887
Now he might be a hunter,
somewhere out on the ice.

419
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,154
Tagaq? No.

420
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:22,327
Well, thing is, I know you know
someone who knows someone.

421
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:24,224
Homebrew
comes with a network.

422
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:26,202
You'll ask around?

423
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:30,004
Mm-hmm... for a price.

424
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:32,741
You want me
to pay you?

425
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:35,072
It's called
quid pro quo.

426
00:30:35,073 --> 00:30:38,143
You tell me something.
I tell you something.

427
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:40,947
Don't get fuckin'
cute on me.

428
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:42,451
I'm not kidding.

429
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,850
You tell me something
about yourself...

430
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,459
and I'll get
you that intel.

431
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,696
Fuck you, Qavvik.

432
00:30:56,164 --> 00:31:00,169
Always lovely to see you, Evangeline.

433
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,090
Da fuck you wanna know?

434
00:31:25,894 --> 00:31:27,129
Your mom.

435
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,697
- Tell me about her.
- Ask Julia.

436
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:33,184
Mm-mm,
I'm asking you.

437
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,671
She was local,
wasn't she?

438
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:40,873
Yeah, from a gold mining
camp that's gone.

439
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:43,525
She left when
she was 15.

440
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,177
Met my dad
in Boston. Boom.

441
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:51,620
- Now get me Tagaq.
- That's that accent, Boston girl.

442
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,958
But you
didn't stay.

443
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:58,894
No.

444
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:01,965
Dad was bad.

445
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,400
He drank.

446
00:32:05,534 --> 00:32:07,136
He hit her.

447
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,407
Us too. So Mom
took us and ran.

448
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,311
And then we came
back up North.

449
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:19,582
Alaska girls
always come back.

450
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,790
She was... not okay.

451
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:29,625
She...

452
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:32,328
Like Jules?

453
00:32:36,632 --> 00:32:37,833
Yeah.

454
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,934
Voices. Episodes.

455
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:49,012
Then one day she ran out
and never came back.

456
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,714
- Was she...
- She was killed.

457
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,953
Fucker was never found.

458
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,623
Oh.

459
00:33:02,123 --> 00:33:03,326
Fuck.

460
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,229
Sorry, Eve.

461
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:17,606
She never told me my Inupiaq name,
you know?

462
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,644
I wish...

463
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,448
Nothing.

464
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:33,953
Anyways,
there's your intel.

465
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,724
Now get me mine.

466
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:06,286
They're sick,
they're starving,

467
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:07,518
they're dying.

468
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,104
The fish, the whales,
the seals,

469
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:12,690
the caribou.
What are we gonna eat?

470
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:15,943
We can't pay for the food
in the stores.

471
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:19,196
Now, even our water's rotten.
They're lying.

472
00:34:19,197 --> 00:34:22,302
They're fucking lying when they say
they're not poisoning us.

473
00:34:22,303 --> 00:34:24,469
We want the truth.

474
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:28,507
We want truth! We want clean water!

475
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:33,179
We want clear skies!
We want our animals healthy!

476
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,913
We want the mine to close.

477
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,817
- Close the mine!
- This town was here before them.

478
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:43,489
- We were here before!
- We were here before!

479
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,762
We were here before!
We were here before!

480
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,931
We were here before!
We were here before!

481
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:54,136
Oh, you're the Chief of Police's
daughter, aren't you?

482
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:59,705
- No, she's just my stepmom, but I don't support...
- It's fine.

483
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,841
Anybody who cares
is welcome here.

484
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,755
We were here before!
We were here before!

485
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:19,428
Hey, hey, hey!

486
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:27,400
Aviaq and Joe Carter's
baby boy passed this morning.

487
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:33,805
Another stillborn.

488
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:37,210
Can we have
a minute of silence?

489
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:38,647
Thank you.

490
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:48,918
Lee?

491
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:56,420
- I thought you were gonna help me...
- Hey! I'm changing.

492
00:36:57,753 --> 00:37:00,326
Have you been hangin' out with those people
that are vandalizing the mine?

493
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:01,992
- No.
- Are you insane?!

494
00:37:01,993 --> 00:37:04,229
- Do you know what happens to those people?!
- I'm not insane.

495
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,066
I just fucking care
about this place, alright?

496
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,334
I don't know what
you want from me.

497
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:10,119
I want you
to fucking care.

498
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,903
- I do care.
- Bullshit.

499
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:14,474
I told you to wipe
that shit off your face. Come on.

500
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:17,046
Did you know Aviaq Carter's baby
was stillborn today?

501
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:22,785
Sure as hell didn't
care for them, did you?

502
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:25,868
That shit's comin' off.

503
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,852
- Come on.
- Stop! Let go!

504
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,088
- Get off of me.
- Wipe it off.

505
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:31,360
- No!
- Now.

506
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,196
Now!

507
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:25,378
{\an8}Hey!

508
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,625
<i>Listen...</i>

509
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:45,064
Tell my mommy.

510
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:53,605
Oh, fuck.

511
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,351
Hello?

512
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:09,254
<i>Yes, ma'am, Ms. Navarro?
It's Kenny Hogan.</i>

513
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:11,089
I'm-I'm coverin'
for Qavvik.

514
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,624
Uh, yeah, he got no signal.
Do you want me to...

515
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,629
<i>No, ma'am. This is
about your sister, Julia.</i>

516
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,996
Is she okay?
What happened?

517
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:22,238
<i>It's okay.
She's, she's fine.</i>

518
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:25,374
What did she do?

519
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,793
She started screamin'
that someone was comin'

520
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:31,847
and she was prayin',
she just started prayin'.

521
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:33,978
<i>She was...</i>

522
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:37,020
Hey... Look, I don't know,
it-it was bad.

523
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:42,058
<i>I'm sorry, I just, uh,
I just thought you'd like to know.</i>

524
00:39:43,491 --> 00:39:45,123
Where is she?

525
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:48,164
<i>I-I don't know,
she just ran out.</i>

526
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,834
Aren't you cold, babygirl?

527
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:30,873
How'd you know
where to find me?

528
00:40:34,743 --> 00:40:36,579
You weren't home.

529
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,817
And I know you.

530
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,796
You see that?

531
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:57,500
That's the water.

532
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,403
The sea.

533
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:07,735
I think stuff.

534
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:09,874
Bad stuff.

535
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,512
I know, I know, I know.

536
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:15,151
I know, baby.

537
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,523
Mama!

538
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,776
Hey, I'm sorry.

539
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:18,347
- Come to bed?
- I have an exam at seven.

540
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:20,683
Might as well
stay up.

541
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:38,234
Am I in trouble?

542
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:43,468
Come on, Kayla, it's just one case
and it'll be over, and...

543
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:47,143
And Danvers will
still be calling day and night, Pete.

544
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:49,946
And you'll run
every time.

545
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:53,116
Every time.

546
00:42:57,513 --> 00:43:00,617
- You jealous of Danvers?
- Don't be ridiculous.

547
00:43:00,618 --> 00:43:03,723
- Exactly. You married a cop.
- No, I didn't.

548
00:43:03,724 --> 00:43:05,962
You were not a cop.

549
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,847
You were just a sweet idiot
who made me laugh...

550
00:43:09,848 --> 00:43:12,401
Well, what if I don't
wanna be a sweet idiot?

551
00:43:14,568 --> 00:43:16,769
I don't tell you
you can't be a doctor.

552
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,269
I'm not a doctor.

553
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,738
I'm in nursing school,

554
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,172
with a kid,

555
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:23,007
married to a cop.

556
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:55,024
Jesus, Pete.

557
00:46:56,424 --> 00:46:58,589
Yeah, it's weird, right?

558
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,630
Hey, you think that guy scratched
his own eyes out?

559
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:05,831
How many hours have you been here
staring at this shit?

560
00:47:05,832 --> 00:47:08,399
Prior, crack that phone?

561
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,403
Morning, Chief.
Uh, this is my cousin, Vince,

562
00:47:11,404 --> 00:47:14,006
- the vet I was tellin' you about.
- Yeah?

563
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:16,474
Vince, tell her.

564
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:19,277
- Tell me what?
- Uh, yeah.

565
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:22,682
- I-I think they died before they froze.
- What?

566
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:24,900
I-I mean, they didn't
freeze to death.

567
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:26,694
I've seen plenty
of frozen animals,

568
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,488
and cold makes
their heart rate drop,

569
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:30,491
their breath
grows shallow.

570
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:32,494
They basically
fall asleep.

571
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:35,260
All told, a pretty
peaceful death.

572
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:37,433
Those guys, this...

573
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:40,516
this is not how
you die in the cold.

574
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:42,810
- It's just not.
- What killed 'em?

575
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:45,104
It's hard to tell
without a chance

576
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:47,271
to properly
postmortem them,

577
00:47:47,272 --> 00:47:51,013
but looks like cardiac arrest
if I had to put money on it.

578
00:47:51,379 --> 00:47:54,483
- Oh, well, how can you be sure?
- I can't.

579
00:47:55,216 --> 00:47:57,219
I'm just a vet, ma'am.

580
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,156
But I've seen caribous
die of plain fright.

581
00:48:01,155 --> 00:48:03,359
Running, terrified.

582
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:08,193
Uh, these scientists,
they, they, uh,

583
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:10,066
they look the same.

584
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:17,067
So, uh,
Vince...

585
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:19,338
you think you could do just, like,
a tiny bit of postmortem?

586
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:22,274
- Chief.
- Just... I'm just kidding.

587
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,211
- Oh.
- That would be super illegal.

588
00:48:25,212 --> 00:48:27,012
Sorry, Vince.
I'll buy you a beer.

589
00:48:27,013 --> 00:48:28,117
- Yeah.
- Thank you, man.

590
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,333
Well... so I guess we wait

591
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:33,217
and see what information

592
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:35,203
Anchorage is willing
to share with us.

593
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,189
- Yeah.
- Annie's phone. What about it?

594
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,685
Yeah, uh, we're
workin' on it.

595
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:40,158
We should get it
back this morning.

596
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:42,440
- It shouldn't be a problem...
- Oliver Tagaq.

597
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:46,402
I found him.

598
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:50,139
- How?
- It's called "Mukluk Telegraph."

599
00:48:50,738 --> 00:48:54,073
- Not for white boys.
- No, no. I'm sorry. The man doesn't exist.

600
00:48:54,074 --> 00:48:56,274
Alright? There's no
birth certificates,

601
00:48:56,275 --> 00:49:00,112
there's no school records,
no taxes, nothing for him.

602
00:49:00,113 --> 00:49:02,214
Oh, so, so, nothing
from Tsalal's records.

603
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:03,749
Yeah, nothin' on
the Tsalal records.

604
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,750
- There's nothin'.
- Well...

605
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:09,058
he's living in a nomad camp
on the North Shore.

606
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:11,360
Alright.

607
00:49:12,293 --> 00:49:15,131
Not everything
is on a computer, freshman.

608
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:19,197
Fuck.

609
00:50:03,445 --> 00:50:04,647
Hello, sir.

610
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,384
We're looking
for a Oliver Tagaq.

611
00:50:09,283 --> 00:50:10,852
And that would be why?

612
00:50:11,452 --> 00:50:14,954
Well, we believe that he may
have some information,

613
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:18,194
uh, regarding
Tsalal station.

614
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:22,512
Sir... Mr. Tagaq
is not a suspect.

615
00:50:22,513 --> 00:50:25,031
We just need
to chat with him.

616
00:50:30,037 --> 00:50:31,874
Not sure
he's around.

617
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:46,389
Mr. Tagaq?
Alaska police.

618
00:50:53,895 --> 00:50:55,098
Hear that?

619
00:50:57,164 --> 00:50:58,501
Yeah, the genny.

620
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,270
Yeah, he's
around, alright.

621
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,869
Oh, yeah?
Oh, okay.

622
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,344
- That's good.
- What the fuck are you doing?

623
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,089
You're standing
on traditional Inupiaq territory.

624
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:25,257
- Uh, well...
- Unless you have an order, if you take one step in,

625
00:51:25,258 --> 00:51:27,259
I'll blow your brains out.

626
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,765
Uh... I hear ya.

627
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:34,200
So, if I go
in the state records...

628
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:35,938
this property is your land?

629
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:38,736
It's under your name,
Mr. Tagaq?

630
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:41,277
You wanna come
and see the deed, lady?

631
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:46,147
You.

632
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:50,016
- What's your name?
- I'm A.T. Evangeline Navarro.

633
00:51:50,017 --> 00:51:52,885
No.

634
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:54,590
Who are you?

635
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:58,094
I just told you.

636
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,598
Oh, you forgot,
didn't you?

637
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:05,468
We're here to talk
about Annie Kowtok.

638
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:07,436
Annie?

639
00:52:09,636 --> 00:52:12,287
Look, I don't care what you
came here to talk about.

640
00:52:12,288 --> 00:52:14,940
If you don't have an arrest order,
you need to leave.

641
00:52:14,941 --> 00:52:17,577
What, you want us to get one?
We can get one.

642
00:52:17,578 --> 00:52:19,743
An arrest for what?

643
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:23,983
How about the deaths
of the Tsalal scientists?

644
00:52:27,956 --> 00:52:30,593
Your ex-colleagues.
They're dead.

645
00:52:39,934 --> 00:52:41,938
They all died
a week ago.

646
00:52:44,172 --> 00:52:46,171
How?

647
00:52:46,172 --> 00:52:48,439
They died on the ice.

648
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,407
We still don't know
what happened.

649
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:53,145
- Lund is dead?
- No. No, he's in the hospital.

650
00:52:53,146 --> 00:52:55,179
He's not doing well.

651
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,349
Listen... you can talk to us
if there's anything you know.

652
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,520
- Get the hell out of my house!
- No, we just wanna...

653
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:02,988
Go, now!

654
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:04,455
Alright.

655
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:06,893
- Get outta here. Out!
- We're gone, we're gone.

656
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:09,332
Go, now! Don't ever come back!

657
00:53:20,141 --> 00:53:21,807
What was all that
shit about your name?

658
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:23,808
You wouldn't understand.

659
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:25,681
<i>Chief.</i>

660
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:30,283
- Danvers.
<i>- Chief, we got a call, from the hospital.</i>

661
00:53:30,284 --> 00:53:31,516
Lund?

662
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:33,169
<i>Yeah.</i>

663
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:47,165
<i>The gangrene
spread everywhere.</i>

664
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,802
He needed
multiple amputations.

665
00:53:49,803 --> 00:53:51,069
He lost his eyesight.

666
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,303
We kept him
heavily sedated,

667
00:53:52,304 --> 00:53:54,322
but a few hours ago,
he started waking up.

668
00:53:54,323 --> 00:53:56,342
- Is he communicating?
- He comes in and out.

669
00:53:56,343 --> 00:53:58,595
He's agitated.

670
00:53:58,596 --> 00:54:00,849
Be prepared.
He's hard to look at.

671
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,356
Please be quick.

672
00:54:12,526 --> 00:54:15,546
Dr. Lund... my name
is Elizabeth Danvers.

673
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:18,567
{\an8}I'm with Alaska police.

674
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:22,771
What happened that night out on the ice?

675
00:54:24,572 --> 00:54:28,106
Anders... I'm here.
Okay? Anders.

676
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:30,609
- Anders.
- W-We woke her.

677
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,111
<i>She's awake.</i>

678
00:54:33,112 --> 00:54:37,486
And now she's out.
She's out there in the ice.

679
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:39,417
Who's out there?

680
00:54:39,418 --> 00:54:43,621
She came for us...
in the dark.

681
00:54:43,622 --> 00:54:47,096
I'm sedating him.

682
00:54:47,495 --> 00:54:50,395
No. Who-Who's out there?

683
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:52,247
Who was it?
Who is she?

684
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,099
Who-Who came for you?

685
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,068
- Anders, who?
- There's been an accident

686
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:57,268
on the police search.

687
00:54:57,269 --> 00:54:59,303
Chief Danvers,
we need help!

688
00:54:59,304 --> 00:55:01,477
Officers?

689
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:05,210
- Anders... talk to me.
- Officers?!

690
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:07,495
Fucking hunters are fighting!

691
00:55:07,496 --> 00:55:09,780
Stay with him.
Fuckin' hillbillies.

692
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:11,382
<i>Security to the waiting area.</i>

693
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:13,419
<i>We need all security to proceed
to the waiting area.</i>

694
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:21,427
Who are you callin' a redneck?

695
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:28,900
What are you doing?!

696
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:31,540
Alright, cuffs, cuffs.
