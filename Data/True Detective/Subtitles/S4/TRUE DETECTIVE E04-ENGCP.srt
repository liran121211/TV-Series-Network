1
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,920
<i>I found it.</i>

2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,440
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,760
<i>If anything happens to me, please...</i>

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
<i>Kowtok.</i>

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,320
<i>If anything happens...</i>

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>If anything happens...</i>

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,600
All right, Petey, talk to me.

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,360
<i>I'm at the ice rink, Chief.</i>

9
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
<i>And they're early, packing up
the bodies to Anchorage.</i>

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Of course, they are.

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,960
All right, I'll be there right away.

12
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,560
<i>Well, Captain Connelly is here
to supervise, so...</i>

13
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,880
What? He's there?

14
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,800
All right, I'll be there in five.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,320
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Wait... fuck.

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
<i>Chief?</i>

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,040
Oh, shit. Hey, call Navarro,
and tell her that...

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
to meet me at the police station.

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,360
<i>- Chief?</i>
- Right away. Okay?

20
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>Okay. Well, what should I say
it's about?</i>

21
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,160
- Hey.
<i>- Chief?</i>

22
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Hey, hey, Julia.

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,976
<i>- Chief, can you hear me?</i>
- Julia.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,280
It's Liz Danvers,
I... I've worked with your sister.

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Okay, I'm just...

26
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,616
- I'm just gonna come towards you.
- You can see me...

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,680
- Okay?
- Oh, no.

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Yeah, we need to...
we need to get you inside.

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
Okay, let me put that on you.

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Fuck!

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
It's okay...

32
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,960
I know...

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
You know what?
I'm gonna put this on you.

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,760
There you go. There you go.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,480
That's it, that's it.

36
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
I'm gonna keep you safe.

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
Just gonna get you safe, baby.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,280
It's all right.

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,920
I got ya. I got ya.

40
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Okay.

41
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
Yeah.

42
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,640
You ready?

43
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,560
Come on.

44
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
Hi. Hey.

45
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm... I'm sorry.

46
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
It's nothing.

47
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,720
Hey, can you wait for me downstairs?

48
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,120
It'll just be a minute, okay?

49
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Thank you.

50
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,360
She gonna be okay?

51
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,040
Bodies off to Anchorage yet?

52
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,840
Yeah. You know, Prior's handling it

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,080
and, you know,
Connelly's supervising, so...

54
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
- The fuck is he here for?
- I... I got it, I got it.

55
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,496
He better not be trying
to take this case away from us.

56
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,040
Nobody's taking
the case away from us.

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,520
Just go be with your sister.

58
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
That video...

59
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
We need to talk about it.

60
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Yeah.

61
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,680
Hey, Prior.

62
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,280
- So, how'd it go?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,000
Anyway, I... I think
I got something for you

64
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,120
with medical records

65
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,680
on folks with similar injuries
to the Tsalal men.

66
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,480
Yeah. Good... Okay, get it together.

67
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,800
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

68
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,560
That kid's gonna be good.

69
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,680
It's a miracle of overcoming
shitty genetics.

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,440
What the fuck are you doing here?

71
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,320
- Oh, it's good to see you too.
- No, I'm serious.

72
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
Why are you here
for a routine body transport?

73
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,040
I'm gonna stick around for a while.

74
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,760
- Fucking knew it.
- Look at me.

75
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm not here
to take the case away from you.

76
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,680
Why are you here?

77
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
You have protests around the mine.

78
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,200
You had a shooting that ended
in a fight in the hospital.

79
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,720
You got six dead bodies
in the local ice rink

80
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
and a still missing
person of interest.

81
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
You need to get
this shit under control.

82
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
I need to show up.

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,520
So you could look good
for your mayor campaign next year?

84
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm fucking helping you here, Liz.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,320
Besides, you like having me in town.

86
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Fuck off.

87
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Listen...

88
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,360
Look, just to get you up to speed.

89
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,720
Those men died before they froze.

90
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
How do you know that?
We haven't done forensics.

91
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,320
Oh, 'cause I did a independent
pre-forensic evaluation.

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
I don't want to know what that means.

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,080
Look, I'm treating
this like a murder case.

94
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,440
You saw the Annie Kowtok video
I sent you?

95
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,920
You keep that
on a need-to-know basis.

96
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,120
- All right?
- All right, copy.

97
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,040
It's good to see you.

98
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,640
What, you want to come in here
and take my office, too

99
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,776
or can you find
yourself someplace else?

100
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,840
Yeah, okay.

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
And, fuck you.

102
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,520
Yeah. Fuck you, too.

103
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,840
This is to fill out
your insurance information.

104
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Thank you.

105
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,760
This isn't gonna be
like the other places

106
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,040
I promise, okay?

107
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm right here in town.

108
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll come visit you every day.

109
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,640
And you can keep your cell phone,
so you can call me.

110
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm good.

111
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,880
I'll be here tomorrow for Christmas.

112
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,440
I'll bring presents and virgin eggnog

113
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,840
and, you know, 20-dollar cookies.

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
I can do this.

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
You knew.

116
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,160
That you were gonna stay here,
didn't you?

117
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
I'm so sorry.

118
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,616
- You're perfect, okay?
- I'm so sorry.

119
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
No, you're perfect, okay?

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
I love you so much, baby girl.

121
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,160
I love you, too.

122
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Thank you.

123
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Are you ready?

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's go.

125
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,920
Merry Christmas, Chief.

126
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,200
His name is Otis Heiss.

127
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,440
White male.
Admitted to St. Joseph's, April '98.

128
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,520
Burns on both corneas

129
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
ruptured eardrums,
self-inflicted bites.

130
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,216
You're... you are
not terrible, Prior.

131
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
He's a German national.

132
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,840
No records of employment,
no bank accounts

133
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,200
no credit card numbers.

134
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,240
Social security's been inactive
since November 2006

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
and no registered address
for the past eight years.

136
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,160
- So, no wife, no kids?
- Nope.

137
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,480
It's like no trace.
Like Oliver Tagaq.

138
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,080
Yes, but this guy has a long history

139
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
of disorderly conduct, all right?

140
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,160
So, breaking and entering,
petty theft.

141
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
He's been in and out
of rehab forever.

142
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,840
- Possession.
- Okay, move.

143
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
And if you look here

144
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,200
he was picked up by a trooper
in Noatak two months ago.

145
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,520
Zero sightings since.

146
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
- So, he's a junkie?
- After the accident.

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
What was the cause of the accident?

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200
That's the thing. There is no cause.

149
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
It's not out there.

150
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
All right.

151
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,680
Let's get the units out there
looking for him.

152
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,080
Motels, hostels,
flop houses, dealers.

153
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,016
The men are out there
looking for Clark.

154
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,400
We don't... don't have anybody left.

155
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,520
What about your dad?

156
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,080
He is at the airport.

157
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,760
Picking up his fiancée.

158
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Fine.

159
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,200
Well, get the men out there
looking for Clark and Otis.

160
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,520
Maybe they're in the same place.
Who knows?

161
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,600
Okay, but I... I mean,
I'm gonna have to put out an APB.

162
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,936
That's... that's updates, links.

163
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,496
- Go for it then. Do it.
- Gonna take...

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,640
Chief, it's Christmas Eve.

165
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560
Well, get on it. Fast. Chop, chop.

166
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
I really hate you.

167
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
I hate you, too.

168
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Yeah?

169
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,720
<i>There's no ice caves in the area.</i>

170
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Fuckin' Hank.

171
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Hey.

172
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,856
What do you mean,
there's no ice caves?

173
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
<i>Annie's video.</i>

174
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,440
There aren't any ice caves
near where her body was found.

175
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,760
<i>You know what that means?</i>

176
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,480
It means she was killed in one place

177
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,240
and then they dumped
her body in town.

178
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,960
<i>Send a message.</i>

179
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,040
You said it, not me.

180
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,640
<i>What about those bones in the walls?</i>

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,720
<i>In the video. Fossils?</i>

182
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Yeah, maybe.

183
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,440
Where's Julia?

184
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
In The Lighthouse.

185
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,520
I'm hanging outside. I...

186
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
You should go home.

187
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,240
<i>I don't want to go home.</i>

188
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,400
It's Christmas Eve.

189
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,960
Fuck Christmas Eve.

190
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,520
Good. I got an idea.

191
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,400
How bad is it with Julia?

192
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,840
I don't know. She's...

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,280
Remember when you asked me
earlier if I pray?

194
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,440
Well, she prays a lot.

195
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,440
That's not a good thing?
Praying a lot?

196
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,120
I don't know.

197
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,960
When my mom died...

198
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,360
my dad told us to pray.

199
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,200
He said...

200
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,800
pray with our hearts
and she'd be fine.

201
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
And you prayed?

202
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,840
Oh, yeah. I prayed.

203
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
From the bottom of my...

204
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,720
sorry ass little seven-year-old
broken heart.

205
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
I prayed so hard, day and night.

206
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,120
My knees turned black.

207
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,080
Couldn't even walk at the funeral.

208
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
Maybe you didn't pray hard enough.

209
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,920
Fuck you.

210
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,040
Still no God though.

211
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
All right, you might wanna
step in front of me.

212
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,080
- Why?
- Well...

213
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,640
Just forget it.

214
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Danvers.

215
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Hi.

216
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
Can I help you with something?

217
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
Good evening, ma'am.
We're really sorry to bother you.

218
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,121
We just need to speak with
your husband for a few minutes.

219
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh, you didn't.

220
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,560
Is there anyone in this town
you haven't fucked?

221
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,960
No, you can't be serious.

222
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,096
Wait, we just need five minutes.

223
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,320
- This is my home.
- Okay, three.

224
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,680
It's Christmas Eve.

225
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,040
This is a recording of a murder, sir.

226
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,880
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

227
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,696
- We do need your help.
<i>- If anything happens to me</i>

228
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
<i>please...</i>

229
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,360
- Well?
- Yeah. Those are...

230
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,880
Those are definitely whale bones.

231
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,840
Monodontoides.

232
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,640
Probably prehistoric.

233
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
How do we find this cave?
There's no caves in the region.

234
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Actually, there are.

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,376
There's a whole ice cave system up
bordering the Brooks Range.

236
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,320
But it's a death trap.

237
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,616
There were a bunch of accidents
up there years ago

238
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,800
and it was closed.

239
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,160
Where are they exactly?

240
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I could pull the maps.

241
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,120
But it's gonna take some time.

242
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,320
Everyone's out for the holidays.

243
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,160
Even if you had the maps

244
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,880
you'd still need
an expert to guide you.

245
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
There's... there's fissures
everywhere.

246
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,080
One wrong step and the whole bottom
could drop out from under your feet.

247
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,480
So, what then?

248
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,040
We need to go there.

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please.

250
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,560
Other way to do this

251
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,880
would be to track down
whoever mapped the cave system.

252
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
You got a name?

253
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,400
One second.

254
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Heiss.

255
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,040
Otis Heiss.

256
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,400
- Wait. Heiss, Otis Heiss?
- You know him?

257
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,920
Yep. I asked Prior
to check the medical files

258
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,760
for anybody that had similar injuries
to the Tsalal men.

259
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,880
Only got one ping...

260
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,800
- Otis Heiss.
- Fuck.

261
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Adam?

262
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
You... guys... you guys need to go.

263
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,736
You're gonna get us
those maps, right?

264
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,880
Yeah, I'll get it to you.

265
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Get 'em to you. Get you the maps.

266
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Hey.

267
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Hey.

268
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,680
What are you still doing here?

269
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,480
We are just putting out an APB.

270
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,680
I'm communicating
with the men in the field

271
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,960
and nearly done.

272
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,960
That wife of yours
is gonna kick your ass.

273
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,640
Yeah.

274
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,720
Did Irina get in okay?

275
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,640
Alina? She wasn't on the plane.

276
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,480
Did she call?

277
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,960
No, I think there's some problem
with her cell service.

278
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,440
Something musta happened.
Her mother's been sick.

279
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,880
Maybe some emergency.

280
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,040
Something like that.

281
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Yeah.

282
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,760
Listen, you didn't send her
any money, did you?

283
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,720
I was thinking,
seeing as I'm all freed up

284
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,680
maybe I can come over tonight
for Christmas Eve.

285
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,760
Yeah...

286
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
That sounds...
Yeah, that sounds really nice.

287
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,760
Obviously, just gotta finish up here
and talk to Kayla, but...

288
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,880
Take your time.

289
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,760
I got nowhere to be,
no hurry to get there.

290
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Damn.

291
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,720
Merry Christmas, Missy.

292
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,080
Is everything okay?

293
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,560
Yeah, I just stopped by
to say Merry...

294
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,480
Christmas.

295
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,000
Jesus, did you make all this?

296
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
'Course, I did.

297
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,440
All of Santa's elves drowned
in global warming, darling.

298
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,840
And the rest are all meth-heads.

299
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,480
This is amazing.

300
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,400
What were you, Rose, before?

301
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,200
You mean before I was old and crazy?

302
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,360
No. I mean, before Alaska.

303
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,480
Your name isn't Rose Aguineau, is it?

304
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,560
You never talk about it.

305
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,280
Well, I was a very serious professor

306
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,840
in a very serious school...

307
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,400
writing very serious ideas.

308
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,440
Why'd you leave?

309
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,960
One Tuesday morning, after coffee...

310
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,920
I sat down to polish
some pompous, useless article.

311
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,400
And I just had enough.

312
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,960
I had enough.

313
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,840
Every damn word I had written
in my entire life

314
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,520
was meaningless.

315
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,760
Making so much noise.

316
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,720
So much noise.

317
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,920
It is a little quieter here.

318
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Mostly.

319
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,840
Except for all the fucking dead.

320
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,560
<i>Liz, this is Kate McKittrick.</i>

321
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,720
<i>We need you to come
to the mine offices now.</i>

322
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,440
<i>We have a problem.</i>

323
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,560
That is unacceptable.

324
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Great.

325
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,600
You, talking about
what's unacceptable.

326
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
What do you plan to do about it?

327
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,480
Well, first, I'm gonna go home
'cause it's Christmas Eve.

328
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,240
And then I'm gonna call a couple guys

329
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,280
to come over here
and clean this up so that...

330
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
it's gone before
your employees get back.

331
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
I wanna press charges.

332
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,920
- No!
- No?

333
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
- Yeah, no.
- You don't get a say in this.

334
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,336
- If I wanna press charges, I will.
- Well, well...

335
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,400
You don't get to fuck up
my kid's life

336
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,576
just because you're pissed at me

337
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,960
and you feel like
maybe this will make us even.

338
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,400
Because, you know,
it won't do the trick, Kate.

339
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,720
Look, it's Christmas.

340
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Please.

341
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,816
Yeah, I ought to strangle you.

342
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,200
Why do you always take their side?

343
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,600
Just get in the fucking car.

344
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,000
Hey. Just checking in.

345
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
<i>How's the room?</i>

346
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,680
It's okay.

347
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Quiet.

348
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
Good, good.

349
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,240
Get some rest, okay?

350
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
<i>I'll see you tomorrow morning?</i>

351
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Yeah.

352
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
I love you, Angie.

353
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,960
I love you too, baby girl.

354
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Really?

355
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,040
Where are you gonna spend the night?

356
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,720
What? Priors'?

357
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,680
Why... why don't you just wait
until after dinner?

358
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
I'm making the turkey.

359
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Come on.

360
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm not gonna make you
pretend anymore. All right?

361
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Fine, go.

362
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Go to Priors'.

363
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,240
Go, get out.

364
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,920
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

365
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
<i>If anything happens to me, please...</i>

366
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,480
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

367
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,920
<i>If anything happens to me, please...</i>

368
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Wha...

369
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,280
<i>She's awake.</i>

370
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,960
<i>She's awake.</i>

371
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,600
- Hello?
<i>- Someone cut the power.</i>

372
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,840
What are you talking about?

373
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,800
Molina. The... hot one?

374
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,280
<i>The Tsalal guys, Molina.</i>

375
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,280
Okay, I thought
it was a glitch in the video...

376
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,880
but the power goes out.

377
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Are you drunk?

378
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,320
<i>Well, it's... it's the same
in the Annie video.</i>

379
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,960
<i>You're gonna see it,
that part where the power goes out.</i>

380
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,000
It's the same MO in both cases.

381
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,400
<i>Why would there be power
in an ice cave?</i>

382
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
I guess...

383
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,040
<i>that is the right question.</i>

384
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,840
Okay, where does that get us?

385
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,480
<i>Someone put a generator there. Ol...</i>

386
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,480
You got Oliver Tagaq

387
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,240
the fucking equipment engineer guy.

388
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,520
<i>He's got access
to the emergency generator.</i>

389
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,640
And he was defensive
and... and hostile

390
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,960
when we went to see him, right?

391
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
<i>I can hear you thinking.</i>

392
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
It's not crazy.

393
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,400
I'm gonna come pick you up in five.

394
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,120
Hell no. You're not going anywhere.

395
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,840
You're wasted.

396
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
I'm not... I barely drink.

397
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,680
Yeah, clearly.

398
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
<i>All right.</i>

399
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,440
You pick me up then.

400
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,480
I'm not going to a suspect
with my backup armed and shitfaced.

401
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,400
Well, you stay where you are

402
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,200
and I'm gonna get Prior
to come pick you up.

403
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,960
Liz, come on, give the kid a break.
It's Christmas Eve.

404
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,280
Prior's gonna come pick you up
in ten minutes.

405
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,240
All right, should we hit it?

406
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah.

407
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,280
Hey, you want me to bring this gal?

408
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,840
She's still got a little life in her.

409
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,120
Nah, we're good.

410
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

411
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,800
Hey, Chief, I put out the APB.

412
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,240
We got everybody
looking out for Otis Heiss.

413
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,216
<i>- Okay, I need you</i>
- Is that Danvers?

414
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,736
<i>- To go to Navarro's.</i>
- Let me talk to her.

415
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,200
She's headed to the Nomad camps.

416
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,680
Suspects could be armed and dangerous

417
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
- and she needs backup.
<i>- Jesus Christ, Liz.</i>

418
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,160
Kid's got a family.

419
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,080
It's Christmas Eve,
for Christ's sake.

420
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,120
I wouldn't ask you
unless I really needed you.

421
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,880
Yeah, I know.

422
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,840
That's my boy.

423
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,840
Anyway, so they just disappear.

424
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,840
- Oh, my.
- So, all the... all that for...

425
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,840
nothing, really.

426
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Make these, too.

427
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,880
- Push, and then...
- Like that?

428
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,280
- Like that.
- Yeah.

429
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,360
Sorry, freshman.

430
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,440
She was drunk, right?

431
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,560
Hammered.
She was so fucking drunk.

432
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,680
Jesus. Why are we even doing this?

433
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
She's onto something.

434
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Mr. Tagaq?

435
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,760
Evangeline Navarro. Alaska Police.

436
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Open please.

437
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Mr. Tagaq?

438
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,200
This feels a lot like...

439
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,160
You need an order
to go into a man's house.

440
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,080
When did he leave?

441
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
The day after you came.

442
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,880
We were supposed to go seal hunting.

443
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,680
Do you have any idea what this is?

444
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
Fuck.

445
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,200
One sec.

446
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

447
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
What is that?

448
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Hi.

449
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,120
Are you drunk?

450
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
So what?

451
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,280
You drive here?

452
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,600
Don't judge me.

453
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Come here.

454
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

455
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,840
Have you been working on
your Hollywood smile?

456
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,280
Is this for your...
your campaign posters?

457
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,760
- Stop it.
- Or what?

458
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,080
Where are you gonna send me
that's further away than Ennis?

459
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,400
Or to the North Pole with Santa?

460
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,680
That's funny. When I sent you here,
I was trying to help you.

461
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,920
You were a fuckin' mess.

462
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,640
That's not why you sent me here.

463
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,280
You were scared
I was gonna take your job.

464
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,400
Okay. You want the truth?

465
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,080
You were a better cop than me.
From day one.

466
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,080
But you were terrible with people.
And after...

467
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
What?

468
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
What?

469
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Go on.

470
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Say it.

471
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
Jake and Holden, it got worse.

472
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Bullshit.

473
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,360
What, are you saying
I got... I got too emotional?

474
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,560
No. You just got fucking shittier.

475
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,840
Told people
they sucked at their jobs.

476
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,800
It's 'cause
they sucked at their jobs.

477
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,320
Nobody wanted to work with you, Liz.

478
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,040
Nobody wants to work with you now!

479
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,320
You're still a fucking mess.

480
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Take a look around.

481
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,320
It's Christmas Eve
and you're here, busting my balls.

482
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,480
Yeah. You're here, too,
busting mine, aren't you?

483
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,320
Liz. Liz!

484
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,160
Do not fucking drive.

485
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,840
Fuck off, Ted.

486
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,640
<i>I ought to say, "No, no, no sir"</i>

487
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
<i>Mind if I move in closer?</i>

488
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,160
<i>At least I'm gonna say that I tried</i>

489
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,080
<i>What's the sense in hurting my pride?</i>

490
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,600
<i>I really can't stay</i>

491
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,960
<i>Baby, it's cold outside</i>

492
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,880
- Hello?
<i>- Evangeline Navarro?</i>

493
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,360
<i>This is Lieutenant James Ingram
of the Alaska Coast Guard.</i>

494
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,520
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

495
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
Is everything okay?

496
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Yeah.

497
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Go be with your family.

498
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
You sure?

499
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Yeah, go.

500
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
I'm sorry.

501
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
You're not.

502
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,880
What do you want me to do?

503
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,400
I want you to let me sleep.

504
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,640
Why don't you just say it?

505
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,800
That I ruined your life
and you didn't want to have the baby.

506
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
<i>Bitch!</i>

507
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,936
- Why the fuck you let her leave?
- What?

508
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,536
Ma'am, you can't come in here
after hours.

509
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
My sister.

510
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,320
Julia Navarro.
We checked her in earlier today

511
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,496
and you just let her
walk out the fuckin' door.

512
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,080
If... you want, I...
Here, let me check in the system.

513
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,576
What are you checking?
She's not fucking here.

514
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,920
Are you... Are you listening?

515
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,160
I'm... sorry, ma'am.

516
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,840
You don't even know
she's fucking gone.

517
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Are you kidding me?

518
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,520
On your computer,
does it say how the fuck

519
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,240
a mentally unstable patient

520
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,480
just fucking disappears?

521
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,256
Ma'am, this is...
this isn't a detention center.

522
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,720
It's a... it's a voluntary facility.

523
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,320
Well, it's a shit fucking facility.

524
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,400
You just let people fucking die!

525
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
What the fuck?

526
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,240
You're fucking kidding me?

527
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,680
Hey! We done nothin'!

528
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,960
- Just having a nightcap...
- Hey!

529
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,920
You motherfucker!

530
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,560
Hey, hey, fuck!

531
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,040
Fuck you!

532
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Get up.

533
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,640
Evangeline?

534
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,800
Jesus fucking Christ!

535
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
What the fuck happened?

536
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
Nothing.

537
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,520
But you should see the other guys.

538
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,480
Shit. Slow...

539
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,480
Holy Christ.

540
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,720
You lost a fucking tooth?

541
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,960
Just stay still.
Just... just stay still.

542
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
All right. Let me see.

543
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
How's this?

544
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,160
What, let me see that hand.

545
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,840
Oh, what's going on here?

546
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
No, don't.

547
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
What is this?

548
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,320
I don't know what it is.

549
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Fuck!

550
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,080
Oliver Tagaq left it for us.

551
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,840
- Wait...
- I'm just...

552
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
It's gonna sting.

553
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Okay. Yeah.

554
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Stay still.

555
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
Okay.

556
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,240
Okay.

557
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Why are you alone?

558
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,960
My brother went to Disneyland
with all the kids, so.

559
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
In life.

560
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,680
I'm... I'm not.

561
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,520
Yeah, you are alone.

562
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,640
I'm alone.

563
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,400
Danvers is alone.

564
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Rose...

565
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,400
Hey. Hey!

566
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Gee...

567
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,400
Baby, baby.

568
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
You're not.

569
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,240
You're not alone.

570
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Okay?

571
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
Nah.

572
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
Yeah.

573
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Forget it.

574
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,840
Fucking Christmas, right?

575
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,800
Since you're here...

576
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,440
I knew that you were gonna come.

577
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,800
And I've been thinking,
you know, you and me...

578
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,040
Oh, no.

579
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,480
- No... Qavvik, listen.
- I really think that we could do...

580
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,000
- Fuck!
- You're, it's good.

581
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,880
- Fuck!
- It's done. It's done.

582
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Fuck you, Qavvik!

583
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Fuck you!

584
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Fuck!

585
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Fuck!

586
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,520
- Fuck...
- That's okay.

587
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,960
It's okay. It's okay.

588
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,000
Baby. It's good. It's good.

589
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,360
It's okay.

590
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
Peek-a-boo!

591
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,880
<i>Baby</i>

592
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,720
<i>Twist and shout</i>

593
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,000
<i>Baby</i>

594
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,960
<i>- Twist and shout</i>
- I see you!

595
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,720
I see you...

596
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,360
Oh, your face. What happened?

597
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
What happened to you?

598
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,640
Was it... Was it Tagaq?

599
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,120
Hey, is Prior okay?

600
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
He's good.

601
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,880
Hey, what the fuck,
with the boots in the house?

602
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,360
Oliver Tagaq is gone.

603
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,320
He was gone when we got there.

604
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,360
Think he knew we were coming?

605
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,880
He left this.

606
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,040
- Fuck.
- What?

607
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,040
It was a stone.
With the spiral on it.

608
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,680
You lost it?

609
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,120
Yes, I did, all right?

610
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,040
And I also had a rough night, okay?

611
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,000
All right. Here, sit down.

612
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,280
Did you sleep down here?

613
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,640
- Maybe.
- Where... Where's Leah?

614
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,360
Oh, fuck sake.

615
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,120
Tell my mommy...

616
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
What?

617
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Is this his?

618
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,760
Holden's?

619
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,040
I don't know what
weird-ass shit you're thinking

620
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,560
but just stop it.

621
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,320
Dead people are dead.

622
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,560
Danvers...

623
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,160
No! There's no heaven,
there's no hell...

624
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,960
there's no ghosts fucking beyond.

625
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,960
There's nobody out there
just waiting for us, watching us.

626
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,240
Then why do you keep that around?

627
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,360
There. Happy?

628
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Okay, there's nothing except us.

629
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,480
We're here, Navarro.

630
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
Okay? Alone.

631
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,520
The dead are gone.

632
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,480
Fucking gone.

633
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,120
My sister killed herself last night.

634
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,400
What?

635
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,520
Just walked out into the sea.
Just walked.

636
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,120
Just kept going until she fell
into the freezing ocean.

637
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,840
And drowned.

638
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,840
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm...

639
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,720
Her body is coming today.

640
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,520
Her dead body.

641
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,360
They diagnosed her with
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder

642
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,080
borderline personality.

643
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,400
You wanna know
what was really wrong with her?

644
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,040
Oh, yeah, don't...

645
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,440
It takes us one by one.

646
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,160
And you know who's next?

647
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,040
Hey, listen to me.

648
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,720
You're an intelligent woman.
You don't have to believe that stuff.

649
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,080
I failed her, Liz.

650
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,240
You don't understand.

651
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,920
It's a curse.

652
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,560
My mother had it, too.
Something calls us, and we follow.

653
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,160
- Stop it.
- And it's calling me now.

654
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,800
- Stop it! Stop it!
- She's calling.

655
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,240
All right, you're doing the thing
that you did with Wheeler!

656
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,736
Okay, where... where...
You're... you're seeing something

657
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,240
you saw something in that room.

658
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,680
No, I didn't.

659
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,800
Yeah, you did.

660
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
I was there.

661
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,640
And you saw something in that room.

662
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,280
It was a ghost,
or some kind of spirit.

663
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,840
You saw something.

664
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,680
I saw nothing.

665
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
You're a liar.

666
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,880
You're a liar.

667
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,600
- What, Prior?
<i>- Hey, Chief.</i>

668
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,040
<i>We just got a call in.</i>

669
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,400
<i>Some fishermen spotted
something near the dredge.</i>

670
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,320
<i>Wait, I... I'm gonna send you
the photo.</i>

671
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,120
We already checked the dredges.

672
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,960
Clark wasn't there.

673
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,520
He's probably been moving around.

674
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,120
A dredge is a good place to hide.

675
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,160
You ever seen them
when they were still working?

676
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,640
When you were little?

677
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,920
The dredges?

678
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Yeah.

679
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
They were amazing.

680
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,240
Then the fucking things
just got abandoned.

681
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,960
Still out there rotting...

682
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,240
forgotten.

683
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,040
Aren't we all?

684
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,360
Clark!

685
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
Stop!

686
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,760
<i>Evangeline...</i>

687
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Navarro?

688
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,800
Stop where you are! Ennis Police!

689
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
Fucker.

690
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,920
Raymond Clark?

691
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,160
Hands over your head.

692
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,760
Let me see your hands.

693
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
Slowly.

694
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,640
Otis?

695
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,800
Otis Heiss?

696
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,560
Leave me alone.

697
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,400
Who gave you that coat?

698
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,880
Was it Raymond Clark?

699
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,400
Otis? Did he give you that coat?

700
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,280
Otis.

701
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,200
Talk to me.

702
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,600
Where is Raymond Clark?

703
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,400
He's gone!

704
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,120
He went back down to hide.

705
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,320
Where is he hiding?

706
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,600
Navarro?

707
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,240
Navarro.

708
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,160
Where you been?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

709
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,480
Otis! Where is he hiding?

710
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,320
He's hiding in the Night Country.

711
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,760
We're all in the Night Country now.
