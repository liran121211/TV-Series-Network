00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,772
<i>Twist and shout</i>

2
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,442
<i>Come on, come on, come on,
come on, baby, now</i>

3
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,693
<i>Come on, baby</i>

4
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,155
<i>Come on and work it on out</i>

5
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,781
<i>Work it on out</i>

6
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,537
<i>You know you look so good</i>

7
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,787
<i>Look so good</i>

8
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,040
Hey, man.
Have you seen my phone?

9
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,042
No, I don't know.

10
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,170
<i>Like I knew you would</i>

11
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,840
<i>You know you twist, little girl</i>

12
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,049
<i>Twist, little girl</i>

13
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,394
New data?

14
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,855
No, same.

15
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,073
You're too late, Veer, I'm finished.

16
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,075
This week, it's your turn.

17
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,694
Hey, Clark. Are you okay?

18
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,493
She's awake.

19
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,616
Yo! Delivery!

20
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,787
Emerson!

21
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,248
Your stuff's here!

22
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,208
I got your Funyuns!

23
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,212
Guys, come on! Goodies are here!

24
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,133
Nobody ever helps me around here.

25
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,181
Come on, could somebody
gimme a hand with this stuff?

26
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,521
Guys.

27
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,319
I need a signature.
Come on, I have to get back.

28
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,614
Anton?

29
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,619
Hello? Anybody?

30
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,415
Hello?

31
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,501
Hey!

32
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,879
Guys?

33
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:45,344
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

34
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,266
<i>Twist and shout</i>

35
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,601
<i>Come on, come on, come on</i>

36
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,894
<i>Come on, baby, now</i>

37
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,187
<i>Come on, baby</i>

38
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,856
<i>Come on and work it on out</i>

39
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,778
<i>You know you look so good</i>

40
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:17,668
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

41
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,045
Susie, where's your hairnet?

42
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,359
Not a whole lotta crab, huh?

43
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,049
Nah, it's been shit this year.

44
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,468
Getting worse every year.

45
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,889
Where's the ambulance?
We don't need nobody dyin' in here.

46
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,891
They're comin'. I was closer.

47
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,977
Y'all get your asses back to work!

48
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,563
Them loads ain't packin' themselves.

49
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,772
Let's go!

50
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,194
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

51
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,278
Sir?

52
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,992
Fucker's not gonna die.
He's just too drunk to get up.

53
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,286
Sir? Sir?

54
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,582
- Sir?
- I told you. He's just too wasted.

55
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,000
Did you hit this man, ma'am?

56
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,630
Asshole hit Blair, then I hit the asshole.

57
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,090
With a metal bucket?

58
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,720
What's your name, hon?
Who's your <i>Aaka?</i>

59
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,141
Did you or did you not hit this man
with a metal bucket, ma'am?

60
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,976
Damn right I hit him with a metal bucket.

61
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,270
You puttin' me away for that, hon?

62
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,647
Hell yeah. I mean...

63
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,275
Sir, I'd like to speak
with these women now.

64
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,905
- If he fuckin' dies...
- Now, sir.

65
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,163
Alright, what's the story here?

66
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,000
He hits me, I moved out,
he didn't like it.

67
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,462
She moved in with me, mind you.
Not with some guy.

68
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,424
- Did he...
- No, that's just the job.

69
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,594
Playin' with sharp things
after a first or second shift

70
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,638
on some other job will get you chopped.

71
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,722
You fucking bitch!

72
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,518
- You broke my fucking nose!
- Hey, hey!

73
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,355
- Miss, are you pressin' charges?
- What?

74
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,606
Damn right, she is.

75
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,901
Sir, you're under arrest
for assault and battery.

76
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,528
The fucking bitch hit me!

77
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,366
Fuck you too!
Fucking bitch-pig! Fuck!

78
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,348
I can't talk right now.

79
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:40,579
You actually on the phone?

80
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,207
You're on the fucking phone?

81
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,007
So this is what this place looks like
on the inside, huh?

82
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,924
You ever been out here?

83
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,386
Oh yeah, Liz, with my
polar chemistry Ph.D., you mean?

84
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,474
Can't find my glasses.

85
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,227
- Any vehicles missin'?
- Nope.

86
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,686
This is it.

87
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,069
We don't think that they
just went out for a stroll?

88
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,779
No.

89
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,324
Well, shit.

90
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,575
Yeah.

91
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,497
Just the third day of dark
and it's already gettin' weird.

92
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,965
Where is that fucking song?

93
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,475
- Where is it?
- Morning, Chief.

94
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,934
Where's...

95
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,396
Yeah, sorry, we can't turn that off.

96
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,063
It's gettin' on my nerves too.

97
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,024
Tried to cover it up,
muffle the sound a little.

98
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,568
There's no buttons.
Can't find the remote.

99
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,072
Those don't open.
That does not open.

100
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,491
Nah, those don't open either.

101
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,369
Look at that.

102
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,424
Not a Beatles fan, okay?

103
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,593
Alright, what do we know, Pete?

104
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,472
A supply guy found the station
empty this morning.

105
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,266
He called it in.

106
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,436
- The scientists' last contact was...
- Speak up, Peter.

107
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,979
I can hear him just fine.

108
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,773
So when was their last contact with town?

109
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,232
It was a week ago.

110
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,526
They called for some supplies.

111
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,820
And who's contacting the families?

112
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,783
Lulu, but they're
from all around the world,

113
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,202
so, ya know, takin' a minute.

114
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,705
And who pays for this place?

115
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,832
Government grants?

116
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,042
You askin' me?

117
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,836
I'll check on the funding.

118
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,548
Look what I found.

119
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,517
It's like they went to take a leak,

120
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,978
never came back.

121
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,939
Alright. Here we go.

122
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,110
Alright. Tsalal Station's been
operating for 18 years,

123
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,529
researching Arctic geology, biology,

124
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,700
<i>and the impacts of climate change.</i>

125
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,464
<i>Ralph Emerson, geology.</i>

126
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,593
<i>Anton Kotov, geophysics.</i>

127
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,804
<i>- All men, huh?
- Yep.</i>

128
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,435
<i>Li Jie, geobiology.</i>

129
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,981

<i>They live here all year long?
All alone? Just like monks?</i>

135
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,097
<i>What are they looking for?
Digging that ice up.</i>

136
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:12,268
<i>I think the origin of life?</i>

137
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,979
<i>That thing.</i>

138
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,626
Sat phones are back there.
These are the cells I could find.

139
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,168
This one was charging,

140
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,464
and that one was just there,
just like that.

141
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,509
- Dead battery.
- Who leaves their cell behind?

142
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,179
Well, it's not like there's a lotta
cell signal out there.

143
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,723
It's not like there's a lotta
anything out there.

144
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,852
Alright, well, let's get the cell records
and the radio log, Pete.

145
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,564
Yeah, that ham seems pretty fresh.

146
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,737
Alright, we're gonna call in rescue.

147
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,948
Let's get the choppers,
ping this site as an LKP,

148
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,867
and then 15 miles POA.

149
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,203
Word'll spread.

150
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,622
Their families will be upset.

151
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,043
And if these dorks turn out to be just out
on some geek expedition,

152
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,337
don't you wanna hold off for a bit?

153
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,463
No, Hank, I don't.

154
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,757
We're late to the party already.

155
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,302
The ham and the sandwich
may seem fresh,

156
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,054
but the mayo is like syrup.

157
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,682
Mayo doesn't go runny until a couple days
out of the fridge.

158
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,767
But your processed cold cuts,

159
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,853
they'll survive the apocalypse.

160
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,813
The things you learn when your kid

161
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,900
leaves their lunch in the back seat
of the car.

162
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,780
You were never much of a sandwich-makin'
kinda dad, was he, Pete?

163
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,576
Clothes in that washer stink.

164
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,412
It's gonna take wet clothes
a couple of days

165
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,373
to stink that bad.

166
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,502
These men disappeared
48 hours ago, at least.

167
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,711
Least.

168
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,884
Alright, let's take a look at that tongue.

169
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,308
Two days. Startin' to discolor.

170
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,560
Maybe it's not human.

171
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,605
It's human, all right.

172
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,565
See there?

173
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,527
That a bite?

174
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:27,985
No.

175
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:33,200
Those are marks
left by a repetitive behavior.

176
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,495
Remember that Native auntie
that we found a year ago,

177
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,288
- frozen solid?
- Yeah, yeah.

178
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,834
Outside Saint Joseph
of the Arctic, right?

179
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,669
Yeah. She had the same marks.

180
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,799
Comes from lickin' the thread
when you're fixin' the fishin' nets.

181
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,260
That is a native woman's tongue.

182
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,303
Jesus.

183
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,097
Dead or alive, you think?

184
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,685
Gonna have to wait until the lab
in Anchorage processes this baggie.

185
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,311
In the meantime, Hank?

186
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,729
Yup?

187
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,794
Why don't you hit up command
and see if they got

188
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:08,193
a tongue-less lady
in some fridge somewhere.

189
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,701
Prior, call Central.

190
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,412
Your father's havin' a brain fart.

191
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,330
Hey.

192
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,668
Lulu, Hank Prior.
Put me through to Central.

193
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,295
<i>Right on it, Hank.</i>

194
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,929
<i>Alright, folks,
Christmas is coming.</i>

195
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,722
<i>Can't stop it.</i>

196
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,391
<i>Ya have your presents lined up?</i>

197
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,893
<i>Yeah. Me neither.</i>

198
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,773
<i>We're gonna take calls, though.
Alright. Anyone out there? Hello?</i>

199
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,275
<i>Hello?</i>

200
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,160
<i>Is there anybody there?</i>

201
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,836
Hello, Travis.

202
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,803
What do you want?

203
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,444
- I left a few messages...
- Hey, Lulu.

204
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,239
...and I'm trying to reach
Dr. Molina's family.

205
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,657
Has he called?

206
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,620
You have a message.

207
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,998
- There's someone in your office...
- Coffee.

208
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,000
...but it's her.

209
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,608
- It's not her tongue.
- How do you know?

210
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,508
It's been six years.
Can't be her tongue.

211
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,385
But it's a woman's tongue?

212
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,594
I don't know.

213
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,848
Right. Let me see it, then.

214
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:01,849
No.

215
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,853
You got bounced off the case, 'member?

216
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,937
You're a trooper now.

217
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,274
You're not A.P.F. anymore, 'member that?

218
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,984
It's a woman's tongue.

219
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,987
It's an Inupiaq woman's tongue.

220
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,865
And you know this because

221
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,992
your spirit animal came to you in a dream?

222
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,037
Nah, my spirit animal eats
old fuckin' white ladies

223
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,747
like you for breakfast, Danvers.

224
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,833
Careful.

225
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,090
How's daddy Connelly?

226
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,133
Treatin' ya good?

227
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,554
Ah, right. Is that all, Trooper Navarro?

228
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,977
I'm sure you got some
caribou to scrape off the road somewhere.

229
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,417
You never even wanted
to look at her files.

230
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,857
And now you're just
brushin' her off like...

231
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,151
like she's...

232
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,073
Did you get all that?

233
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,202
What file is she talkin' about?

234
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,708
Alright, go look in the cold case files.
Get me Anne Masu Kowtok.

235
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,004
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Elizabeth Danvers?</i>

236
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,715
- Yeah.
<i>- This is Kerri Gillard.</i>

237
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,341
<i>Sheri's mom.</i>

238
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,301
<i>Sheri Gillard, from Leah's class?</i>

239
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,053
Oh, yeah. I can't talk to you right now.

240
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,639
<i>I really, really need to talk to you,
Mrs. Danvers.</i>

241
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,014
I'm gonna call you back later when...

242
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,434
<i>No, we need to talk now! Like, right now!</i>

243
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,022
<i>- She's 15 years old!
- I got it. I understand.</i>

244
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,523
15 years old!

245
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,028
Do you understand?

246
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,697
No, this is your daughter initiating this.

247
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,032
Alright, let's not escalate it.

248
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,367
Let's talk about it in a week,

249
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,993
see if it improves.

250
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,672
- I didn't do any...
- Shut up.

251
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,430
A video? Really?

252
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,932
You know, you don't have to

253
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,813
- freak out about...
- I'm not talkin' about it.

254
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,481
I thought you were
smarter than that, Leah.

255
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,693
Well, you know where those videos end up?

256
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,277
They end up on porn sites.

257
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,467
For the rest of your life,
every single time somebody

258
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:24,658
- looks you up...
- Okay, well, we didn't post it.

259
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,639
Her mom took her phone
and she freaked out.

260
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,619
- It was just for us...
- Don't be an idiot.

261
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,707
- People break up, 'kay? Phones get hacked.
- Oh, right.

262
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,335
Thanks, Chief Danvers.
All criminal angles noted.

263
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,838
Stop pretending like you give a shit now.

264
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,630
I don't give a shit!

265
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,135
But that woman was screaming
in my face because you...

266
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,889
- "You" what?
- Because you made a video of...

267
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,393
- Of what?
- Of you screwing a 15-year-old girl!

268
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,689
Okay? You made a video
that I had to watch...

269
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,653
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

270
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,719
- Did we hit something?
- Nah. We didn't hit anything.

271
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,785
It's okay. Leah, Leah.
It's just an ice slip. Alright?

272
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,164
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

273
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,333
It's Danvers.

274
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,877
<i>- Chief.</i>
- We got in an accident.

275
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,379
<i>Sending ambulance, Chief.</i>

276
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,880
Yeah, send an ambulance.

277
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,508
Possible injuries. We're at 5th and Front.

278
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,645
Is that fucking Stacy Chalmers again?

279
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,149
- I'm so sorry.
- Stacy, you idiot!

280
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,608
Are you fuckin' drunk?

281
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,714
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

282
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,821
Alright, get outta the car.

283
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,760
Get outta the car.

284
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:48,324
Hey, Mrs. Danvers.

285
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,286
Hey, you don't even have
your license anymore.

286
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,123
My baby! She's not speakin' to me!

287
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,500
Oh, for fuck's sake.

288
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,418
I'm so sorry.

289
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,795
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

290
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,713
Turn around! Come on!
Turn around!

291
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,718
Put your hands up right now!
Move it! Hands fuckin' up!

292
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,553
Fuckin' bitch!

293
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,159
She's 16.

294
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,827
What?

295
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,081
Sheri's 16, not 15.

296
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,210
Oh, for fuck's sake.

297
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,366
Agent Navarro, it's been a while.

298
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,576
Hey, Ryan.

299
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,995
You got a break in her case?

300
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,081
I'm not sure yet.

301
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,499
Want a beer?

302
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,460
The ex asked me to watch Evan tonight.

303
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,421
Wanna come over?

304
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,922
Yeah.

305
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,553
So, Annie never mentioned Tsalal?

306
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,473
Never talked about it?
Anything?

307
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,517
No.

308
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,604
You found Annie had some connection?

309
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,190
I don't know, just goin' over

310
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,818
any angle I might've missed back then,
you know?

311
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,530
Last of my stash.

312
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,909
No. Maybe just some water?

313
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,163
Water's bad.
Turned to shit about three days ago.

314
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,250
Annie'd say, "I told you so."

315
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,795
Look, don't take this wrong.

316
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,756
I loved my sister,

317
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,716
and I wish like hell she was still here,

318
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,471
but I'm not sure it'd do much good to go
through all this again.

319
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,892
Listen, you don't really think that, Ryan.

320
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,311
Hey.

321
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,106
Hey, listen to me.

322
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,109
I know it wasn't easy for you.

323
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:33,365
Annie protestin' the mine,
mine guys going at her.

324
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,742
- It was a mess.
- Yeah.

325
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,871
We got into some shit fights.

326
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,688
I told her,
"You kill the mine, you kill Ennis."

327
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:48,797
No jobs, no mine taxes,
no schools, nothin'.

328
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,174
She didn't care.

329
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,302
We were barely speakin' that last year.

330
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,731
Do you believe in God, Agent Navarro?

331
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Yes.

332
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,413
Mind if I ask why?

333
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,252
My last tour...

334
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,053
Listen.

335
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,351
It doesn't matter.

336
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,646
Must be nice.

337
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,650
What?

338
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,611
Knowing we're not alone.

339
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,407
No, we're alone.

340
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,661
God too.

341
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,548
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Navarro. Cooper here.</i>

342
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,133
<i>It happened again.</i>

343
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,928
<i>I'll be there right away.</i>

344
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,247
- Hey, Cooper.
- Hey, Ange.

345
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,289
How's Troopers?

346
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,292
You know, same shit, different badge.

347
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,003
So, she called in hysterics,

348
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,880
said there was someone
inside the apartment,

349
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,635
but the door is bolted from the inside
and the windows are all shut tight.

350
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,637
Thanks for the call.

351
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,391
Yeah, you got it.
It stays between us.

352
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,725
Thanks.

353
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,781
- Hey, Jules.
- Hey, Angie.

354
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,491
What's going on?

355
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,161
Nothing, I shouldn't have called.
I'm sorry.

356
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,415
It was just a little freak-out.

357
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,166
I'm okay.

358
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,460
I'm just tired.

359
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,962
Alright, so...

360
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,674
why don't you come over to my place,
we eat some junk food,

361
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,321
watch "The Bachelor," come on.

362
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:40,968
I never should've moved here.

363
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,887
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, Jules, Jules.

364
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,723
Come here. Hey, look at me. Hey.

365
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,227
I wanted you here.
I'm glad you're here, okay?

366
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,771
Listen, I'm not like Mom.

367
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,858
You are nothing like Mom.

368
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,569
You are not her, okay?

369
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,320
You hear me?

370
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,164
If you're worried, we can start talking
some options.

371
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:13,418
No hospitals.
You promised me no hospitals.

372
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,379
'Kay, so make sure you're good, Jules.

373
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,382
I'm okay. I promise.

374
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,010
I got this.

375
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,656
Alright, so, if you look at the funding,

376
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:49,746
most of the funding to Tsalal comes from
an NGO, but some of it

377
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,874
- comes...
- I want to go home!

378
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,510
- But if you try and...
- Please!

379
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,015
- Like she's dying.
- So...

380
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,393
Lemme go!

381
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,190
Oh, thanks.

382
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,025
- Here we go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

383
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,028
- What are you doin'?
- Putting us all out of our misery.

384
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,072
The fuck you are! She's still drunk.

385
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,656
Yeah, so, I'll drive her home.

386
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,702
Nah, I'm not letting a still-drunk DUI out
just because sometimes she blows you.

387
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,538
- Hey!
- End of story!

388
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,581
Back in. Back in!

389
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,795
I need some toilet paper!

390
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,507
You know, for the record,
I have a fiancée.

391
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,882
Oh, yeah?

392
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,405
Natasha from the catalog?

393
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:46,667
She's not from a catalog.

394
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:47,928
She's from Vladivostok,

395
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,973
and she's coming for Christmas.

396
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,891
We're getting married, just so you know.

397
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,060
A Christmas wedding. That's festive.

398
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,564
- This girlfriend stays in.
- Sorry, Stace.

399
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,399
- You heard the man.
- I hate you!

400
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,778
Yeah, and I need the Anne Kowtok file.
You got it.

401
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,613
- Do I?
- Yeah. It's at your place.

402
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,950
You took a bunch of case files home
after the flood.

403
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,160
I don't think so. I'll check.

404
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,287
- When?
- Soon.

405
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,665
- I hate you all!
- Shut up!

406
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,795
- He has the files?
- I hate you all!

407
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>What you doin' down there, Darwin?</i>

408
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,052
Doin' a drawin'?

409
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,598
Oh, what's this?

410
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,604
You do this?

411
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,275
Kayla?

412
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,026
Yeah?

413
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,113
What's this?

414
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,241
Just a local legend.

415
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,787
You leave him at the laundromat
with your grandma?

416
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,330
- Yeah, I did.
- Right.

417
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,874
- You know why?
- Okay.

418
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,918
Yeah, I'm sorry I was late.

419
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,628
It's just the Tsalal thing.

420
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,229
- It's been kinda crazy, so.
- It's fine.

421
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,257
It's all good, but I have classes,

422
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,218
so my grandma's there
to take care of Darwin,

423
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,014
and she happens to like
to tell him stories from his culture.

424
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:16,558
Alright, so when the stories that
his grandma tells him,

425
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,104
they give him bad dreams,
I can just put you on the phone, right?

426
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,774
You'll talk to him,
explain why it's important.

427
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,150
You're such a white boy.

428
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,154
How the hell did I fall for a white boy?

429
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,499
Oh, no you don't.

430
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,959
Seriously?

431
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,897
I gotta take this.

432
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,486
Fuck!

433
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,363
- Kayla!
- Seriously?

434
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,742
- It's work.
- Work ends at six. That's Danvers.

435
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,412
I gotta take it. Fuck.

436
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,706
- Hey, Chief.
<i>- I need you to get me something</i>

437
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,040
<i>from your dad's.</i>

438
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,604
Sorry, Chief.

439
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:24,167
No. Please?

440
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,003
<i>Did I hear no?
Weird.</i>

441
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:30,633
<i>Yeah, I think it was a no.
Must be the connection.</i>

442
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,192
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

443
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,529
Everything okay?

444
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,407
Yeah, I promised Darwin

445
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,077
I would show him an old photo of me
when I was his age.

446
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,038
- Ah, okay.
- You mind if I take a look?

447
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,665
Ah, that's fine.

448
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,425
Yeah, careful. Still wet.

449
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,012
That is

450
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,889
really blue.

451
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,808
Well, Alina likes blue.

452
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,605
Too blue?

453
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,483
It's blue, but...

454
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,610
Too damn blue.

455
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,070
No. No, no, no. It's great.

456
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,908
- It's a change.
- Yeah, you want a beer?

457
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,577
No. I'm good, thank you.

458
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,707
Fuck.

459
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,711
- You sure?
- Yeah.

460
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,299
Actually, you got anything to eat?

461
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,928
Like, chips or somethin'?
I'm starvin'.

462
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,305
Let me check.

463
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,605
Pretty tapped out.
I gotta grocery shop.

464
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,482
You want an apple?

465
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,484
No, I'm good.

466
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,447
You want to go out, grab a bite?

467
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,954
Nope. I promised I'd put
Darwin to bed, so.

468
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,880
Let me see what you took.

469
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,436
Didn't know I still had that.

470
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,501
Watch yourself on the ice.

471
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:52,149
It's slick as shit out there.

472
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,624
You take Darwin to see Santa yet?

473
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,918
Not yet, but I'm working on it.

474
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,859
Well, dude, you better be
or else Kayla's gonna kick your pink ass.

475
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,801
I think I liked it better when I babysat
and she couldn't talk back.

476
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,011
Thanks.

477
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,805
So this case is connected to Tsalal?

478
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,806
No.

479
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,683
- No?
- No.

480
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,102
That's all I get?

481
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,898
Chief, my dad is gonna kill me
if he finds out I took these.

482
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,193
Alright, take the Christmas tree box
into the living room.

483
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,152
- Did you eat?
- Nope.

484
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,782
- When have I got time to fuckin' eat?
- Well, you gotta eat.

485
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,412
The body was found on the edge
of the Villages.

486
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,414
Navarro was the first on the scene.

487
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,842
{\an8}Her name was Anne Masu Kowtok.

488
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,055
People called her Annie K.

489
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,100
Stabbed 32 times

490
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,645
with a sharp, unidentified object.

491
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,815
Star-shaped wounds.

492
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,026
Murder weapon never found.

493
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,236
Missing tongue?

494
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,698
Yeah. Never recovered.

495
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,744
I knew about the dead girl
out in the Villages, but...

496
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,038
I didn't know about the tongue.

497
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,042
Yep, we kept that from the public.

498
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:24,342
She was a midwife, activist, protester.

499
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,763
You know, fighting the mine like crazy,
drivin' everybody nuts.

500
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,765
Workers, mine folks.

501
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,059
A lotta haters.

502
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,687
But this?

503
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,608
Nobody deserves that.

504
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,782
You lied to her.

505
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,617
Navarro.

506
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,329
You do know the case.
You studied it.

507
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,041
Mind your own business, kid.

508
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,210
You made it my business
when you asked me to steal these for you.

509
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,379
I asked you to relocate them.

510
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,220
Fine. I will relocate them back to my dad,
and you can ask him for them.

511
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,015
You bluff for shit, you know that?

512
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,603
Alright. Okay. Sit down.
It's gettin' cold.

513
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,189
Here's the story.

514
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,857
Navarro was obsessed with the case.

515
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,486
She's got this thing
about women who get hurt.

516
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:24,569
I don't know.

517
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,114
She didn't get anywhere with it,
but she wouldn't let it go

518
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,075
and started buggin' the wrong people.

519
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,160
Mine people.

520
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,080
Kate McKittrick, specifically.

521
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,955
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

522
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,958
Showed up at her house,
started demanding answers,

523
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,880
and she got in a couple of fights
with some mine workers.

524
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,632
Your dad had to take her off the case.

525
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,176
And when I came to town

526
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,638
we started working together, and

527
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,848
she asked me to pick it back up.

528
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,433
And you didn't?

529
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,854
This one was never gonna be solved.

530
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,439
What do you mean?

531
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,983
Ennis killed Annie.

532
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,985
This fucking place.

533
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,114
No killer was ever gonna be found.

534
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,663
That a Tinder match or somethin'?

535
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,081
Fantasy football.

536
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,873
I got two running backs on I.R.

537
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,085
I got a wide receiver who's a klutz.

538
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,754
I don't know who the fuck
I'm gonna start on Sunday.

539
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,776
- Evangeline.
- Qavvik.

540
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,636
Wait, fuck.

541
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,390
Wait!

542
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,163
Fuck, Gi.

543
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,215
Fuck.

544
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,555
SpongeBob? Really?

545
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,351
SpongeBob is cool.
He cleans your teeth.

546
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,353
He lives in a pineapple.

547
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,897
Hey, what are you doing?

548
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:09,693
Don't do that. No.
It's disgusting. No.

549
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,161
I gotta go.

550
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,830
Your sister?

551
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,166
Why, has she been actin' off?

552
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,709
No. She's...

553
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,505
she's just been missing some work,
it's nothing major.

554
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,467
Gotta swing by the booze depot.

555
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:38,889
Don't go.
You can take a gallon of my homebrew.

556
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,475
Yeah.
I don't wanna go blind yet.

557
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,312
My homebrew brings
all the boys to the yard.

558
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,316
Are you tellin' that to a cop, Qavvik?

559
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,914
{\an8}Hey.

560
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,336
Next time you call,
I'm not gonna pick up the phone.

561
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,430
Hey.

562
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,474
No, that's my toothbrush.

563
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,851
Well, I need it!

564
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,739
Hey, about earlier.

565
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,035
You mean about you makin' dirty videos?

566
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,869
No.

567
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,040
About people driving drunk.

568
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,839
Ya know, it's really stupid
that we never talk about that day.

569
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,678
We're doin' Christmas this year.

570
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,597
I'm gonna cook.

571
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,979
Ya know, you don't really
have to be my mom, Liz.

572
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,399
Think my dad would've understood.

573
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,571
I'm takin' a shower.

574
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,209
- Night, Manny.
- Night, officer.

575
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,796
She's gonna come right back
begging for this,

576
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:35,463
and I'm gonna give it to her so hard,

577
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,882
her eyes are gonna pop right off that
fugly face of hers,

578
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,302
and I'm gonna stuff her mouth with all
the fuckin' bills

579
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,762
- I've been payin'.
- Yeah, man.

580
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:42,763
Bitch broke my fucking...

581
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,910
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

582
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,735
<i>Mommy?</i>

583
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:19,633
Holden?

584
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,220
<i>She's awake.</i>

585
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,583
<i>Hi, Miss Irniq.
Thanks for returning my call.</i>

586
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,041
<i>I hope I didn't wake you up.</i>

587
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,710
<i>- I'm not sleeping much these days.</i>
- No, no.

588
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,882
I was just going through some old notes,
filing some stuff,

589
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,758
reaching out to Annie's contacts.

590
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:06,221
Do you remember Annie
ever mentioning the Tsalal Station?

591
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,850
<i>Tsalal? That place with the scientists?</i>

592
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,060
Hello?

593
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,189
Ma'am, hello?

594
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,357
<i>She's awake!</i>

595
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,189
Ennis Police! Step out slowly.

596
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,326
This is an A.P.F. investigation.

597
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,287
I have a badge.

598
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:26,291
A trooper's badge. You're trespassin'.

599
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,420
Trespassing, huh?

600
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,548
You gonna book me?

601
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,931
Still really carry it, don't you?
Annie's case.

602
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,328
We carry 'em all.

603
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:44,893
No, we don't.

604
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,063
What are you lookin' for?

605
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,275
I don't know.
Anything that might've belonged to her.

606
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,611
A shoe, an earring.

607
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,779
A coat?

608
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,078
Alright. You can look around, this once,

609
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,039
but the Tsalal men's case is mine.

610
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,666
What coat?

611
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,043
This one.

612
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,261
So you did look into the case,
didn't you?

613
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:23,306
- Back then.
- Yeah. It doesn't mean shit.

614
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,852
It's one parka.
Could be thousands of 'em.

615
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,772
Right.

616
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,942
So what are you doin' here, then?

617
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,360
Just followin' up.

618
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,995
The only one with a room of his own.

619
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,914
Well, which one is him?

620
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,835
Raymond Clark.

621
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:57,382
Yeah, I've never seen this guy before.
He's not in any of our photos.

622
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,049
Nowhere.

623
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,053
How about Annie's brother?
Miner guy?

624
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,640
Ryan.
Yeah, I'll show him a photo.

625
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,519
That's it.

626
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,605
It's not here.

627
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,023
No parka.

628
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,652
- Maybe he had it on when they...
- When they went poof?

629
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,991
You don't really think
they're gonna find them, do you?

630
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,703
You're the one who believes in miracles.

631
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,038
Pickin' up any spirit vibes?

632
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,791
Nope. All I'm pickin' up is
your shitty fuckin' attitude.

633
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:41,009
<i>Five, acknowledge.
Movin' to sector 2-7-8.</i>

634
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,517
Better watch out.

635
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,895
That case sunk ya once.

636
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,025
The case didn't sink me.

637
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:00,362
You asked me to transfer to Troopers.

638
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,112
Had nothin' to do with Annie.

639
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,115
We both know what really happened.

640
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,826
Are you done?

641
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,121
Annie's case isn't closed.

642
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,208
It's not closed.

643
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,418
Just let her go.

644
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,672
Let that poor girl go.

645
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,259
"Let her go."

646
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,847
You didn't find her.

647
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,443
You didn't see the hate.

648
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,199
You could see the disgust
in the way they cut her.

649
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,957
Forensics showed that someone kicked her
after they dumped her dead body, Liz.

650
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:58,837
Poor girl's just lyin' there,
and they still kick her.

651
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,757
<i>Broken teeth, broken ribs.</i>

652
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,469
And then they cut out her tongue.

653
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,265
To shut her the fuck up.

654
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,936
Wouldn't've happened
if she was white, though.

655
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,062
Wouldn't've made any difference

656
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,731
- what color her skin was.
- Yes the fuck it would have.

657
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,400
They would've had the whole
fuckin' police force out

658
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,734
lookin' for a white ass.

659
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,236
No, you're not gonna blame her on me.

660
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,531
And I wasn't even here.
You know who was here?

661
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,450
You. You were here.

662
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,370
It was your case all those months.
You didn't close it.

663
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,580
You.

664
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,791
Exactly.

665
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,533
Did you get the cell records?

666
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:51,181
<i>No, we got a call.</i>

667
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,059
<i>They found something on the ice.</i>

668
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,853
<i>Chief?</i>

669
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,314
<i>Chief, can you hear me?</i>

670
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,067
Yeah, talk to me, Prior.

671
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,446
<i>Rose Aguineau, Chief.</i>

672
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,823
<i>Rose Aguineau found it.</i>

673
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,147
- Hey, Rose.
- Morning, Missy.

674
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:45,151
- How did you find them?
- Travis showed me.

675
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,825
Travis.

676
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,203
Travis is dead, Rose.

677
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,788
I know.
