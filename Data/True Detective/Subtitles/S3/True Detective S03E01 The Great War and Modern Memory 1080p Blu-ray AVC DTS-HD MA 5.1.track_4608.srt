I can't find them anywhere.

177
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,410
Listen, we need a bunch of people
out here right now.

178
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,704
Okay, you need to be on every street,
down in the woods...

179
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,581
All right, Mr. Purcell,
slow down, please.

180
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,791
Take us through what happened,
you could,

181
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,585
so we can know the right thing
to do next.

182
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,261
Went riding their bikes, around 4:00.
Supposed to be home by 5:30.

183
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,972
They were supposed
to go by a friend's house.

184
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,557
Kid says he never saw them.

185
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,393
<i>Never occurred to you
he might be lying?</i>

186
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,270
Of course it did.

187
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,316
General rule is, everybody's lying.
Peflod.

188
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,653
First impression, though, no.

189
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,073
I did not believe he was fabricating.
Not about this.

190
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,408
"About this"?

191
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:59,913
Yeah. I mean, I checked around

192
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,415
if he was honest about
his overtime or his height.

193

194
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,546
What is this, really?

195
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,966
Y'all know something I don't?

196
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,802
Well, we don't know what you know.

197
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,097
So we can't really answer that.

198
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,685
I was deposed when the man's family

199
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,396
tried getting the conviction
overturned in '90.

200
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,692
Then worked the case again
when it was reopened.

201
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,653
That's when my wife
published the book.

202
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,240
Wish you could've
talked to her. (CHUCKLES)

203
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:42,956
I used to think back then
it was before 'Nam and after 'Nam.

204
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:49,045
But more it's
before the Purcell case and after.

205
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,966
And it keeps coming back.

206
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,510
And here we are.

207
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,305
What is it, 2015?

208
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,641
Come back again.

209
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,937
And your wife's book,
which is now, well,

210
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,481
it's considered a classic
of literary nonfiction.

211
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,153
Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,657
She did a good job.

213
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,204
She was a good...

214
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,835
She was a good writer.

215
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,714
Good teacher...

216
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,342
Good investigator, really.

217
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,303
She was good at lots of things.

218
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,432
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.

219
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,809
A few years back...

220
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,733
We made plans. I retired and...

221
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,864
It just got me thinking.

222
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,950
(INHALES, EXHALES HEAVILY)

223
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,496
Those kids. My kids. My wife.

224
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,387
I'm sorry.

225
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,181
Guess I'm just missing her today.

226
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:31,189
Your wife, Mr. Purcell.
She expected back tonight?

227
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,485
I think.

228
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,614
I don't know.

229
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,699
Any chance the kids could be with her?

230
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,035
No. No, no chance.

231
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,870
ROLAND: Have you talked to her?

232
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,914
TOM: Well, not since this morning.

233
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,583
She waitresses down at The Sawhorse.

234
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,587
She's out with her friends now,
and I can't reach her.

235
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,298
Get the APB out right away.

236
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,551
I need as many troopers
as Highway can spare.

<i>K-9 trackers.</i>

238
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,804
If State's isn't available,
check with the sheriffs.

239
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,681
We're gonna search the fields,
the woods,

240
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,766
put patrols on every street.

241
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,852
High beams out.
I wanna light all this up.

242
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,186
TOM: Ain't you gonna call the FBI?

243
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,897
I mean, that's what they do on TV.

244
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,317
Takes 72 hours, sir.
We don't know yet if...

245
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,904
We have to wait on that.

246
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,657
You two. Start canvassing neighbors.

247
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,784
Ask if they saw the kids,
anything unusual.

248
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,662
ROLAND: Any other relatives
the kids might be with?

249
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,374
TOM: No. No, my parents
are in Shreveport, and Lucy's passed.

250
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,587
You know what? Talk to Ronnie Boyle.
Will's friend.

251
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,256
You know, I could take y'all
out to the playground.

252
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,716
Okay, sure.

253
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,595
Mind if we look around the house while
we wait on the other officers?

254
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,722
They're not in the fucking house.

255
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,016
ROLAND: Yes, sir, but sometimes,

256
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,351
might be some kind of clue
where they went,

257
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,061
if they had other plans.

258
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,564
- What? Why would they...
- WAYNE: Just saying, sir.

259

It's been known to do some good.

260
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,567
We have to consider all possibilities.

261
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,651
TOM: Yeah.

262
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,406
- Whatever. You know, do what you want.
- Mr. Purcell...

263
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,242
Take the house apart, you want.
Flip on the TV. Grab yourself a beer.

264

I know you want to do that, sir,

266
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:14,501
but I promise,
we're getting that handled.

267
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,419
We need you nearby,

Huh?

272
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,890
Yes, sir.

273
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,936
Can you take us through the house?

274
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:35,980
Please?

Well, go on. Knock yourself out.

took the kids?

if that's the case.

the Wife had taken off with the kids</i>

they have any clothes missing or not.

350
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,839
NEIGHBOR: <i>I didn't see the children.</i>

351
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:03,719
But I saw some older boys, teenagers,
in a purple Volkswagen Bug.

352
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,098
I wasn't home until after 7:00.

353
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,852
I saw the two kids
riding out toward the park.

354
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,563
But I didn't see any teenagers.

355
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,608
But I know they hang around
at Devil's Den.

356
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:22,154
I hear things,
about what they do out there.

357
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,408
NEIGHBOR 2: Yeah, sometimes, like,

358
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,160
out by the ranger tower
at the edge of the park,

359
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,038
people hang out, listen to music.

360
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:35,084
Um, that Volkswagen is
Freddy Burns', I think.

361
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,963
I seen that "Trash Man" fella.
I don't know his name.

362
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:42,633
Rides around town in a go-cart,
picking through garbage. (CHUCKLES)

363
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,385
Everybody knows him.

364
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,638
Patty, what's that
"Trash Man" guy's name?

365
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,058
His last name's Woodard, I think.

366
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:56,188
I saw him riding around
when I was looking for the kids.

367
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:01,068
He drives a go-cart
and tows this little trailer.

368
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:04,572
He picks up trash and sells it
at the scrapyard, I guess.

369
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:05,865
Been around for years.

370
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:07,992
I never liked him.

371
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,453
Going through other people's trash.

372
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,580
Any idea where he lives?

373
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,752
We're sorry for the personal nature
of these questions,

374
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,546
but we need to know everything we can.

375
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,800
How long you folks
been sleeping separate?

376
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,679
- Few months.
- About six months.

377
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:30,973
- Since beginning of summer.
- LUCY: Hasn't been that long.

378
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:34,101
TOM: Yeah, it has. Dan left last May,
then I took the couch.

379
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,771
- Dan?
- He's my cousin.

380
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,522
Stayed with us a few weeks
Iastspflng.

381
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,191
He's like an uncle to the kids.

382
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,359
And what's his last name?

383
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:45,529
O'Brien. Same as mine. Used to be.

384
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,615
Where's he live?

385
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,992
He's up in Springfield, Missouri.

386
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,329
But he hasn't seen the family
in a long time.

387
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:54,830
He stayed there on the couch?

388
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:58,084
No, he stayed in Will's room.
Will was on the couch.

389
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,051
Would you write down his contact info?

390
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,386
Phone number and address.

391
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,931
What for? Been gone since May.

392
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,266
Just have to check out
anything we can.

393
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,062
Sometimes, there's tension
between the parents,

394
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,397
or fighting and whatnot.

395
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,025
Kids'II make like to run away.

396
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,902
They didn't run away, God damn it.

397
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,405
Why don't you go find
that "Trash Man" bastard

398
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,990
and ask him some questions?

399
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,701
- Did you talk to Ronnie Boyle?
- ROLAND: We did.

400
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,037
Hadn't seen Will since school.

401
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,498

since 3:00.

Do I need to stop?

411

No, uh, we're okay.

412
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,322
Sorry about that.

413
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,866
Please, continue, Mr. Hays.

415
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,496
Had maybe 15 guys
out that first night.

416

Um...

454
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,194
Maybe 4:30,
4:45 we got there, I think.

455
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:39,656
And that was you,
Ryan Peters and this Lampanella boy?

- Anybody drinking?
- No, sir.

457

about those missing kids?

Yeah, I seen them around.

460
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,761
I think we saw them.

461
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,513
You saw them?

462
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,348
Riding their bikes.

463
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,684
Yesterday. We passed them
when we were driving.

464
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,728
What time was that?

465
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,774
Maybe 4:15. Before we got to the park.

466
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,943
You saw them riding their bikes
in the neighborhood?

467
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,778
Yes, sir.

00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,781

A little after.

00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:35,629
Let me ask you.

475
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,133
What's up with this?

476

I mean, it's... It's just a band.

478
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,519
What's a Black Sabbath?

479
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,272
It's a satanic mass.

480
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,568
Is that true? It's satanic?

481
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,945
I think it's just their name.

482
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,750

these children yesterday?

483
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,047

486
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,143
They were out playing in the park.

487
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,020
You saw them in the park?

488
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,484
Were they up at the tower
when y'all were hanging out?

489
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,361
No.

490
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,198
I mean, I don't think so.

491

But you don't know.

492
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,661
I don't know all the kids that
were playing out there, you know?

493
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,330
There were other kids out there?

494
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,832
Yeah. They weren't with us.

495
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,336
There were a couple kids
playing with firecrackers

496
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:01,715
and younger kids just running around,
but we didn't talk to them.

497
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,009

498
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,221
No.

499
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,557

Any sense you might've had?

501
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,192
He's a good student.

502
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,988
Quiet, polite in homeroom.

503
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:26,990
He's very advanced in English.

504
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,496
As far as home, I don't really know.

505
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,915
I don't know either of his parents.

506
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,626
But he's a nice boy.

507
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,672
He has a sensitivity.

508
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,676
You always worry a bit
about the sensitive ones.

509
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,094
Hmm.

510
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,429
There's a few of the older boys here,

511
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,515
you know, they make it hard
on the others.

512
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,768
But I never saw Will
getting any trouble.

513
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:56,645
