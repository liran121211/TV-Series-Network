00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,354
Hell of a day when a gunfight's

3
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,940
the second most exciting thing
happens to you.

4
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,279
I was trying to hold out.

5
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,781
Make you wait a bit.

6
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,828
You seem like the type
that kind of thing matters.

7
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,540
You don't have to do that.

8
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,209
What?

9
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,004
Check and see if I'm judging you.

10
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,172
I'm not.

11
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,649
I was so glad you weren't hurt.

12
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,110
Came close.

13
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,199
First time I fired my weapon
on the job.

14
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:45,916
You fired your weapon before,
in the war?

15
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,255
I wanna hear about your stuff.

16
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,258
How you got here, your past.

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,638
Honestly, I never give it thought.

18
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,854
One thing I learned, the war?

19
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,857
Life happens now.

20
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,986
And Iater's now, you know?

21
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,697
It's never behind you.

22
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,660
And I'm not avoiding the question,

23
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,539
just really don't spend time
remembering stuff.

24
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,337
That's like a superpower to me.

25
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,383
I can't even understand that,
how you do it.

26
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,593
Just lucky, I guess.

<i>I don't know what he did with him.</i>

33
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,306
That certainly sounds like
an indictment.

34
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,561
And according to the file,
he didn't have an alibi the night of.

35
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,605
You two never kicked that very hard,
did you?

36
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,023
You ignored that?

No. We'll do it.

00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,290
- That was her, wasn't it?
- Sit down, Tom.

- I don't wanna sit down right now.

What?

the night of the incident,

63
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,718
couple of neighbors saw you
working in the garage, early evening.

64
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:28,847
Don't have anybody saw you after 6:30.

You leave the house
and forgot to tell us?

No.

71
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,079
No. Iwent back inside,
I had a couple beers

72
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,457
and listened to the Cardinals game,
same as I told you.

73
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,376
Julie's room...

74
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,880

A what?

77
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,181
<i>Like a peephole. For spying.</i>

78
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,851
<i>Ever look in on her? Julie?</i>

79
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,562
<i>Maybe while she was getting dressed?</i>

80
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,693
Some question, wasn't there,
whether she was yours?

81
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,487
Lucy passed it around a lot,
what we hear.

I fed her, got up in the night.

She's mine. That child is mine.

How could you,
after everything you know,

86
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:41,378
you think I could
do something like that?

00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,255
Do you? You?

88
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,092
- Did you give her to somebody, Tom?
- What?

89
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,595
- Was she trying to get away from you?
- What?

out of a situation with you?

- What? Why?
- Did Will know? Did he catch you?

I can't believe we missed this.

103
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,185
I mean, could he have
colluded with Woodard?

104
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,689
Come to that, could he have planted
the items in Woodard's house?

105
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,277
There's no evidence
right now for an arrest.

106

Hold him for the 24.

that points in his direction.

for his place.

where that call came from, too.

consider it as an indictment,

off of a payphone.</i>

about the backpack?

You were pretty convinced
it was planted.

to use on him yet.

They think
it's too good an opportunity.

I get troubled calling what happened
an "opportunity."

146
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,298
That's their word.

147
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,804
You can't expect the world to conform
to Wayne Hays's moral semantics.

148
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,849
Right.

149
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,685

isn't it?

So, that's my imagination,

seeing you
like you can't breathe in here?

159
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,296
Yeah, it's your imagination.

160
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,965
Telling yourself stories about me,
my motives.

161
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,842
I could tell stories.

162
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,386
Why you're all of a sudden
working on a book you already wrote.

163
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,181
What you looking for out there,
you're not finding here.

<i>His place. Talked to his bosses.</i>

00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,742
I remember talking to y'all back then.

167
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,121
Yeah, he quit before
the school bus factory closed.

168
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,376
Tell you the truth,
he was on his way out

169
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,171
even before what happened.

170
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,214
Why's that?

171
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,301
Caught him drinking on the job
more than once.

172
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,220
Machines are dangerous
around that shit.

173
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,183
Always asking for a loan.
And, you know,

174
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,936
didn't quite get along
with the rest of the guys.

175
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,854
How do you mean?

176
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,106
I didn't wanna say anything back then,

177
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,903
but a few of the boys had around
saw him going into a queer club.

178
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,782
They got on him a lot, after.

179
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,622
So, he's not
the saint of all suffering.

180
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,126
Everybody's got weaknesses.

181
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,172
Don't mean he did that to his kids.

182
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,924
Looking less and less to me
like they were his kids.

183
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,220
Devil's Den was a homo cruising spot.

184
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,639
The kids weren't
supposed to be out there.

185
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,767
- If Tom was...
- Fuck off.

186
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,479
We know they were meeting
somebody else out there.

187
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,565
Tom wouldn't do that.

188
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,108
- This.
- Hey.

189
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,152
If he wouldn't, then we'll clear him.

190
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,948
But we gotta get this right.
You saw at the station.

191
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,702
Kindt and Blevins are hot for it.

192
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,247
If it's not him,

193
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,416
we clear him.

194
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,585
But we don't stop.

195
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,129
Take it all the way this time.

196
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,847
I remember 1980.

197
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,755
You're supposed to be at home.

198
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,924
Detective Hays.

199
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,636
Your shooting cleared. No surprise.

200
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,055
What's the latest on Roland?

201
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,807
Gets to keep the leg.

202
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,643
Won't be the same,
but it's a lot better

203
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,019
than Diller and Bowen got.

204
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,189
WARREN: They found the boy's backpack.
Girl's shirt.

205
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,900
Both at Woodard's place.

206
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,236
KINDT: Yeah, it was him.

207
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,946
What?

208
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,534
No, something's wrong here.

209
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,245
If it was him, that ain't all of it.

210
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,582
Other people involved.
Kids were meeting somebody.

211
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,168
KINDT: Jesus Christ, you were there.
WARREN: Wayne.

212
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,086
You see what's happening out here?

213
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,089
Press is making the county
3 Hee Haw sideshow.

214
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,507
May have gotten some help with that.

215
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,926
Okay, Detective,
stick to the evidence.

216
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,970
And it only goes one way.

217
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,474
Even makes sense for the kidnap note.
Cut-out words, misspelling.

218
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,018
It was Woodard.

219
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,811
Then where's the girl?

220
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,106
He had a couple of oil drums
he made into an incinerator.

221
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,192
Evidence suggests he burned the body.

222
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,986
- Are we sure?
- KINDT: She's dead.

223
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,948
Let's not draw out
the family's pain any longer.

224
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,910
Our official position is
Woodard murdered both children.

225
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,245
That's it. Take some time.

226
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,208
- Probably a medal in this.
- Warren, I don't wanna take time.

227
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,001
I don't give a shit about medals.
I'm telling you...

228
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,755
Enough. He killed 10 people, Wayne.
You were there.

229
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,882
It's done.

230
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,802
This community needs to heal,
Detective. We're the first step.

231
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,266
And state law allows conviction in
absentia under special circumstances.

232
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,477
Our offices are gonna need
all evidence,

233
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,896
your investigative records,
everything.

234
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,858
Twelve people.

235
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:48,985
What?

236
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,531
You putting the kids on him,
that means he killed 12 people,

237
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,909
<i>not 10.</i>

238
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,247
Just so you keep
your stories straight.

239
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,460
ELISA: The cousin, Dan O'Brien,

240
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,589
his remains were found in a drained
quarry in southern Missouri.

241
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,425
Do you think
this could connect to Tom?

242
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,886
I don't know.

243
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,888
Couldn't say.

244
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:22,310
Well, what happened with Tom,
Lucy, now her cousin Dan...

245
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,312
We also had to talk to all the cops

246
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,440
who worked the Woodard scene
backin'80.

247
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:32,195
I believe that's what we did next,
or around then.

248
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,532
Because the thought was that Tom
may have planted the evidence there?

249
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,327
Well, we had to look
at the possibility.

250
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,000
Or maybe they worked together,
him and Woodard.

251
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:52,132
You know, it's terrible
what this work makes you ponder.

252
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,219
Don't you think?

253
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,141
Might've seen him. Hard to say.

254
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,642
Had a lot of Iookie-loos
around the place.

255
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,602
And you're the one found the backpack?

256
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,440
Yeah. Yeah, I found it.

257
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,067
Then Harris said
looked like that boy's.

258
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,861
- That's Harris James?
- Yeah.

259
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,946
Says he left the force.

260
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,781
Oh, yeah, 3 long time ago.

261
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,992
You know what he's doing now?

262
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,759
"Chief Security Officer."

263
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,095
How do I get something like that?

264
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,306
Well, I moonlighted security
at the plant

265
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,725
for about five years
when I was a patrolman.

266
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,853
When the spot opened up here,
I was in the right place.

267
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,148
I don't know why a lieutenant
would wanna switch careers.

268
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,651
That matter, I don't know I ever heard
a lieutenant working the field.

269
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,654
It's a special situation.

270
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,117
If I get your salary,
I'll switch to any career they say.

271
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,329
What, you look at my paycheck?

272
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,915
Pretty depressing from my end.

273
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,625
(CHUCKLES)

274
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,087
ROLAND: You took the job May '81?

275
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,381
That's right.

276
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,592
We're backtracking. The Purcell case.

277
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,805
Got it down you were the one
spotted the bag.

278
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,473
JAMES: NO, I didn't find it.

279
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,811
I was the first to think
I recognized it, off the APB.

280
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:31,689
Well, we've been wondering why it took
two days to find that backpack.

281
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,942
Took God six days to make the world.

282
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,613
I can believe it took a bunch of GEDs
two days to find a backpack.

283
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,495
The kids' father.

284
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,582
You ever see him out there
when you were processing the scene?

285
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,837
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I saw him
in the field across the street.

286
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,004
Watching.

287
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,423
ROLAND: What was he doing?

288
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,175
Just staring.

289
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,387
Stood there looking at the house,
or what was left of it.

290
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,305
Long time.

291
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,143
You know, the kids' mother
used to work up here.

292
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,978
Back in '79.

293
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,063
Well, unless she worked
10:00 to 6:00 in the morning,

294
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,481
I never saw her.

295
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,777
That was y'all, right? The shootout?

296
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,863
That's my fucking limp.

297
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,241
Why'd you leave Highway Patrol?

298
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,204
Why'd I give up hemorrhoids
and 15K 3 year? I don't know.

299
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,665
That question keeps me up nights.

300
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,012
What's the job involve?
Money like that.

301
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,056
Hog thieves?

302
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,643
People trying to steal
the secret chicken recipe?

303
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,687
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

304
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,608
"Securing without compromise

305
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,235
"the integrity of corporate assets

306
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,822
"while guarding against hazards
to daily operations."

307
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,367
But I'll admit, now and then,
I miss whiling away my days,

308
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,369
cruising around, eating donuts.

309
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,039
I don't eat donuts.

310
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,749
I can tell.

311
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,127
You got a good body, Detective.

312
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,297
ROLAND: Appreciate your time.

313
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,424
We'll get outta your hair.

314
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,685
ROLAND: I thought it took God
seven days to make the world.

315
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,854
He rested on the seventh.

316
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,233
I always thought he should've
put the extra day in,

317
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,609
instead of half-assing it.

318
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,904
ELISA: Harris James?

319
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,615
He was one of the officers
who processed the Woodard scene.

320
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,953
He disappeared
during the 1990 investigation.

321
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,913
Huh.

322
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,123
Know what happened to him?

323
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,835
No. But the mother, the father,

324
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,421
the cousin's body being found now,

325
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,507
all the dead at Woodard's,

326
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,634
this former cop worked the scene.

327
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,471
I wonder if one day
they'll drain a quarry with him in it.

328
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,309
I wouldn't know, miss.

329
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,897
But what you just did
is called speculation.

330
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,899
That leads to projection, we call it.

331
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,694
Twists what you see, obfuscates truth.

332
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,030
Have you sat back at any point
over the last two decades

333
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:30,243
and thought about the sheer number
of fatalities surrounding this case?

334
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,787
(SIGHS)

335
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:43,381
I'm afraid I need to stop for today.

336
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,092
I'm sorry, can you give us
five more minutes?

337
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,385
I didn't mean to press.

338
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,220
You're fine. I'm just done.

339
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,224
All I meant...

340
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,643
Doesn't the simple body count
point toward something bigger...

341
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,062
- Stop. He's done.
- ELISA: I'm getting to the point.

342
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,940
HENRY: Then you should have
gotten to it sooner. Okay?

343
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,406
AMELIA: Thanks so much for your help.

344
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,742
Do you work with a lot of young girls?

345
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,452
We get a fair amount.

346
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,788
Runaways, girls trying
to get away from bad homes.

347
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,832
We just lose so many.

348
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,462
I can't say I recognize her.

349
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,798
But that's not the best picture,
is it?

350
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,055
The idea is
maybe it's this little girl, grown up.

00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,442

I think?

Why did she leave?

355
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:57,664
Things had gotten kind of shaky.
Drugs.

some of the girls to trick.

a couple weeks after Mary.

She called herself "Mary"?

360
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,887
Sometimes.

361
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,556
Or Mary-Julie.

362
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:20,687
And sometimes Mary-July,
like Julie, but July.

363
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,481

00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,122
She mentioned something about,
"Living in the pink rooms"?

Or "A queen in a pink castle."

371
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,007
I think she didn't know who she was.

372
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,802
I think she just pretended.

00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,020
You feeling better, she feeling worse?

520
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,732
I never did anything like this before,
Pop, I want you to know that.

521
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,234
I didn't plan it.
You know, shejust...

522
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,864
She was exciting.

523
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,491
They're exciting, all right.

524
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,994
And me and Heather,
it's not like it used to be.

525
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,499
Nothing stays like it used to be.

526
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,466
I been looking at myself a lot.

527
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:21,347
And I'm asking this question for me,
so I know.

528
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,766
What?

529
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:30,189
Did you find that I...

530
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,195
Did I teach you to withhold?

531
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,281
I don't understand the question.

532
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:47,998
I didn't intend that.
I didn't realize it was happening.

533
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,216
I got those addresses you wanted.

534
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,011
The names.

535
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,807
What are you planning?

536
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,484
Before you ever knew me,
Iwasn't scared much.

537
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,029
Iwasn't a fearful man.

538
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:24,076
I did things some people
even called brave.

539
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:28,664
Y'all made a coward of me.

540
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,584
I been terrified since
the day you were born.

541
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,089
<i>Maybe you know when mean.</i>

542
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,637
Can't shrink from it.
Can't be stingy, son.

543
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,431
People you love,

544
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:49,726
can't hold it back, see?

545
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,271
Can't hold back anything.

546
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,568
I gotta make a phone call, Pop.

547
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:24,011
KINDT: Due to the shocking
and horrific events three days ago,

548
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:29,892
our offices have reached a conclusion
in the case of Will and Julie Purcell.

549
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:35,022
New evidence suggests that
Brett Woodard murdered both children.

550
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,776
Now, we will pursue
a conviction in absentia,

551
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,030
due to the terrible nature
of his crimes,

552
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,157
and it is our hope

553
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,284
that the community will begin to heal

554
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,244
from these events
which have shaken us all.

555
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,038
REPORTER 1: Have they found
the girl's remains?

556
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,290
We have evidence,
but I don't wish to say more

557
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,083
under the present circumstances.

558
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,002
REPORTER 2:
Was Woodard under investigation?

559
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,922
He was very much a person of interest.
We were looking at him.

560
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,382
REPORTER 2: Were you close
to an arrest, is that why he snapped?

561
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:03,717
KINDT:
Well, I believe it's very likely

562
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,177
that the pressure, maybe the guilt,

563
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,555
drove him to explode
before he could be brought to trial.

564
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,141
But make no mistake,
that was an act of suicide

565
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,810
where he wanted to take
as many with him as he could.

566
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:17,189
REPORTER 3: Brett Woodard
was interrogated early on, correct?

567
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,900
Why wasn't he held
during the time of questioning?

568
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,069
KINDT: A lack of evidence.

569
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,030
We are bound by our common law,
which preserve the rights of all men,

570
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,534
even those as malignant
and as vicious as Mr. Woodard.

571
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,957
Mrs. Purcell.
Do you have a statement at this time?

572
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,209
"Leave me the fuck alone"
is my statement.

573
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,795
- Do you feel justice has been done?
- Justice?

574
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,506
The fuck are you talking about?
What's that even mean, huh?

575
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,716
- Here? Now?
- Mrs. Purcell...

576
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,718
Just leave her alone.
This is harassment.

577
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,887
It's my job. I'm just trying
to get the story right.

578
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,597
If I don't,
someone else'II get it wrong.

579
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,224
That is no excuse.

580
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,767
The fuck do you want, teacher?

581
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,769
I just wanna apologize
for how we left things...

582
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:59,481
Don't apologize to me.
Ever. For anything.

583
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,568
You two bitches,
you talk to each other.

584
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,444
Make up a story on your own.

585
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:40,022
Be ironic, that shitbird clears Tom.

586
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,864
It's something, isn't it?

587
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,408
How quick this town died.

588
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:54,953
Didn't die. Got murdered.

589
00:40:56,872 --> 00:41:00,167
We oughta look at who else might've
planted the backpack and shirt.

590
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,544
Could've been anybody.

591
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,923
But I wouldn't clear Tom just yet.
The man has secrets.

592
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:11,261
Get back to the office,
wanna look up that church program,

593
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,721
more co-workers.

594
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:18,101
Wait. Where we going?

595
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,687
I'm taking you home. What you think?

596
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,648
I'm not going home. I'm working.

597
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:23,982
It'll still be there in the morning.

598
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,528
Come on, man. O'Brien?
We got the scent.

599
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,822
Let's get back, strategize,

600
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,784
maybe talk to somebody in Vice
about the queer underground.

601
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,035
Just stop, all right?

602
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,330
You don't wanna go home,
don't go home.

603
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,040
But don't make it the job.

604
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,500
Maybe we just work it different.

605
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,210
Oh, yeah, we work it different.

606
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,961
- I just said.
- And I agreed.

607
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,381
That's why I'm where I'm at,
and you...

608
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:48,715
What?

609
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:50,425
Me, what?

610
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,761
You're you.

611
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,598
- Pull over.
- What?

612
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:57,766
Stop the fucking car.

613
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,142
What are you, a prom queen?

614
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,687
I hurt your feelings,
you're just gonna storm off?

615
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:07,317
Are you fucking kidding me?
This kindergarten shit?

616
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,527
Where do you think you're going?

617
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,737
I don't care so much
about my timecard.

618
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:12,030
I'm working.

619
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,079
People see your black ass
skulking around,

620
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,914
you're gonna get yourself shot.

621
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,001
Prick.

622
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,379
Tommy Purses.

623
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,007
The fuck you doing here?

624
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:13,592
Smart mouth.

625
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,970
For a smart guy, you're awful sloppy.

626
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,181
Same place you used to
come to slam meth

627
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,308
when you weren't leeching off of us.

628
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,604
Don't really feel like
catching up just now, Tommy.

629
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:36,907
Hey, you know,
there's a rest stop up the road.

630
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,285
Saw a glory hole in the back stall,
if you need something to do.

631
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,042
Heard you're wanting a payout.

632
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,294
Let's pretend each of these bullets
is a thousand bucks.

633
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:53,298
Hold on now, Tom. Now,
you ain't got no problem with me.

634
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,842
Look, I know we ain't been buddies,
but you got no call for this here.

635
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:57,427
You know something,
you son of a bitch!

636
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:59,971
What is it?
What are you selling the cops?

637
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,848
Just point that gun down now, Tom.

638
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,226
Please.
You're making me real nervous here.

639
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,727
(PANTING)

640
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:08,522
You been drinking, man?
I thought you quit that.

641
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,982
- What do you know?
- Nothing! Just nothing!

642
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,443
- Bullshit!
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

643
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:17,030
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

644
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,115
Hold on.

645
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,537
(GRUNTING)

646
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,971
Get up, motherfucker.

647
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,142
(GROANS)

648
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,936
I'm gonna shoot your dick off.

649
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,064
And then your knees,
and then maybe your ears...

650
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,732
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

651
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,652
Julie! When you were staying
in Will's room,

652
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,404
you were spying on her.

653
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,574
Made a peephole in Will's closet,
so you could watch her get dressed.

654
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,367
I never... I would never...

655
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,244
I don't know
what you're talking about.

656
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:07,414
I'll figure out where to put
the last bullet when I get there.

657
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,875
God damn it, listen to me.
Listen to me!

658
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:17,674
I don't know nothing
about no peephole.

659
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:21,094
All right?
I'd never do nothing like that.

660
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,972
- Julie? She was...
- Where is she?

661
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,724
- I don't know!
- Where's my daughter?

662
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,268
- I don't know!
- You lying motherfucker!

663
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,354
You ever ask yourself
where Lucy got the money to run off?

664
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,650
Or what she was living off for all
them eight years before she died? Hmm?

665
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,569
Say what you're saying, God damn it!

666
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:41,531
I'm saying,
I know who was paying her.

667
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,950
Listen, man,
I know who was paying her

668
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,578
and who would have a problem
if she asked for more.

669
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,330
That's all I was gonna
give the cops, man.

670
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,916
That's all I was gonna give the cops.
A name. Shit.

671
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:52,542
Just a man's name.

672
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,839
All right, you dumbshit.

673
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,927
Give me a reason not to murder you.

674
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,469
<i>WAYNE: They were passing notes.</i>

675
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:13,016
Little notes with the kids.

676
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:17,604
The hole in the wall,
that's what it was for.

677
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,274
That's right. That's correct.

678
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,862
Yeah, that director woman.

679
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,867
She mentioned Harris James. Again.

680
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,077
(SIGHS)

681
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,456
Are you sure you know
what you're doing with her?

682
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,043
Well, if I don't...

683
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,213
What'd O'Brien tell us?

684
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,424
"I'm just a sick man."

685
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:47,842
(SCOFFS)

686
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,932
I got a list of the names, addresses.

687
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,727
A former domestic, Hoyt's house.

688
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:00,188
Harris James' widow.

00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:03,233
What you think we're gonna do?

690
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,282
Take a leak.

694
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,709
Roland?

695
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,214
Hey, man.

696
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:14,929
How you doing?

697
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,849
Good, man.

698
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,185
How you doing?

699
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,147
All right.

700
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,150
All right.

701
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,696
You been spending a lot of time
in here, I guess.

702
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,490
I don't think I sleep much.

703
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,541
What?

704
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,001
Do me a favor.

705
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:47,795
Go to the window.

706
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:52,967
See if there's a dark sedan
idling down the street.

707
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:55,929
Okay.

708
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,279
No, man.

709
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,907
Nothing out there.

710
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,956
All right.

711
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,793
You been seeing a car?

712
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,298
How you been, Roland?

713
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,968
Been doing some reading.

714
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,136
Oh. Yeah.

715
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,265
I never read it all the way.

716
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,642
She never minded.

717
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,228
Good-looking woman.

718
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:48,189
That she was.

719
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,569
Yeah.

720
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,533
It's 2015, isn't it?

721
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,995
That's right, pal.

Thank you.

737
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,133
Are there any questions?

the girl alive now?

There were fingerprints
found recently, yes.

741
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,645
I'm writing about
the new investigation now.

742
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:14,400
You got any idea where she is?

743
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,446
Do they?

744
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,950
Uh, no. Nobody does.

745
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,705
- Are you...
- And what about your book?

746
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,334
You got any theory here?

747
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:34,712
You got some idea
about where she's at?

748
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,256
Well, this...

749
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:41,177
I wrote it
when she was believed dead.

750
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,389
So, you don't know nothing?
You just...

751
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,310
You're just making your money
and milking their pain.

752
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:50,770
Sir, the author has never claimed...

753
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,355
Shame on you, woman!
