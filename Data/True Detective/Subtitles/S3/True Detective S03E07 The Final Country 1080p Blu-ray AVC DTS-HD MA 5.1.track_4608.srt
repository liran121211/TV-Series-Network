00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,206
I left you messages.

20
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,583
Wayne, there was a man
at my reading, and he...

21
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,794
- Where are the kids?
- In their rooms.

22

23
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,839
But there was this man at my reading.

24
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,216
He was a black man with one eye.

25
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,095
You saw a man with one eye?

26
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,265
He was aggressive and rude, and...

27
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,727
And he was asking
if I knew where Julie was now.

28
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,856
Wayne, I think he was the guy
from back in '80.

29
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,776
The one y'all were looking for.
The one who bought the dolls.

30
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,154
You didn't get a name?
Any other way to find him?

No...

32
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,991
But he's out there,
and he's looking for her.

33
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,994
I think he's the reason
that she ran away.

34
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,129
Tom Purcell killed himself.

00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:57,965

ELISA: Did you ever
think it was possible

42
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,778
Tom didn't commit suicide?

43
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,322
That was the ME's call.

44
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,075
Man had plenty of reasons for doing
somethin' like that.

45
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,913
The ME's report noted a swollen
contusion at the base of his skull,

46
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,414
as if he'd been struck there.

47
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,417
His skull was blown apart.

48
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,462
The whole thing was one big contusion.

49
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,256
We had an independent ME evaluate
the report.

50
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,383
She said the gunshot wouldn't account

51
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,594
for a particular bruise
and blood clot.

52
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,849
You're suggestin' that somebody
brought him up there, unconscious,

53
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,434
then did him in that way?

54
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,104
In any case, it effectively
ended the second investigation.

That was us, man.

We did that.

65
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,469
Drove him to it.

66
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,682
We didn't make that phone call.

00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,732

00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,526

76
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,252

00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,715

gave Julie a doll

he might've been the one to take her.

All right.

right back to you.

In the morning...

714
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:20,995
We have to talk.

715
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,458
Will you talk to me in the morning?

716
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,495
AMELIA: We haven't been honest.

717
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,582
What's going on, what we're doing.

718
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,503
No. I know.

719
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,508
Maybe we could turn it around.

720
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,636
If I tell you...

721
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:24,058
Things you're better off not knowin'.

722
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,354
Not about you, there's not.

723
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,941
With you, I need to know everything.

724
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,404
I'd be a son of a bitch
if I did that to you.

725
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,991
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

726
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,412
I'm sorry, uh,
it could be Roland or somethin'.

727
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,581
Could be big.

728
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:49,125
Please. Hold on.

729
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:50,460
(RINGING CONTINUES)

730
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,842
- Hello?
- MAN: <i>Detective Hays?</i>

731
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,303
<i>- Wayne Hays?</i>
- Yes.

732
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,930
<i>Do you know who this is?</i>

733
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:04,599
No.

734
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:06,851
<i>Edward Hoyt.</i>

735
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:12,398
<i>I think we may have
some things to discuss.</i>

736
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,109
How's that?

737
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,445
<i>Harris James.</i>

738
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:21,366
<i>I'd like to discuss
the events of last night.</i>

739
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,494
<i>As I understand them.</i>

740
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,456
<i>I could come inside, if you like.</i>

741
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,470
<i>I'd be pleased to meet your family.</i>

742
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,264
<i>Your wife, the writer“?</i>

743
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,225
<i>Little Henry and Rebecca.</i>

744
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,062
<i>It's lucky, havin' a family.</i>

745
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,401
No.

746
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,321
<i>Then maybe you'd like
to come out and talk to me.</i>

747
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:04,951
<i>My preference, you understand,
is to keep this between us.</i>

748
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:08,663
<i>For the moment.</i>

749
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,706
WAYNE: How 'bout a little later?

750
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,751
<i>You may not realize this,</i>

751
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:16,546
<i>but I've been pretty damn patient
with you already.</i>

752
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:19,966
<i>Perhaps I should take my information
to the prosecutor's office.</i>

753
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,676
<i>Or like I say,</i>

754
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,845
<i>happy to talk inside.</i>

755
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:26,764
No.

756
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:28,975
I'll be out in five.

757
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,443
What?

758
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:45,658
Just, uh...

759
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,746
I'm sorry. It's one last time.

760
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:53,082
Trust me, all right?

761
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:55,168
One more time. That's it.

762
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,128
Then we talk,
then I tell you everything.

763
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,255
Right now, um...

764
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,757
Listen.

765
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:03,468
You gotta just trust me.

766
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:11,476
One last time.

767
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:14,645
This is it.
