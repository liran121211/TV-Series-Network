I suppose he blinked.

WAYNE: Who took these pictures?

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,251
I did.

22
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,714
WAYNE: The youth group,

23
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,466
had you talked much with the kids

24
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,259
about their activities
outside the church?

25
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,888
Ever about their home lives,
new acquaintances?

26
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,684
I didn't often see
their parents at service,

27
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:06,645
and then usually it was
just the father, Tom.

28
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,940
Actually, last I saw her,

29
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,651
Julie had been excited
about seeing an aunt.

30
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,905
She doesn't have any aunts.

31
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,074
Tell you anything about this aunt?

32
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,492
Description?

33
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,952
Something might draw notice?

34
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,331
She told the woman's name.
I wish I could recollect it.

other people who worked
with the youth group.

37
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,754
Like to get some fingerprints, too.

38
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,838
Certainly.

39
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,343

She's a dear, good woman,
I can tell you.

44
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,779
You were Catholic.
Do you attend services?

45
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,740
Sometimes.

46
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,410
Remiss of late.

47
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,371
I was an altar boy,
little country church in Conway.

Anything else about the kids?

51
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:23,097
Just that they were sweet children,
and they looked out for each other.

00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,852
I don't like him.

The priest.

54
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:35,609
I know his alibi's good,
but I don't like him.

55
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,281
Man signs up to
go without fuckin' for life,

56
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,033
either he don't know himself
for a liar,

57
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,246
or he's some tight,
limited-edition psycho, you know?

58
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:52,376
(SCOFFS) I mean,
everybody's fuckin' somethin'.

59
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,715
You can imagine that little boy
looking out for his sister, huh?

60
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,929
He was trying to defend her.

61
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,515
That's what happened to him.

62
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,059
Maybe whoever they were
playing with in the woods,

63
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,564
maybe this new aunt or whoever,

64
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,026
they never wanted the boy.

65
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,237
My feeling,

66
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,947
it was all about the girl.

67
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,248
Catholic, huh?

68
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,875
Yep.

69
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,502
We were Baptist.

70
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:40,090
Had a good buddy in the war. Baptist.

71
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,592

A dear, good woman.

75
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:14,083
Yes, I'm pretty sure these are mine.

76
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,293
Just little things I do.

77
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,046
Somebody bought 'em. Do you know who?

78
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:25,511
Well, the last I sold these myself
was at the fair in October.

79
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,266
I'd only sold a couple,
and then one man bought 10 off me.

80
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,809
That was nice.

81
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,687
You know who he was?

82
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,522
You remember anything about him?

83
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,942
Didn't recognize him.

84
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,903
Negro man, like yourself.

85
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,156
He had a dead eye.

86
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,910
Filmy, you know, like a cataracts?

besides the eye?

Handsome, ugly?

89
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:59,753
Well, like I say, he was black.

He say what the dolls were for?

he had nieces and nephews.

No.

have been with the rest of them

at the liquor store.

180
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,370
Pretty fuckin' racist, man.

181
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,624
And it's one of three businesses here
'cause nobody uses it.

182
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,795
Let's flip for it.

183

Sound like anybody in the community?

186
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,353
Having us owe you a favor
could be worthwhile,

191
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,909
talkin' 'bout that dead eye.

192
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,415
Sam Whitehead got one of them.

193
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,709
Where's he live?

197
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,410
Wonder could we talk to you a minute?

198
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,912
Well, what's this about?

199
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,248
Could we step inside, sir?

200
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,046
I'd rather stay out here,
if it's all the same to you.

201
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,590
WAYNE: You ever go to mass?

202
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,800
St. Michael's Church?

203
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,470
No, I go to First Presbyterian.

204
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,638
ROLAND: You go
to their church fair, maybe?

205
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,641
Buy some dolls made out of straw?

206
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,561
What? No!

207
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,521
What the hell is this?

What y'all tryin' to do to me?

209
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,941
Just runnin' down a couple of details.

Case we're workin'.

211
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,237
Dead boy, missin' girl.

212
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,948
You might have seen it in the papers.

213
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,867
White children.

214
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,536
If it's in the paper,
it's white children.

maybe you could tell us
where you were the night of the 7th?

How you gonna wear that badge?

It's got a little clip on it.

Off on the wrong foot here.

I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

I work for a goddamn living.

Two jobs, when I can get 'em.

250
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,462

don't you think?

Would you have done it?

Would you have shot one of 'em?

If I thought it was
between him and me.

277

what color he was.

Sure about that?

I didn't drive. I grabbed a bus.

I'm just sayin', you take a bus,
what happens you forget to get off?

What happens you don't remember
why you even got on?

I been workin' on this thing.

00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,026
Writin'. About the case.

305
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,778
Both times,
the first one and the second.

306
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,572
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, so...

00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,784
I been goin' through old files
and writin' stuff down

00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,452
and recording stuff, so I remember.

309
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,246
What's the point,
you lookin' at old case notes?

310
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,249
Writing's been good for me.

311
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,252
Maybe I got a book in there
or somethin',

312
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,129
or maybe it's nothin'
and don't mean anything,

313

You don't need
to do that show anymore.

I'm not talkin' about the show.

00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,348
It's me. It's my life.

317

I tell the case in steps,

318

Goin' along with all that,

00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,529
I found a couple of people and details

322
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,949
I was wonderin' if maybe
you could look up for me?

323

Where else I'm gonna go
than Detective Hays?

Look at it.

327
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,129
Just a few names and people
I'd like to see where they ended up

328
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,673
and never got around
to gettin' everything from.

329
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,591
And Roland.

330
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,010

for you to find Roland.

331
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,346
Roland? Jesus, Dad, come on.

man to man.

00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,775
Knowin' I had a place here, as you do.

335
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,362
This right now is

336
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,949
my way of stayin' alive.

337
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,040
This can't be a habit
or anything, all right?

338
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,501
Yes, sir.

339
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,963
Thank you, son.

340
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,677
Roland... He's not dead, is he?

341
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,096
I guess I'll find out.

342
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,517
How are you otherwise?

343
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,771
One of my good days. Pretty clear.

344
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,899
Be a good day for that director
to catch me.

345
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,610
You seen her since?

346
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,570
The director? Elisa?

347
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,697
Since the last day, I mean?

348
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:08,536
No, not since she pulled that shit,
criticizin' the investigation.

349
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,999
Okay, son.

350
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,587
Now look, Dad, I'm gonna see
what I can do about some of these,

351
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,132

if he's still around.

352
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,842
I appreciate it.

353
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,056
Come on, Pop. I'll drive you back.

354
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,188
ROLAND: Uh-huh.

355
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,357
Yeah, that's right.

356

Yes, sir.

357

Well, that'd be my preference,
and you'd have my gratitude.

358

Thank you, now.

ROLAND: Mr. Attorney General.

364
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,732
Roland, A.G. Kindt
wanted to reiterate our cause.

365
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,153
All the evidence at the time pointed
to the Purcell girl bein' dead.

366
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,156
KINDT: And whether
or not this was the case,

367
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,243
state and county offices
remain convinced of the man's guilt.

368

is to vindicate

369
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,206

for Will Purcell's murder.

370
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,710
Understood.

371
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,421
Officer Hays,
I know it's been some time

372
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,716
since you've been involved
in an investigative unit.

373
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,426
Roland had to do
considerable campaigning

374
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:50,013
to get you to be a part of this.

375
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,640
I'm hopin' your involvement
does not portend

376
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,809
to any damage to his reputation.

377
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,686
KINDT: And I further hope, Officer,

378
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,146
that you might use this new role

379
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,816
to redeem
an unfortunately stunted career.

380
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,699
I'm committed to fulfillin' the
mandates just described to us, sir.

381
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,284
KINDT: Good.

382
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,411
This is all brought to conclusion,

383
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,414
I could imagine you
back at Major Crimes.

384
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,547
Sir.

385
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,273
We're not gonna do any of that shit
they just said, right?

386
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,360
Wasn't plannin' on it.

388

"Justice is not ours to deliver.

393
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,777
"Justice is not in our power,

394
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,570
"it is in His."

395
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:36,119
Having said as much, I would like
to ask you all for your help today.

396
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,082
After services, the police
will have set up some tables,

397
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,626

you will assist them.

brother, but I'll tell you this,

400
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:04,021
there's some serious ass up in here.

401
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,816
I gotta get back to church.

402
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,240
Well, don't mind me.
I'll just hang back.

403
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,122
Excuse me, miss?

404
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,332

helpin' us with this.

405
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,210
I don't know anybody'd do it
without your askin'.

406
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:29,380
Of course.
We'll keep it up through Sunday.

408
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,093
I'd need to hit confession first.

409
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,179
Would you like to confess now?

410
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,182
I reckon
I'll let it pile up a little more.

411
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,436
Can you tell me,

412
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,147
any member of your congregation
a black man with a dead eye?

413
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,108
- Like a cataract?
- Offhand, I don't believe so,

414
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,778
but we have
over 1,000 parishioners,

415
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:55,698

a small portion are African-American.

418
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,500
they're one of y'all's.

419
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:07,627
I find it difficult to believe

420
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,504
that anyone here
could do something like that.

421
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,965
They don't exactly wear signboards,

Maybe ask around
about the man I described.

424
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,976
I'll certainly try,
and pray to be of use.

425
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,065
I really would like
to hear your confession, Detective.

I get to feelin' penitent,
I'll let you know.

00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,921
since everybody thinks
I'm so fuckin' funny.

527
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,800
She was fuckin' him, you know.

528
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,803
Her boss.

529
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,515
Shit, you're a detective,

530
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,686
you probably figured that out already.

531
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,397
Why didn't you call his wife?

532
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:33,275
Lucy's got enough problems right now.

533
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,364
Could press charges on you, Tom,

534
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,741
but I sympathize,
what your family's goin' through.

535
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:41,867
(SPITS)

536
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,660
Fuck you.

537
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,596
I'm such a joke.

538
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,682
You didn't need
the one nigger cop on the job

539
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,309
to help babysit me?

540
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,396
He's the best detective on the case.

541
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,982
Tryin' to find your daughter.

542
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,991
I apologize.

543
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,537
That word I used.

544
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,918
Your pal wanted to kick my ass,
he'd have the right.

545
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,758
You've gotten your ass
kicked enough for now.

546
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,721
You takin' me home?

547
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,432
Yeah.

548
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,438
I can't be in that house, man.

549
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,901
Every inch of that place is them kids.

550
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,824
I can't be there.

551
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,618
I can't sleep there.

552
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:14,460
I just wanna die all the time.

553
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:29,391
I got a jail cell for you,
or I got a couch.

554
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,978
Why don't you use that?

555
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,230
Then we see how tomorrow looks.

556
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,568
Oh, my God.

557
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,653
I'm so sorry I used that word.

558
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,074
Don't tell him.

559
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:49,912
He been called worse
by people meant it more than you did.

560
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,669
I'm sorry for that, too.

561
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,160
First thing.

562
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:33,872
You two, go over every statement
taken back then.

563
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:38,293
I want y'all finding current addresses
for any residents we talked to in '80,

564
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,879
anybody from that neighborhood.

565
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,048
Detective Hays here
was lead at the time.

566
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,176
He's come over from Public Information
to help us out.

567
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,305
We had a couple of threads
we were just getting started

568
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,140
before the whole thing
closed out on us.

569
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,767
What we got that's brand-new

570
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,561
is the missing girl's prints
showed up in Oklahoma.

571
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,646
Now, we're gonna have to...

572
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,773
ROLAND: Wayne's gonna
try to help me find her.

573
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:03,777
We figure find the girl,
who by now is 21 years old,

574
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,196
we get the story of what happened.

575
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,283
Now, everything pointed
to her bein' dead.

576
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,243
We were wrong.

577
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,287
Let's find out why.

578
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,997
I don't know about "we."

579
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:21,378
Her mother Lucy, she's dead. We knew.

580
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,839
OD'd outside Vegas, '88.

581
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,174
She had a cousin, Dan O'Brien.

582
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,427
Nobody knows where he is.

583
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,638
Hobbs, Segar, focus on findin' him.

584
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:35,309
Mainly, y'all seekin'
anything might have got overlooked.

585
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,644
All the tips, interrogations, whatnot.

586
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,815
Yeah. You in the back.

587
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,987
A secondary consideration.

588
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,239
If word's out now this girl's alive,

589
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,408
there's a real possibility
there's people somewhere

590
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,243
don't want that to remain the case.

591
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,454
Imagine she escaped somewhere,

592
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,706
imagine we're not the only ones
lookin' for her.

593
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,583
There's any chance that's the case,

594
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,126
I think it's like the last time,

595
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,461
we gotta figure
there's a tickin' clock.

596
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,132
He's not wrong.

597
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,510
May not be right, but he's not wrong.

598
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,013
All right, let's get to it. Come on.

599
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:27,152
We goin' to Sallisaw?

600
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,237
Yeah.

601
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,626
Hi.

602
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,127
WAYNE: Mind if we talk a little?

603
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,064
Hope I didn't interrupt anything.

604
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,274
You and a friend.

605
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,819
No, I'm alone.

606
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,446
My mistake.

607
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,367
I get confused, as you by now know.

608
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,746
Sit. Please.

609
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:23,625
Well, what can I do for you?

610
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,213
I kind of had the impression
after our last talk

611
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,090
you might be done with me.

612
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,050
It's all right.

613
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,594
Thing is,

614
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:37,139
you shared some details I didn't have.

615
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,893
It's clear you have some kind
of investigator workin' this.

616
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:45,272
We have researchers,
a couple of investigators, sure.

617
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,191
And you'd like to
talk to me some more?

618
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:51,945
Since we haven't addressed
the conclusion of our efforts in '80,

619
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:57,117
much less '90, which to me
is more hauntin' than anything.

620
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,243
Yeah.

621
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,162
Of course,
I want to keep talking to you.

622
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,081
So you want to talk to me,
I want to talk to you.

623
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,750
All right, great.

624
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,501
But, miss,

625
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,712
you're gonna have to show yours, too.

626
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:11,423
- How do you mean?
- I mean, Iwanna know

627
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:15,051
anything and everything
your people pulled together.

628
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,304
Why are you doing this now?

629
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,599
You got some idea
what happened to the girl?

630
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,559
Are you trying to work this?

631
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,645
I wanna know the whole story.

632
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,523
A lot of this is my life.

633
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,818
Got some pieces I'm missin'.
I need 'em.

634
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:43,955
Drained quarry in southern Missouri.

635
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:47,667
Dental records from prison
identify the remains as Dan O'Brien,

636
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,545
Lucy's cousin who went missing in '90
after resurfacing.

637
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,717
This it?

638
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:00,472
Look, I can't show you
all my cards just yet.

639
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,766
But it's not on you.

640
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:17,072
Should you happen
to see my son Henry,

641
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,784
it'd be best for both of us
you didn't mention this exchange.

642
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,247
Are you sure you're not trying
to investigate this again?

643
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:28,875
That'd be a job for somebody who knows
where he is most of the time.

644
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,011
We're puttin' an APB
on the description,

645
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,179
person of interest.

646
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,431
Between the pose, the dolls,

647
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:46,309
and why we think this has
something to do with the church.

648
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,937
That's strange,
the body position bein' the same.

649
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,814
WAYNE: That, and the toys.

650
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,774
Playin' out in the woods,
this new "aunt."

651
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,110
Doll guy mentionin'
nieces and nephews,

652
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,820
little notes in her room.

653
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,240
There's an aspect we're not catching.

654
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,409
We're tryin' to print
the whole congregation.

655
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:03,577
Speaking of.

656
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,079
Still no match
on that bicycle's prints.

657
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:08,164
We just had our guy
start comparing to student files.

658
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,041
There was this program
a couple years ago,

659
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,209
all the kids got theirs done.

660
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:12,836
ROLAND: What about the note?

661
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,006
Matched magazine ads to the letters,
but no real action there.

662
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,092
Processing public mailboxes
that ZIP code,

663
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,719
but it's not gonna come to anything.

664
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,804
Thought to look at the toys
from the woods.

665
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:26,516
Call around, see what shops
sell those specific.

666
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:29,227
We've still got those
unknown prints from 'em, too.

667
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,646
Another thing.

668
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,525
How 'bout workplace injuries
going back 40 years?

669
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:39,321
Anybody lost an eye, black male,
Washington and surrounding counties.

670
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:40,780
That's kind of thin.

671
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,825
Any priors from that list of employees

672
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:46,703
at the Hoyt Foods plant
where the mother worked?

673
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,872
Cross-reference
with workplace injuries.

674
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,833
You heard your prosecutor's
going on Donahue?

675
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,795
What the fuck is a <i>Donahue?</i>

676
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,298
<i>MAN ON TV: Is the caller there?</i>

677
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,883
WOMAN: <i>Yes.</i>
MAN: <i>Go right ahead, please.</i>

678
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,093
<i>WOMAN: Mr. Kindt, in your experience,</i>

679
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,762
<i>do you think that dangers to children</i>

680
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,889
<i>have gotten worse over the years?</i>

681
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,683
KINDT: <i>Well, I think children
are at considerable risk.</i>

682
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,936
<i>I mean, it's no secret that our values</i>

683
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,979
<i>have lowered significantly
as a society</i>

684
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:14,814
<i>and, in that environment,</i>

685
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:17,734
<i>certain people
feel emboldened to prey on children.</i>

686
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,195
Dickhead wants attorney general.

687
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,989
<i>Now, this crime
is our number one priority.</i>

688
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,866
MAN: <i>And we'll be back
in just a minute.</i>

689
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,743
It's beyond the fuckin' pale.

690
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,079
Forget it. We got a hit on the bike.

691
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,538
What? Who?

692
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:31,915
That Black Sunday teenager...

693
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,125
What's his name? Freddy Burns?

694
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,265
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- LUCY: "Don't call."

695
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,268
Who the fuck do you think
you're talkin' to, motherfucker?

696
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,853
Huh?

697
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,272
Hello? Hello?

698
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:57,941

My name is Amelia Reardon.

701
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:08,743
I taught Will English.

702
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:15,125
I picked up...
The children had things.

703
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,920

704

- Right.

'Course.

716

Lot of times
we do things to hurt ourselves

717
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:39,667
because we think
we deserve to be hurt.

Whatever you think
you did or didn't do,

719
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:51,387
you don't deserve to suffer.

720
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,557
You don't need to be punished.

721
00:48:56,601 --> 00:49:00,063
And those children wouldn't want you
doing that to yourself.

00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,155
All I hoped,

724
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,574
when I knew enough to hope,
was that them kids

725
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:13,993
might have a better time of it
than I did.

726
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:18,289
But even then,
I couldn't make that easy on 'em.

727
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:24,087
This wasn't a very happy home.

728
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:29,008
Children should laugh.

729
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:32,387
Right?

730
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:37,433
There wasn't a lot of laughter
around here.

What do you mean?

736
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,456
I ran around on Tom.

737
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,711
I always run around.

738
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,590

00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:17,348
sometimes I couldn't breathe
in this house.

741
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,936

with that part of me.

I got a .38 revolver in my purse.

746

Where does that courage come from?

747

I've never really thought of that
as courage, Mrs. Purcell.

01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,724
We already know all that.

877
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,143
You haven't mentioned that
you were gone for a half hour

878
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,270
before your friends saw you again.

879
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,564
Just an observation,

880
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,399
I don't think you're well-liked.

881
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:13,444
What'd you do in the woods,
those 30 minutes?

882
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,696
Look, I don't know
what happened to him.

883
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,282
I chased him just for a minute,
but I was kind of drunk.

884
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,451
I lost my way real fast.
Like, 'fore I knew it,

885
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:21,535
there was just trees all around,

886
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:22,870
and it took a while
to find my way out.

887
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,246
What about the bike?

888
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,081
It was where he dropped it.

889
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:27,708
I fooled around on it, that's all.

890
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:30,169
I hit a tree, I bent the wheel,
and just...

891
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,546
You know,
I threw it back in the marsh.

892
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,548
And you're gonna risk
20 years in prison

893
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:36,383
saying the only thing you did

894
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:39,386
was throwing the kid off
and take his bike?

895
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,847
Which, by the way,
makes you a dirtbag.

896
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,892
Puttin' you
in the legal category "screwed."

897
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,519
Prior to suckin' gas.

898
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:47,895
Call him a shit-heeled twerp again.

899
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,772
You shit-heeled twerp.

900
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,608
Unless you can enlist us in
the Save Freddy Burns campaign,

901
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,777
which can only achieve victory

902
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,948
with your complete disclosure
of the truth in its entirety.

903
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,324
What?

904
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,576
He's sayin' tell the whole story

905
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,870
or train your ass to be an entrance.

906
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:07,998
I know brothers inside
will tear your guts up

907
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,667
fuckin' you stupid.

908
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:14,797
(SOBBING)

909
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:14,648
Goddamn.

910
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:31,892
(PANTING)

911
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:22,776
FREDDY: <i>Fuck.</i>

912
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:27,239
(SOBBING)

913
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:36,623
That prison rape's
a real go-to for you lately, huh?

914
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:40,586
Somethin' you want to tell me?

915
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:47,426
I think he's done.

916
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:49,803
FREDDY: No, no, no.

917
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,514
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

918
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:54,808
Never mind.

919
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:57,019
You gonna go with this?

920
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:58,687
Are we sayin' it's him?

921
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,316
What are you thinkin'?

922
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:06,445
That probably when he's 25,
that kid's gonna be in jail.

923
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,447
But not for this.

924
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,450
Detectives, a couple
of calls just came in.

925
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,952
Something big's going down
at that trash guy's place.

926
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,287
West Finger.

927
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,580
Men with guns, they said.

928
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:18,749
Keep him here.

929
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,835
Woodard!

930
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,838
You was warned off them kids!

931
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,131
(GUN COCKING)

932
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:28,217
Woodard!

933
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,641
Woodard! Get out here!

934
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:43,315
Woodard!

935
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,901
We comin' in if you ain't comin' out!

936
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,153
What's goin' on here?

937
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:49,988
Back up!

938
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,865
(EXPLOSION)
