<i>WAYNE: You have the autopsy report.</i>

00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,606
<i>I don't need to go over that.</i>

00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,821
<i>Blunt force trauma
and a cervical fracture.</i>

6
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:39,910
Somebody broke his neck.
Brought him to that cave.

7
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,873
Folded his hands, I guess.

8
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,127
Alan.

9
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,047
Talk to me about Oklahoma.
You have to, man.

10
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,216
- Wayne, this isn't the time...
- How many sets of prints were taken?

11
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,678
Do they know she was
one of the robbers and not a customer?

12
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,973
If they found her, you wouldn't
even be talking to me, right?

13
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,600
Do they have video surveillance?

14
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,435
Mr. Hays,
the purpose of this deposition

15
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,479
is to give your statement,
not to extract one from us.

16
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,523
I'm pretty easygoing,
but go away already.

17
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,817
I don't think I Will.

18
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,571
Look, we're not at liberty
to divulge details

19
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,573
of an ongoing police investigation,

20
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,201
nor to share discovery items
with anyone

21
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,786
other than the prosecutor's office.

22
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,788
Now, you can talk to them,
if they'll talk to you...

23
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,873
Hey, hey, hey. All right, stop.

24
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,209
<i>Wayne.</i>

25
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,170
Finish up today, all right?

26
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,130
Then after, we'll speak.

27
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:38,886
I'm saying, we'll talk. Okay?

28
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,474
Now, you were saying.

29
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,770
You questioned people
during this time. Right?

30
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,147
Do you know another way to do it?

31
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,944
<i>The father worked
at Wilson Body Works,</i>

32
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,779

33
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,781
<i>We talked to everybody there.</i>

34
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,076
<i>Employed about 100 people
from West Finger.</i>

35
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,080
<i>The dolls were their own thing.
Wasn't getting us anywhere, either.</i>

36
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,756
Thank you very much.

37
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,678
WAYNE: <i>That guy who collected garbage,
Woodard. We talked to him, too.</i>

38
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:24,432
I saw the kids.
They were pedaling into the sun.

39
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,559
Headed west?

40
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,271
We went by your place.

41
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,899
You sort of collect things, huh?

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,569
I salvage trash that I can sell.

43
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,696
You don't need to make it
sound better than that.

44
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,907
You got any other properties?
Anywhere you keep things?

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,618
I don't have anyplace else.

46
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:49,248
What'd you do before this?
Before you collected scrap.

47
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,628
Uh, came back from overseas. '72.

48
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,797
Did some carpentry.

49
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,550
Construction dropped off.
Things didn't work out.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,719
My marriage. Stuff.

51
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,472
I was gone too long.

52
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,559
About four years ago, she left me.
Took the kids.

53
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,062
I was motor pool.

54
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,733
My man here was a LRRP. Two tours.

55
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,902
Detective Hays.

56
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,488
They called him "Purple Hays"
over there.

57
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,574
You miss your family?

58
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,618
I... Yeah.

59
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,454
I miss being someone that way...

60
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:30,956
A way I could have a family.

61
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,876
You were recon?

62
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,712
75th Infantry.

63
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,340
Sergeant.

64
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,219
You must be pretty insane,
volunteering for that.

65
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,846
I didn't think about it much,
to tell you the truth.

66
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,852
I ain't one of them burnouts.

67
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,648
You know, comes back busting guys up,
getting high.

68
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,652
And I ain't a bum.
I keep a house. I pay my way.

69
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,363
Hey. I ain'tjudging, man.

70
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,867
Look, I punch in and out.

71
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,286
I put on a suit in the morning.

72
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,539
And being honest,

73
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,833
I don't have much of a life.

74
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,964
So why? Why punch in?

75
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,800
Why the suit? Why...

76
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,843
I don't ask myself
questions like that.

77
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,598
Could be I'm too chickenshit,
Mr. Woodard.

78
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,894
It ain't my world.

79
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,188
Less than yours, even.

80
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,483
But I did pretty good
at following orders.

81
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,319
Now...

82
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,197
You ever do this?

83
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:50,077
I miss when "Don't get killed"
was the only thing on my to-do list.

84
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,998
It's hard to unplug from that.

85
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,376
I spent a year coming down.

86
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,505
(ROLAND CLEARS THROAT)

87
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,135
Just to go back over it,
you sure you didn't see anything?

88
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,639
I told you.
I saw the teenagers out there, too.

89
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,225
I was going in the other direction.

90
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,103
You like kids, generally?

91
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,856
Do...

92
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,483
What the fuck's
the right answer to that?

93
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,241
You think I...
Listen, I got two kids, okay?

94
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:30,868
Where are they?

95
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,122
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

96
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:37,750
And I haven't gone looking.

97
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,464
If I'd never left,
I think it'd have been fine.

98
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,092
But to go, and come back...

99
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,555
I just couldn't put myself
back in that old story, that's all.

100
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,600
And I couldn't leave it, either.
You know?

101
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,854
You ever been some place
you couldn't leave,

102
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:04,401
and you couldn't stay,
both at the same time?

103
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,079
HENRY: Do you remember the place?

104
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,169
I remember.

105
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,309
GREG: I can tell you all
that none of us will rest

106
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,186
until we achieve justice
in the matter.

107
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,730
Our detectives are hard at work,

108
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,317
and this is priority one
for law enforcement

109
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,070
in Washington County
and Northwest Arkansas.

110
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:50,823
Now, it's temporary,

111
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,117
but we're gonna have to
have a curfew for a little while.

112
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,744
It's important that we keep
an eye on our kids right now,

113
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,122
and we want to make sure
you know where they are at all times,

114
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,290
and that they're indoors by 8:00.

115
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,045
Now, we can't really say
too much about the investigation,

116
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,463
but I'm here to answer
any questions I can.

117
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,426
Well, I don't let mine
go near Devil's Den.

118
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,803
Everybody knows you got
something happening in it.

119
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,848
Bums, junkies.
Queers meet up out there.

120
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,684
You have a question, sir?

121
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,894
I wanna know what y'all are doing
to break up that stuff.

122
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,479
Clean up that park!

123
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,608
What about these junkies?
You got heroin in Arkansas now.

124
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,862
Right now, our focus is trying
to find this little girl

125
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,321
and bring her home.

126
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,490
We're considering every possibility.

127
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,033
MAN 2: And what about that fella

128
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,536
always digging through
everybody's trash?

129
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,498
Mr. Kindt, can you tell us
if they think the girl is still alive?

130
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,667
It's our hope that she's alive, yes.

131
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,502
But again, I really can't discuss

132
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,254
any of the details
of the investigation.

133
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,759
Now, our detectives
have a pair of Xeroxes to pass out.

134
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,803
One is a picture of Julie Purcell.

135
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,515
The other is the kind of backpack
that the boy, Will, had.

136
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,893
It's red and has his name on it.

137
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,354
Now, if anyone has any information
of potential interest,

138
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,857
no matter how far afield,
share it with us.

139
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,193
And trust that we will not
let this terrible,

140
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,487
cowardly act go unpunished.

141
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,948
WAYNE: Your old boss got real vocal
around then.

142
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,868
Gerald Kindt had an election
coming up the next year.

143
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,453
I know.

144
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,789
Guess that works
to some point in your petition.

145
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,500
It's worth noting,
I think, his motivations.

146
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,421
Well, now he's fucking
State Attorney General.

147
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,134
But we didn't work for him.
He was your boss.

148
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,887
Oh, not for a good while now.

149
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,600
The broken neck is clear.

150
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,977
But the way the arms were folded...

151
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,146
- I know.
- And the other thing.

152
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:51,109
- The hell are those dolls for?
- Correct. Look familiar, some way.

153
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,321
Like the kind of thing
at country fairs.

154
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,448
What do you get
from that crowd in there?

155
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:58,909
They're worried.

156
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,203
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

157
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,124
Could be thinking
it could have been a neighbor.

158
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,754
Had them sign in.
Saw some shifty eyes in there,

159
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,465
but may be my redneck radar.

160
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,009
I don't know.

161
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,846
Excuse me.

162
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,154
- Hi.
- Hey.

163
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,242
You found him, didn't you?

164
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,998
You look like you haven't
slept in a couple days.

165
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,002
Work to do. How's it at school?

166
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,337
Sad.

167
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,299
People are scared.

168
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,639
Uh...

169
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,892
Been asking about this.

170
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,811
We haven't gotten anything.

171
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,982
I don't know,
you knowing the kids and such.

172
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,944
You ever seen anything like this?

173
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,530
Seen a kid with a doll like this?

174
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,200
Uh, maybe. I don't know.
