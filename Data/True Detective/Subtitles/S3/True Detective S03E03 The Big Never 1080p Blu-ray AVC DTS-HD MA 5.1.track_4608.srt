the prosecution

4
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:46,065
didn't make a full accounting
or mount a suitable case.

5
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,942
So we have to do that now.

6
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,986

have wanted to go there?

took place out there.

- What, you ratting on me?
- What, are you working a case?

almost certainly is.

00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,559
What?

179
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,395
We just don't know, ma'am.

180
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,083
ROLAND: We'll process this stuff,

181
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,960
get it back to you.

182
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,504
Don't lose it, okay?

183
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,506
We won't.

184
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,926
Say, one of you used
to work at Hoyt Foods?

185
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,389
Yeah, I did.

186
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,725
On the chicken line.

187
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,226
Quit a year or two ago.

188
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,731
Make better money in tips
at the Sawhorse.

189
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,024
Why?

190
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,234
Just asking.

191
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,070
Thank you, now.

192
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,710
So Wayne opened up
that the kids weren't doing

193
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,462
what they said they were.

194
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:43,175
With that big reward,
brought everybody out the woodwork.

195
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,010
ALAN: You see Wayne much anymore?

196
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,388
Not at all, really.

197
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,516
And I don't know why.

198
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,977
No hard feelings, though?

199
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,438
Not between him and me.

200
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,940
We were good friends, as I see it.

201
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,945
I think it was

202
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,782
once we stopped working together,

203
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,159
we just stopped.

204
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,747
Sometimes it's like that with people.

205
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,957
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

206
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,879
Dad, can I get a Transformer?

207
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,214
No.

208
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,299
Can we get something
from the toys, Dad?

209
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,468
- If it's cheap?
- No.

210
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,303
Where the hell's the charcoal?

211
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,056
- How about if it's only a dollar?
- No.

212
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,433
Stores aren't supposed to be this big.

213
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,103
Can we at least go look at the toys?

214
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,730
No. You guys have to stay with me.

215
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,194
So we're trying to update the book,
if possible.

216
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,738
Hearing about her prints
at the drugstore,

217
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,615
it's very significant.

218
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,034
How'd you hear about that?

219
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,911
My ex-husband.

220
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,789
He's a cop in Arkansas.

221
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,251
Always had a thing for oops, I guess.

222
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,297
OFFICER: We got a few partials
and a lot of fulls.

223
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,133
We verified it
with the state crime lab.

224
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,926
It's definitely a match.

225
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,848
Were any of her prints
found behind the pharmacy?

226
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,686
No. But we didn't get
to keep working the scene, neither.

227
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,104
End of the day,

228
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,857
store just wanted
to get back to business.

229
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,318
- So hers were just the shelves.
- Yes, ma'am.

230
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,155
We only focused on the robbery,
and that was months ago.

231
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,576
I'm about to clock out.

232
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,078
You wanna grab a bite?
We can talk more about it?

233
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,924
All right.

234
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,480
Hey, I think we're done.

235
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,817
That was awful, right?

236
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,403
Since you guys were so good,
I'll let you get one thing.

237
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,739
- Yes!
- Feel better, sad guy?

238
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,328
Where's your sister?

239
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,206
She was right behind me. I don't know.

240
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,041
Come on.

241
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,587
- Becca!
- Becca!

242
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,005
Becca!

243
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,937
Becca!

244
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,314
Becca! Becca!

245
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,193
Becca! Becca!

246
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,819
WOMAN: <i>(ON PA)
please come to customer service.</i>

247
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,489
<i>Look for the nearest
Wat-Mart representative</i>

248
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,200

<i>Rebecca Hays.</i>

250
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,579
It's been 10 minutes.
Need to lock down the store.

251
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,540
Shut all the doors, nobody in or out.

252
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,834
Listen to me. I'm a cop. State Police.

253
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,296
Lock down the store now. I'll make
an announcement, give me the mic.

254
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,673
Sir, I don't think that you...

255
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,132
- Give me the mic!
- BECCA: Hi.

256
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,679
- Where were you?
- I don't know.

257
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,847
They were giving out chips
in one place,

258
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,141
and I stopped to eat some,
and y'all were gone.

259
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,269
God damn it, you can't do that!
You hear me?

260
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,896
Don't fucking do that, Rebecca!

261
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,232
(CRYING)

262
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,614
Okay. Okay.

263
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,283
Let's go. Let's just go home.

264
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,013
MANAGER: We were happy to help.

265
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:01,558
Especially once we heard
she was a former employee of ours.

266
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,728
Just, it led to a lot of false tips.

267
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,856
You know, it's better
to coordinate this kind of thing

268
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,607
between our offices.

269
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,526
But we did.

270
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,612
The board cleared it with
the county prosecutor's office.

271
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,411
I don't see any pictures of you all
putting up rewards for anybody.

272
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,164
MANAGER: Up till now, we've tended
to help families

273
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,000
with children that needed
medical treatment.

274
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,295
But with it all over the news,
and knowing the mother

275
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,630
used to be in our family of workers,

276
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,507
the board voted to contribute.

277
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,469
When did this outreach start?

278
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,180
Mr. Hoyt endowed the foundation

279
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,016
after they lost their granddaughter
a couple of years ago.

280
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,519
Mother worked on the chicken line.
Where's that building?

281
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,396
Oh. Let's see.

282
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,816
It would be one

283
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,568
of those two.

284
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,822
WAYNE: You know what would help?

285
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,366
Names and dates of hire

286
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,951
for every employee
that works at this plant.

287
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,829
That's nearly 700 people.

288
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,374
Faster we get them back, the better.

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,752
All right. Sure. Of course.

290
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,962
We'll start getting it together
right now.

291
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,508
And the big man, Mr. Hoyt,
he ever here?

292
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:21,054
Well, hardly, no. Mr. Hoyt's
been in Africa since mid-October.

293
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,890
- Safari.
- Oh, yeah?

Listen, we closed right now,

301
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,798

call back in the morning.

314
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,885
and them other kids
didn't play with him, huh?

315
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,319
Who gave Julie the doll,
met them in the woods?

316

Who played the game with Will?

00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,948
Where'd they go after school?

318
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,742
They were meant to be
with that neighbor.

319
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,827
So what was your next move?

320
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,084

have to look for it.

You tracked men in the war?

329
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,908
I did.

330
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,412
Did you march?

331
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,623
I did.

332
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,837
Funny how the protests stopped
once the draft ended.

333
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:53,308
Hey, that poem you were teaching...

334
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,561
Yeah. You had some thoughts about it?

335
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,941
He says you call the story "Time,"

336
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,944
but you can't say its name.

337
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,613
Why is that?

338
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,075
I think it's because

339
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,246
we're in time and of time,

340
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,750
but to name...

341
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,671
You separate yourself from
something when you name it,

342
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:28,343
and I think he means
we can't be separated from time.

343
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,219
Ah.

344
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,767
I thought he meant
it was like the name of God.

345
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,521
You know, how the Hebrews
weren't supposed to say God's name.

346
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,401
Huh.

347
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,760

355
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,300
Are you drunk?

356
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,636
No, I'm...

357
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,847
I had a drink at dinner.

358
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,891
This detective took me out to eat.

359
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,018
- Ah, terrific.
- No, actually,

360
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,646
I got a lot of info from him.

361
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,648
Listen, her fingerprints were found

362
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,608
just on the shelves
in the cosmetics aisle.

363
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,445
Looks like she was
probably a customer.

364
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,572
They had the prior week's
surveillance footage.

365
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,907
I think they're gonna let me
take a look at it.

366
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,535
I didn't get any of the shit you want.

367
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,370

368
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,415
Okay.

369
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,252
Did something happen?

370
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,589
- Are the kids all right?
- The kids are fine.

371
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,674
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

372
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:35,470
But one thing. One favor.

373
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,806
Do not come bouncing in here,
half in the bag,

374
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,100
all giddy about this shit.

375
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,685
Can you do that?

376
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,395
Can you summon the mental resolve

377
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,397
to shut up about this shit with me?

378
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,151
If you feel this way,

379
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,652
you don't have to talk
to me like that.

380
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:54,238
- You could just tell me.
- You've been told.

381
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:57,658
Why don't you go check on your kids
since you haven't seen them all day.

382
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,578
- They're supposed to be in bed.
- Fuck off.

383
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,371
I'm with them five times
the amount you are

384
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,540
for a job that treats you like shit.

385
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,292
I don't really feel
like trading curses.

386
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,668
I said my piece.

387
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,756
I'm not gonna stop, Wayne.

388
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:12,853
Patrol's got the scene.
Forensics is on the way.

389
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,772
That's where the boy died.

390
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,816
Somebody carried him to the cave.

391
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,944
The office checked the field reports.

392
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,363
Nobody talked to this guy.

393
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:25,032
And the farm road's not on our maps.

394
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:38,295
I already talked to your people.

395
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:41,424
Man came here the next day.

396
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,634
What man?

397
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,803
Was he police? Sheriff's?

398
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,515
Man in a suit. Showed me a badge.

399
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,642
Asked me about those missing kids,

400
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,519
if I'd seen anything.

401
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,854
Can you describe him?

402
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:01,986
A normal guy. White. A suit.

403
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,821
Showed me a badge.

404
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,742
What'd you tell him?
Did you see anything?

405
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:11,120
I told him I seen those kids before.

406
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,830
Two or three times.

407
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,958
They come down my road
and into the woods.

408
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,836
Couple afternoons I seen them.

409
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,881
- You see anybody else?
- Yeah.

410
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:25,009
Told him I seen a car
out here a couple times.

411
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,763
Nice one. Brown. Man and woman.

412
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,515
But it wasn't the same day.

413
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,351
What'd they look like?
The man and woman.

414
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,853
Like y'all.

415
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,980
Black and white.

416
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,191
Man was Negro.

417
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,234
I couldn't see faces.

422
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,539

423
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,000
Yes, sir, I mind.

424
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,504
Don't you need a warrant
for something like that?

425
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,840

of the neighborhood

429
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,187
Yes, I do.

430
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,732
We brought whatever we had.

431
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:27,029
General rule is, you start close,
then work your way out.

432
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,990
ELISA: Did officers conduct
multiple interviews

433
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,119
-with all potential witnesses?
- Yes. Mmm-hmm.

434
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,539
And I feel like, honestly,

435
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,125
everyone was giving
everything they had.

436
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:42,169
Well, we have people who say they were
never questioned by the police,

437
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,923
although they remember
the officers going door to door.

438
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,384

If anyone got overlooked,
it was a mistake.

00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,562
We had over 100
law enforcement officers out there.

But nobody spoke to these people.

444
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,904
And we found two who both
separately claim to have witnessed

445
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:12,408
a very nice brown sedan
driving around the neighborhoods,

446
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,703
and later, away from Devil's Den
on the day of the murder.

447
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,125
Brown sedan?

448
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,960
ELISA: A witness said police
talked to him once,

449
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,130
and he told them about the car,
but they never came back.

450
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,966
And there's no mention of the sedan
in the field reports.

451
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,260
Another said police
never took a statement,

452
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,722
but they both noticed the car
because it was new and upscale,

453
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,807
and that was unusual for the area.

454
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:39,810
And that the vehicle
kept driving around.

Another former resident,
Charles Snyder,

459
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,658
said two weeks before,
he reported that his boy and a friend

460
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,703
had told of a black man
with a soar, in a suit,

461
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,706
at the cul-de-sac where the kids
played near Devil's Den.

462
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,959
No one ever came back to question him.

463
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,673
None of this is mentioned
in the official reports.

464
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,680

points to serious flaws
