(THEME SONG PLAYING)

2
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,975
ROLAND: We're doin' an APB,

3
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,103
but we're keepin'
the public out of it.

4
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,690
That'd hurt us
if she don't want to be found.

5
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,026
Like Wayne said,

6
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,071
somebody else might be
lookin' for her, too.

7
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:55,199
We're sending it to Oklahoma.
The Missouri State Police.

8
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,576
How much do we think
this is really her?

9
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,453
I think it's her.

10
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,039
Show it to the father,
see what he thinks.

11
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,001
He don't know what she looks like now
any more than we do.

12
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,586
He could make it into her,
even if it's not.

13
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,714
Just give him somethin' else
to hurt about,

14
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,841
and I ain't gonna do that to the man.

15
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,385
So we don't know it's her.

16
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,888
We find her, we can ask.

17
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,056
What else?

18
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,893
I got the file on the mother, Lucy,
from Clark County Sheriff's.

19
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,896
August 12, 1988.

20
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,523
Housekeeping found her,

21
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,651
motel in Paradise, Nevada,
right outside Vegas.

22
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,987
She'd been stayin' there
'bout three weeks.

23
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,363
The OD fits.

24
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,782
Right. Old news.

25
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,077
The cousin, Dan O'Brien, no luck yet.

26
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,663
Did nine months
Missouri Eastern Correctional.

27
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,832
Bad checks. '85-'86.

28
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,793
Have him in Vegas, '87.
Then he drops off the map.

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,962
Vegas, like Lucy.

30
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:51,964

31
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,384
MORELLI: Yeah,
found a few former residents,

32
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,012
just repeated what they remember,
nothin' jumped out.

33
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,306
Had one guy said
a plainclothes took his statement,

34
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,975
but there's no record
of that interview.

35
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,979
Excuse me, Lieutenant West.

36
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,231
They're wantin' me
to make a statement.

37
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,984
- That's Lucy.
- You shouldn't be here, Tom.

38
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,611
- That picture.
- You don't wanna see that.

39
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,029
- No.
- Come on, now.

40
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,697
I never saw it, man,
didn't really know it...

41
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,240
- I'll tell you about it out here.
- Who's that?

42
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,117
Hold on. Who's that, Lieutenant?
Is that someone...

43
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,037
- Lieutenant, who is that?
- ROLAND: Listen to me.

44
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,582
Calm down, Tom.

45
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,419
TOM: All right, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,254
Ineven_

47
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,799
I never saw that room.

48
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,093
Is that where she was Iivin'?

49
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,804
You shouldn't've seen that.
Try and forget it.

50
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,014
What are you doin' here?

51
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,310
They wanted me
to make a statement. On TV.

52
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:47,520
Sol...

53
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,563
Do you know somethin' you haven't...

54
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,148
What are you lookin' at Lucy for?

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,900
We're just gettin' started.

56
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,653
I told you, Tom, we find
something out, I'll let you know.

57
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,072
Yeah, but that girl.
The black-and-white picture.

58
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,365
Who was she?

59
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,784
- Does she look familiar?
- Shut up.

60
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,078
- Here, look close.
- Who is this?

61

63
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,545
Get back in the squad room. Now.

64
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,303
You need to go home.

65
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,557
I'm gonna give you a call later.

66
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,933
All right?

67
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,185
Who is this?

68
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,312
Is that her?

69
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,275
Is that what she looks like?

70
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:36,610
Tell me.

71
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,465

You think I'm fuckin' goin' somewhere?

- That you, Sergeant?
- Put it down, man.

89
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,744

All right.

Let me return the favor.

96
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,309
Put it down,
and I'll walk you out of here.

97

Nobody made you take the job.

and we just want to know
that you're okay.

120

And for you to know
that you can come home.

REPORTER: Do you now believe
that Mr. Woodard was innocent?

131
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,916
What about the evidence?

132
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,836
I don't know.

133
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,840
I just know that
my daughter's out there,

134
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,260
and for so long
I thought she wasn't.

135
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,762
REPORTER 2:
Sir, do you think the police

136
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,054
fumbled the initial investigation?

137
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,557
KINDT: Mr. Purcell won't be
taking questions right now.

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,434
REPORTER 3: Mr. Attorney General,
what about this petition

139
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,895
to have the original
conviction overturned?

140
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,105
The possibility
of the Purcell girl being alive

141
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,732
doesn't change our conclusion

142
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,111
that Brett Woodard murdered
Will Purcell and kidnapped his sister.

143
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,655
Now, what he may have done with her,
we can't know.

144
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,201
David and Josie Woodard
want their father's name cleared.

145
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,621
Now, we all understand
the violence Brett Woodard committed

146
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,750
and view it as the reaction of a man
persecuted by the violence of others.

147
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,876
Now, regardless,

148
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,213
we insist he is not guilty
of hurtin' those children.

149
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,382
We contend his posthumous conviction
was fraudulent

150
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,967
and a significant dereliction of duty

151
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,969
on the part
of the prosecutin' attorney's office.

REPORTER 4: Is this a mandate
against Gerald Kindt?

153
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,515
It's a mandate against
the lack of due process

154
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,350
that could allow somethin' like this
to happen.

155
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,476
Excuse me.

156
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,062
REPORTER 5: What about the evidence
found at the Woodard place?

157
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,650
Where was
this Perry Mason shit in '80?

158
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,860
Even bein' a lawyer,
you gotta know this is outta line.

159
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,071
Press is the only language
he understands.

160
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,406
You're tellin' me you didn't enjoy
that look on his face?

161
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,659
It's not about you or your old boss.

162
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,329
Maybe consider that man
tryin' to get his daughter back.

163
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,711
Those his kids?

164
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,004
Mmm-hmm.

165
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,589
They know who I am?

166
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,308
Motherfucker made me carry his water.

167
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,978
Like I need more of them memories.

168
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,605
It's good to see you back on the job,
Detective Hays.

169
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,873
Freddy around?

170
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,374
He's changing oil.

171
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,877
He can't take anything new.

172
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,087
We're old friends.

173
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,216
Who remembers?

174
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,635
I saw the Trash Man guy, Woodard,

175
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,012
but he was headin' away
from Devil's Den.

176
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,055
Them two kids was ridin' towards it.

177
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,932
Don't mean anything.

178
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,684
He could have doubled back.

179
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,104
Yeah, sure. I mean, he did it, right?

180
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,983
And you're the one killed him, huh?

181
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,985
I seen you in the paper back then.

182
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,195
We just wanted to know
if you remembered that night.

183
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,699
Maybe you could
take us through it again.

184
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,244
You must be a stone-cold killer, huh?

185
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,206
- Plenty tough with teenagers.
- ROLAND: That night,

186
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,417
you told us Will was alone
when you saw him.

187
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,128
Where was the girl?

188
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,965
- Where was the sister?
- How would I know?

189
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:38,967
He was all nervous,

190
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,053
like, "I can't find my sister.
I don't know where they went."

191
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,304
"They"?

192
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,849
He said "they"?

193
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,142
I'm pretty sure he did.

194
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,270
I don't know, you wanna
slap me around some, make sure?

195
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,689
He give you any indication
who they might be?

196
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,943
You two can't be
very good at your job.

197
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,280
Comin' back 10 years later,
try hangin' this on me.

198
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,449
Nobody's hangin' anything on you.

199
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,118
Maybe killer here wants to see
can he make me piss my pants.

200
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,205
That don't seem
like a very tall order.

201
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,665
Come on, then.

202
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,252
Bounce me off the walls,
you black motherfucker.

203
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,047
'Cause you think there's
something you can do to me,

204
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,216
you might wanna take
another look at my life.

205
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,425
Hold on, now.

206
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,223
Mr. Burns,
I understand your hard feelings,

207
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,725
but we just needed you to remember.

208
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,269
And not for nothin'.

209
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,066
Things might be what they are

210
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,987
'cause you're the type like bullyin'
somebody weaker than you.

211
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,530
(SCOFFS)

212
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,614
And you don't?

213
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,202
I was a teenager, me.
What's your excuse?

214
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,416
I wanna thank you
for your help, Mr. Burns.

215
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,087
Maybe you let me know,
you remember anything else.

216
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,674
Mrs. Burns.

217
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,267
Don't you wanna call me
a shit-heeled twerp again?

218
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,895
Tell me how I'm gonna get ass-raped?

219
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,369
Believe that guy?

220
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,330
Actin' like I ruined his life?

221
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,919
Please explain to me
all the hardships and tribulations

222
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,839
of bein' a white man in this country.

223
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,101
Verified Woodard's location,
which don't mean much.

224
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,395
But they...

225
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,693
Makes me think we need to get back

226
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,780
on who those kids
were meetin' in the forest.

227
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,407
I'm gonna tell you,
when I was his age,

228
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,828
age he was in the room with us,
I was in the fuckin' jungle.

229
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,874
And them toys we found in the woods?

230
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,044
We need to run
those unknown prints again.

231
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,213
They didn't even
have a database in '80.

232
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,756
I made the kid skip college?

233
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,301
So what do you think?

234
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,389
I think that whole generation's
a bunch of pussies.

235
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,560
ROLAND: You left Mena, 16.

236
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,939
You been on the streets
this whole time?

237
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,817
I been all over.

238
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,111
Went as far west as Boulder
a few years back.

239
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,821
You said you recognize this woman?

240
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,824
Yeah. With the same crew a while.

241
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,534
You know, other kids.

242
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,078
We had a good little family.

243
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,872
But she didn't stay long.

244
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,707
What's her name?

245
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,126
Mary, she said.

246
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,710
Mary July.

247
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,963
Was that her real name? I don't know.

248
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,840
She tell you anything about herself?

249
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,508
Where she was from?

250
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,760
I wasn't close with her or anything.

251
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,011
A little nutty.

252
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,513
How's that?

253
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,474
Like, couldn't get straight
on what year it was.

254
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:18,311
Tell some story how she's
a secret princess or somethin'.

255
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,896
Any idea where she might have gone?

256
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,774
No, sir. Really.

257
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,236
I'd try talkin' to workin' girls.
A lot of 'em end up trickin'.

258
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,904
She ever do drugs?

259
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,739
Not that I saw.

260
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,534
Some of her stories
seemed like she used.

261
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:37,706
She's a "princess
from the pink rooms."

262
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,957
I don't know.

263
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,877
Hey, said she lost a brother.

264
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,879
She was lookin' for her brother.
That's right.

265
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,590
- Did she...
- What happened with her brother?

266
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,841
Did she say?

267
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,553
I think they got put apart
when she was young, I don't know.

268
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,971
She act like
she was runnin' from anybody?

269
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,183
I don't know.
You hear that kind of thing,

270
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,351
but everybody on the road's
runnin' from somebody.

271
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,897
Write down names.

272
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,317
Anybody in that crew with you,
anybody else might have known her.

273
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,196
They're not in trouble.

274
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,823
They get a favor
to call in with the police.

275
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,169
Mary July?

276
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,630
Don't know that's our girl.

277
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,839
It's her.

278
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,925
The missin' brother. That's her.

279
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,261
I'm just sayin',
don't want us fixatin'.

280
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,515
Hey. Till we find her, this is her.

281
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,727
Hookers and runaways. Let's go.

282
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,609
WAYNE: <i>Spent a few days
all over the place.</i>

283
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,694
<i>Runaways, workin' girls.</i>

284
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,738
- Want to ask you a couple questions.
<i>- Nobody knew.</i>

285
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,950
<i>Or maybe they did,
but nobody talked to us.</i>

286
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,452
Were you aware
that one of the officers

287
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,331
who processed the Woodard scene,
Harris James, went missing in 1990,

288
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,250
during the second investigation?

289
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,503
Who?

290
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,515
No.

291
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,644
NO, I didn't.

292
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,814
Who was that?

293
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,821
The field statements
said you talked to him in '90.

294
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,575
A lot of people
around this thing are dead.

295
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,078
A lot of people gone.

296
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,249
People do that, miss.

297
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,962
Most people I ever knew are gone.

298
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,230
Foxwood.

299
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,857
They've done all right, huh?

300
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,067
Hate these suburbs.

301
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,194
Like a plastic factory.

302
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,998
Hello, hello! Welcome!

303
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,167
I'm so glad to meet y'all. I'm Lori.

304
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,420
- Come on in.
- ROLAND: Hey.

305
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,672
Hey.

306
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,300
All right.

307
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,473
Your home is beautiful. It really is.

308
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,807
Well, thank you.

309
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,893
We got it after his promotion.

310
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,978
Man been rentin' his whole life.

311
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,564
I said, "You're an adult.
You can afford to own a home."

312
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,608
Too much commitment for this one.

313
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,486
Naw, just, like,
if somethin' needs fixin',

314
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,905
I pick up the phone
and say, "Fix this shit."

315
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,407
Now I gotta fix this shit.

316
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,993
You two been together this whole time?
Since '80?

317
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,704
I saw these two meet.

318
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,581
And I saw you two meet.

319
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,000
I messed with him a bit
first time he saw you.

320
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,961
We were together two years,
and then we split.

321
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,172
And about three years later,

322
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,758
we run into each other at the IGA.

323
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,887
So this time now, we're on five years.

324
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,264
I add 'em together.

325
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,142
I say seven years
with a little vacation in between.

326
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,645
So when's the big day?

327
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,148
Well, that is touchy.

328
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,858
Don't be comin' to my house
to break bread,

329
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,235
thinkin' you're gonna stir shit up.

330
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,491
How's the case going?

331
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,494
I saw Tom on the TV.
Have you been able...

332
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,454
Nobody wants to talk about that.

333
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,665
No, I'm curious, too.

334
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,502
It's just the first week.
We got some stuff we're lookin' at.

335
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,421
It's incredible she's alive.

336
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,089
Do you know anything?
Where she's been?

337
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,715
You see how late I been workin'.

338
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,093
Maybe let's forget about it tonight.

339
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,929
ROLAND: We found a runaway.
The guy knew her.

340
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,557
We tried askin' others, street kids,

341
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,559
but they ain't talkin' to us.

342
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,853
Have you tried that women's shelter
on Pine Street?

343
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,356
Can't really get into it,
stuff bein' classified and all.

344
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,692
- Come on...
- Would you stop?

345
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,573
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,533
I'm a writer, I can't help it.

347
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,952
Right. He said. You have a book.

348
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,289
Yeah, it comes out next week.

349
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,374
It's all about the case.

350
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,751

00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,800
How do you know that?

704
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,927
Some things Ame quoted in the book.

705
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,805
Things the mother said.
I'll show you. They line up.

706
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,351
Why would she do that?

707
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:42,522
I think, you look at the note,
what it's sayin',

708
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:47,694
think she was tryin'
to make Tom feel better.

709
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:49,863
Tryin' to get him to let go.

710
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:52,907
'Cause she already had, way before.

711
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:57,078
So what? So what if she did?

712
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:59,789
We already knew
she had some connection to...

713
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,419
That guy whose name you just said.

714
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,424
He came to see me.

715
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,927
Day after what happened.

716
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:14,971
Hoyt.

717
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:17,098
What?

718
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,312
You never told me that.

719
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,564
I made a decision.

720
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:28,151
I had other things to think about.

721
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,694
Includin' a family.

722
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,529
I let it go.

723
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:33,948
What'd you get from him?

724
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:36,576
Nothin', I think.

725
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,124
He knew about what we done.

726
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,045
Seemed like he was in the dark
on some stuff, too.

727
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,298
I can't...

728
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:57,138
I really can't remember.

729
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,769
Passed away some years back.

730
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,565
You walked away.

731
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:13,529
Not this time.

732
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,992
This what you come to see me about?

733
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,412
Twenty-five years.

734
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:24,540
What, you doin' old man fantasy camp?

735
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,377
You think you...

736
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:31,798
Think you can just roll up here
and I'll be all, "Golly gee, partner!

737
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,884
"Let's grab
ourjunior detective clue-finders

738
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:36,636
"and have an adventure!"

739
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,228
(DOGS BARKING)

740
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:49,357
You...

741
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:53,945
You know, '80?

742
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,863
We stopped bein' partners.

743
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,365
You get married.

744
00:51:57,657 --> 00:52:00,118
It's natural
for people to drift apart.

745
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:04,998
This right now? This ain't that.

746
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,584
All this time.

747
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,212
You never picked up the phone.

748
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,215
Never dropped by for a beer.

749
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:17,593
Never said you're fuckin' sorry once.

750
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,053
Roland...

751
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,306
And I was gonna put that shit aside.

752
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,474
Have a drink with you.

753
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:25,768
Reminisce.

754
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:31,024
Maybe just watch the dogs play
and the sun go fuckin' down.

755
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,026
But look what you're doin'.

756
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,154
How many of those
you go through a week?

757
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,031
Hey, fuck you, man!

758
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,824
I'm fine.

759
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,578
Alone, out here.

760
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:49,667
No woman. No kids.

761
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,255
And no old friends.

762
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:00,970
So that means I get to drink
exactly as much as I want to.

763
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:05,558
You don'tjudge me, motherfucker.

764
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,561
I know you.

765
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:10,396
I know what you did.

766
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,523
What I did.

767
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,152
You talkin' 'bout my drinkin'?

768
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,863
I'd whip your ass
if it wouldn't kill you.

769
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:23,785
And you still ain't apologized.

770
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,661
Roland.

771
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,083
I don't remember.

772
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,669
I'm sorry.

773
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,716
I'm sorry, but I just can't remember.

774
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,346
I don't... I...

775
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,099
I can't...

776
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,561
Can't remember my life, man.

777
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,816
I can't remember my wife.

778
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,655
I don't know.

779
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,448
If you tell me I...

780
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:07,745
I did something wrong,
well, okay. I'm sorry.

781
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,247
It's all right.

782
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,706
I'm sorry.

783
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:17,588
I got this...

784
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,092
This file I'm workin' on,

785
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,803
and I read it every mornin'.

786
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:26,514
And...

787
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,308
But I'm missin' so much.

788
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:36,357
But you remember some stuff.

789
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:38,484
I mean,

790
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,571
you know me, right?

791
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:45,616
Nah, it's other things.

792
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,496
- Hey, look.
-(SNIFFLES)

793
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,999
You need help killin' time,

794
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,460
I'm your man.

795
00:54:57,086 --> 00:55:02,216
I come up with ways to kill time
ain't nobody ever thought of.

796
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,261
You wanna drink? Talk?

797
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:09,682
Watch a ball game?

798
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,144
I'm right here.

799
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:17,899
But I don't want to dip so much
as a toe back in that shit.

800
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:23,029
She could still be out there.

801
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,822
Don't give me that.

802
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,410
Half the cases you ever worked
never closed.

803
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:32,497
You quit the job.

804
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,457
I was there.

805
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,876
There were other considerations
at the time.

806
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,377
I just...

807
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:41,797
Between me and Ame.

808
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,676
And before I'm

809
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:49,013
a droolin' fuckin' squash plant,

810
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,265
and with whatever brains I got left,

811
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,476
I'm gonna finish this.

812
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,481
No.

813
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:00,900
Yes.

814
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:02,235
No.

815
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:04,320
Oh, yes.

816
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:07,490
No, man.

817
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:12,328
Come on.

818
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,957
Stir some shit up with me.

819
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:19,794
(COUGHS)

820
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,258
How is it your son
don't have you looked up?

821
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,302
He don't know how fucked up I am.

822
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:32,056
Well, I got bad news.

823
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,685
Your condition's worse than you think.

824
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:39,313
You imagine
two old motherfuckers like us

825
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:42,316
doin' anything
other than pissin' our pants?

826
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:45,486
Come on.

827
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,823
This is some sad senile shit.

828
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,413
Seventy-year-old black man

829
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,711
goin' batshit crazy, runnin' around
with a badge and gun.

830
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,548
You shouldn't miss that.

831
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,305
Well, I could use a laugh.
