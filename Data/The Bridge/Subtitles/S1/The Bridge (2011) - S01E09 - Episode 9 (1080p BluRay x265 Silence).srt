00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,079
SUMMARY

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,039
The report you filed
against Martin...

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,679
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,399
-Should I take the gun?
-You can't be armed in Sweden.

5
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:24,159
What the hell have they been doing?

6
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:26,559
Lie down! Lie down!

7
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,279
Get back!

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,079
Knock, knock...
Hey... What's going on?

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,319
-It pinches.
-You're going to the hospital.

10
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,959
The children are fine.
You have kidney stones.

11
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,759
-The children? As in twins?
-Yes.

12
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,999
Drop your weapon!

13
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,359
They're not the ones.
Back to square one.

14
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:59,119
The girl is 14-year-old Anja Björk.
She ran away from home.

15
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,359
Saga Norén was here.

16
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,919
You always choose the easy way out.
That's just the way it is. So do I.

17
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,759
-He's in the military.
-Police task force.

18
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:17,799
It's Jens.
We worked together for years.

19
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,719
His wife and child died.
They were pushed against a lorry.

20
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,239
-He blew his head off years ago.
-They took no fingerprints or DNA.

21
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:33,039
-Saga thinks he's alive.
-He can't be.

22
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,759
EPISODE 9

23
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,079
-Hi.
-Hi.

24
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,119
-Are you allowed to sleep here again?
-Yes.

25
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:12,599
-You're good together.
-Yes, we are.

26
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,279
-Are you going to work?
-I'm going to Malmö.

27
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:23,879
-I thought he was done.
-Yes, but we're not done chasing him.

28
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,599
Saga thinks he'll carry on.

29
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,679
-With what?
-I don't know.

30
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,319
When this is over, maybe we
could do something together.

31
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,679
-We could go somewhere.
-The two of us?

32
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:54,479
-Where would we go?
- I don't know.

33
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,999
-Think about it until tonight.
-OK.

34
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,919
It's too risky,
someone might recognize him.

35
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,919
-He's changed his appearance.
-We have to assume so.

36
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,879
Bjørn recognized him,
but only the eyes.

37
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,319
Look for something to do with plastic
surgeons after the staged suicide.

38
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,919
-Anything in particular?
-Deaths and missing persons.

39
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,399
-Hi, everybody. Hi, Saga.
-I thought you'd sleep at my place.

40
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,399
-I was allowed to sleep at home.
-Right.

41
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,879
-We're not seeing each other.
-He cheated, his wife threw him out.

42
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,599
-He slept on my camp bed.
-Now you all know.

43
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,519
-Why was Jens' wife out driving?
-Mikaela. Her name was Mikaela.

44
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:08,919
-Why was Mikaela on the bridge?
-She was going to see her parents.

45
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,999
At 2 a.m. midweek?

46
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,639
What a strange time to visit
your parents with a 7-year-old.

47
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:25,039
THE BRIDGE

48
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,599
Can you look after
the children a while?

49
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,359
-When?
-Around 11 o'clock.

50
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,919
-Why aren't they in school?
-They're off. We're going to the zoo.

51
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,759
-What are you doing first?
-I have a meeting here.

52
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,479
-I thought you were on sick leave.
-We're just preparing a presentation.

53
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,679
I don't want the children to disturb.

54
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,319
-Can you take them out?
-No, I'm going to town.

55
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,999
It's difficult to move in with me,
you don't see much of Martin.

56
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,399
So I've not asked anything of you.

57
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:27,479
You use our home as a hotel.
But now I need your help.

58
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,919
What is so important
you can't help me?

59
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,839
I've got a job interview.

60
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,039
A job interview? About a job?

61
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,279
Yes, so that I can pay
the hotel bill.

62
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,519
OK. I'll work something out.

63
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,959
-The job's a good thing. Good luck.
-Thanks.

64
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,439
-Think aloud.
-You and Jens were friends.

65
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,719
-That's why he didn't shoot you.
-Probably.

66
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,879
Is your relationship
relevant to the investigation?

67
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,559
I don't know.
Jens was a good police officer.

68
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,799
He was a good person.
He wanted to change the world.

69
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,079
-This is different.
-That night on the bridge...

70
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:04,199
-She wasn't going to her parents.
-Where was she going?

71
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:10,119
They said that her friend
Josefin Samuelsson might know.

72
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,239
-Mikaela was on her way to see her.
-Yes.

73
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,679
-Why was Mikaela on her way?
-She and Jens had a row.

74
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,559
She asked
if she and Rasmus could sleep over.

75
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,319
-What was the row about?
-She wanted a divorce.

76
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,599
She'd met someone else.

77
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,039
Jens went furious
and didn't want to see her again.

78
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:49,679
She didn't dare to stay.
She was coming here with Rasmus.

79
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,399
-Did she tell you who she'd met?
-No.

80
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,959
-Did she tell Jens?
-No, only that she'd met someone.

81
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:03,079
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

82
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:07,799
I asked her if she ought to
warn him against Jens.

83
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,159
-But Jens didn't know who he was.
-Did she say anything else?

84
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:17,759
-Excuse me.
-No, we were going to see each other.

85
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,119
Why are you asking about this now?

86
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,839
They were mentioned
as part of an investigation.

87
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:30,199
-Jens is dead, he committed suicide.
-Yes, we know.

88
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,719
Martin? Why did you leave?

89
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,439
The man that Mikaela met...
It was me.

90
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,559
I wasn't married.
It was long before I met Mette.

91
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,999
Susanne and I were divorced.
She and Julie left me.

92
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,399
Mikaela was having a hard time.

93
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,279
-You weren't married, but she was.
-Yes.

94
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,279
-With your best friend and colleague.
-Can we keep this to ourselves?

95
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:35,679
I don't want
the rest of the team to know.

96
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,159
If it affects the investigation,
they have to be told.

97
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:46,039
-Did you know that she'd tell him?
-No.

98
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:51,759
It must have been hard to see him.
Could you have remained colleagues-

99
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,999
-if you and his wife had become
a couple? Maybe you didn't plan to.

100
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,479
I certainly didn't plan
to cause her death.

101
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,279
-You didn't.
-Yes.

102
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,399
She chose to tell him.
He became angry.

103
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,279
Without me there would have been
nothing to tell.

104
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,239
Without a bridge
she wouldn't have crashed.

105
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,919
-You can't think like that.
-No, but I do.

106
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,799
-Let's go.
-OK.

107
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,879
-Have you got anything?
-Well...

108
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:45,159
It's cost a lot to do these things.

109
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:49,559
We looked for
properties and transactions.

110
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:54,639
We checked
unsolved robberies and break-ins.

111
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,239
It's brought us nowhere so far.

112
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,559
Do your colleagues know
that Jens is alive?

113
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:06,679
-Yes, a few chosen by Lillian.
-What did the friend say?

114
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:13,359
Mikaela told Jens that she was
leaving him. She was scared to stay.

115
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,439
-Why did she leave?
-She'd met someone.

116
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,999
Do we know whom?

117
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,759
No. She didn't know, nor did Jens.

118
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,479
-And it doesn't really matter.
-OK.

119
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,319
Saga? Karl-Erik Hermansson
was a plastic surgeon.

120
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,319
He died in a car accident.
His practice was close to Triangeln.

121
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:47,279
-Did he have any colleagues?
-A nurse called Elsa Dahlberg.

122
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:57,759
-Saga, you're doing a good job.
-Yes.

123
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,119
If this leads to anything...
You're good.

124
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,239
And...if anyone's going to catch him,
it'll be you.

125
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,079
-Yes, I think so as well.
-Yes.

126
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,359
-Do you ever praise the others?
-No.

127
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,519
-Why not?
-I just tell them what to do.

128
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,679
-They're good.
-Yes, that's their job.

129
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,239
-Don't you want praise?
-No, that's not necessary.

130
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:53,239
-Do you think it's important?
-Yes, very. Most people do.

131
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:58,879
-Do you want me to sing your praise?
-Sure.

132
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,359
-What do you want me to say?
-It doesn't work like that.

133
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,679
That's like telling someone
to say "I love you".

134
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,919
It has to be spontaneous.

135
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,399
Did you miss me yesterday?
When I didn't show up in the evening?

136
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,799
Yes, a little.

137
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,639
Karl-Erik...

138
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,839
They said that he killed himself,
but I never believed that.

139
00:14:54,999 --> 00:15:00,039
-Why not?
-We worked together for 11 years.

140
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,439
I would have known
if he was planning suicide.

141
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:09,599
No, many that commit suicide
don't display suicidal tendencies.

142
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:18,919
And then there was that fire.
Something wasn't right.

143
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:24,359
-What fire?
-At the practice, after his death.

144
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:30,479
-The entire house nearly burnt down.
-Was he one of your patients?

145
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,359
Yes, yes...

146
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,319
Jens something. Danish.

147
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:46,599
I wouldn't have been surprised
if he'd committed suicide.

148
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,719
-Why not?
-Such extensive changes indicate...

149
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,399
...problems beyond your appearance.

150
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,839
-What did he have done?
-The hairline, the nose...

151
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,879
...the mouth, the teeth,
changes to the bone structure.

152
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,839
But he became really handsome.

153
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:11,839
Karl-Erik was good at his job.

154
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,759
Do you have any medical records?

155
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:20,479
There were medical records
and computer back-ups.

156
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,319
It was in the same room in the fire.

157
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:28,239
Can you describe him
if we bring in a sketch artist?

158
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,399
-I think I've got a photo of him.
-Of him? After the operation?

159
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:41,439
I kept paper copies
of some of my patients' records.

160
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:45,399
I worked from home at times,
my husband was ill.

161
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:50,999
-So you might have some here?
-Yes, in the attic.

162
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,519
-Do you know where you put them?
-In a box.

163
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:07,239
-Is it marked?
-I can't remember.

164
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:10,079
It should be a bit further in.

165
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:14,199
-How far in?
-A bit further that way.

166
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,319
It might be next to a typewriter.

167
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,279
There it is.

168
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,159
It's marked "office".

169
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,719
-Is it marked "office"?
-Yes, that's it.

170
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,279
There.

171
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:18,079
-Hi.
-Sorry I'm late.

172
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,319
-Flowers to make you feel better.
-Thank you.

173
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,799
Come in.

174
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,079
This is what he looks like now.

175
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,799
-What do we do?
-I'm trying to find his name.

176
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,919
Should we distribute the picture?

177
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,999
He doesn't know
that his appearance is known.

178
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,439
If no one but us know,
he won't be recognized.

179
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,959
None of us will run into him.
To catch him everyone must know.

180
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,359
-He'll find out and go into hiding.
-If there's a leak.

181
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,719
He somehow receives
info we distribute.

182
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,519
We'll keep it to ourselves
for a while.

183
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:13,639
-For how long?
-We'll distribute it in the morning.

184
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,879
A nationwide alert in both countries
and Europol and Interpol.

185
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,439
-Martin? I don't like lying to Hans.
-What have you lied about?

186
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,919
I haven't mentioned
your affair with Mikaela.

187
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:34,639
You just haven't told him.
That's not a lie.

188
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,479
To not tell the truth
is the definition of lying.

189
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:42,799
-Has he asked you?
-No.

190
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:48,199
-Did he ask if you're hiding info?
-No.

191
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,479
-Then you haven't lied.
-He'll find out sooner or later.

192
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,159
Say that you knew,
but that it wasn't relevant.

193
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,119
I'd be lying.

194
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,359
-Is it relevant?
-Not so far.

195
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,599
-What a nice house.
-Thanks, we like it here.

196
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:32,599
-What does your husband do?
-He's a policeman.

197
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:39,279
How exciting. What kind
of crime does he work with?

198
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,799
He's an investigator.

199
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:46,599
He's working on
the killer from the bridge, or T.T.

200
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:51,759
-Or whatever you call that madman.
-He has his hands full then.

201
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,279
-They seem unable to catch him.
-No, they're closer than we think.

202
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:03,359
-Mum, when are we leaving?
-Later, if I'm up to it.

203
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,439
-You promised.
-That was before I fell ill.

204
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,639
-You manage to work.
-If you disturb me, it takes longer.

205
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:17,919
-Then I'll be more tired. OK?
-Ok, then...

206
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:23,159
-Where are you going?
-To the zoo.

207
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:27,319
I'll bribe them
with a film and sweets instead.

208
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,879
-The zoo sounds more fun.
-That's what they think.

209
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:37,199
-Do you want me to join you?
-No, I'll manage.

210
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,119
I'm sure you will,
but I can help out.

211
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,879
-If you want me to.
-No, that won't be necessary.

212
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,199
I haven't been there for ages,
it'd be fun.

213
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,999
Well, thank you. That's nice.

214
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:11,159
Thanks for coming,
we'll get back to you.

215
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,959
"Thank you for your interest.
The position has been filled."

216
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,759
-Excuse me?
-If you need help with the wording.

217
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:25,959
-As I said, we'll get back to you.
-Thank you.

218
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,519
August!

219
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,639
-Why are you here so early?
-What?

220
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,319
You were to arrive this afternoon.

221
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:10,719
-We were supposed to meet up.
-Were we?

222
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:14,879
-That's what we arranged.
-When did we do that?

223
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,439
Online the day before yesterday.

224
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,439
-We've never chatted online.
-Knock it off.

225
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,159
-We haven't.
-You have to be joking.

226
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,079
-We've chatted every night.
-No, we haven't.

227
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:37,999
Someone must have been
pulling your leg.

228
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,119
-I hope you haven't revealed too much.
-Oh, fuck.

229
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:50,199
-Do you regret something you said?
-Not really.

230
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,039
I don't know. I thought it was you.

231
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:59,519
Yes, well...
We met anyway, as it turned out.

232
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,559
-Am I disturbing? Where's Martin?
-On a coffee break.

233
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,519
-Should I fetch him?
-No, no.

234
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,839
I want you to know this before
the others. I asked for a transfer.

235
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:26,839
-Yes, to Gothenburg.
-It's going to happen.

236
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:31,319
-When?
-I want to finish this first.

237
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:36,239
-And they have to find a successor.
-How long does that take?

238
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,839
I don't know, maybe a month.

239
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,119
-Do you know who it'll be?
-No.

240
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,039
You'll be fine,
you're a wonderful police officer.

241
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,279
-Not everyone thinks so.
-Then they're wrong.

242
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:57,359
All aren't
as understanding as you are.

243
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,879
-I just wanted you to know.
-Thanks.

244
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,879
A meeting at John's.

245
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,239
OK, we've got a name.
Sebastian Sandstrod.

246
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:34,599
I found a link between Jens'
bank accounts and Sebastian.

247
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,319
-He runs an IT consultancy firm.
-Where?

248
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:42,079
There's no office,
just a PO box and a mobile.

249
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:46,599
We've got his card details,
driving licence and address.

250
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,639
-Where does he live?
-Outside of Copenhagen. Hellerup.

251
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,239
-Did Jens live there?
-No.

252
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:57,679
Well done. Well done, everybody.

253
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,639
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

254
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,719
-Do you want to go with me?
-No, I'll go with Martin.

255
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,359
OK.

256
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,479
-Who are you calling?
-Mette.

257
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:16,639
-Does she know about Mikaela?
-No.

258
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,399
Maybe you shouldn't
tell her just now.

259
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,839
You weren't together
when you did Mikaela, but...

260
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,199
-Thank you.
-Yes.

261
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,599
That's it. You can wait outside.

262
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:40,079
It's my husband,
I'll call him later.

263
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:44,639
-There. Where's your hat?
-I don't know.

264
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:52,119
-Did you tell your husband about us?
-What about us?

265
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:57,359
-That I'm going with you to the zoo.
-I left a note.

266
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:02,879
That's it, I think we're ready.

267
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,719
-You're not having second thoughts?
-No, I look forward to it.

268
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,959
The house is cleared!

269
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,599
I'm ready, we'll go in.

270
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:19,759
Martin? Saga? Down here.

271
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,639
I need Gry, Navid and Anne here.
They know what to look for.

272
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,359
-We've got Danish officers.
-Let's put politics aside.

273
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,439
You've got nothing to lose.

274
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,599
-I'll go see someone that knew Jens.
-You knew him.

275
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,079
-Not recent years.
-I'll get the team here.

276
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:14,879
-I withdrew the report against you.
-The one from the bridge?

277
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,919
-Yes. I thought you should know.
-Thanks.

278
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,719
-But you made a mistake.
-Thanks anyway.

279
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,799
Did she talk about me
on the way here?

280
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:39,439
-No, was she supposed to?
-Not really.

281
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,679
-I've resigned, I'm going to move.
-Yes, I know.

282
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,399
It's definite now,
and I wonder how she is.

283
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:53,519
-Saga doesn't share her feelings.
-You're most likely to hear about it.

284
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,639
-Can you ask her?
-Yes, of course.

285
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,439
-She means a lot to me.
-You mean a lot to her.

286
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,159
-Do you recall my colleague Jens?
-Yes, he stayed here.

287
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,439
Did he mention other places?
Places where he felt safe?

288
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:56,879
Well, he didn't talk much.
He kept to himself.

289
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,479
-I need something, Olsen.
-He got that caravan.

290
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:06,479
Other than that? No.
Why do you ask?

291
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,239
It wasn't suicide.

292
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,079
-Was he killed?
-He's alive.

293
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:19,159
-What?
-He's called Sebastian Sandstrod.

294
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,719
-Do you know him?
-No, no.

295
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:29,079
Try to remember.
Is there anything at all?

296
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,399
Hang on... He...

297
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,679
-He got a parcel just before he left.
-What was in it?

298
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:44,959
His family had
a summer house in Sweden.

299
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,719
When they sold it, they sent him
some of Mikaela's things.

300
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:54,239
-What was it?
-I'm not sure.

301
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:01,119
Note books, letters, personal items.
Something made him angry.

302
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,359
-What?
-I don't know.

303
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,279
He wanted someone dead.

304
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:13,399
He broke furniture,
he really lost it. I threw him out.

305
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:20,559
He got that caravan where he...
Well, he never came back.

306
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,719
-Yes?
-Hi, it's Saga. He knows it was you.

307
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,639
Hello?

308
00:32:57,439 --> 00:33:01,039
Come on. For God's sake, answer.

309
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,799
-It's August.
-Hi, is Mette at home?

310
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,279
No. I'm alone.

311
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:19,719
-Where is she?
-She spoke about going to the zoo.

312
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:24,399
-I didn't think she went.
-There's a note.

313
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,399
She did go, someone joined her.

314
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,519
-Who?
-Sebastian Sandstrod.

315
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:56,519
Everyone knows what he looks like.
There's a nationwide alert.

316
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:03,519
Gry, Navid and Anne are checking
his basement. He planned this.

317
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,799
-Did he succeed with everything else?
-Yes.

318
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:13,959
-Does that mean...?
-Stop it. Don't even think it. OK?

319
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,239
The zoo was searched,
they're not there.

320
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:22,599
Why is he after you?
You were friends.

321
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:27,039
Do you think I can read his mind?

322
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,199
-And Mette's mobile?
-Barbara is working on it.

323
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,679
Just go.

324
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,479
I've got it. It's in that area.

325
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,039
-Can't you narrow it down?
-No, but it doesn't seem to move.

326
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,319
-What's that?
-The zoo.

327
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:06,999
-Then how could they miss them?
-It's not correct.

328
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:11,559
-The sound might be switched off.
-He let Mette write his name.

329
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:15,879
He knows we'll find out
who he is and where they are.

330
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:23,679
-Yes, but this is our best lead.
-Then how about a thank you?

331
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,399
A team arrives in five minutes.

332
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,999
-No uniforms. We're leaving now.
-Good.

333
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:42,399
Aren't we leaving? What is it?

334
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:20,079
OK. We'll go in now.

335
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,959
Go that way.

336
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:49,159
-Saga Norén.
-Hi. He used his credit card.

337
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:53,719
-Five minutes ago at a zoo café.
-He used his credit card here.

338
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,599
-Where?
-It's called Provianten.

339
00:36:56,759 --> 00:36:59,959
-Provianten.
-Come on.

340
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,719
Excuse me...

341
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,639
It's the police.
Show me the credit card you used.

342
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:21,799
It's not mine, it was given to me.
He told me to use it here.

343
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,999
Are you Martin?
He said you'd show up.

344
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,959
Take it easy, take it easy.

345
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:37,959
It's just this.
He said it was for you.

346
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,439
Right.

347
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:50,239
Catch me, if you can!

348
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,839
-Let's race each other.
-Haven't you got any children?

349
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,239
No.

350
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:10,679
I have had. A son.

351
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,559
-What happened?
-A car accident.

352
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:21,359
-Oh, I'm sorry. How terrible.
-Yes.

353
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:30,519
It took a while, but...
I got back on my feet.

354
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,159
The worst thing is the anger.

355
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:41,479
You need an outlet for your anger.
I work on it every day.

356
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:49,519
-I don't know what I'd do.
-No.

357
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,479
-What about your wife? Was she...?
-She'd met someone else.

358
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,119
She wanted a divorce. I lost her
even before the accident.

359
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:07,119
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

360
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,159
-That's OK.
-Martin cheated on me.

361
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,159
It's not relevant,
but I know what you've been through.

362
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,759
It hurts.

363
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:33,879
We should...

364
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:39,799
-Children? We're leaving now.
-We're coming.

365
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:42,839
Yes!

366
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:46,959
Thank you,
it's been a really nice day.

367
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,999
-I want to show you one more thing.
-Yes!

368
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,839
-We should go home, they're tired.
-It won't take long.

369
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:58,879
-You won't regret it.
-OK.

370
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,399
We drove far
to get to Legoland as well.

371
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:28,599
-The door is open.
-Yes! Yes!

372
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,919
There's a surprise for you inside.

373
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,799
The light switch is by the door.

374
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:44,199
-Is it yours?
-It belongs to a friend.

375
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,839
-What do you think it is? A rat?
-I think so too.

376
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:58,039
Rats aren't that small.
I think they're bigger.

377
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,679
What is it?

378
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,359
-I'm sorry.
-I don't know, it's just...

379
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:23,359
I'll get the children.

380
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,519
Come on. We're going home.

381
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,919
-Look, a hamster.
-Yes.

382
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:35,079
I have something for you as well.
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

383
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:41,079
Give me your hand.
Hold on to this.

384
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,999
-What is it?
-I'm almost done.

385
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,279
Squeeze it. That's it.

386
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,519
You can look now.

387
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,519
What is it, mum?

388
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,719
What is it?

389
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:18,639
Sit down, please sit down.
Do as I say. Sit down!

390
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:37,079
Help!

391
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:48,199
I spoke to my father.

392
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,679
-Did it go well?
-Better than expected.

393
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,999
Yes?

394
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,599
-Have you found them?
-No.

395
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:43,039
I thought about something.

396
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,919
Do you remember Frida
that I've been chatting to? My ex?

397
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,239
-Yes, what about her?
-It wasn't Frida.

398
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:01,199
Let's go, Saga.

399
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,199
She's not on the chat line.
It's someone else.

400
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,199
-When did she contact you?
-A week ago.

401
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,799
It's Jens. You wrote
that we were looking for Anja.

402
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:26,799
Did it matter?

403
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:36,399
-Anything else?
-He doesn't know that he met Frida.

404
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:42,479
-We can contact him as August.
-He didn't answer about today.

405
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:48,319
-What's happening today?
-I was meeting Frida, I thought.

406
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:51,679
-Fælledparken in an hour and a half?
-Yes.

407
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,959
-Have you got a hoodie?
-Yes.

408
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,399
-Will he show up?
-He's been true to his word so far.

409
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,039
-I'm going.
-I'll stay here and check this.

410
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,039
-I'm in position.
-Received.

411
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,319
Give me your status, 1 to 4.

412
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,559
Unit 1 is ready.
I can see the target.

413
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,839
Unit 2 is in position.
I can see the target.

414
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:36,199
Unit 3 is in position.
I can see the target.

415
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:42,359
-Unit 4 is in position.
-Received. Stand by.

416
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:34,079
A man is approaching the target.

417
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:44,919
-What's happening?
-A man with a dog is approaching.

418
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,319
All units,
move slowly towards the target.

419
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,319
It's not him. Continue the operation.
Return to initial positions.

420
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:42,479
I'd like to report
some strange sounds.

421
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,519
A woman and some children
are screaming.

422
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:53,199
-You write a lot about me.
-Yes, maybe...

423
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,879
-MILF.
-Yes. It was just a joke.

424
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:05,399
-It means...
-I know, but I don't have children.

425
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,039
Did it matter that I mentioned Anja?

426
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,759
He didn't know
that we were looking for her.

427
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,679
It was my fault that she died.

428
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:34,919
We shouldn't have spoken about her.
It was unprofessional.

429
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:41,439
-I didn't know it was him.
-I know. He's smart and dangerous.

430
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:47,119
Will he kill Mette and the children?

431
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:54,399
Give me a straight answer.

432
00:48:56,439 --> 00:49:00,119
Probably,
if he hasn't done it already.

433
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:36,319
-Nothing yet. What do we do?
-Hang on.

434
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:41,679
-He's twenty minutes late.
-He's not coming. Call it off.

435
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,359
-Abort! He's not coming.
-Abort the operation.

436
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:50,959
-Pack up, we'll see you at home.
-Yes?

437
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:58,719
Martin? The central received
a call about cries for help.

438
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:02,319
-A woman and some children.
-Morten, you drive.

439
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:19,159
-Why is he doing this?
-His family died in an accident.

440
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:24,519
He feels that there were made errors.
He's taking revenge.

441
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:28,759
All the talk
about opening people's eyes...

442
00:50:28,919 --> 00:50:32,439
-...was just talk?
-Yes.

443
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,079
What was my father's error?

444
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,759
-You have to ask him.
-But you know?

445
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:55,519
Did he let him down?
He let me and my mother down.

446
00:50:56,479 --> 00:51:03,359
And my half sister and her mother.
And Mette. That's just the way he is.

447
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:23,239
Wait here.

448
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:27,359
Mette? Mette!

449
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,919
What's happening, Martin?

450
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:46,919
Lillian! Listen to me.

451
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:51,079
Lillian is coming, go with her.
There's a grenade.

452
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,319
I'll stay with mum.
Get the children out.

453
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:59,319
-I'll stay with mum.
-Come on.

454
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,279
-Help me.
-I'm with you now.

455
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:08,799
I'll hold here. I'll help you.

456
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:14,959
Come, darling. You've done
really well. Let's do this together.

457
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,319
-We're ready, Martin.
-Yes.

458
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,439
To the left, the ruins are cleared.

459
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,279
Come on.

460
00:52:34,439 --> 00:52:38,599
Come on. I'm with you.

461
00:52:40,919 --> 00:52:43,839
On the count of three you let go.

462
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:52,039
OK? On three. Raise your hand.

463
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:00,799
On three you open your hand
and let go. Ready?

464
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:04,839
One, two, three.

465
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,759
OK. Yes. Thank you. Bye.

466
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,719
John didn't find anything
on the chat line.

467
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,599
-Who's John?
-The IT manager in my unit.

468
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,199
Isn't that typical? Just when things
are getting better...

469
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,559
Frida made me...
or the guy I thought was Frida...

470
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,079
He made me see my father
in a new light.

471
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,319
He got me closer to him.

472
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:13,359
He gave good advice,
but it was just some psychopath.

473
00:54:18,439 --> 00:54:20,999
-Are you listening?
-The park...

474
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:26,039
-Have you heard anything?
-Mikaela was lost to him already.

475
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:28,719
He didn't want to see her again.

476
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:33,679
-So he lost a son.
-Who?

477
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,639
You and Martin were to grow closer,
so that it would hit him harder.

478
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,119
What are you talking about?

479
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:44,639
He's not after the others.
He's after you!

480
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,199
-It's Saga Norén. Do you read me?
-What's going on?

481
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,319
-It's Saga Norén. Do you read me?
-Why don't they answer?

482
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:02,599
It's Saga. Do you read me?

483
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,399
What are you doing?

484
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,759
He's here.

485
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:28,159
-Haven't you got your gun?
-No. Hush, come on.

486
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,879
Wait here.

487
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:05,399
No!

488
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:15,319
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

489
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:15,799
