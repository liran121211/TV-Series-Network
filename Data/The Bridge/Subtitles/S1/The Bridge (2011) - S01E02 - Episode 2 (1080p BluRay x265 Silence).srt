00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,079
SUMMARY

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,799
The lights on the bridge went out.

3
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:15,719
It went black for 45 seconds.

4
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,639
- Saga Norén.
- Copenhagen Police.

5
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:35,759
Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
Two women killed a year apart.

6
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:39,759
Dismembered and assembled.

7
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:43,399
- Someone wants to make a statement.
- I can identify the lower body.

8
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,959
The father changed his mind.

9
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,319
We can't have the heart. Göran!

10
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,479
I've got the car's license number.

11
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,839
- It belongs to Daniel Farbé.
- The journalist?

12
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:12,519
- Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
- Who?

13
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,239
It skipped a minute. What did you do?

14
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,519
Come back! Where are you going?

15
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,239
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

16
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,279
- It's clean.
- Sorry about the drama.

17
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,759
I assume I have your attention now.

18
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:48,799
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.

19
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,839
EPISODE 2

20
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:11,359
What the hell are you doing?
No! Step back!

21
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,879
I've got her, I've got her.

22
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:39,599
THE BRIDGE

23
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:57,839
Can we deal with it
when we get back? Which address?

24
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:03,039
- There's info on truth.se.
- What is that?

25
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,559
It's an Internet address.
Someone knows more than us.

26
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:16,159
What if you were in a car with a bomb
and had five minutes left to live?

27
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,159
- He didn't have five minutes left.
- But imagine thinking that.

28
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,639
- I'd try to get out.
- It would have gone off.

29
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:32,119
Five minutes don't make
much of a difference. Look.

30
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,919
"Equal Before The Law - a Myth."

31
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,519
In Swedish and Danish.

32
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,919
- "The Women on the Bridge."
- In the plural.

33
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,759
- Have we said that there were two?
- No. "They were just a beginning."

34
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,679
"Message to the police. Listen.”

35
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,479
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

36
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,039
I assume I have your attention now.

37
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,679
He says it's just the beginning.
Will there be more killing?

38
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,719
- Don't you ever have breakfast?
- Sometimes.

39
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:36,279
- Do you plan to eat at all today?
- Maybe later.

40
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,479
- There's a web page.
- Two, truth.dk has the same content.

41
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,279
It's from Daniel Ferbé's car.
Check the content.

42
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:58,559
- Can we eat before we interview him?
- We're not handling it.

43
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,079
- Why not?
- We've got specially trained staff.

44
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:07,679
- Interrogators? Not you?
- No.

45
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:12,679
Aren't you curious?
Which number is he in?

46
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,799
- Number three.
- Come on.

47
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,279
- Hi.
- Why am I here?

48
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,639
- Your car was used in a murder.
- I worked all night.

49
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:45,879
- Ask the editorial staff.

50
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,679
It's not random
that your car was involved.

51
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,559
I know nothing about Kerstin Ekwall
or bodies on the bridge.

52
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:59,439
You might know more than you think.

53
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,719
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

54
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,719
- I have a ticket to Berlin.
- You're not going anywhere.

55
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,839
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

56
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,399
- I nearly died in that car.
- No, you didn't.

57
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:25,159
There was dynamite in the backseat.

58
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,759
Why don't you try to catch
the one that put it there?

59
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,399
I didn't do anything.

60
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,719
I just want to get out of here.
Please.

61
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,679
A lunatic stole my car,
it's not my problem.

62
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,559
But the drugs in your apartment are.

63
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,359
- Personal consumption.
- You're still in possession.

64
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,199
We just want to know why.

65
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:17,759
- It was used in a double homicide.
- I have no bloody idea!

66
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,159
Let's try to find out why.

67
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,399
- Interrogators never lie.
- I'm not an interrogator.

68
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,719
- He might never trust us again.
- He doesn't trust us anyway.

69
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,599
- How do you know?
- I know his type.

70
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,119
- Based on the clippings you read?
- No, I'm clever.

71
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,599
- Am I annoying you?
- No, not yet. Why do you ask?

72
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,879
- I'll get a search warrant.
- Or we can just go have a quick look.

73
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,479
No. The breakfast room is downstairs.
You've got ten minutes.

74
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,799
Excuse me, where's room 3234?
Thank you.

75
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,959
- Is this Christian?
- Yes.

76
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,719
- I'm Charlotte Söringer.
- I'm Ole.

77
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,639
- Are you the psychologist?
- No, but...

78
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:49,679
My husband's very ill.
He'll die without a new heart.

79
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,639
Your son's heart.

80
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:07,959
My son is breathing.
His heart is beating. You can tell.

81
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:14,959
- I understand, but...
- I want him here. Do you understand?

82
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:21,799
But he's not here.
What was your son, is gone.

83
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,679
I don't want you to take his heart.

84
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,799
I can't imagine what this is like,
but I love my husband.

85
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
Without your son's heart he'll die.

86
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:48,039
Then he'll have to die.

87
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,199
- Do you call this lunch?
- Come here, you guys. Come listen.

88
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:10,159
- John.
- The next listener is Jørgen.

89
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:13,639
My name isn't Jørgen,
but that's irrelevant.

90
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,999
Have you heard about
the two bodies on the bridge?

91
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,119
One was Danish,
Monique Brammer.

92
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,519
A drug user and a prostitute.
I killed her 13 months ago.

93
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,599
The investigation lasted two weeks.

94
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,199
Will they drop
the Swedish politician's case?

95
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:40,839
- This isn't the right forum.
- The right forum is truthnow.dk.

96
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,959
It was on the radio
an hour and a half ago.

97
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,919
- Have we traced the call?
- Cash card.

98
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,919
- It's not the same voice.
- Is it a group?

99
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,919
No, he says: "I think", "I killed".

100
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,839
Groups spread fear
by saying that they're many.

101
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,879
- What now?
- I'll reopen Monique's case.

102
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,319
We'll put a tail on Daniel Ferbé
and hope that he's contacted again.

103
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:17,079
- And the web pages?
- We're trying to locate the server.

104
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,719
Both links are
on newspaper websites and blogs.

105
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,159
There's info
only the killer could have.

106
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:31,079
- What does he want?
- There's a message.

107
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:36,239
- We're not equal before the law.
- That's true.

108
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,759
- Many would beg to differ.
- That doesn't make it less true.

109
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:46,319
What are your thoughts?

110
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:52,559
- The women were just the beginning.
- He wants to point out five problems.

111
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:58,679
Unequal before the law.
There are four left. What are they?

112
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,719
The second body
was a Danish prostitute.

113
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,919
She disappeared 13 months ago.

114
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:25,679
- You contacted the donor's father.
- His dead son can save my husband.

115
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,719
- That wasn't a good idea.
- Nothing's happening.

116
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,679
He's brain dead,
can't you just pull the plug?

117
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,759
Your husband isn't our only patient.
What if your son was lying there?

118
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,639
I don't have children.
I don't want to lose Göran.

119
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:55,679
The medical examiner
should finish today.

120
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,439
I'll check on Ferbé's car.
What's your email address?

121
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:04,479
Hi, darling. I'm still in Malmö,
but heading home soon.

122
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,919
This evening, I have to stop by
the station. Ask August to help you.

123
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,039
It's after noon, just wake him up.

124
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,239
I promise to talk to him tonight.

125
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,919
Bye, darling.
Saga sends her regards. Bye.

126
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,959
- My wife. Have you got a boyfriend?
- No. What's your email address?

127
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,759
- August is my oldest.
- Saga!

128
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:39,919
The server's in Copenhagen.
Here's the address.

129
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,239
- That can't be right.
- The IP address leads to the server.

130
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,319
The guy may not be there,
but the server is.

131
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:54,119
That's Copenhagen Police Station.

132
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:12,599
- It's impossible. It can't be.
- That's what I said.

133
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,839
He switched off
the lights on the bridge.

134
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,599
I'll be darned.
They're right, he's using us.

135
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,559
- How can he?
- He might have hacked in.

136
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,959
Even if I knew how,
you wouldn't understand.

137
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:41,919
- Can we trace him?
- We can try.

138
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,599
He disconnected.

139
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,079
- Martin.
- Saga Norén.

140
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:58,279
- Is he closed down?
- He disconnected.

141
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:02,239
- Can you still trace him?
- Can we trace him?

142
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,479
Maybe, but he won't still be
using his computer.

143
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:11,359
- We might find the computer, but...
- I heard her.

144
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,239
He wanted us to find it. Why?

145
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:25,559
He closed it down when we traced it.
That defeats his object.

146
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:28,679
- He wants it out in the open.
- It already is.

147
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:34,639
Everything's on the Internet.
The source isn't necessary anymore.

148
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,879
Saga? A visitor says that he recorded
the message on the Internet.

149
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,279
Turn around, face the wall.

150
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,319
- Why?
- Face the wall, spread your legs.

151
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,159
I was shocked when I heard
the message on the radio.

152
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,079
- I've recorded it.
- How come?

153
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:16,759
I sometimes work for Ljudgrottan.
I do radio commercials and dubbing.

154
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,359
- I'm with Malmö City Theatre.
- You're an actor.

155
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,079
- Maybe you've seen me perform?
- No.

156
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:31,119
- The recording?
- Ljudgrottan called about a job.

157
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,839
The client wanted
a Standard Swedish speaker.

158
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:37,239
Did you meet the client?

159
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:43,279
No, the script came in the mail.
The tape was sent to a P.O. box.

160
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:48,479
We joked about it,
it was like a spy film.

161
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,679
- Wasn't the work a bit odd?
- No.

162
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:58,439
I thought it was for a performance
or an art installation.

163
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:04,639
It sounded ominous. I didn't know
that it would be used for this.

164
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,639
- Have you still got the script?
- No.

165
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,119
Maybe the studio has,
and the P.O. box number.

166
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,559
You could give them a call,
but I would be very surprised.

167
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:21,279
It was recorded
three and a half years ago.

168
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,959
You're not taking my son away.
My son stays here!

169
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,039
My son stays here!

170
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:17,439
I haven't seen you here before.

171
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,039
It's important to look nice.

172
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,399
It's important
to make a good impression.

173
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:44,039
Last year I had two new teeth put in.
A beautiful smile opens up doors.

174
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:52,039
- Charlie walked along the street...
- What did you say?

175
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:56,839
- Charlie walked along the street...
- Charlie?

176
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,399
You have nice legs,
if you don't mind me saying.

177
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:28,319
Nice to meet you. I have to go now.

178
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:40,559
Charlie walked along the street,
he found...

179
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,519
Hi.

180
00:23:55,879 --> 00:24:00,759
- Have you sold her anything?
- No.

181
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,719
- Try a bit harder.
- Maybe, but it's a long time ago.

182
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:12,079
- Who did she work for?
- I don't know. I can't remember.

183
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:19,319
I'm tired, hungry, and my dick hurts.
I have a very short fuse.

184
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:24,839
- I wish I could help you, mate.
- My fuse is getting shorter.

185
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:29,159
Her name is Monique.

186
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,919
She disappeared a year ago,
what's taken you so long?

187
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,919
- Did she say something back then?
- No.

188
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,559
She's dead.

189
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:45,479
- Did she bring customers home?
- No, that would have been stupid.

190
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,719
We found blood in her apartment.

191
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,999
- Did any customers threaten her?
- Not as far as I know.

192
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,799
- Where did she work?
- In Absalonsgade.

193
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:02,519
- Can I talk to someone there?
- Pernille. I'll give her a call.

194
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,359
- How old are you?
- Old enough. Do you want a blowjob?

195
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,559
- Thanks for your help.
- I worry about them. Keep me posted.

196
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:18,519
I'll give you my full attention
when this case is over.

197
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:15,319
- You're going to Berlin, but...
- The police won't let me go.

198
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:21,319
Do you know that he confessed
to the murders on Danish radio?

199
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,879
This is turning into a big case.
We have a unique angle.

200
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,599
- I'm supposed to be off work.
- We can discuss the matter.

201
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,879
Daniel, who's negotiating his salary.
Can I call you back? Who is this?

202
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,879
- Do you understand my Danish?
- Yes.

203
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,199
- Who are you?
- A protector of the truth.

204
00:26:56,239 --> 00:27:00,359
- Why are you calling me?
- We need each other, Daniel.

205
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,159
I don't need someone
that places bombs in my car.

206
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,719
I need a voice,
they're trying to silence me.

207
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:12,999
- Why do I need you?
- You're negotiating your salary.

208
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,679
- I'm not for sale.
- Really?

209
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,199
I'm giving you facts,
use them as you please.

210
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,719
What facts? Hello?

211
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:34,559
(UN)EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW

212
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,639
- What's this?
- Crime statistics.

213
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,759
"Investigations depend on
where the crime is committed."

214
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,479
Statistics don't reflect everyone

215
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:56,159
Social groups...clear-up rate...

216
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,239
- ...resources... What do we do now?
- What do you want to do?

217
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:30,839
Excuse me. Veronika Holmgren
has been given a secret address.

218
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,159
- Can you register it?
- OK.

219
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,239
She was here a lot,
she needed the money.

220
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,719
- She was an amphetamine user.
- I know.

221
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:42,159
- Was that the reason?
- What?

222
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,799
- Was she killed because of debts?
- No, that wasn't why.

223
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,039
She wanted to quit.
She met a man that she cared about.

224
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:59,039
- Who was he?
- Jørgen something. He wasn't here.

225
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:01,879
- Was this her room?
- No, it's next door.

226
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,159
- It's empty, I've taken her things.
- What things?

227
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,959
Her diary.

228
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,599
- Why haven't the police got this?
- They were never here.

229
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:49,479
Thank you.
I'll make sure it's returned to you.

230
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,479
No fingerprints
apart from the owner's.

231
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:22,919
He must have had
someone in the car before.

232
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:27,479
- There were very few fibres.
- It's been cleaned.

233
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:31,039
Thoroughly.
With a steam cleaner, I think.

234
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:35,719
Have you really checked everything?

235
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,199
Have you?

236
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,879
- We need each other, Daniel.
- I don't need you.

237
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,399
- What's this?
- The killer called a reporter.

238
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,239
- Why do I need you?
- You're negotiating your salary.

239
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
I'm not for sale.

240
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,959
- Hi there!
- Why didn't you call?

241
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,319
- It didn't occur to me.
- He's a criminal.

242
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:24,879
If he contacts you again,
call us straight away.

243
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:32,959
- What's that?
- The relevant act and penalties.

244
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,679
- I said I'll call.
- I don't believe you.

245
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,679
Where's your boss? Here's her copy.

246
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,719
- Saga Norén.
- Hi. We've found Ekwall's car.

247
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:50,319
It's on a surveillance tape.
It was in the town hall car park.

248
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:55,599
He avoids the cameras.

249
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,239
- Is that the only camera?
- The other one's of no use.

250
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:11,319
The window's covered up.

251
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,879
- And when he entered?
- The same side faced the camera.

252
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,719
- Do you recognize this woman?
- No.

253
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,719
I'll pay whomever helps me find her.

254
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,919
- Yes?
- That guy knows her.

255
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,399
Charlotte?

256
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,839
It went well.
In spite of some complications.

257
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,599
He's in the recovery ward.
You can go see him.

258
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,159
Thank you, Anders.

259
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:58,239
Kerstin Ekwall was strangled,
like you said.

260
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:02,359
Cause of death can't be determined
for the other woman.

261
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,079
We can only rule out poisoning.

262
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,479
There were traces of amphetamine.
She was chopped in half after death.

263
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,719
It took a lot of force,
it wasn't done by hand.

264
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:18,399
The cut is perfect.

265
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:25,799
- A sawmill, then?
- The blade wasn't made for timber.

266
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,199
You can tell that it's fine-toothed.

267
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:35,839
I think they used the right tool
for the job. A meat saw.

268
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,959
- A slaughterhouse?
- Possibly. Definitely a meat saw.

269
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:12,799
Hi! Careful, careful.

270
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:16,319
Let's go in and eat. Take a bag each.

271
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:23,199
Nice! Bloody hell.

272
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,839
- No, without that thing on. Hi.
- Hi. Can you fetch August?

273
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:33,399
- Where is he?
- He's gardening...

274
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:50,959
Food's ready. I've bought Thai food.

275
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,919
You have to eat well
when you're this active...

276
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:04,119
August! Come on, food's on the table.
We're waiting for you.

277
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:08,519
It's... It's important
to have a family meal.

278
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,959
I've eaten without a family
for 15 years.

279
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:21,359
- What kind of bullshit is that?
- I'll be there in a little while.

280
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,799
Turn it off.

281
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,079
Stop it, come on.

282
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:48,999
We're not equal before the law,
that's a lie.

283
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,599
- So he's right?
- Of course not.

284
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:59,039
- It's growing bigger.
- The planning took over three years.

285
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,199
Ekwall's computers, phone and car
gave us no clues.

286
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:10,399
We haven't traced the power cut
or websites. The voice was distorted.

287
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:16,079
Martin Rohde found
Monique Brammer's diary.

288
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,639
She met someone called Jørgen,
the name used on the radio.

289
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,239
- How are things with Martin?
- Fine.

290
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,759
- Does Karin call you for no reason?
- Sometimes. Why?

291
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,439
Martin's wife called.

292
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,079
What a waste of time
to call just to hear someone's voice.

293
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,639
- Do you want a lift?
- No.

294
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:40,799
EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW

295
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,879
Hi.

296
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,919
- Are you waiting for someone?
- No.

297
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:50,999
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No.

298
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:57,159
Right. OK.

299
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:11,279
Listen, why did you walk away?

300
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:17,839
- I just didn't want a drink.
- OK.

301
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:21,359
Do you want to have sex
at my place?

302
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:33,999
- Yes, definitely.
- Good. Let's go.

303
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:38,119
- What are you reading?
- A diary.

304
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,519
Are you upset?

305
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,559
It's been a long day.

306
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,879
There's something about this case.
The women on the bridge...

307
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,759
- The guy that called...
- What?

308
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:05,519
I just have this feeling.

309
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:13,239
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow is another day.

310
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,039
Hi, darling.

311
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:00,999
We did it!

312
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,599
Did the father change his mind?

313
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:12,919
The son was a registered donor.
The father didn't matter.

314
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,879
- It didn't matter.
- No.

315
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,519
Charlotte.

316
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:32,799
I thought I was about to die,
and it made me think.

317
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:36,839
"If I make it"...

318
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:42,559
"I'm going to treasure life more."

319
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,639
- We'll take care of each other.
- No.

320
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,719
I neither can nor want to anymore.

321
00:46:57,479 --> 00:47:00,639
Things haven't worked since...

322
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:05,519
It's been bad for so long.

323
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,039
Life's too short not to be happy.

324
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:18,039
- I am happy.
- But I'm not.

325
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,119
- I haven't been for a long time.
- Do you want a divorce?

326
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:33,119
- I love you.
- I know. I know.

327
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:38,599
Do you have any idea
what I've done for your sake?

328
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:45,479
<i>Göran? Göran?</i>

329
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:48,759
What's happening?
What's happening?

330
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:26,479
Do you need help?

331
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:50,159
Sonja!

332
00:48:55,279 --> 00:49:00,439
Listen to me. It's me.

333
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,639
Stefan.

334
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:12,079
Charlie walked along the street,
he found...

335
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,079
...a parcel. He thought
it was tobacco, it was dynamite.

336
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,479
He filled his pipe and lit it.
Then Charlie blew up with it.

337
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,399
We'd chant it that summer.
Didn't we, sis? Do you remember?

338
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,239
It didn't rain a single day
that summer. It's me.

339
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:37,719
I could kill him over and over again
for your sake.

340
00:49:37,879 --> 00:49:42,759
He'll return. He lives within me.

341
00:49:46,759 --> 00:49:51,759
Sonja? Sonja? Sonja!

342
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:38,399
Did you get a chance to talk?

343
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:47,759
We talked about the future.
About our time together.

344
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:53,359
We were grateful to have each other.

345
00:50:58,479 --> 00:51:04,719
- He really loved me.
- Yes. I know he did.

346
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:07,599
- What's that?
- Work.

347
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:16,999
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm with Malmö County Police.

348
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:27,999
- Do you want me to leave?
- Do you want to stay?

349
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:36,479
- Do you want me to stay?
- Yes. You can sleep.

350
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,919
What the hell is that?

351
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:51,799
- It's a corpse.
- Oh, OK. I think I'll...

352
00:53:03,439 --> 00:53:07,559
- Well... Bye, then.
- Bye.

353
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,519
Thanks!

354
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:27,759
AEB...STAEB...

355
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,239
...STA...

356
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:46,879
- Yes? Hello?
- Is "staeb" something in Danish?

357
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:51,279
They thought it was part of a tattoo
on Monique Brammer.

358
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:55,399
It might be printed or stamped on.

359
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,719
The body might have been
pressed up against something.

360
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:05,159
Doesn't it mean something to you?
It's not the whole word.

361
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:11,039
Think in the lines of
an autopsy room...

362
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,759
- ...meat...
- Kødbyen.

363
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:21,319
It's a slaughterhouse area.
There's a huge one in Staebogade.

364
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:24,679
- I'll go there now.
- See you there.

365
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:41,279
- Can you unlock?
- Yes.

366
00:54:47,479 --> 00:54:52,519
- Can the lights be turned on?
- Martin! A dog is alerting.

367
00:54:58,919 --> 00:55:01,279
Clear!

368
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,319
I need a list over those
that have access at night.

369
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:10,639
- Are there any surveillance cameras?
- No.

370
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:15,159
I need a list over those
that can switch the alarm system off.

371
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:19,439
And the alarm log
from the last couple of days.

372
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:56,679
VISIBLE, YET INVISIBLE

373
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:06,439
- What did you find?
- The other half, a lower body.

374
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:09,639
- Ekwall.
- This was attached to it.

375
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:15,959
"...there would have been
no victims."

376
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:21,239
He knew that we would find
the stamp and this place.

377
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:27,879
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
- It's Daniel. I've been contacted.

378
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:33,679
The subject is:
"Visible, yet invisible."

379
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,639
The email reads:
"If you had cared..."

380
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:43,679
"If you had cared, there would
have been no victims." Go on.

381
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:48,479
There's a number of attachments,
just like last time.

382
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,759
- What's in the attachments?
- More statistics.

383
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:57,119
Something's increased
in Copenhagen and Malmö.

384
00:56:57,279 --> 00:57:02,839
- What's increased?
- "...little funding for..."

385
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:14,799
Homelessness.
It's about the homeless.

386
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:21,719
- He contacted Daniel Ferbé again.
- Six people have been found.

387
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:25,959
They seem to be poisoned
and have been brought to hospital.

388
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:30,559
- He's going to kill homeless people.
- He's started already.
