00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,199
SUMMARY

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,439
- T.T.?
- They call him The Truth Terrorist.

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,919
Agree to his demand.
He doesn't like to improvise.

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,559
If we force him to,
he might make mistakes.

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,999
The property investors
haven't agreed to the demands.

6
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:37,639
He's saying: A...1...
And then three letters.

7
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,479
- A, J, B.
- Bjørn can see a power meter.

8
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:46,879
There are three meters
in the same empty building.

9
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:58,719
Bjørn! Bjørn! Can you hear me?

10
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,599
He shot two from the task force.

11
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,919
- How are they doing?
- One dead, one critically injured.

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,839
Sören! Stop it!

13
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,639
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I can.

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,519
- Don't walk away!
- Let go.

15
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:34,279
Or what?
Or I'll have an awkward fall?

16
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,039
He was unconscious.

17
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,839
I watched. Then I walked away.

18
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:50,239
- Aren't you going to open it?
- I'm not allowed. Not yet.

19
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,959
A samurai fasts
the day before he goes into battle.

20
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,679
EPISODE 5

21
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:24,479
Lars Jönsson? Hi, I'm Emil.

22
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:30,279
- You haven't been here before.
- No.

23
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,839
- Did you struggle to find the way?
- No.

24
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,639
Emil? No!

25
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,879
THE BRIDGE

26
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:30,359
Thank you. The best way
to honour our colleague Mats...

27
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,679
is to catch the bastard.

28
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,839
- How are you doing?
- Fine, I'm on painkillers.

29
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,559
Did they find anything
where Bjørn was?

30
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:54,639
A shoeprint, size 9.
I haven't identified the make yet.

31
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:58,199
Let's bring in
all men that take size 9.

32
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,519
- That was a joke.
- Yes, I got that.

33
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,159
- Hi, Lillian.
- Henning.

34
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,839
- When are you due in court?
- At one o'clock.

35
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:32,799
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

36
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,519
You want to tell them who did what.
You didn't do anything.

37
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,719
If I tell them...
If that's true, what will happen?

38
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,359
There will be a new trial.

39
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,639
Some colleagues will freeze you out,
most will back you up.

40
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:59,879
- Can I be charged with perjury?
- That might happen.

41
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,679
- If I'm sentenced, I'll lose my job.
- I would do my best to avoid that.

42
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,599
- That's not good enough.
- Henning... The boy died.

43
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:43,279
Four officers
will be sentenced today.

44
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,519
They're charged with
bodily harm leading to death.

45
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:53,159
24-year-old Hadi Hurani died
during an arrest.

46
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,679
Saif? Let's go.

47
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:03,119
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to go.

48
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,239
- Do it for your brother's sake.
- We both know what'll happen.

49
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,519
- They'll do the right thing.
- Do you really believe that?

50
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:21,439
- I have no choice but to believe it.
- Right.

51
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,559
Come on.

52
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:30,639
- Saif...
- You know they'll make fools of us.

53
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:45,319
A postman and a psychologist
were killed this morning.

54
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,039
The postman's killer
committed suicide.

55
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,039
- Don't you want to take it on?
- Definitely, it's big.

56
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,239
- All the more reason to do well.
- Of course. Let me just...

57
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:06,799
He's so cute when he gets excited.
It's like throwing a ball to a puppy.

58
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,679
- Daniel Ferbé.
- A miserable front page.

59
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,399
I'm trying to make people
aware of problems.

60
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:19,759
- That stuff steals attention.
- Then stop shooting police officers.

61
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,399
- They came too close.
- Are you getting sloppy?

62
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:27,719
- Do you really want to annoy me?
- No, I'm sorry.

63
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,039
- Let's focus on the third problem.
- Which is...? Hello?

64
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,679
"A pat on the shoulder and pills
is the help mentally ill receive."

65
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:52,879
Åke? Run everything by Daniel,
he decides what we'll use.

66
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,359
- This was my case.
- It isn't anymore, things happened.

67
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:11,759
You've heard about the murders,
three of them followed by suicide.

68
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,719
A postman in Malmö
was killed with a machete.

69
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,079
A psychiatrist
was assaulted with a sword.

70
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:27,079
In Copenhagen an axe was used
on a bus and a knife in a stairwell.

71
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:32,519
According to Daniel Ferbé
T.T. has claimed responsibility.

72
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:39,719
It's his way of criticizing
the cuts to psychiatric programs.

73
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,319
- That's the third problem.
- How did he do it?

74
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:49,639
Both perpetrators in Malmö
suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.

75
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,999
He must have spent months
coaxing them into this.

76
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,599
So four murders,
but only three suicides?

77
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,679
The psychiatrist's colleagues
overpowered the perpetrator.

78
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,519
- Is he here?
- The first interview gave us nothing.

79
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,279
This is the second interview
with Lars Jönsson.

80
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:16,479
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police,
and Martin Rohde are present.

81
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,679
You killed Emil Fernskog.

82
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,999
Someone told you to do it. Who?

83
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,079
Did you meet him?

84
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:42,959
What did he look like?
Can you describe him? Lars?

85
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:04,439
Look at us, Lars.
Lars! Try to look at us.

86
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:13,479
- Hi. Do you want something?
- What?

87
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,119
I don't know. Are you thirsty?

88
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,959
- Hungry? Are you a smoker?
- Some green tea.

89
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:25,279
Green tea? OK.

90
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:30,159
You can have some green tea
if you give me something.

91
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,399
- What?
- Just answer a few questions.

92
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,519
- Not about him.
- About whom?

93
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,439
- Who?
- No One.

94
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,959
Are you scared of him, Lars?

95
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,719
He won't come here. He can't get in.

96
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,039
Do you know, you ought to be
more scared of me than him.

97
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,199
Do you get it? You can't decide
whether you're going to talk or not.

98
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:25,319
You killed for him.

99
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:29,439
You make me furious
when you don't talk.

100
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:33,759
Do you get me?

101
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,799
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Stop defending him!

102
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,879
- Martin!
- Yes. Stop protecting him.

103
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:49,799
The interview is stopped at 09:57.

104
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,039
- Don't say anything.
- What?

105
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,359
- About this.
- How you handled the interview?

106
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,799
When I tell you not to say anything,
I really mean it.

107
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,519
- Do you get it, Saga?
- But it's inappropriate...

108
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:38,159
- What are you doing?
- We're always one step behind.

109
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:43,679
It's not a race
where we're chasing someone.

110
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
We're in different places.

111
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:52,799
When we get enough information,
we'll be in the same place.

112
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,799
If you're chasing someone,
he decides which road you go down.

113
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,359
Martin?
Stefan Lindberg was here yesterday.

114
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,759
Was he here yesterday?
And we weren't told until now?

115
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:12,239
You've got our mobile numbers.
What if he had important information?

116
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,319
He didn't. I asked him to stop by.

117
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,479
- She doesn't know that.
- Have a nice day.

118
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,879
Yes.

119
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,999
He was going to get help a couple
of days a week. I don't know.

120
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,759
I can go see him this afternoon.
Absolutely.

121
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,399
That doesn't matter.
Hang on a second.

122
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,679
Sorry.

123
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,799
OK, I'll get in touch
when I've been there. Bye.

124
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,959
Was that Veronika?

125
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,399
- No, a colleague.
- Really.

126
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,719
I want
Veronika and my children back.

127
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,239
Certainly.
Let's go down to the office.

128
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,719
- We can find out where they are.
- No, you're going to tell me now.

129
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,679
Where are they?

130
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,559
Stefan?

131
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:13,439
This is Martin Rohde.
I saw you, so please open the door.

132
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,479
- Yes?
- What are you doing?

133
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:25,599
I was about to go to bed,
I worked the night shift.

134
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,039
Can I come in?

135
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,919
Sure. Come on in.

136
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:57,319
What... What do you want?

137
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:03,039
- We bump into each other too often.
- Really.

138
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:06,359
I guess we frequent the same places.

139
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:10,319
- Are you nervous?
- No.

140
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,399
We wouldn't have met if Ekwall
or some other VIP hadn't been killed.

141
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,079
- Do you dislike VIPs?
- That's not what I meant.

142
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,719
So what did you mean?

143
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:30,959
In my job you can't help but notice
how unfair society is.

144
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,599
But violence isn't the answer.

145
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,799
- What is the answer?
- I don't know.

146
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:50,599
- Are you all right?
- Yes, why do you ask?

147
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:58,799
Do you know any of these?

148
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:05,879
- Are they homeless or drug users?
- No.

149
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,439
Why do you think I know them?

150
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,079
- Maybe you've met them.
- No.

151
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:20,639
- I'd like to see his medical records.
- It was his first visit.

152
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,479
- But he had an appointment?
- Yes, he called eight weeks ago.

153
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:32,599
- How many psychiatrists are there?
- Five, but not at the same time.

154
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,719
So he just happened to get Fernskog.

155
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:41,319
No, he asked to see Emil,
and it had to be today.

156
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,839
I remember.

157
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,319
Emil had two cancellations.
Both times I called Lars Jönsson.

158
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:55,199
He could have had an earlier
appointment, but insisted on today.

159
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,879
- It's Martin.
- Are you in the office?

160
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,279
I'm with Stefan.

161
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:10,639
- Can you go there?
- I'll be there in fifteen minutes.

162
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,519
See you. Bye.
We have to talk some other time.

163
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,119
- Don't leave town.
- Sure. No, no.

164
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,519
- My sister's ill, I'll stay here.
- OK, see you.

165
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,799
- What did Stefan Lindberg say?
- Nothing, but something's wrong.

166
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,359
We'll have him followed.
Take a look at this.

167
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,959
The two schizophrenics
in Copenhagen lived here and here.

168
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,959
They committed murder
here and here.

169
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,399
The postman in Malmö
was killed here.

170
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,479
It's the killer's stairwell.
But Lars lived here.

171
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,519
He walked to the bus stop
and got on the bus.

172
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,319
He got off, walked through the park-

173
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:17,839
- came to the surgery,
and stayed in the waiting room.

174
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,479
He killed Emil Fernskog
in the consulting room.

175
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,839
He booked the appointment
eight weeks ago.

176
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,399
It was planned.

177
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,439
Bjørn recognized his kidnapper.

178
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,239
Maybe Brammer and Ekwall
weren't just symbols?

179
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:40,799
- Did he pick them for a reason?
- Possibly.

180
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,999
Gry's looking for
links between the victims.

181
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,799
- And Lars' apartment?
- Forensics are checking it.

182
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,239
The police officers were acquitted.
There were protests.

183
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:12,959
In a trial last year-

184
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,199
- four immigrants were found guilty
without proof of who did what.

185
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,039
Jesper Anderson,
you're a regional coordinator.

186
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:25,839
You work against recruitment
into organized crime.

187
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:30,799
- What effect will the verdict have?
- It's very unfortunate.

188
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:33,399
It's giving out the wrong signals.

189
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,439
- How?
- It affects our youth work.

190
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,439
We have to establish
some sort of trust.

191
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,359
This verdict
takes us back to square one.

192
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,839
It's been compared to
the one against the four immigrants.

193
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,639
I can understand that.

194
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,199
We're not all equal before the law.
That's a problem.

195
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:07,479
Not just for the police,
but for the general public.

196
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:12,679
- They should take this seriously.
- Thank you.

197
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:21,479
- I'm glad I wasn't there.
- We'll appeal. It's all we can do.

198
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:25,759
It's all you can do.
We have to take action.

199
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:31,639
- What are you up to?
- I'm going out with my friends.

200
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,399
No, stay away from them!

201
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:39,039
Stay here.

202
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:43,959
- We're trying to find the sender.
- That won't get us anywhere.

203
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,799
- What else?
- Navid?

204
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:56,599
- He's been taking his clozapine.
- Have it analysed.

205
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:02,519
- This was in the apartment.
- It's a good likeness.

206
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,599
He didn't make it himself.

207
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,839
The pens, and the flat, are covered
in someone else's fingerprints.

208
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:17,959
- It's a small hand, a youngster's.
- Someone with the initials A.B.

209
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,839
- It's Martin.
- This is Charlotte Söringer.

210
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:31,039
I found something for you
amongst Göran's things.

211
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:34,999
Records. It's easier to explain
if you take a look.

212
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,239
- I'll be right over.
- Good.

213
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,439
Charlotte Söringer
found something interesting.

214
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,079
- Records. I'll go there now.
- Good.

215
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:56,079
He called them his black files.
They're complaints.

216
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:03,559
Legal documents. Tenants'
associations, the authorities...

217
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:08,399
People who have sued,
appealed, all sorts of things.

218
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,919
There's a folder of hate mail.

219
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,319
Thank you.

220
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,519
- Is it of use to you?
- I'll have someone check it.

221
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,239
- Do you have to hurry back?
- Yes.

222
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,199
He's on the move. We'll follow him.

223
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,119
This is Martin.
I'm with Charlotte Söringer.

224
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,639
- Still? Why?
- I'll be there in twenty minutes.

225
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,559
- Did she have something for you?
- Records.

226
00:27:55,719 --> 00:28:01,679
Does it take that long
to fetch some records?

227
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,719
What's it like to cheat on your wife?

228
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:15,359
I wonder how Göran felt.

229
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,999
- This isn't your first time, is it?
- It was a long time ago.

230
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,719
Take care, Martin.

231
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:55,279
- Have I missed anything?
- The cameras don't show the gate.

232
00:28:55,439 --> 00:29:00,639
We can't see Lars at all,
he doesn't seem to leave the house.

233
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:07,079
Our guy could be anyone on there,
but he's avoided the cameras before.

234
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:12,599
Stop. Stop. Rewind.

235
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,559
There! She sees the police officer
and turns around.

236
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,959
Is that Lars Jönsson's lodger?

237
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,159
- He's not talking.
- I got the lab results.

238
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,959
All four were given placebo drugs.

239
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,759
They haven't taken drugs
for schizophrenia for months.

240
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,199
These are Goran Söringer's records.

241
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,359
See if you can find any names
connected to the investigation.

242
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,599
Show me again.

243
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,519
Can you see the sign?
"Ellborns Päls".

244
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,479
The shop window's been smashed
three times. Red paint everywhere.

245
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:17,759
- What does the police do?
- Property crime is not a priority.

246
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,559
- Not the way I see it.
- No, but we do.

247
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:28,559
- Is that all?
- Only the last 48 hours are kept.

248
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:33,079
A colleague will stop by
with a formal complaint.

249
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:36,479
- The camera's illegal.
- You have to be joking.

250
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,759
- Was she joking?
- No. I'll see what I can do.

251
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,639
Are there any rules you don't follow?

252
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:54,759
- Why do you ask?
- I just wonder. Are there?

253
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,519
Rules are rules,
unless they're only recommendations.

254
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,999
Are you thinking about the camera?
It's illegal.

255
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:09,199
- He helped us.
- We don't know that.

256
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,039
What else should we ignore
if people are helpful?

257
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:20,119
That's not what I mean. You don't
have to say you'll report them.

258
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,799
- Why not?
- It's an unwritten law.

259
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,479
I don't know any of those.

260
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:35,999
Hi, it's me. I'm on my way home.

261
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,039
Can we have dinner together?
All of us, for once.

262
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:46,679
That would be nice.
I'll head home now.

263
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:51,119
Saga sends her regards. Bye.

264
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,119
- Why did you say that?
- What?

265
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,359
I didn't send my regards.
Should I have?

266
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,879
Is that an unwritten law?

267
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,719
Call me if John finds anything
on the tapes.

268
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,239
"A killer could be living
in your neighbourhood."

269
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:31,119
Addresses for psychiatric patients.
What's wrong with you? Is this legal?

270
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,199
- I had to write "could".
- He wants to spread fear.

271
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,919
He wants to tell the truth
and point to problems.

272
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,159
To call all psychiatric patients
potential killers is not the truth.

273
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,079
It was true
in four cases this morning.

274
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,399
I spoke to
one of the killers' parents.

275
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:09,599
They've tried to have him admitted
for weeks, he's been very ill.

276
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,359
- That's what we should write about.
- You don't get to decide.

277
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,519
Nor do you, T.T. is in charge.
You're just a useful fool.

278
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,479
It's better than being just a fool.
Don't you think?

279
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:34,479
If you update it,
remove my name from that crap.

280
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,559
I got this from
the guy in the fur shop's camera.

281
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,359
Lars Jönsson isn't here either.

282
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,519
But the girl that lived with him
is in these three. Here.

283
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,879
- That's all that's of interest.
- It's of no use without her identity.

284
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:05,319
It's Anja Björk, she's missing.
Should we issue her description?

285
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:12,039
Yes, but don't tie her to this case,
that could put her in danger.

286
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:23,039
This could be done
by the time we get home.

287
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,439
Is it so difficult
to place demands on him?

288
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:34,359
- Maybe he struggles to adjust.
- Should the rest of us adjust to him?

289
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:41,359
- You can hardly tell he's here.
- Yes, even the twins help out more.

290
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,119
What would happen
if you placed some demands on him?

291
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:53,039
I don't know.
Can't we just give him some time?

292
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,519
OK. In the meantime
Hotel Rohde stays open.

293
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,599
This is new for me as well.
Give him a chance.

294
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,039
Is dinner ready?

295
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,559
August! The doorbell rang.

296
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:28,159
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Is Martin Rohde at home?

297
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:32,959
- Yes, yes.
- Are you here?

298
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,119
The girl is 14-year-old Anja Björk.
She ran away from home.

299
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:41,599
- Would you like some food?
- We haven't got time.

300
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:44,999
Yes, we do.
It's quicker than going to 7-Eleven.

301
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:51,159
We've got bubble and squeak.
It's a kind of hash. Come on.

302
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:58,719
This is Carl, Johanne, and Nikolaj.

303
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:06,479
The young man staring at you
is August. You've met Mette.

304
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,559
- Can you say hi to Saga?
- Hi.

305
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,159
You lost this at Charlotte Söringer's
place. She handed it in.

306
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,159
Well, take a seat.

307
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:33,519
- Would you like the recipe?
- No, it wasn't tasty.

308
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,319
- You don't have to finish it.
- I don't want to either.

309
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:40,399
You have to.

310
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,799
- Why are you looking at me?
- What? I'm not.

311
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:50,559
- August is a big fan of T.T.
- Not his actions, not the killings.

312
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,959
But he points out important issues.

313
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,759
- And he's a genius.
- Yes, he's well-organized.

314
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:02,679
- He's not a genius.
- That depends on your definition.

315
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:06,479
I've never come across
anyone like him.

316
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,159
He's Michelangelo,
the others do fingerpainting.

317
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:14,839
- That's a good comparison.
- Are you in the fan club as well?

318
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,239
I understand his reasoning.

319
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:23,199
We'll be right there.
Anja Björk's mother is on her way.

320
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,279
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry you didn't like it.

321
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:32,359
Yes. Thanks.

322
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,879
See you later.

323
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:46,479
I'm afraid I can't help you.

324
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,559
- She'll be back, right?
- She'll be home soon. I promise.

325
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:59,239
You can't. We'll do our best,
but can't promise that she'll return.

326
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:07,359
- I guess I'll hear from you.
- Yes.

327
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:23,639
Are you aware of the things you say?
Are you?

328
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,479
We can't promise that she'll return.
She might be dead.

329
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:32,519
She was caught on camera
eight hours ago.

330
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:39,079
Everyone is alive eight hours before
they die. 30 percent never return.

331
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:50,519
I'm fully aware of that.
And so is she, I think.

332
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:57,639
Sometimes people need to hear
something, even if it's not true.

333
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,079
Martin? Wait.

334
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:08,359
- So people want to be lied to?
- Yes, Saga. Sometimes.

335
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,759
What if she dies?
What will we say then?

336
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:17,359
- You're annoying me how.
- Really?

337
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,559
- You know, Anja...
- What about her?

338
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,679
- She's not the only witness.
- But he's not talking.

339
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,479
Maybe we asked
the wrong questions?

340
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:40,679
I want to talk about Anja.
She stayed with you.

341
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,999
Did you like her?
She made this drawing of you.

342
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,999
The guy that told you to kill,
has done this.

343
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:03,879
And this. And this.

344
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:15,359
And this. He'll do it to Anja if we
don't find her. Do you want that?

345
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,359
What? Do you want that?

346
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,319
If we catch him, he can't hurt Anja.

347
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:30,279
But we don't know what he looks like.
Can you tell us?

348
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,639
What does he look like?

349
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:44,799
He's tall and has blue eyes.
Chequered coat, hat, and gloves.

350
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:50,759
- What did you say?
- Tall, chequered coat, scarf, gloves.

351
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,679
- You have to speak up.
- Tall, blue eyes, scarf, and gloves!

352
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,599
I said he's tall and has brown hair!

353
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,759
He's tall and has a scarf and gloves!

354
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:11,439
He's tall and has blue eyes,
chequered coat, scarf, and gloves.

355
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:20,519
- It's him, she saw him.
- He's not on the other tapes.

356
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:26,279
- He avoids the cameras.
- He didn't know about this one.

357
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:30,959
- We have to find her.
- All officers are looking for her.

358
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,119
- Did Anja's father know anything?
- No, nothing.

359
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:41,279
- We have to find her.
- You can't search both cities.

360
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:46,959
You can't, and you're not going to.
Do you understand?

361
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:34,239
- Are you Daniel? Daniel Ferbé?
- Yes.

362
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:43,759
- What the hell is this?
- They threw it through my window.

363
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:50,199
I'm Markus Bolin.
You printed my address today.

364
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:59,319
So? There's no need to be scared,
I won't hit you.

365
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:05,399
I just wanted to show you
what might happen.

366
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:09,759
It's sad, but I'm just a writer.

367
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,119
I can't take responsibility for
people's reactions.

368
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:19,279
How nice.

369
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:22,799
You don't give a damn
about the consequences.

370
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:30,359
Good luck with your life. Good luck.

371
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,439
- One more!
- Have you got something stronger?

372
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,439
- Hi.
- Hi.

373
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:08,959
- Don't you recognize me?
- Yes, we had sex.

374
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:16,319
- Anton Cederlund.
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

375
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,519
- Would you like something?
- I need to eat first.

376
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,959
If we're going to have sex.
I didn't have dinner.

377
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:13,559
So you got to meet Saga Norén
from Malmö's criminal police.

378
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,479
- She's different.
- Yes.

379
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:22,719
She drives me mad sometimes,
but there's something about her.

380
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:27,639
We work well together.

381
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:30,999
Good thing
she stopped by with your wallet.

382
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,839
- Didn't you know that you'd lost it?
- No, clearly not.

383
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,599
Who's Charlotte?

384
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:48,759
One of the property investors.
She put up twenty million kroner.

385
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:59,959
You're so hot.

386
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:33,719
Do you know who was here tonight?
Saga fucking Norén.

387
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,159
From TV? How was she?

388
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:43,639
- Cool. Very pretty.
- So you're into MILFs now? :)

389
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:54,559
- LOL! I won't say what she told me.
- PLS. I promise I'll be good.

390
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:38,959
We've spotted Anja Björk where
Adelgatan crosses Östergatan.

391
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,239
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

392
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:07,799
Yes. I'll be right there.

393
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:10,679
- I have to go.
- What?

394
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:33,879
Henning?

395
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:46,359
- Are you drunk?
- Yes, somewhat.

396
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:50,919
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

397
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:59,119
I heard about the verdict.
Did you speak to Lillian?

398
00:50:59,279 --> 00:51:03,639
- Yes, I spoke to Lillian.
- What did she say?

399
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:09,959
She had nothing to say,
nothing that matters.

400
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:33,599
That's enough, Saif. It's late.

401
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,159
You're disappointed.

402
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:40,559
- We did the right thing.
- I didn't do anything.

403
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:43,439
We can appeal and have a new trial.

404
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,519
- We can talk to the media.
- It won't make a difference.

405
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,159
It has to. We live in Denmark,
it has to be better here.

406
00:51:53,439 --> 00:51:56,879
You lost a son, I lost a brother.
They were let off.

407
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,199
Hate and vengeance
will lead to nothing.

408
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:10,719
I want you to put this behind you.
You're everything to me.

409
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:16,519
Your brother wouldn't listen.
We lost him.

410
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:20,439
I'm not my brother,
you won't lose me.

411
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,039
Sometimes it feels
as if I've lost you.

412
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:29,119
- Saif...
- I have to go.

413
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:02,519
Anja?

414
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:05,359
Hi.

415
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:21,199
Do you remember him?
Was he the one that shot you?

416
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:35,599
Draw him and I'll catch him.

417
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,639
Am I going to die?

418
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:50,519
No.

419
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:14,239
Carry on.

420
00:54:19,479 --> 00:54:21,759
Carry on.

421
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,679
Anja? Anja?

422
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,479
There are no traces
in the parking garage.

423
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,239
- How is Anja doing?
- She died twenty minutes ago.

424
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:24,119
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

425
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,559
- Are you sure?
- She drew this.

426
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,839
Can you see who it is?

427
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:48,679
It's Stefan Lindberg. Can you see?

428
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,879
He's got that look in his eyes.
