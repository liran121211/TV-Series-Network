00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:04,159
SUMMARY

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,599
In my job you can't help but notice
how unfair society is.

3
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:19,159
I heard from him again.
It's immigrants this time.

4
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,119
- What are you doing here?
- He slept over.

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:27,839
Saga's my colleague, you're my son.

6
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:31,719
- He's published something.
- Why Henning, not the others?

7
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:35,839
- Has he got Henning?
- He disappeared in the night.

8
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:42,039
- There was a letter by the door.
- I won't get my brother back!

9
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:51,039
- Why were you with that Charlotte?
- To interview her.

10
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,599
Have you slept with her?

11
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,359
Get up and pack your bags.
Leave, I don't want to look at you.

12
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,279
I died in the night.
I didn't see a tunnel or a light.

13
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,999
- We need a search warrant.
- How did the blood get there?

14
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,199
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
I'm going to find you.

15
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,079
- It's me. Stefan.
- Charlie walked along the street...

16
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,759
- Who poisoned you, Sonja?
- I saw him.

17
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:38,439
- The police car was stolen.
- Maybe it wasn't stolen.

18
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,839
What if he's one of us?
What if he's a police officer?

19
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,759
EPISODE 7

20
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,759
What the hell...

21
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:52,599
THE BRIDGE

22
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,559
Hi, this is Mette.
Please leave a message.

23
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,279
Hi, it's me. I understand
that you're hurt and angry.

24
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,799
You know we'll have to talk.

25
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,599
Can you please call me?
I'll try to get home tonight.

26
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,999
Have a nice day... today. Bye.

27
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,199
If he's a police officer,
it explains a lot.

28
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,879
He hasn't left a single trace.

29
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:44,439
- Hardened criminals avoid that.
- They're only in it for the money.

30
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,239
- Why does he do it?
- It's personal.

31
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,079
He selected people he wanted to die.
This time it was Henning.

32
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:59,639
- But why a police officer?
- He knew we were looking for Anja.

33
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,999
Only the police knew
that she was in the parking garage.

34
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,839
He took a police car
and no one noticed.

35
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,079
He's got riot gear. The stun gun
was stolen from a police office.

36
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:18,039
The shots
were fired by a professional.

37
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,559
He's very organized.

38
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:24,479
He can handle
weapons and explosives.

39
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
- He's in the military.
- A police task force.

40
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:35,759
We have to be very careful if we
pursue that line of investigation.

41
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,119
We're looking for Danish officers,
so we'll run the investigation.

42
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,399
- Why Danish officers?
- Danish police car and riot gear.

43
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:51,839
- He speaks fluent Danish.
- I'll single out the few it might be.

44
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,039
None of them
would have shot their colleague.

45
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,519
Have you got
an opposing theory, Martin?

46
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,799
So?

47
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,999
I'll send you what we've got.
We'll talk later.

48
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,199
- How about some breakfast?
- No thanks.

49
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:14,079
- Why not?
- I haven't got time.

50
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:21,639
It seems to upset Martin
that it might be a colleague.

51
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:28,159
- Or has something else happened?
- He's annoyed with me.

52
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,479
- Why?
- His son spent the night with me.

53
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:38,839
- Did he miss his train or something?
- No, he likes me.

54
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:44,679
- How old is his son?
-18. I don't see why he's upset.

55
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,919
- August can do as he wants.
- That's irrelevant.

56
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,759
You can't have sex
with your colleagues' children.

57
00:06:52,919 --> 00:07:00,119
We didn't have sex.
I said that he spent the night.

58
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,039
You should tell Martin.
He probably thought what I did.

59
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,079
- That's not my problem.
- Do it as a favour to me.

60
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,239
OK.

61
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,239
A school bus with five children
has disappeared.

62
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,799
BODY FOUND IN SKIP

63
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,879
Sonja? Sonja?

64
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,719
Sonja! It's Stefan.
Do you recognize me?

65
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,999
Charlie walked along the street,
he found a parcel.

66
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:00,599
He thought it was tobacco,
it was dynamite.

67
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,159
- Is this a long time ago?
- It's the present, sister.

68
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,559
- She's awake.
- Yes, she's awake.

69
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:21,079
- Don't leave me.
- Listen. I'll never leave you again.

70
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,719
I'll never leave you again.

71
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:52,439
- Hi. I didn't think you'd come.
- You were right.

72
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:58,879
It was wrong to expose
the psychiatric patients.

73
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:05,359
- I'm sorry.
- OK.

74
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,839
You're a good guy, Åke.
I didn't appreciate you enough.

75
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,599
I have to go.
A school bus has disappeared.

76
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,479
- Five children missing. It's big.
- Congratulations.

77
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:46,879
- Hi. Åke said you were ill.
- I feel better now.

78
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,519
He killed
that police officer, Henning.

79
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,039
Any news about the fifth problem?
Have you checked your e-mail?

80
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,399
- Are you going to?
- I don't think so.

81
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,319
- It doesn't make a difference.
- What?

82
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:17,479
All of this. Everything I write,
everything he sends me.

83
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,639
In the end everything is meaningless.

84
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:30,279
- Nothing really matters.
- What's happened, Daniel?

85
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,279
- What does he want?
- I'll be damned if I know.

86
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:49,519
Lillian sent us these,
they match the criteria.

87
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,839
He died this winter.
He's dead as well.

88
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,599
It's been years.
Why didn't they check?

89
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,079
We've received new data.
I didn't sleep with your son, Martin.

90
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:18,559
August and I didn't have sex.
You clearly wanted to know.

91
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:26,759
- Listen.
- What is it?

92
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,239
Communication between a police
helicopter and the stolen car.

93
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,639
HK4 to car 319. What's your status?

94
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,559
HK4, this is 319.
Zebra, zulu. Zebra, zulu.

95
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:48,399
- Car 319, repeat.
- Nothing to report.

96
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,959
Car 319, message received.

97
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,359
"Zebra, zulu" means "all well".
ZZ is a snore.

98
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,559
It's used by officers in the US
with task force training.

99
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:08,719
- Does that match any of the profiles?
- They're all trained by the FBI.

100
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,679
Did he find "zebra, zulu"
on the Internet?

101
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,919
- John?
- No hits from the big search engines.

102
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,599
Do any Swedish officers
match the profile?

103
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,159
- John? Any Swedes?
- There are seven.

104
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,839
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Right, thank you. Bye.

105
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,319
Sonja Lindberg
has come out of the coma. Martin?

106
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:40,919
There's a school bus
and 15 officers to investigate.

107
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,519
- Sonja saw him.
- We don't know why he's got the bus.

108
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,799
John? Can you get us pictures
of the seven Swedes?

109
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,559
She doesn't answer.
I've tried to reach Mette all day.

110
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:05,439
- Why do you keep calling?
- She kicked me out.

111
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:11,999
- Why?
- I cheated on her.

112
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,599
Didn't she know
that you don't believe in monogamy?

113
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,079
What? What makes you think that?

114
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:23,519
- I do.
- Then why do you sleep with others?

115
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,799
- Have you been in a relationship?
- That depends on the definition.

116
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,879
I don't mean sex
with guys twenty years younger.

117
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,039
- August and I didn't have sex.
- Right. So what did you do all night?

118
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,239
- Talked, watched a film, ate, slept.
- In the same bed?

119
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,119
Is it unthinkable to spend
the night together and not have sex?

120
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:54,879
- I can see why you're cheating.
- Give it a rest.

121
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,559
- OK.
- Thank you.

122
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,559
It's all your fault. You waved
my wallet in front of Mette.

123
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,439
Did you sleep with
Charlotte Söringer?

124
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,519
What was it like?

125
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:45,119
It's Mette Rohde.
I'll be right down. Thank you.

126
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:57,799
- Hi. Is Sebastian Sandstrod here?
- Yes, over there.

127
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:10,399
- Hi, I'm Mette Rohde.
- Sebastian Sandstrod.

128
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,639
- What's this all about?
- I want to show you my software.

129
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:18,719
I don't purchase IT systems.

130
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:23,359
- But you use them.
- Yes, the ones the company buys.

131
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,119
They only think of the company.
I think of what's good for you.

132
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,519
Lots of salesmen
try to revolutionize my life.

133
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,479
I'll be the first to succeed.

134
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:38,799
- How?
- The long or the short version?

135
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:43,199
- The really short one.
- A better overview of the profits.

136
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,239
Less coordination, so less overtime.
More time with the family.

137
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:54,399
- Too long?
- No, but is it true?

138
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:59,639
The short version is that it is.

139
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:05,039
You have my full attention
for five minutes.

140
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:09,839
- That's not much.
- You have to earn more time.

141
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,399
This way.

142
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,399
Is it my fault that Mette's angry?

143
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,639
You could have
given me the wallet at work.

144
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,959
So the problem isn't that you cheat,
it's that Mette found out.

145
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,079
No. The problem is I want her back.

146
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,439
Do you get that? I love her.

147
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,079
- You should have thought about...
- ...that. I'm fully aware of that.

148
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,719
- What are you doing here?
- I've got some questions, Sonja.

149
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:05,039
- She just woke up. Can't this wait?
- No. I'm Saga Norén.

150
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:11,439
Look at these pictures. Did you see
who left the bottles of wine?

151
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,119
You said that you recognized him.

152
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,359
- Sonja? How are you?
- Fine.

153
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,199
- That's good.
- Yes.

154
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:28,559
- Look at them.
- Yes.

155
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,759
Concentrate, look at every picture.

156
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:41,639
- Focus, Sonja.
- She only just woke up.

157
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,519
- Do you want to tell me something?
- No.

158
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,799
- Are you OK, Sonja?
- Sonja, Sonja...

159
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:07,039
It's OK, Sonja.

160
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:23,479
We're not all equal before the law.

161
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,999
That's a problem.

162
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,879
Not just for the police.
People should take it seriously.

163
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:36,799
- "Equal before the law."
- "People should take it seriously."

164
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,199
Jesper Andersson,
born 1969, bilingual.

165
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,639
Danish mother.
He lived there until he was 12.

166
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:50,199
He graduated in 1995 and was given
training with the FBI 1998-2000.

167
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:57,239
He was in the national task force.
Two colleagues were killed in 2003.

168
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,199
He went on sick leave
and got divorced in 2005.

169
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,359
Then he became a regional
coordinator against organized crime.

170
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,639
He's good at youth work
and well-liked.

171
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,759
We need
a connection to the victims.

172
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,479
No one but the investigation team
should know about the surveillance.

173
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:26,959
- Should we talk to him? He's here.
- Do it.

174
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,559
Ask Pilkvist to give me a call.

175
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,839
- Is Jesper Andersson here?
- No.

176
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,679
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

177
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,959
OK. We just wanted to talk to him.

178
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,399
Do you want to leave your name?
Hello?

179
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:06,119
- He's Swedish. You said Danish.
- Things indicated that he was Danish.

180
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,519
- But Jesper Andersson is Swedish.
- Yes.

181
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,839
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.

182
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,239
- He wasn't there.
- He isn't at home either.

183
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:29,319
- Gry is searching his home.
- I'll go, she might miss something.

184
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:35,599
If it's him, he's busy. I'll show you
in John's office. Come here.

185
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,039
Millions of children
around the world are exploited.

186
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:55,599
If a product is very cheap,
someone has been made to pay.

187
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:02,119
We don't care, they're not
our children. But these are.

188
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,599
- Where's this from?
- Truth.se and the Danish page.

189
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,879
Each child represents
a line of business.

190
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:16,079
There are companies in our region
that contribute to child labour.

191
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:21,399
I want their premises torched
before the time is up.

192
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,519
One fire saves one child.
All can survive, it's up to you.

193
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,879
A list of the companies
will soon be made public.

194
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,199
Bloody hell.

195
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,559
The companies.

196
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:03,919
They're not just any companies.
Should we assume it's true?

197
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,319
- Are they involved in child labour?
- He hasn't been wrong yet.

198
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,399
If we print it,
there'll be consequences.

199
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:17,119
Five fires. Insurance companies
will make less of a profit.

200
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,999
- Five children will survive.
- It's not that easy.

201
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,439
I thought it was. Does it matter
that they're important advertisers?

202
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:34,759
- We can't encourage arson.
- We won't. We pass information on.

203
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,759
- As we've done for a week.
- We won't print it.

204
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,159
- We'd instigate crime.
- You've spoken to the lawyers.

205
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,959
We'll send the list to the police.
This is police business.

206
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,279
Because it affects
those that pay your wage?

207
00:24:54,439 --> 00:25:00,879
I've put up with your crap,
but you're almost crossing the line.

208
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,639
- I'm not killing five children.
- Oh, you just crossed it.

209
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:36,239
Thanks.
The five minutes were well spent.

210
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,879
- Or how long? An hour and a half?
- That's including coffee.

211
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:46,519
Your software sounds interesting.
I'll talk to my colleagues.

212
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,279
Thanks. It's simple, really.

213
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:55,879
It's like life itself.
Figure things out and sort them out.

214
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,999
How do you sort your life out?

215
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,839
If I knew, I would have been
on tour giving well-paid lectures.

216
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,199
Do you need to sort your life out?

217
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,519
Who doesn't?

218
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,159
I'm sorry. That's too personal.

219
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,959
- It's too soon. I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

220
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,399
- Your five minutes are up.
- Yes.

221
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,719
I'll send you some info.
You can forward it to colleagues.

222
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:38,759
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

223
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:58,559
Navid? Have you found a link
between Andersson and the victims?

224
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:01,839
Kerstin Ekwall
used to be a prosecutor.

225
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:07,239
- They might have met.
- Here's the list of companies.

226
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:16,479
We can't watch
all warehouses, offices and shops.

227
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:20,839
We have to try. Excuse me.

228
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:25,799
Anne? Look for a link between
the companies and the children.

229
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:29,879
- John has a list for you.
- OK. Thanks.

230
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:36,279
- John? The sounds in the room?
- None are from the surroundings.

231
00:27:53,319 --> 00:28:00,279
- What have you done?
- I assume it's a rhetorical question.

232
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:05,879
- I said no.
- Yes, and I didn't give a damn.

233
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:10,039
The list is everywhere,
in case you take it off our web page.

234
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:14,719
It's gone already.
Like you'll be in less than a minute.

235
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:21,719
- Labour laws aren't like that.
- Get out of my editorial offices.

236
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,359
Here's an update on Andersson.

237
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:50,799
- The ex-wife says he's a loner.
- That matches the profile.

238
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:55,919
His mother in Båstad hasn't seen him.
He's got a cottage in Småland.

239
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,199
We're in touch with colleagues,
but have to tread lightly.

240
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,399
- Have you spoken to Gry?
- Nothing of interest in the flat.

241
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,159
We're no closer to him
than we were this morning.

242
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:16,599
Excuse me. We've found
the body of Sören Holmgren.

243
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,079
His wife Veronika has disappeared.

244
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:25,559
Their social worker is
Stefan Lindberg.

245
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:31,159
- Do you know where he is?
- He's at the hospital.

246
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,079
- His sister's there.
- Good. Thank you.

247
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:41,439
He did it. Stefan Lindberg did it.

248
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:47,719
There's blood between
the floorboards in his bedroom.

249
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:51,359
Saga? The school bus
was found after a tip-off.

250
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,759
Five fires in two hours.
It's as if he wants them to die.

251
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,119
He wants people
to act on instinct, not think.

252
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,679
Children affect people's emotions.
Just like kittens.

253
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:23,879
Isn't this the worst thing he's done?
He'll kill five children.

254
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,399
They're five small persons,
he killed more homeless.

255
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:36,399
They don't know they're in danger.
Bjørn Rasmusen knew he was dying.

256
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:52,359
- So you have no maternal instinct?
- No. Why do you ask?

257
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,719
The windows are covered up.
No movement.

258
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:28,679
He used explosives before.
We'll send in the bomb crew.

259
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:32,439
- Are you ready, Milos?
- Yes.

260
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,799
- Hi, Saga.
- Hi.

261
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:43,479
The children aren't in the bus.
They're not filmed inside a bus.

262
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:46,239
- Maybe he moved them.
- He wouldn't.

263
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,279
The transmission might be recorded.
We have to expect the worst.

264
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,919
Can you hear me, Milos?
That's good.

265
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,399
You can follow Milos' camera here.

266
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,119
- What kind of a warehouse is it?
- We're looking into it.

267
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,479
What kind of a warehouse is it?
It's urgent.

268
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:14,319
- Yes, Milos?
- The outside of the bus is OK.

269
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:17,239
It's not wired on the outside.

270
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:33,159
- Back up.
- Can you back up a little?

271
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,879
- What does it say?
- Can you improve the picture?

272
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,079
Wait.

273
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:52,079
"Thanks for helping out."

274
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:56,919
- "Thanks for helping out"?
- Yes?

275
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,999
OK, thanks. It's a furniture company.

276
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,559
- Which company?
- Hulbos Möbler.

277
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,319
- We have to get him out.
- I've opened the door.

278
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:15,679
The company's on the list.
Get him out!

279
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,079
- Now!
- Abort and come out now.

280
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,199
- I'm in..
- Abort now!

281
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,519
A warehouse is on fire.
The missing school bus is there.

282
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,439
The police bomb technician
narrowly escaped the explosion.

283
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,479
It's not known whether
the five children are in the bus.

284
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,599
There's reason to believe
that they're not.

285
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:07,639
"Thanks for helping out."
Now it's on TV.

286
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:16,559
Five fires will save them. We don't
know if this company is on the list.

287
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:22,159
The building is engulfed in flames.
It'll take a while to...

288
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:57,039
- Saga Norén.
- Hi, it's John.

289
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,399
"Furniture" was taken off the list.
A child is saved.

290
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,559
- Yes. Thank you.
- OK. Bye.

291
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:13,839
- Did the police get hold of you?
- What?

292
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,799
The uniformed ones
were looking for you.

293
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:22,319
Yes, yes. We've...
We're done. Thanks.

294
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:46,399
- You were gone a long time.
- I'm sorry.

295
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:50,639
We're going away.

296
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:54,039
- Where to?
- I don't know. Away.

297
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:59,639
- Together?
- Of course. We'll always be together.

298
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:03,679
- Come on.
- Now?

299
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,559
We'll make a fresh start.

300
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:16,479
A fresh start. Do you hear me?
We'll walk away from this shit.

301
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,639
Come here.

302
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,839
OK? OK.

303
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,719
OK?

304
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:46,839
Sonja, come here.
We'll go the other way.

305
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:49,639
Hang on, I have to sit down.

306
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:05,959
Listen to me, Sonja.
I've messed up. Do you hear me?

307
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,239
I'll take care of you and make sure
you're fine. I love you.

308
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:18,639
- Stefan!
- Listen to me, Sonja.

309
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:24,119
Do you remember when you were
taken away? I said I'd wait for you.

310
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:30,239
Can you promise me the same thing?
Wait for me.

311
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:34,719
- You said we'd be together!
- We will be. Wait a little longer.

312
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,479
Stefan! Stefan!

313
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:12,079
- "Clothes" was taken off the list.
- Some kids torched a clothes store.

314
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,959
- Have they been arrested?
- Yes. People called them heroes.

315
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,959
There are three left. Excuse me.

316
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,439
- Has he got children?
- His son just turned two.

317
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,559
I'm here with Erik and Anna.
Their boy has been kidnapped.

318
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,359
Companies are on fire.

319
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,439
- How does that make you feel?
- It's terrible, but...

320
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,719
It only affects material things.

321
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:54,079
It's more important to get
my son back. They have insurance.

322
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,079
My boy can't be replaced.

323
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:37,959
I need the number
for Gladans Choklad in Malmö.

324
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:42,759
Can you transfer my call? Thank you.

325
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:49,399
Hi, my name's Daniel Ferbé.
Yes, that Daniel Ferbé.

326
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:54,159
Your company
has been tied to child labour.

327
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,279
I'd like to interview you
to get a more balanced coverage.

328
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:03,759
Who should I talk to?
Can you transfer my call?

329
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:09,039
- And Jesper Andersson?
- I might issue a wanted notice.

330
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,399
- He'll disappear.
- He already has.

331
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:18,159
- Have we got anything on him?
- Navid? Have you found anything?

332
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,999
I compared his working hours
to the perpetrator's activities.

333
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,599
He often works nights.

334
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:31,799
He's often in Denmark.
No one knows where he is.

335
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:38,439
- Is there a link to the children?
- They seem to be randomly selected.

336
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:42,359
A toy store's warehouse is on fire.

337
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:46,039
Another clothes store as well.

338
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,399
There are three minutes
and two fires left.

339
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,879
- You want it to succeed.
- Yes, and so do you.

340
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:57,399
"Sport" just disappeared.

341
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,519
How is this personal?
There must be a link to Andersson.

342
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,119
It might be a parent.

343
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:10,999
Five fires will save five children.
The companies must be connected.

344
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,119
Navid? Look for a link
between the companies.

345
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:18,079
There's a small fire at Gladans.

346
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,039
One minute and thirty seconds left.

347
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,159
They're saved.

348
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:52,159
- Do you think it's a good thing?
- To avoid the death of a child, yes.

349
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,839
Yes, but what if he puts people
up against each other?

350
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:01,679
If five disabled people die,
five children are saved.

351
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,839
- Or five immigrants have to die.
- That's not what he did.

352
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,279
- People obey him. Aren't you worried?
- There's something new.

353
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:18,919
- GPS coordinates.
- Find out where it is.

354
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:48,279
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

355
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:53,119
- Did he lock you up?
- I don't know.

356
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:55,839
- Didn't you see him?
- Yes.

357
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:59,359
Look at the picture, concentrate.
Was it him?

358
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,679
Maybe.
He had a beard and an eye patch.

359
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,319
- He looked like a pirate.
- I found these.

360
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,839
They're all saying the same thing.
Thank you.

361
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:18,159
That was
the last of his five problems.

362
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,319
- He's done.
- Maybe.

363
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:25,199
Let's issue a nationwide
wanted notice for Jesper.

364
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:31,759
He doesn't know we're looking
for him. That's our only advantage.

365
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:35,439
There'll be no wanted notice.

366
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:32,439
- What are you doing here?
- I need clothes.

367
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:37,639
- I want to see the children. August?
- He's not here.

368
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:44,199
- Will those children be all right?
- Yes, but we haven't caught him.

369
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:49,639
- I would like to tell you...
- Fetch your clothes and leave.

370
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:56,679
I love you.

371
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:22,719
Saga Norén.

372
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:28,359
What? Now? Yes. Thanks.

373
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:34,039
Hi. I was just passing by.

374
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:40,119
- Where were you going?
- Nowhere. I just wanted to see you.

375
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:45,479
You want to spend the night
at my place.

376
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:50,319
- If you'll let me.
- No. Your dad doesn't like it.

377
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,079
- Who cares what he thinks?
- I do.

378
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,759
- Really?
- Yes. I have to work now.

379
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,959
- Good night.
- Good night.

380
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,319
Thanks for a lovely day. Sebastian.

381
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,199
- I'm leaving.
- OK, fine.

382
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,439
- How long do we carry on like this?
- I don't know.

383
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:38,359
- We need to talk to work things out.
- I don't want to see you right now.

384
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:43,239
- Saga?
- Lithium aluminium hydride.

385
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:50,119
It was on the floor around the bus.
Water makes it catch fire.

386
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:53,679
- August slept over at your place.
- Yes.

387
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,319
- Does Andersson know chemistry?
- So you have a camp bed?

388
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:02,479
Don't you know, or doesn't he know?

389
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,119
- I don't know. You have a camp bed?
- Do you want to sleep over?

390
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:11,279
No, I was thinking about
someone else.

391
00:49:11,439 --> 00:49:13,639
Who?

392
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:22,839
Don't touch that.

393
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:40,759
- It's brand new, isn't it?
- Yes, it's not been used.

394
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:44,959
- So August slept in your bed?
- Yes.

395
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:50,839
He stopped by the police station.
August.

396
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:55,839
- What did he want?
- To sleep over. I said no.

397
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,199
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

398
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,519
Do you want some food?
I'll cook something.

399
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:31,479
Is this cooking?

400
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:35,399
- Isn't it hot?
- Yes, it's perfect.

401
00:50:43,279 --> 00:50:47,799
- Have you always lived alone?
- I lived with my sister a while.

402
00:50:47,959 --> 00:50:52,799
- And with a boyfriend?
- No.

403
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:57,639
- Why not?
- I'm no good as a girlfriend.

404
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,719
You can't know without trying.

405
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,919
- Is it because of your sister?
- What do you mean?

406
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:14,119
Do you worry about something
that you should be able to predict?

407
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:20,079
Many commit suicide
without prior suicidal tendencies.

408
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:25,199
Of course.

409
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:32,399
- Do you expect visitors?
- No.

410
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:36,839
Hi. Come on in.

411
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:44,919
Martin Rohde is
from the Copenhagen Police.

412
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:47,999
His wife kicked him out,
he's staying over.

413
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:51,439
This is Anton.
We have sex now and then.

414
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:01,879
- Hi.
- Do you want to go to bed right now?

415
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:09,159
- Maybe I won't stay.
- Why? Martin will take the camp bed.

416
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:11,999
Yes, but I was thinking...

417
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:18,999
- We can do it another day. OK?
- Sure.

418
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,799
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Nice to meet you.

419
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:31,279
- Bye.
- Bye.

420
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,439
- That was a nice guy.
- Yes.

421
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:45,719
- I should have left you two alone.
- No, we have to work.

422
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,199
- What's that?
- Jesper Andersson.

423
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:28,119
- Shit. It's just you.
- Yes, just me.

424
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:32,119
- What are you doing?
- I'm copying some stuff.

425
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,519
I've put too much time into this
to let Carina take over.

426
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:47,759
- What are you working on?
- The children that were released.

427
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:58,279
I know who torched
Gladans chocolate factory.

428
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:05,359
- Who?
- Just a part of the main office.

429
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:12,159
- Have you lost your mind?
- I saved a child.

430
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:18,399
You can't report me.
You have to protect your sources.

431
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:24,359
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

432
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,919
To save a child was intense.

433
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,599
Or maybe I enjoyed
setting fire to the place?

434
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:40,799
- I thought you'd changed.
- Maybe I have?

435
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:46,559
- It doesn't seem that way.
- So sue me.

436
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,319
- I thought you were done.
- Thank you for cooperating.

437
00:55:25,479 --> 00:55:29,199
- I was fired because of you.
- What a shame.

438
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,559
You helped me, so I'll help you.

439
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:38,079
The paper will take you back
if you get an exclusive interview.

440
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,199
- Do you want to meet up?
- We meet up and talk.

441
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:48,959
And then you get to
hand me over to the police. Daniel?

442
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,839
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No. I never intended to walk free.

443
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:58,479
I wanted to create awareness
among people.

444
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:01,759
- I'll face the consequences.
- OK.

445
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:08,679
- How do we do this?
- I'll give you driving directions.

446
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,839
I'm here.

447
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:28,479
- Do you get a feeling of déjà vu?
- It wasn't funny the first time.

448
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,799
Do you know what else isn't funny?
To give the truth second priority.

449
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:37,839
Journalists that can be bought.
Cowards.

450
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:41,479
People like you, Daniel.

451
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,799
That's really good.

452
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:49,519
- We're through with each other.
- You're right.
