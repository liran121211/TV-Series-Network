00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,039
SUMMARY

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,959
The lights on the bridge went out.

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,399
- The women were just the beginning.
- He wants to point out five problems.

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,719
Unequal before the law.
There are four left. What are they?

5
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:29,039
- Is he a psychopath?
- He's willing to make sacrifices.

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,279
- Are you sure it's the same man?
- Yes. Two dismembered women.

7
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,279
- Nine dead homeless people.
- Ten now.

8
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,999
Daniel Ferbé has joined us.

9
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,079
He's been in contact with
the perpetrator or perpetrators.

10
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,999
- Which is it?
- I've been in touch with one person.

11
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,999
He's done more for the homeless
than the politicians.

12
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:03,799
- Stefan! Stefan was there.
- Stefan? Do you know him?

13
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:08,559
Do you know who brought
the bottles? Who poisoned you?

14
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,479
You can't stay, Anja.
We haven't got space.

15
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:20,799
I'm just about to have some tea.
You can have some.

16
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,359
What are you doing?

17
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:36,599
- Has he been in touch?
- He wants 20 million to stop it.

18
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,079
- After another litre the heart stops.
- OK, so five or six hours.

19
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:49,199
- Let's contact the four men again.
- Did he do that with his eyes before?

20
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,479
Wasn't he in the merchant navy?
It's Morse code.

21
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,399
EPISODE 4

22
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:09,159
THE BRIDGE

23
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,319
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, pretty well.

24
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,759
- And you?
- I keep having dreams.

25
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,319
- About dad?
- About anything.

26
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,239
Was he happy?

27
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,959
Yes. Why do you ask?

28
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:54,199
We had a wonderful relationship.

29
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,679
I want to see him.

30
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,959
- Is that a good idea?
- I don't know, but I want to.

31
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,439
Will you come with me?

32
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,599
It's the police.
They want to talk to you.

33
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,999
- Charlotte Söringer is on her way.
- And the Danish?

34
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:44,199
- They're coming, albeit reluctantly.
- Let me know when they're here.

35
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:50,199
- How are things going?
- This is Kjell-Åke Jönsson.

36
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:53,199
He used to be a telegraph operator.

37
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:57,439
So far he's found:
"Recognize the eyes."

38
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,679
- And then "near".
- Does he know him?

39
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,719
- From the merchant navy?
- T.T. doesn't know Morse code.

40
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,239
- T.T.?
- They call him The Truth Terrorist.

41
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,759
Here's something new.

42
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,839
Men... Men's...

43
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,919
...home...is...

44
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,959
- ...te...
- Istedgade.

45
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,279
The Men's Home on Istedgade.
I'll go there.

46
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:06,519
August? Dammit, August!

47
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,879
I'm warming milk. Keep an eye on it.

48
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:21,479
- What's going on, brats?
- We're not brats.

49
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,799
Yes, you are.

50
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,919
- What's wrong with mum?
- It must be something she ate.

51
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,239
- What?
- I don't know. A car?

52
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,559
She did it yesterday as well.
She was sick.

53
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:52,319
Four police officers are charged.

54
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,479
There is no proof
of police brutality.

55
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,799
It's uncertain who did what,
when Hadi Hurani was injured.

56
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,519
Experts believe...

57
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,879
I don't care
what they say on the radio.

58
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,359
Nice coffee.

59
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,039
- What are you doing?
- Did I wake you?

60
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:10,159
No. Do you know what time it is?

61
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,519
- Why are you here?
- What?

62
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,479
- What are you doing here?
- I came yesterday. I stayed over.

63
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,039
Don't you remember?

64
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:30,519
I had a row with my mum.
It was raining.

65
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,599
You let me stay here.

66
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,999
Have you got
some bread or something?

67
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,919
A samurai fasts
the day before he goes into battle.

68
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,199
I have an important
assignment tomorrow.

69
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,079
- But... can I have something to eat?
- Sure.

70
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,959
Bread is in the other cupboard.

71
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,799
- Why are you so grumpy?
- I'm scared of my wife.

72
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,919
Does anyone want this?

73
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,559
A former sailor, a nasty man.
We banned him five years ago.

74
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:34,079
- Why?
- He was aggressive and unstable.

75
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,639
He nearly killed
a man that changed the TV channel.

76
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,959
- So he fell out with everyone.
- Yes.

77
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,079
- Do you know where he went?
- I don't know.

78
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:48,399
I need a list of staff
while he was here.

79
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,719
Do you realize how many there were?
What do you need it for?

80
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,199
Bjørn met his abductor here.

81
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,559
Lindberg! Stefan Lindberg.

82
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:18,039
- This is quite a coincidence.
- I work here.

83
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:24,199
- I'm the Swedish contact person.
- Maybe you know Bjørn, then.

84
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,919
- Who?
- The guy that's bleeding to death.

85
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,959
No.

86
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,439
Were you here five years ago
when he was banned?

87
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,919
I never met him,
so I probably wasn't.

88
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:45,239
- How's your sister?
- Still unconscious.

89
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,959
- When will you be back in Malmö?
- This afternoon.

90
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:55,999
Stop by the police station.
I want to ask you some questions.

91
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,959
- About what?
- We'll talk about it then.

92
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,039
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

93
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,119
We weren't given much of a choice.

94
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,359
- Why are we here?
- Agree to his demand.

95
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,199
- Why?
- He doesn't like to improvise.

96
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:37,679
If we force him to,
he might make mistakes.

97
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:42,639
- Does he assume we won't pay?
- Of course.

98
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,399
You stockpile your money
and take no social responsibility.

99
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,319
We need to discuss our next step.

100
00:13:54,479 --> 00:14:00,919
- If you give in, he'll take action.
- It might save Bjørn Rasmusen.

101
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,039
- And then what?
- I don't know.

102
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:10,359
Now we know what you think.
Can we discuss the matter in private?

103
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,999
- Could you excuse us?
- Of course.

104
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,839
There's nothing to discuss.

105
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,359
Is there? Do you want to give
a madman 20 million?

106
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:44,479
We could agree to it,
but then stop the payment.

107
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:59,679
- I don't think we should pay.
- "They can afford to save Bjørn."

108
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,559
9454 group members so far.

109
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,919
And then there's that.

110
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,599
Charlotte is right.

111
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,439
Bjørn knows the abductor.

112
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,639
All of these people
were there when he was.

113
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,759
- Is it personal?
- I don't know.

114
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,079
- Is he in Denmark?
- I don't know. I don't know anything.

115
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:39,879
We need a happy ending.
Tomorrow won't be easy.

116
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:46,279
- I heard they might be acquitted.
- The press is drawing comparisons.

117
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:52,119
Four immigrants were sentenced,
but only one or two were guilty.

118
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,199
- Is this the same thing?
- Yes. Yes.

119
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,839
- But they're police officers.
- Yes, exactly.

120
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:05,199
- I'm going back to Malmö.
- Martin? A happy ending.

121
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,159
- Hi, Henning.
- Hi, Martin.

122
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,239
- How are you?
- Fine.

123
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,079
- The trial must be stressful.
- Yes.

124
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:45,239
- We'll be acquitted.
- So I hear. Can I have a cigarette?

125
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:57,319
- Why are you protecting them?
- I'm not. He fell.

126
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:03,279
- His arm broke and an eye ruptured.
- He had an awkward fall.

127
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,639
How do you rupture your eyeball
in an awkward fall?

128
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:18,439
- He's dead. Don't walk away!
- Let go of me.

129
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,959
Or what?
Or I'll have an awkward fall?

130
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,039
You're going through hell.
Why are you going down with them?

131
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:56,639
Hey, hey... Hi, Henning.

132
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,959
- What were you talking about?
- Nothing.

133
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,759
One day. Right?

134
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,759
Keep your mouth shut one day more.

135
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,279
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

136
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,239
We'll get through this.

137
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:41,319
The property investors
haven't confirmed...

138
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:45,519
that they'll agree to the demands.

139
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,719
There's no time to lose.
Medical experts say-

140
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:54,959
- that Bjørn Rasmusen will lose
consciousness within the next hour.

141
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:01,119
His life will be at stake
as a second hour passes.

142
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,799
Thank you, Karin.

143
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:09,759
Journalist Daniel Ferbé is with us.

144
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,879
He's in contact with the killer.

145
00:19:55,399 --> 00:20:00,679
- How's it going?
- We don't know where Bjørn is.

146
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,639
I didn't find any clues, but I met
Stefan Lindberg in Copenhagen.

147
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:13,279
- What was he doing there?
- Working. I told him to stop by.

148
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,439
- Why?
- He keeps popping up.

149
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,839
- They won't pay.
- Didn't they hear what we said?

150
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:28,279
- Are they still there?
- You can't have your way this time.

151
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,959
He's saying something.

152
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,399
He's saying: A...1...

153
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,919
And then three letters: A, J, B.

154
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,159
- He repeats it: A1.
- It's some sort of code.

155
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,559
- No, he must be looking at something.
- He can see the camera.

156
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,759
Maybe.

157
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,959
Gry and Navid,
search for A1AJB everywhere.

158
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:03,479
Product numbers, the land registry...
Everything!

159
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:07,199
Ask Copenhagen to do the same.

160
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,439
- He might change the number.
- He won't. He's unconscious.

161
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:24,239
THEY'RE KILLING BJØRN

162
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,919
- Can you see well enough?
- It's a bit more complicated.

163
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,519
- To negotiate with terrorists...
- Write an editorial.

164
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,599
- I mean...
- Have you seen the competition?

165
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,119
- It's all about emotions.
- That's what he wants.

166
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,919
How do you know what he wants?
Are you his contact?

167
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:56,759
- You're just jealous.
- For once I'm not, actually.

168
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:20,279
The four property investors
have made a decision.

169
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:24,479
They won't pay the 20 million.

170
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,279
- Do you regret this?
- Not yet.

171
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:40,399
- We can go back home.
- No, I want to see him.

172
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,239
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

173
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,759
- Who are you?
-I'm sorry. I'll leave.

174
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,639
Who are you? Why are you here?

175
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,639
My name's Emilie Hanson.
I was a close friend of Göran.

176
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,719
Well... I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be here. I'll leave.

177
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,959
Em? You're Em.

178
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,719
You were together.

179
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:31,759
I'm sorry for your loss, Maja.

180
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,159
I didn't know that she was here.

181
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:22,159
- Think out loud.
- He hasn't made a single mistake.

182
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:29,439
He didn't expect that Bjørn
would be able to communicate.

183
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,759
He's in an abandoned factory.

184
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,599
What's in an abandoned factory?

185
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,959
Machinery.

186
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:44,519
- He would have told us what kind.
- Pipes, doors.

187
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:50,959
Doors with serial numbers.
A barrel of chemicals.

188
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,879
Behind the camera.
It's filming continuously. Filming...

189
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,719
Bjørn can see a power meter.

190
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:49,919
He isn't giving us
the last two digits.

191
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:55,079
There's a letter, a digit,
three letters, and two digits.

192
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:58,399
The last two digits
must be hidden from view.

193
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,919
- Are there 99 possible places?
- 100, there's 00 as well.

194
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,839
- We've found it.
- It's a fuseboard.

195
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:13,719
- Some aren't used, there are 89 left.
- That's 88 too many, he's dying.

196
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:17,479
37 are in apartment buildings
and 30 in houses.

197
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:20,799
- That leaves 22.
- Martin, Saga.

198
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:31,959
I'll pay. I'll pay the entire sum.

199
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,639
- Why? On your own?
- Yes.

200
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,999
If he demands that the others pay,
we can pretend they did.

201
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,599
- Your husband would have refused.
- Yes.

202
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,119
- Are you sure? It's a lot of money.
- Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

203
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,399
- He'll go there to stop the bleeding.
- I'll contact the press.

204
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,319
This way.

205
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:15,839
- What made you change your mind?
- Revenge.

206
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:24,119
I'm sorry. I don't have noble motives
or a guilty conscience.

207
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,399
- It's revenge.
- On your husband.

208
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:36,679
- I feel as if I've wasted 19 years.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

209
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,839
Don't be.

210
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:49,919
I can break down or get my own back.
I'll get my own back.

211
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:56,679
- Are you married?
- Yes.

212
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,799
And faithful? Good.

213
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,159
I'd like to drive you home,
but I'm needed here.

214
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,359
I've got my car, and I'm in no hurry.

215
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:19,559
I'll let Maja leave the house.
My stepdaughter.

216
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:24,119
Who will inherit 20 million less.

217
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,599
- They'll pay 20 million.
- To save the tramp?

218
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,319
- Can you handle it?
- To quote a press release? Use Åke.

219
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:48,879
- What is he doing?
- Åke? He's licking his elbow.

220
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,799
- The killer, I mean. T.T.
- He said he would stop the bleeding.

221
00:30:54,959 --> 00:31:01,399
- So he has to go there.
- Yes, but no one knows where it is.

222
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,159
There are three interesting meters
in the same empty building.

223
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,719
The power station says
that one is in use.

224
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:23,039
The task force is on its way.
We've got him.

225
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:26,279
- If he sticks to his word.
- He will.

226
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:39,559
Do you think he's dead?

227
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,039
- Are you expecting visitors?
- Open the door.

228
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:04,359
It's locked.

229
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:19,679
- Lasse Jönsson?
- Yes, he lives here. I'll take it.

230
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,439
I need your signature there.

231
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,559
Thank you.

232
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:48,879
I don't want you to lock the door.

233
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,359
- Why not?
- I'm locked in.

234
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,839
No, I'm locking things out.

235
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,439
The end result is the same, isn't it?

236
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,559
- Take the keys. Is that better?
- Sure.

237
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,679
- Don't let anyone in.
- No.

238
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:16,279
- Aren't you going to open it?
- I'm not allowed. Not yet.

239
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:20,959
- Says who?
- No One.

240
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,359
I might call mum.
I'm sure she's worried.

241
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,959
That serves her right.

242
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,719
Dad's much nicer.
But he's got a new, fantastic family.

243
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:44,559
He doesn't have time for me.

244
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,479
- Who are you?
- Are you kidding?

245
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:01,519
Anja. I came yesterday.
I spent the night here.

246
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,519
The rain.

247
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,159
- I'm going out for a while.
- Will you come back?

248
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,879
- If you let me.
- Of course. Just knock three times.

249
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:04,439
They're on their way.
We can enter in ten minutes.

250
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:08,439
The fuseboards are in three places.

251
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,679
- Ten minutes is a lot of time.
- 9 minutes 47 seconds.

252
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:17,559
- Where are you going?
- I'm doing my job.

253
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,999
We have to wait for the task force.

254
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:33,759
The most important task
is to protect your colleague.

255
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:37,279
Let me make this clear,
I'm your colleague.

256
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,439
Turn left.

257
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:32,199
- It's this one.
- Hans calling Saga. Where are you?

258
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,159
Hans calling Saga.

259
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,519
Saga? Over.
What the hell are they doing?

260
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,559
Police! Stop!

261
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,879
- Stop!
- Don't kill me! Please!

262
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,759
The other fuseboard is over there.

263
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:21,319
Don't.

264
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:28,399
Calm down. We're from the police.
Calm down. OK?

265
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,279
- What's your name?
- Mange. I live here.

266
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:36,279
- Have you seen anyone here?
- No, I'm alone.

267
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:42,559
I'll check the other fuseboards.
Can you bring him upstairs?

268
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,679
- Are you OK?
-I'm OK.

269
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,319
Saga calling Hans.
We've arrested a person.

270
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:05,279
- What are you doing? Who is that?
- A homeless person.

271
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:09,759
There was nothing
at Sorgenfri and Dalvik either.

272
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:15,319
They're other industrial areas
with the correct meter numbers.

273
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,759
- I was absolutely sure.
- He might have stopped the bleeding.

274
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,879
That doesn't matter
if we don't know where.

275
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,239
- Saga Norén.
- It's Gry. We discovered something.

276
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:37,159
There are two of some fuseboards.

277
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:43,919
- What does that mean?
- There's that new area at Sorgenfri.

278
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,879
Numbers from buildings due
for demolition have been reused.

279
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:56,679
- Every fuseboard is in two places.
- We checked the new ones.

280
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,679
Send me everything you've got.
Get everyone out there.

281
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,919
- Should I take the gun?
- You can't be armed in Sweden.

282
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,959
- I don't like this.
- Don't worry, I'm a good shot.

283
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,679
All the way down the corridor.

284
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,559
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

285
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,799
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

286
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:57,319
Bjørn! Bjørn! Can you hear me?

287
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:24,039
Saga calling Hans.
I found the victim.

288
00:41:27,879 --> 00:41:32,199
T.T. is going out onto the roof.
He's armed.

289
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:26,679
- Hi. How are you doing?
- Me? Fine.

290
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:31,479
- What did he look like?
- He was taller than me and athletic.

291
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:36,319
He was fit and good at close combat.
I don't know more.

292
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:40,879
- Is that it?
- She meant to say: How are you?

293
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,719
It's been patched up nicely.
What about Bjørn?

294
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:49,639
His heart stopped.
He never regained consciousness.

295
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:54,599
He had stopped the bleeding.
He sticks to his word.

296
00:42:56,279 --> 00:43:03,079
- He must have had an escape route.
- He shot two from the task force.

297
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:09,519
One dead, one critically injured.
Did you see anything?

298
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:14,599
- What?
- I just got this feeling.

299
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,039
I don't know what it means.
I'm sorry.

300
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:26,759
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- Are you sure?

301
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:31,719
Your wife is outside,
I'll send her in.

302
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:38,959
Are you Mette Rohde?
Your husband's in there.

303
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,959
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
- Nice to meet you.

304
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,159
- Martin has told me a lot about you.
- What?

305
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,999
- You're working together.
- Nothing else?

306
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,839
- Do you do something else together?
- No. What do you mean?

307
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:59,679
We'll let Mette go inside. I'm Hans.

308
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,279
I'm the one that called.
You can go in.

309
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:07,719
Maybe we can meet
under better circumstances?

310
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:20,559
Come here. I need a kiss.
Come here, sit down.

311
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:27,239
- Ouch, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

312
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:34,119
The bastard kicked the stitches open.
It hurt as bad as giving birth.

313
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,119
- What is it?
- Nothing.

314
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,199
Was it him? Why didn't you
shoot him? Why let him get so close?

315
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,759
- Because I'm not armed in Sweden.
- You're chasing that lunatic unarmed?

316
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,999
- Saga is armed.
- OK, what did she do?

317
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,599
She was knocked over.

318
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,319
- Are you off the case? Why not?
- I can't stop.

319
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:18,559
Of course you can.
You're in hospital, for God's sake!

320
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,919
I can't. I'm going to find him.

321
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,199
This is no different
from what I've always done.

322
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:30,839
Normally you're
able to defend yourself.

323
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,479
Yes.

324
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:40,479
How are the twins and Nicholai?

325
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,839
August is watching them.
He's been very helpful today.

326
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:55,559
- It will work out.
- Yes.

327
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:16,639
Saga Norén will be back tomorrow.

328
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:22,959
- Martin Rohde?
- Same thing, tomorrow.

329
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,479
- Can you leave them a note?
- Certainly, I will.

330
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:32,839
- What was your name again?
- Stefan Lindberg.

331
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,959
Stefan Lindberg.
I'll take care of it.

332
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:40,959
- Stefan Lindberg.
- Where's Veronika?

333
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,919
- What Veronika?
- She can't leave with the children.

334
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,479
I'll find her! Do you get it?
If I can't find her, I'll find you.

335
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,199
Bloody hell...

336
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,159
- I can do this.
- Sorry.

337
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:41,079
Thanks.

338
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:57,999
- Hi. Are you home already?
- I may as well lie here.

339
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,359
- Thanks for looking after the kids.
- That's OK.

340
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,079
- What did T.T. look like?
- I don't know.

341
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:13,439
But he's the hell of a kicker.
I'm off to bed. Don't stay up late.

342
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,719
Maybe I should get
one of those user accounts?

343
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:24,039
- I could stay in touch with people.
- You're good at that...

344
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,879
- Who is she?
- Her name's Frida.

345
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:36,639
- Is she your girlfriend? A friend?
- If you cared, you would have known.

346
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:41,639
She's my ex. We were together
my first year in high school.

347
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,279
- Can you remember my first year?
- No...

348
00:48:47,439 --> 00:48:53,919
- And then he left his son's room.
- Sleep tight.

349
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:03,479
Bloody hell...

350
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:10,799
What is it? What's on your mind?

351
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:14,439
What?

352
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,079
Is something wrong?

353
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,319
- What is it?
- I'm pregnant.

354
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,079
It happened before your operation.

355
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:49,399
- It's yours, in case you wonder.
- No, I don't.

356
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:54,239
We weren't going to have any more.

357
00:49:56,919 --> 00:49:58,919
What?

358
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,839
- We can't.
- I don't know.

359
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,159
What if it's twins?

360
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,679
It could be twins again.
We'd have five children!

361
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:24,279
No. We haven't got enough space.

362
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:31,879
- No. We... Can we manage?
- Can we manage?

363
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:40,679
Come here. Come here.

364
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,359
- We don't have to decide yet.
- No.

365
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,679
- I'm leaving now.
- Hans?

366
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:16,439
What's a police officer's
most important task?

367
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:20,959
To solve crime,
arrest the perpetrator.

368
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,559
To protect your colleague?
Martin thinks so.

369
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,679
- It wasn't your fault he was injured.
- I helped Bjørn.

370
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:35,959
To save lives must be
most important. Martin is alive.

371
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,479
- Exactly.
- It must be most important.

372
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:45,159
I've double-checked,
they prioritize the same way.

373
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:50,239
The Nordic countries
have the same instructions.

374
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,759
There's no difference.
You did the right thing.

375
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:25,359
Why do you sit in the dark?

376
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:38,679
Darling?

377
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:46,119
He resisted a body search.
Bo kneed him in the face.

378
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:49,399
His eye burst.

379
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:55,119
Luffe tried to stop the screaming
and broke his arm. It hurt.

380
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:59,839
He tried to get up,
but they sat on him...

381
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:02,879
until he calmed down.

382
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,799
He was unconscious.

383
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:11,119
I watched. I watched,
and then I walked away.

384
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:22,159
You should tell someone else.

385
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:27,639
I agree.

386
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,359
I'm sorry. Thanks.

387
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,479
Hello? It's me.

388
00:54:00,399 --> 00:54:02,399
Hello?

389
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:12,079
Did you run into No One?
He just left.

390
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,079
- How can I run into no one?
- That was his name. A master.

391
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:25,799
He revealed the truth. Tomorrow
the sword of justice will swing.

392
00:54:26,919 --> 00:54:28,919
OK.

393
00:54:32,279 --> 00:54:38,999
- Good night, Anja.
- You're odd, but in a good way.

394
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,599
Listen, I... called mum.

395
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:51,399
I thought she would cry
and tell me to come home.

396
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,839
She went absolutely crazy.

397
00:54:57,319 --> 00:55:02,279
So I'll stay another night,
if that's OK?

398
00:55:02,439 --> 00:55:07,519
Stay as long as you like. From
tomorrow on the apartment's yours.

399
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,439
- What? Mine?
- Good night.

400
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,199
- Don't forget to lock the door.
- No.

401
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,879
- Hi, Saga.
- How's your scrotum?

402
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:00,759
Small talk isn't your strong side.

403
00:56:00,919 --> 00:56:05,279
I was thinking about
what happened today.

404
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:10,479
He aimed at you, but didn't fire.
Why didn't he shoot you?

405
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,239
- I don't know.
- He shot two from the task force.

406
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,639
Maybe I wasn't a threat to him?

407
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:27,759
Maybe.
Or he's trying to tell us something.

408
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:33,039
- What?
- Maybe he needs you?

409
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:36,519
- Why?
- I don't know.

410
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:41,679
Think about it. Good night.
