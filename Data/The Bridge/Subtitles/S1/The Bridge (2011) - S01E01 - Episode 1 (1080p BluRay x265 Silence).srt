1
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,519
The lights went out.
The lights on the bridge went out.

2
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:47,159
- I'm on my way. It went black for...
- ...45 seconds.

3
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,839
- I'll take a look.
- No, I know what's going on now.

4
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:13,119
THE BRIDGE

5
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,479
EPISODE 1

6
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,119
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
- Copenhagen Police.

7
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,039
- Do you know who she is?
- Yes.

8
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:28,879
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

9
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:35,039
- Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
- I don't know.

10
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:41,719
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

11
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,839
- Saga Norén. Can I help you?
- When will you let traffic through?

12
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,239
- It might take up to two hours.
- I haven't got two hours!

13
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,439
- Back up.
- Is someone's life in danger?

14
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,679
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

15
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,159
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

16
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,119
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

17
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:17,079
- What's happened?
- Is there no other way through?

18
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:21,239
There ought to be
another way through.

19
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:27,199
- No one's answering any questions.
- Let me pass, please.

20
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,559
The Öresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.

21
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:46,239
According to the police it will...

22
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,919
- It's Stefan Lindberg.
- Hi, it's Veronika.

23
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,599
- Sorry, did I wake you up?
- No, you didn't. How are you?

24
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,519
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

25
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:24,919
- I see. How are the boys?
- They're asleep.

26
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,239
They don't understand
what's about to happen.

27
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,519
- Can we meet up?
- Now?

28
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:40,399
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

29
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:47,759
- No. I'd rather go to your place.
- OK.

30
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,679
- I can go to the office.
- I'll see you there.

31
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:06,279
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

32
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,359
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

33
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
My colleague
might have recorded something.

34
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:19,239
Hello! Stop! Stop!

35
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,759
- Stop! Stop!
- I allowed it.

36
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,999
- Why? This is a crime scene.
- I'm fully aware of that.

37
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,159
- We've got enough bodies.
- He wasn't dying.

38
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,399
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a police officer.

39
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,439
- What's your name?
- Martin Rohde.

40
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,199
- Rohde?
- R, O, H, D, E.

41
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:55,079
- Have you got an ID?
- It was an ambulance.

42
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:59,999
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

43
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,359
- What evidence was destroyed?
- Probably none.

44
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,559
Thank you.

45
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:36,719
Hello. Hi. Finally.

46
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,519
I won't operate on Göran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

47
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:50,079
- At what time? Are you drunk?
- No, but that doesn't matter.

48
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:55,359
You promised to see us through this.

49
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,839
- Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
- Better than you?

50
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,479
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

51
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,519
- I won't forgive you if it goes wrong.
- What if I do it and it goes wrong?

52
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,759
Then I'll never forgive myself.

53
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:36,199
- We're done, you can move her.
- You can take her away.

54
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,679
Bloody hell.

55
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:08,639
The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.

56
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,479
- And the recordings?
- They'll deliver them tomorrow.

57
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,679
- What about the press?
- They know.

58
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,079
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

59
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:25,359
- And the family?
- I'm on my way to see them.

60
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,479
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

61
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,839
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

62
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:41,039
- Just tread lightly.
- Listen, Hans...

63
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,999
She was chopped in half.

64
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,439
- Right above the hips.
- What the hell are you saying?

65
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:56,759
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

66
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,199
- Have you got more computers?
- No.

67
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,919
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

68
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,639
- When did you last talk to her?
- She called yesterday.

69
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,839
- Do you know what time it was?
- I don't know.

70
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,119
Around half past six in the evening.

71
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,479
- Was she threatened?
- By whom?

72
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,719
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

73
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,479
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

74
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,439
- Has she upset anyone lately?
- Lately...

75
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,399
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

76
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,479
- That's foolish.
- Sorry, what?

77
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:55,039
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

78
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:58,879
- Is that why she was...?
- We don't know why.

79
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,999
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

80
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,999
Why? Why did someone do this?

81
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:13,759
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

82
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,839
Did she have an affair?

83
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,479
Saga Norén.

84
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,759
Can't we talk on the phone?

85
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,639
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

86
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,319
August?

87
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,679
- Were you on the bridge?
- Yes.

88
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,919
- What happened?
- A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

89
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,319
- Did you check on August?
- Yes.

90
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:38,999
- Is he asleep?
- Yes.

91
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:43,439
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

92
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,679
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

93
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,199
- He got up at three o'clock today.
- I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

94
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,679
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

95
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,639
- Do you know the cause of death?
- I can make a qualified guess.

96
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,559
She died six to eight hours ago.

97
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:47,719
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

98
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:52,599
There's something else.

99
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,319
- What?
- Take a look.

100
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:30,439
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

101
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:33,439
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

102
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,959
The face is swollen.

103
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,279
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

104
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,479
And the other half?

105
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:00,959
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

106
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:08,399
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

107
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:17,279
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

108
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,959
It feels different. Frostbite.

109
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,999
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

110
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:30,919
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

111
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,079
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

112
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:02,399
- So everyone's here, then.
- Yes.

113
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
Hi, Sebastian.

114
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,839
I don't know what to do.

115
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:16,159
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

116
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,399
Can't you just pay the rent?

117
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:25,319
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

118
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,679
I paid out money for the rent.

119
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:34,879
- Why did you bring the children?
- Sören wasn't there.

120
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,919
I can't manage.

121
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:44,559
- Can't you make an exception?
- No. You know I can't.

122
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:48,599
- Please.
- There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

123
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,399
Charlotte Söringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

124
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:17,919
- Göran had atrial fibrillation.
- They managed to stop it.

125
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,239
- He's too weak for surgery.
- Too weak?

126
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:27,119
- But there's a new heart.
- It will be given to someone else.

127
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:32,479
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

128
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:38,959
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

129
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,199
We're cancelling for his own sake.

130
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:47,639
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

131
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:54,359
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

132
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,719
- Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?
- Yes.

133
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:24,399
- It's Saga Norén from the bridge.
- Yes, I remember.

134
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,159
- Were you asleep?
- I tend to doze off around this time.

135
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,719
- There were two women.
- You found another one.

136
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,599
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

137
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,799
- Have you found half a body?
- I don't know.

138
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:49,919
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

139
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,719
- Can you look into it? Now?
- First thing tomorrow morning.

140
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,599
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

141
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,519
- I'll call you back.
- When?

142
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,639
- Do you have to get up?
- Yes.

143
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,639
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

144
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,439
- How old?
- Adult.

145
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:55,599
- And life in general is OK?
- Yes.

146
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,479
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

147
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:05,759
- So you'll be firing blanks.
- Was it in the staff news bulletin?

148
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,519
- Is everything working as it should?
- It will in time.

149
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,239
It can't be much fun.

150
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:19,159
- What do you mean?
- You've heard about castrated toms?

151
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,959
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

152
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,519
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

153
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,199
Let's see what we've got.

154
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,399
Two women killed a year apart.

155
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,399
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

156
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:55,039
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

157
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,119
- Saga Norén.
- It's Martin.

158
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:12,119
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

159
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,359
- Can you email the info?
- I'll be right over.

160
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,439
- Why do you want to come here?
- She's Danish.

161
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,279
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

162
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:27,759
- Do you mind if I come over?
- Yes.

163
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,399
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

164
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:39,919
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

165
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,599
- Is that a problem?
- Yes...

166
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,079
No, no.

167
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:54,039
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

168
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,119
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

169
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,119
- Can you be ready by then?
- Yes.

170
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,439
It finally worked out.

171
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:45,399
- What did you just sign?
- Formalities.

172
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:52,039
- Whose is it?
- What?

173
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,559
The heart. Whose is it?

174
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:58,919
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

175
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:07,799
- What's his name?
- I don't know. Does it matter?

176
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,479
No, I guess it doesn't.

177
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,719
- I'm scared.
- It will be fine.

178
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,839
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

179
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,559
I can't imagine life without you.

180
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:44,559
- I need to take Göran with me.
- Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

181
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:51,599
- Hi.

182
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,959
- Hi! An early breakfast?
- No thank you.

183
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,599
- An email would have been faster.
- Yes, but not as pleasant.

184
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,639
- Where are you going?
- I'm coming in with you.

185
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:16,559
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

186
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,439
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

187
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:40,439
- Good morning. Coffee?
- No thanks, I've already had some.

188
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,919
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

189
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:52,199
- Thank you. You need to register.
- I also need a card.

190
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:55,359
- My name's Felicia.
- Nice to meet you.

191
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,799
- That's it. This is for you.
- Thank you.

192
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:05,999
- And one of these is for you.
- Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

193
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,639
- See you later.
- I hope so.

194
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:28,079
- Where's Saga Norén?
- To the right. Bye!

195
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,599
Excuse me.

196
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,999
- Sit down.
- I'm afraid I can't.

197
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,079
- You make me nervous.
- OK, I can stand still.

198
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:02,359
- Why can't you sit down?
- My nether regions hurt.

199
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,559
- I had a vasectomy yesterday.
- Right.

200
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:13,039
I've got five children
with three different women.

201
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:18,439
- Have you got children?
- No, why would I want to?

202
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,879
- I've never heard anyone ask that.
- Many should have.

203
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,599
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

204
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,319
- Why aren't you off sick?
- I can't afford it. August moved in.

205
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:53,479
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

206
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:57,079
- You can't sit down.
- I can.

207
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:01,519
- I drove here.
- Pretend that the chair is a car.

208
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,519
Yes.

209
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,959
- No one wanted to solve the case.
- What do you mean?

210
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,479
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

211
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:34,599
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

212
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,199
It fell between two stools.

213
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,319
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

214
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,919
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

215
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,799
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

216
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:10,399
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

217
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:16,679
- Two computers?
- They know who it is now.

218
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,879
- Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
- Yes.

219
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,599
- That's good.
- And a Danish police officer.

220
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:30,759
- Does he know that she's a bit odd?
- If not, he'll soon find out.

221
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:40,199
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

222
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:45,199
- This is Martin Röhde.
- It's Rohde.

223
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,399
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

224
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:58,359
- Have you read the file?
- Most people have just arrived.

225
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,639
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

226
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,759
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

227
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,199
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

228
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,079
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

229
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,639
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

230
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,239
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

231
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:30,839
She went missing 13 months ago.

232
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:37,119
- Right.
- The investigation was inadequate.

233
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,399
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. It was terrible.

234
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,839
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

235
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:56,399
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

236
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,319
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

237
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:05,399
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

238
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:09,479
- How was it done?
- Someone accessed a computer.

239
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,959
Can you show me the fourth picture?

240
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,559
Use all the people you need. Gry?

241
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:21,079
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

242
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:25,639
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

243
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:29,279
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

244
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:34,199
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

245
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,959
- Were they dumped from her car?
- No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

246
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,799
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

247
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:51,239
- John can find the license number.
- What? Sure.

248
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:55,199
- What are you doing?
- I had an idea.

249
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:01,319
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

250
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,719
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

251
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:09,119
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

252
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,559
- It's millimetre perfect.
- Tell me everything about the line.

253
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:16,079
Take paint samples.

254
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:22,359
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

255
00:33:56,439 --> 00:34:02,399
- Hi. Is Veronika at home?
- Yes.

256
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,959
- What do you want?
- I would like to talk to her.

257
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,919
- You can talk to me.
- I would if you were clean.

258
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:15,639
- What? I am clean.
- Hi, Veronika.

259
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:21,559
- Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
- The landlord did that.

260
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:29,199
- You're not helping.
- I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

261
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,199
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

262
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,919
- That was bloody stupid.
- Sören! Stop it!

263
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:55,319
What the hell?

264
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,439
Stop, you bastard!

265
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,479
Stop! Come out!

266
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:29,119
Sören! Stop it, Sören! Stop it!

267
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:32,799
- I hate that bloody bastard!
- Sören!

268
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,759
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

269
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:45,799
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

270
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:28,039
- How's the operation going?
- It hasn't started.

271
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,559
- Why? He was prepared hours ago.
- I don't know.

272
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,479
I'm afraid I have to go.

273
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:41,599
- Don't you know where he is?
- You probably know better than me.

274
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:47,359
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

275
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:54,279
- I'm sorry about all of this.
- Stop apologizing for him.

276
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,879
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

277
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:08,399
Maybe you should do the same?
Sören put you in this position.

278
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,719
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

279
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,359
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

280
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:26,639
- He hits you and the children.
- Hardly ever the children.

281
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:30,759
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

282
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:35,119
He shouldn't hit any of you.

283
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:42,919
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

284
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,079
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

285
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,399
Think about it.

286
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:15,159
- Anders? What's going on?
- We've got a problem.

287
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:21,039
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

288
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,479
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Göran!

289
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,079
Wasn't that the turn-off?

290
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:00,919
- Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
- No, not today.

291
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:07,519
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

292
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,999
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

293
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,479
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

294
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,519
It went to the local council.

295
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,519
It's Sören.

296
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,239
Come.

297
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:51,959
- Step inside.
- What about the children?

298
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,839
They can stay outside a while longer.

299
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,399
- Where are we? Why are we here?
- Just go inside.

300
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:23,839
- Crime scene and meeting place.
- Have you worked here a long time?

301
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:26,199
- More than ten years?
- Yes.

302
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,679
- Are you from around here?
- From Malmö? No.

303
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:37,719
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

304
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:47,639
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

305
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:52,719
- Are you related to Lars Norén?
- No.

306
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,679
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

307
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,559
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

308
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:21,199
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

309
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,359
Here's info about your authority.

310
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,159
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

311
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,719
- Can I have a word with you, Saga?
- Yes.

312
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,279
The report you filed
against Martin...

313
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,959
Yes, there's only one.

314
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,999
What do you suggest I do with it?

315
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,999
Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?

316
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,439
- Do you think so?
- I think there's every chance.

317
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,639
- Will he dislike me?
- That might happen.

318
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:11,879
Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.

319
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,039
He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.

320
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,079
- I'm supposed to file a report.
- I'll handle the report.

321
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:26,719
- Yes, that's fine. Fine.
- I've got the car's license number.

322
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:30,119
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

323
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:33,759
- The journalist?
- Yes, he's a journalist.

324
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,679
- Do you know who he is?
- Yes. I read his column.

325
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,839
It's entertaining.

326
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,439
- You made me jump.
- I worked all night.

327
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,359
- I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
- You work all night.

328
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:59,959
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

329
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,639
Get down?
How many children have you got?

330
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:08,319
Children that suck the life
out of you.

331
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:15,079
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

332
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:20,239
- Have fun.
- I will.

333
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:23,079
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

334
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:27,359
What do you want, Åke?

335
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,759
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

336
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,719
- They're really cool. I like them.
- Yes, they were cool.

337
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:44,439
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

338
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:46,799
And now you like them.

339
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:51,079
My daughter...

340
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,559
- She danced all afternoon.
- Sorry, I have to answer.

341
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:05,079
We'll have to continue this later.

342
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,959
You and the boys will disappear.

343
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:19,559
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

344
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:26,519
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

345
00:46:28,279 --> 00:46:35,279
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

346
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:41,999
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

347
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,399
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

348
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,719
Why? Why do they have to?

349
00:46:55,399 --> 00:47:01,679
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

350
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:07,919
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

351
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,159
People like him ruin things.

352
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,839
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

353
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:31,079
Because I can.

354
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:18,919
Bloody hell.

355
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,199
- Here's my car.
- Do you think it's him?

356
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,239
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

357
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:04,599
- He wouldn't use his own car.
- Nice car.

358
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:09,799
- Is the Swedish police paid well?
- No, the same as in Denmark.

359
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:15,519
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

360
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:20,679
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

361
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,759
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

362
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:30,919
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbé's latest column.

363
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:36,079
- The one that's a good writer?
- No, I said he's entertaining.

364
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,759
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

365
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,679
Hello? What's going on?

366
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:39,079
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
- A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

367
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:43,239
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

368
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:49,359
- Is the guy trying to kill himself?
- I don't think he was involved.

369
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:54,679
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

370
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,759
Help! Help!

371
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,319
- Take it easy.
- Please help me!

372
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,959
- Help me! Get me out!
- Calm down.

373
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,119
- Help me!
- The windshield is wired in.

374
00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:51,079
The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.

375
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:56,799
The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.

376
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:07,359
We've got his contact details.

377
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,519
- What's going on?
- My mobile!

378
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:33,479
- Yes?
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

379
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:39,119
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

380
00:52:40,279 --> 00:52:43,519
- What?
- Were you on the Öresund Bridge?

381
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,959
I was working.
I was here all the time.

382
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:53,439
- How will you get me out?
- I don't know, that's not my job.

383
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,879
- Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
- Who?

384
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:01,599
Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?

385
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:07,119
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

386
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:10,439
- Hello?
- I'm talking to the bomb guy.

387
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:13,679
Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.

388
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,639
- Have you written about her?
- No, I don't know.

389
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:24,119
- Have you been tipped off about her?
- No! What is this?

390
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:26,919
Get me out! Please!

391
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,559
Does anyone else
have a key to your car?

392
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:37,319
- No, I don't know.
- Can you reach it?

393
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:40,999
I don't want to die. Please.

394
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,279
- I don't want it to end like this.
- Daniel? You need to talk to me.

395
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:56,599
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

396
00:53:57,439 --> 00:54:03,759
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

397
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:09,439
Come one, hurry up.

398
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,639
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

399
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:23,399
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

400
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:41,999
You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?

401
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:45,879
Is it a big bomb?

402
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:54,279
- I think so.
- You're not religious, right?

403
00:54:54,439 --> 00:54:57,119
You're an atheist?

404
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:03,359
Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.

405
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:13,479
- Are you sure?
- Don't look at the clock. Listen.

406
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:19,239
Do you know how come your car
was used to dump two bodies?

407
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:25,199
- No.
- Think about it. Focus.

408
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:30,879
- Who did this to you?
- I've slagged so many people off.

409
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:47,759
Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?

410
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:17,239
It's clean.

411
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:29,479
Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.

412
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:32,759
I assume I have your attention now.

413
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:39,319
Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.

414
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,799
I would like to
point out five in particular.

415
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:49,439
This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.
