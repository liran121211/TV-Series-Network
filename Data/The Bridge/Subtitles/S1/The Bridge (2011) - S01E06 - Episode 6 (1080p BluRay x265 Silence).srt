00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,079
SUMMARY

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,079
- Daniel Ferbé.
- A miserable front page.

3
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:17,679
I'm trying to make people
aware of problems.

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:25,279
T.T. is responsible. He's criticizing
the cuts to psychiatric programs.

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,919
You can't decide
whether you're going to talk or not.

6
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,119
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Stop defending him!

7
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:37,599
There! She sees the officer
and turns around.

8
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,199
Is that Jönsson's lodger?
I want to talk about Anja.

9
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,879
The guy that told you to kill,
has done this. And this.

10
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,639
And this. He'll do it to Anja-

11
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,399
- if we don't find her.
Do you want that?

12
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,639
It's him, she saw him.
We have to find her.

13
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:20,439
Stefan? I saw you,
so please open the door.

14
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,759
- What did he say?
- Nothing, but something's wrong.

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,199
If I'm sentenced, I'll lose my job.

16
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,599
The police officers were acquitted.
There were protests.

17
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,119
In a trial last year-

18
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:43,199
- four immigrants were found guilty
without proof of who did what.

19
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:50,079
- We have to take action.
- What are you up to? Stay here.

20
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,639
EPISODE 6

21
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,599
Henning?

22
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,359
Henning?

23
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,839
Are you out here?

24
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:14,239
THE BRIDGE

25
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,879
- Good morning.
- Good night. I'm going to bed.

26
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,159
Have you only just come home,
or are you leaving?

27
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,319
I'm leaving.

28
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,359
- Can you help out around the house?
- With what?

29
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,279
All that needs doing
when the others get home.

30
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,919
- She's never asked for help.
- She shouldn't have to.

31
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,079
- Will you see Saga today?
- Yes.

32
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:58,559
- Do you have fun together?
- Fun?

33
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,919
She's a really good police officer,
but fun...

34
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:16,999
Well, yes. We have fun,
but she's very different.

35
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:21,039
- In what way?
- In every way.

36
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,519
Is she single?

37
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,239
- What?
- I'm just asking.

38
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,839
- What are you asking?
- Is she single?

39
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:51,839
Yes. I don't know what type of person
that could stand to be with her.

40
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,239
See you later.

41
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:17,399
Sorry to disturb you,
but I'm very worried.

42
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:21,319
Someone could be after revenge.
You hear about gangs.

43
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,439
There's nothing in the apartment
that indicates that.

44
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:32,559
It's just that he's
never disappeared before.

45
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,759
He probably needed some time alone.
The trial was strenuous.

46
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,559
I'll ask around. I'll call you
as soon as I know something.

47
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:46,839
Good, thank you.
Maybe he's home already?

48
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,119
He must be wondering where I am.

49
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,319
- Thank you for your time.
- Don't mention it.

50
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,519
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

51
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,879
- Hi. Where have you been?
- The cemetery.

52
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,519
- Why?
- My sister's there.

53
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,799
How did he know
that we were looking for Anja?

54
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,199
Only we knew
why we were looking for her.

55
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:37,159
- Do you think we have a leak?
- I don't know.

56
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,079
- How similar are they?
- Very.

57
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,399
- No.
- Yes. He keeps popping up.

58
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,999
He didn't leave the apartment
when Anja was shot.

59
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,719
He'll only reveal
what he wants us to see.

60
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,879
- It's not enough.
- Let's add to it, then. Come on.

61
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,199
We need a search warrant.

62
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,239
- Will I be arrested for breaking in?
- No, but we need a search warrant.

63
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:23,759
Be a law-abiding Swede
and get one, then.

64
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:57,759
- Did you change your mind?
- The public prosecutor approved it.

65
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,279
- Where do you want to start?
- In the kitchen, you do the bedroom.

66
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Saga? I'm in the bedroom.

67
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:36,199
It's like a Red Cross warehouse.
Or maybe he likes to play doctor?

68
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:43,719
An identical one
was used to drain Bjørn's blood.

69
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:52,919
- None of this will be sent to Africa.
- It's still not enough.

70
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,719
Are there any dressings?

71
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,559
Thanks.

72
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,799
You're late.

73
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,919
- What did you do last night?
- Nothing. I was out.

74
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,759
- Until four o'clock?
- I was out.

75
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,039
- Were Yassir and the others there?
- Yes.

76
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:48,039
Listen. Stay out late,
and go wherever you want to.

77
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,199
As long as there are no calls from
the emergency room or the police.

78
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:59,959
Do you get it?
Do we have an agreement?

79
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,759
There was a letter by the door.

80
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:24,559
- Did you see who put it there?
- No.

81
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,279
- What's in it?
- Nothing.

82
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,799
- What'll you do afterwards?
- Later today, you mean?

83
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,079
No, when this is over.
When the calls stop.

84
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:49,039
You'll just be a regular reporter.

85
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,799
- That'll never happen.
- It won't?

86
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,439
I'll always be the guy that was
the link to our worst killer ever.

87
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:01,319
- People forget.
- Not if you remind them.

88
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:05,879
I'm going to write a book.
Maybe two or three.

89
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:15,559
- Why do you ask?
- You look beat.

90
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:19,359
I care, is that so strange?

91
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,319
- Yes.
- That's just how it is.

92
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,359
The police arrested someone,
it could be him.

93
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,119
- They found someone?
- A social worker.

94
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,199
- Who is he?
- I'm not the one you're looking for.

95
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:40,759
What do you need
the medical equipment for?

96
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,519
- Have you been in my apartment?
- Yes.

97
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,439
It's useful. People get hurt.

98
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:55,599
- Do people around you get hurt?
- No, but what if they did?

99
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:03,679
- Do you know who this is?
- Should I know?

100
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,839
Where were you
from ten until midnight yesterday?

101
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,399
- I was at home watching TV.
- What did you watch?

102
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,439
I was flicking the channels.

103
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:21,639
- Can't you name a specific program?
- No, I can't remember.

104
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,439
- Do you speak Danish?
- No. I'm not your guy.

105
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:36,039
This wine is from a crime scene,
this is from your apartment.

106
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,759
It's the same type of wine.

107
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,719
So I see.

108
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,199
- How did the blood get there?
- What blood?

109
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,199
- We have to take a blood sample.
- Of course.

110
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,839
- Can I leave afterwards?
- No.

111
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:12,479
- There you are. Bye, see you soon.
- Yes. Bye.

112
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,279
CLOSED

113
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,719
What's going on?

114
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,919
What's going on? What?
What do you want?

115
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:46,479
- The thing with your brother...
- Don't talk about him.

116
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,959
I can explain.

117
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:54,159
- Your brother...
- Don't talk about my brother!

118
00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:00,679
- Listen to me.
- What are you doing down here?

119
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,479
What are you talking about?

120
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,599
Haven't you put me here?
Help me get these off.

121
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:14,359
- Can you help me get these off?
- Help you?

122
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,999
Help me. We'll sort out
the thing with your brother.

123
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,959
When we get out of here
we'll explain the whole thing.

124
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:28,119
- We'll explain the whole thing?
- Listen, I didn't do it.

125
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,919
I'm sorry about your brother.
You won't get your brother back.

126
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,159
No, I won't. That's just it,
I won't get my brother back!

127
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:45,599
- When did your sister die?
- Fifteen years ago.

128
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,999
- Older?
- Younger than me. She was fourteen.

129
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:53,519
- Just like Anja.
- Yes.

130
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,479
- Why did she die?
- She killed herself.

131
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,399
- Were you close?
- I guess so, she lived with me.

132
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,519
- Why not with your parents?
- She didn't want to.

133
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,039
- Suicide?
- Yes. She jumped in front of a train.

134
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,679
Were there signs of depression?

135
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:33,519
I don't pick up on signs.

136
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,279
He asked to see you.

137
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:52,679
I help people.
Beyond what my job requires.

138
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,959
I help the weak
that have been let down by society.

139
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:04,039
It can be food, money, clothes,
medication, or a place to live.

140
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:08,039
- How can you afford that?
- There are many ways.

141
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:11,199
There are many ways
to fool the system.

142
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,279
- Name someone you've helped.
- I can't, you know that.

143
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:24,399
- There's a priest you can talk to.
- What about the blood?

144
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,439
Well...
I can only think of one thing.

145
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,399
A refugee was at my place,
he was being expelled.

146
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,879
He cut himself severely.
I dressed the wound.

147
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:46,079
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

148
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,239
- Any news about the blood?
- It doesn't match the victims'.

149
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:11,919
- Is there another victim?
- No, he would never kill in his home.

150
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,559
- I don't believe there was a refugee.
- Stefan isn't our guy.

151
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:22,479
The priest confirms
that they've worked with refugees.

152
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:28,839
- The perpetrator cares about society.
- No, that's just a diversion.

153
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:33,759
- Should we spend time on Lindberg?
- No.

154
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,639
- I'll request his release.
- Wait a little.

155
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,279
I want to talk to Daniel Ferbé first.

156
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,799
I need your help, Gry. Come on.

157
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,119
If you object to people being named,
discuss it with my boss.

158
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,319
- It's not him.
- What?

159
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:06,479
Stefan Lindberg isn't our guy.
He'll soon be released.

160
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:13,119
- Have you gone public with that?
- No, you can have the exclusive.

161
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,279
- Why?
- It's useful to the investigation.

162
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:22,599
You can quote anonymous sources.
Add that he doesn't speak Danish.

163
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,319
- Doesn't Stefan speak Danish?
- No.

164
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:33,079
- Well?
- What do you want?

165
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:37,799
Write that we were wrong.

166
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,879
I'm giving you this
because Saga likes your writing.

167
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:56,319
Daniel. Bloody hell!

168
00:20:56,479 --> 00:21:02,039
I'm really sorry.
There's a bathroom out there.

169
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,719
- Are you all right?
- It looks as if I've wet myself.

170
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:38,799
Yes, it does.
I think it'll wash off. Now then...

171
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:44,319
- When will you go public?
- How much time do you need?

172
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:47,759
- An hour.
- You can have two.

173
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,359
- What's that?
- Daniel's SIM card.

174
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,879
- How did you get hold of it?
- I grabbed it.

175
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,639
- Did he give it to you?
- Not exactly.

176
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,399
You can talk to the killer.

177
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,159
- That's misconduct.
- So you don't want it?

178
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:21,839
He's published something new.

179
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:34,919
- Why just Henning, not the others?
- I don't know.

180
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,919
Have you seen it?
Has he got Henning?

181
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,919
I'm afraid so. His wife was here,
he disappeared in the night.

182
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,679
- We'll move in.
- There'll be riots.

183
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,599
- Have you got any better ideas?
- No.

184
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:29,559
- Saif? Why did you close the store?
- I had to fix something.

185
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:33,719
One of the police officers
has been kidnapped.

186
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:38,599
- They think he's here at Nørrebro.
- OK.

187
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:49,639
- There'll be riots out here.
- Hello, it's Saif. Can we meet up?

188
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,359
- Has something happened?
- I can't talk now.

189
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,159
- Have you heard about the cop?
- That's what I want to talk about.

190
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,639
- Come on over, I'm in the square.
- OK.

191
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:16,639
- Hi, Daniel. Beers tonight?
- No, he'll call you later.

192
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:33,319
- It's No One.
- No, this is Saga Norén.

193
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,679
- Hello?
- Yes.

194
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,319
Why not talk to us directly?

195
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,359
- Hello, are you still there?
- Yes.

196
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,639
- What do you want to talk about?
- Why couldn't Anja live?

197
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,279
How did you know
that we were looking for her? Hello?

198
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,559
- Daniel?
- I'll skip lunch.

199
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:07,599
It's for you. It's for you.

200
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,959
- Daniel Ferbé.
- What are you up to?

201
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,679
- I wonder what you're up to.
- Nothing.

202
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,599
Why do the police
answer your phone?

203
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,319
- Why would they do that?
- Saga Norén answered your mobile.

204
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:32,079
I've got it right here.

205
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,759
I don't... Bloody hell.

206
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,159
The Danish guy took my SIM card.

207
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:51,719
We're aware of it now.
Let's carry on working together.

208
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,239
Immigrants receive tougher sentences.
Ban of burkas - a matter of time.

209
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:12,599
A stricter immigration act.
Nationalist parties join forces.

210
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,679
The police arrested the wrong man

211
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,359
- Hello?
- You've got something that's mine.

212
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:25,119
- I was just reading your article.
- I didn't expect that move you made.

213
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,439
- No, me neither.
- My boss would have blown her top.

214
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,839
She takes protection of sources
quite seriously.

215
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,119
She would have attacked
the entire police force.

216
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:43,439
I'll do you a favour,
I won't say anything.

217
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,399
- But you'll owe me one.
- OK.

218
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,279
- Send it over, I'm expecting a call.
- Lots of people have called.

219
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:54,799
- Did you make a note of their names?
- No.

220
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:57,079
I heard from him.

221
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:01,199
He called the office.
I've sent you everything.

222
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:12,959
- Hey, what's up?
- Have you seen Yassir? See you.

223
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,079
- Hi, Yassir!
- There you are, where did you go?

224
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:32,679
- I have something to show you.
- Not now, come on.

225
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:39,319
What? What?
He's at my place, the bloody cop.

226
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:45,959
- He's in the basement.
- Are you serious?

227
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,279
- Will you help me?
- Of course, but let's go.

228
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,839
OK. You're not our guy,
but you've done something.

229
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:31,959
I've compared the blood
to all the bodies this week.

230
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,999
I'll find out whose blood it is
and catch you.

231
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,959
The police have arrested 17 people.

232
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,679
Three officers
have been injured in the riots.

233
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,439
Henning Tholstrup
hasn't been found yet.

234
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:05,239
We know what the fourth problem is:
Integration has failed.

235
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:10,159
- He says that we've failed.
- We don't want to succeed.

236
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:17,479
"Those in power will always be
unwilling to share their power."

237
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:21,399
Here's the acquittal
of your colleagues.

238
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,919
Statistics show that immigrants
receive longer sentences.

239
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:33,199
Pia Kærsgård, crime statistics,
and The Sweden Democrats.

240
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,679
- It's all here.
- It doesn't matter, it's personal.

241
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,039
It's all about Henning,
like the other cases.

242
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:47,679
He tells the police where Henning is.
He's supposed to die.

243
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:54,679
He helps the gang find him.
Where does the victim's family live?

244
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:15,239
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
This is Martin Rohde.

245
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:19,559
- Do you know where Saif is?
- No.

246
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:24,999
- A police officer disappeared.
- It's got nothing to do with my son.

247
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,399
- How do you know?
- Because he's my son.

248
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,439
Violence and vengeance
isn't tied to genetics.

249
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,119
- What's in here?
- The staircase.

250
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,199
It leads up to our apartment
and down to the basement.

251
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:45,319
Fuck!

252
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:00,679
Stop it. Stop it.

253
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,479
Be quiet. Shut up!

254
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,639
Shut your mouth.

255
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,479
- What's in here?
- A boiler room.

256
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:28,599
The others aren't ours.
They're all locked.

257
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,719
I haven't got the keys.

258
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,479
I think we're done here.

259
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:10,679
He wants Henning to die.
Focus our assets where the gang is.

260
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,119
- There's nothing more for us to do.
- You can always do more.

261
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:24,759
Would you like to talk about it?
Your sister.

262
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,199
- What would you like to know?
- Nothing.

263
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,079
That wasn't why I brought it up.
If you need to talk...

264
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:37,159
- Why would I need to?
- You didn't save Anja.

265
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:42,079
She was your sister's age.
It might have upset you.

266
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:46,519
I miss her sometimes, but she's gone.

267
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:55,639
- So you're all right?
- Yes.

268
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,679
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

269
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:27,399
- Saga Norén.
- You're working late.

270
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,919
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

271
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,559
So now you want to talk?

272
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:45,719
Were you surprised
when I answered Daniel's phone?

273
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,879
- You want to be in charge.
- You talk as if you know me.

274
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,799
- I understand you.
- It takes one to know one.

275
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:59,319
How did you know about Anja?

276
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,719
- I'm going to find you.
- Perhaps.

277
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:11,479
Do you still want to know
how I knew about Anja?

278
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,959
Do you feel responsible
for her death?

279
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:22,359
- There was nothing I could do.
- It's horrible to Feel inadequate.

280
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:31,399
- How did you know?
- You ought to know.

281
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,039
Me personally
or me as part of the investigation?

282
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,959
You're clever,
I'm sure it'll come to you.

283
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,239
Hello?

284
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:08,439
Are you awake?

285
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:18,239
- Why were you with that Charlotte?
- To interview her.

286
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:24,839
- I keep thinking about your wallet.
- My wallet.

287
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:35,199
Yesterday it fell out of your pocket
when you took your pants off.

288
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,959
- Did you use her bathroom?
- I don't know. I can't remember.

289
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,479
- You can't remember?
- Well, yes...

290
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,759
I did use her bathroom.

291
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,119
Have you slept with her?

292
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:11,239
I don't know why. Maybe it had
something to do with the operation.

293
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:17,719
- I had to prove something to myself.
- Prove something?

294
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:23,759
Yes. Is there something wrong,
can I still do it, or...?

295
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,679
Is my manhood affected?
I really don't know.

296
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,719
- You got me pregnant not long ago.
- Yes, I know.

297
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:41,199
- Isn't that proof enough?
- I don't know what to say.

298
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,999
Don't say anything.
Get up and pack your bags.

299
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,639
Leave, I don't want to look at you.

300
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:39,399
Saga Norén.

301
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,959
What do you want?

302
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,559
Thirsty?

303
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,159
Let me go, I'll tell them everything.
There'll be a new trial.

304
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,439
Bo did it. It was Bo and Luffe.
I'll tell them everything.

305
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,239
- It's too late now.
- I can testify. You'll get justice.

306
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:44,519
- I'm telling you, it's too late.
- No, there'll be a new trial.

307
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:49,839
- Listen...
- Shut up!

308
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,239
Last night's riots are subsiding.
They were massive.

309
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:36,239
Many are injured.
Cars and containers were torched.

310
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:40,919
The police officer Henning Tholstrup
has not been found.

311
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:45,599
- You're up early.
- I couldn't sleep.

312
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:48,079
Me neither.

313
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,319
- Why?
- I had a dream.

314
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:55,399
I was with your brother.

315
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:00,559
We met the police officers.
They started hitting him.

316
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:06,159
There was nothing I could do.
I just watched.

317
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:11,559
They left him there.
I turned him over.

318
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:15,999
It wasn't him anymore.
He had your face.

319
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:21,439
My face?
Was there any blood in your dream?

320
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,519
- No.
- There wasn't.

321
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,319
Then it was just a silly dream.
Don't think about it.

322
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,959
- Why are you giving me that?
- Rats need to eat as well.

323
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:10,279
- Don't they?
- What's this? What are you doing?

324
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:15,599
- Saif? What's he doing here?
- Just listen...

325
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:19,159
- I found him here.
- You found him?

326
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:24,279
We can have a whole new trial.
We'll fix this. I promise.

327
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:30,999
What? You and your colleagues
have caused so much pain.

328
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:36,159
I can testify.
If I testify, it'll work out.

329
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,279
Work out? How can it work out?

330
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,919
I lost my son.

331
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,999
- Can you get me my son back?
- No, I can't. Let me go.

332
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:50,839
- We'll work this out.
- No, you don't get it!

333
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:54,679
You should have
told the truth in court!

334
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:58,999
You killed my son!
He's not coming back!

335
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,519
Let go of him, father.

336
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:06,159
Take it easy. Easy.

337
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:15,279
Help him.

338
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:04,879
- Saga Norén.
- It's Martin.

339
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:08,399
- What do you want?
- Let me in.

340
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:20,559
I thought you might like some coffee,
so I brought croissants.

341
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:24,919
- Are there enough for August as well?
- Who's August?

342
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,519
- August.
- My August?

343
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,159
- I've borrowed one of your towels.
- That's OK.

344
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:38,279
What the hell are you doing here?

345
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,599
- What does it look like?
- He slept over.

346
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:51,239
I'll wait by the car.

347
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,919
What the hell is this?
Saga's my colleague, you're my son.

348
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:06,599
- I do as I please.
- No, you don't.

349
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:10,079
If you live in my house,
you follow my rules.

350
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,879
I don't know what your rules are.
You were never there.

351
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:20,119
Is this your revenge
because I was a bad father?

352
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:22,959
Not everything is about you.

353
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:26,599
Why Saga?

354
00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:31,159
- Are you jealous, or what?
- Shut up.

355
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,679
- Are you going home?
- No.

356
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:44,399
- You can make your own way back.
- That's really mature of you...

357
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,959
- Hi, Lillian.
- Martin.

358
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,439
- We've found Henning. He's dead.
- Bloody hell.

359
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:14,999
What's wrong?

360
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:24,079
- You and my son are wrong.
- He's 18, he doesn't need permission.

361
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:33,519
- You just can't do that.
- Why not?

362
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:43,479
- You might be a bit odd, but still...
- Why is it such a problem?

363
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:46,919
We won't mention it again.

364
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:52,559
I don't want to hear about it.
Don't say anything at all just now.

365
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:09,279
You found him, hid him, released him,
and watched him get shot?

366
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,079
- Yes.
- By a police officer.

367
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:16,999
- What did he look like?
- I can't remember.

368
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:23,279
- How tall was he? What build?
- I can't remember.

369
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:28,999
You must remember something
about him. Try again.

370
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,439
- What?
- I got a letter with a key in it.

371
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:41,279
- Where's the key how?
- Here.

372
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,239
- Have you got anything else?
- Not really.

373
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:57,679
- What is it?
- It's just typical.

374
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,399
You must know what I mean.
My brother was killed.

375
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,719
I asked for justice,
and you dismissed me.

376
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,799
When one of your own is killed,
it's a completely different matter.

377
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:16,319
You run around
and turn the earth upside-down.

378
00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:21,879
- The Danish police operate that way.
- Can you shut up? Shut up!

379
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:24,759
What does he look like?

380
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:29,319
- The colour of his eyes and hair?
- He looked like a cop.

381
00:51:41,759 --> 00:51:44,479
Was he as tall as Martin?

382
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:51,719
OK.

383
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:02,479
He was in uniform. He was as tall
as Martin, maybe a bit taller.

384
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,839
He was of slender build.

385
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:11,359
- That's all I know.
- OK.

386
00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:22,279
Daniel?

387
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:36,399
- How did you know where I was?
- I read the police reports.

388
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:44,399
Young man, overdose, your local club.
And you didn't show up at work.

389
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,239
You don't have to be Einstein
to understand.

390
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:53,239
- That must have been a highlight.
- It wasn't, actually.

391
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:59,879
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK.

392
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:07,759
- I slept the whole time.
- You haven't heard what happened.

393
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:12,959
Henning Tholstrup
was shot this morning.

394
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:18,319
I'm going to work.
I'll drive you home first.

395
00:53:22,919 --> 00:53:25,479
I died in the night.

396
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:30,839
I was lifeless for
two minutes and thirty-three seconds.

397
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:40,199
- I didn't see a tunnel or a light.
- I'll drive you home.

398
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,199
There was only darkness, Åke.

399
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,159
Complete darkness.

400
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:57,479
The preliminary examination
confirms that Henning was there.

401
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:00,879
Had Saif told us,
Henning would have been alive.

402
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,719
He didn't have much faith
in the police.

403
00:55:04,879 --> 00:55:08,519
Maybe he dragged Henning out
and killed him.

404
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:13,199
- He made up a story.
- There was no gun residue.

405
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:18,479
Maybe it was a gang member.

406
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:23,479
There were no traces.
That sounds like our perpetrator.

407
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,039
- What do you think, Saga?
- It's him.

408
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:32,319
It was risky to let someone else
kill Henning, so he stayed close.

409
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:36,119
- But why Henning?
- I don't know.

410
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:38,879
There's a link between the victims.

411
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:46,999
Yes? Thank you.
We've found the car.

412
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:31,439
- The car's from Helsingør.
- OK.

413
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,999
Saif saw him leave in a police car.

414
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:41,319
It was stolen for 24 hours,
but there are no traces.

415
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,599
- Maybe it's not stolen.
- What do you mean?

416
00:56:52,279 --> 00:56:57,519
What if he's one of us?
What if he's a police officer?
