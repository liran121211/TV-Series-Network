00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,079
SUMMARY

2
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:11,119
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- We're through with each other.

3
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:20,799
One fire saves one child.
All can survive.

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,039
- "Thanks for helping out."
- Get him out now.

5
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:33,239
I didn't sleep with your son, Martin.
August and I didn't have sex.

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,239
- You have no job. What's your plan?
- Not to have a plan.

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,759
- I'm pregnant.
- Come here.

8
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:46,519
Did you sleep with
Charlotte Söringer? How was it?

9
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,879
Do you need to sort your life out?
I'm sorry. That's too personal.

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,839
I love you, Mette.

11
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,799
- Have you always lived alone?
- I'm no good as a girlfriend.

12
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,519
You can't know without trying.

13
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,599
I'm Emil.

14
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,799
If he's a police officer,
it explains a lot.

15
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,439
He's got riot gear. He took
a police car and no one noticed.

16
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,519
The stun gun was stolen
from a police office.

17
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:27,839
Did you see
who left the bottles of wine?

18
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:32,359
- Look at the pictures.
- Sonja, Sonja.

19
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,079
EPISODE 8

20
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,479
- Mind the traffic next time.
- Yes.

21
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,639
- Why did he kill Daniel?
- He doesn't need him anymore.

22
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,759
That's not enough. Kerstin, Monique,
Emil, Henning, Bjørn, and Daniel.

23
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,399
There has to be a connection.

24
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:19,719
- Hi.
- Jesper Andersson is in. We're ready.

25
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,439
- Hi.
- Hi, Jesper.

26
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,239
Lie down! Lie down!

27
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:58,119
THE BRIDGE

28
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,999
- Is this why I'm here?
- Why did you think?

29
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,839
I don't know, but I know
what happened at these times.

30
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:22,319
- You were there.
- I'm in the police.

31
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,439
I know what you're working on.

32
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,759
Do you need DNA or fingerprints?

33
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,519
- I'll agree to anything.
- Fill in the form.

34
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,359
- Check Jesper Andersson's alibi.
- I'll do it right away.

35
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,639
Double check. If he's our guy,
it'll seem to be in order.

36
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,679
Have John check
Daniel Ferbé's computer.

37
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,199
- "If he's..." Are you unsure?
- We mustn't lose our objectivity.

38
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:01,959
I had a closer look
at Jesper Andersson.

39
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:05,719
Two colleagues were shot.
He saw a psychologist.

40
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,599
- Emil Fernskog.
- He took him out of active service.

41
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,399
Look for a link to the other victims.
We'll try to get his medical records.

42
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:20,879
Are you ready? Come on.

43
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,479
Is Mette OK with
you staying at my place?

44
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,999
- She doesn't think we'll have sex?
- Hell, no. You're not my type.

45
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,959
Have you got a type?
Charlotte and Mette are dissimilar.

46
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:41,039
- Will you get a divorce?
- No, it'll work out.

47
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,039
- Have you worked it out before?
- Yes.

48
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,999
So you've cheated before?

49
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,159
- What the hell are you up to?
- I'm chatting.

50
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:58,839
- As colleagues do.
- Don't. You're no good at it.

51
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,959
- Am I annoying you now?
- No.

52
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:05,679
- Sometimes I do?
- Yes, you can be very annoying.

53
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,879
- More than others?
- Much more.

54
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,319
Why do you ask? You don't care
what people think of you.

55
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,399
No, it's important
what you think of me.

56
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,159
- Does Mette cheat as well?
- No.

57
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,439
In unhappy relationships both
often seek happiness elsewhere.

58
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,639
- We're not unhappy!
- Then why do you cheat?

59
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:39,479
- Do you really care what I think?
- Yes.

60
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,359
Then give it a rest. Thank you.

61
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,519
- Hi.
- Hi.

62
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,559
I've hardly slept since it happened.

63
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:09,799
I keep picturing all the blood,
the guy and the sword.

64
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,399
- How can I work here?
- We want some medical records.

65
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,319
He doesn't have any.
It was his first appointment.

66
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,519
Not Lars Jönsson,
but Jesper Andersson.

67
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:29,199
- I don't recognize the name.
- It's been a couple of years.

68
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,839
Jesper Andersson stopped
seeing Emil five years ago.

69
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,839
- Before my time here.
- We want his records.

70
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,719
- I can't give them to you.
- Yes, you can.

71
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,439
The privilege is waived if a crime
has a minimum sentence of a year.

72
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,359
A medical secretary must know that.

73
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,799
- You still don't think it's him?
- I didn't say that.

74
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,479
- You don't want to be overly sure?
- I want to be sure when I'm sure.

75
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,279
If it's him, he knows we don't have
DNA or fingerprints. There's no risk.

76
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,479
There are links to Emil and Henning,
two of the victims.

77
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,199
- That leaves three.
- He might have met Ekwall.

78
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:39,399
Andersson is on his way back.
His lawyer's coming.

79
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:46,399
A lawyer? The perpetrator's
in control. Everything's succeeded.

80
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,639
- Why would he need help?
- We're really clever.

81
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,639
Not the way he sees it.

82
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,919
Why would he kill homeless people,
a politician, a prostitute-

83
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,759
- manipulate schizophrenics,
and threaten children?

84
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,199
Tell us about
when your colleagues died.

85
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:08,479
That's OK, I'm happy to tell you.

86
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,679
It was a bilateral operation
against a motorcycle gang.

87
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,239
We'd surrounded the building
and were waiting for the go-ahead.

88
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,319
The Danish hadn't secured
the building across the road.

89
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,679
Well, we were fired at.

90
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,799
Two of my colleagues died.

91
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,919
You blame the Danish officers
for the deaths. They messed up.

92
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,159
- They should have died instead.
- No, I've never said that.

93
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:44,319
You said it to your psychologist
on 23rd August.

94
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:48,799
That was less than a month
after the shooting.

95
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,639
Jesper saw a psychologist
to deal with such thoughts.

96
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,999
- So you were transferred.
- Yes. It was the right decision.

97
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,079
- You didn't think so back then.
- No, but I do now. With hindsight.

98
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:06,039
With hindsight,
how do you feel about your divorce?

99
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:16,759
I can see why Maria couldn't take it.
I was angry and hateful.

100
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,559
I turned selfish and mean.

101
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:24,799
And now you're a middle-aged man
in touch with yourself.

102
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,679
- Do you live with anyone?
- No.

103
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,279
- Why not?
- Is there a point to all of this?

104
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:37,679
Henning Tholstrup was one of those
that didn't secure the building.

105
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,199
And he was acquitted for negligence
a week ago in Copenhagen.

106
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:47,439
- I know, I was there.
- Then you also know...!

107
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:57,999
Then you also know that Henning
was shot and killed the other day.

108
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,119
You commented the verdict on TV.

109
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:09,359
- In Danish.
- Yes, I'm bilingual. It's useful.

110
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,159
You said we're not
equal before the law.

111
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,599
As illustrated
by the killer's first victims.

112
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,679
- Don't you think it's a problem?
- Yes.

113
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,719
A number of editorial writers
wrote the same thing.

114
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,079
Are they here as well? Then I assume
you've got something else.

115
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,719
Like a motive or a piece of evidence.

116
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,919
Three alibis have been confirmed.

117
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,719
When Kerstin Ekwall was abducted,
he was at a meeting in Copenhagen.

118
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,159
The poisoned wine was left outside
while he was at a youth club.

119
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,999
Staff and youngsters confirm it.

120
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,359
The morning Bjørn was abducted
he worked at a school.

121
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,159
We don't know exactly when Bjørn
was taken. Jesper was there at 7:30.

122
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,999
Bjørn was left alone
just after seven.

123
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,759
Jesper worked with Lennart Fransson
during the gun amnesty in 2001.

124
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,039
We can't prove that Fransson
passed the stun gun on.

125
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,519
- And Ferbé's computer?
- We didn't find it.

126
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,159
The lock was damaged. A break-in.

127
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:32,959
- Were we too quick to arrest him?
- He matches the profile.

128
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:39,319
He focuses on a single project.
He's single. He's successful.

129
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:43,679
- He had a traumatic experience.
- We're getting nowhere.

130
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,719
One more try.

131
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,799
Sonja Lindberg identified you.
How do you explain that?

132
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,359
I don't know who she is.

133
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,719
- She's one of the poisoned homeless.
- Well, I don't know.

134
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,119
- She made a mistake.
- There were 15 photos.

135
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,399
She didn't make a mistake,
she didn't hesitate.

136
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:22,959
- She made a mistake.
- No. You know each other.

137
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:26,919
- Did she just come out of a coma?
- Yes, yesterday.

138
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,279
- Can you rely upon her?
- Her eyesight's fine.

139
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:35,319
She's been homeless
for quite a few years.

140
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:41,039
Pardon the expression,
but she's a complete nut job.

141
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,519
Jesper has an alibi
for when the wine was left.

142
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,319
I'm sure you've checked it.

143
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,679
- Hans is quitting.
- Why?

144
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:01,759
He wants to go back to Gothenburg,
closer to children and grandchildren.

145
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,439
It's one hour by plane,
three by train.

146
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:10,239
How close do you have to be? So?

147
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,439
- So you'll miss him?
- I don't know.

148
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,439
He'll be placed in custody.

149
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:23,879
- On what grounds?
- Focus on how to spend the 72 hours.

150
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,239
The prosecutor's given us three days.
No stone will be left unturned.

151
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,679
Whatever you've done, we'll find out.

152
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,639
No district court
would ever have detained you.

153
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:57,559
Isn't that what you said
about the prosecutor?

154
00:14:57,719 --> 00:15:02,639
It'll be harder to clear my name.
The press is having a field day.

155
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,519
You'll be out in 72 hours.
We'll find a way to handle the media.

156
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:22,359
Three days. They'll rip me apart.

157
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,919
If you want to tell me something,
this is a good time.

158
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,279
No. Nothing.

159
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,719
Thank you.

160
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,959
Can I use the bathroom?

161
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,839
Thanks.

162
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,879
- Hi.
- Hi.

163
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:56,639
Unlock. Unlock!

164
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,239
Get in.

165
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,479
Get back!

166
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,119
Go!

167
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:26,279
- How did he manage to escape?
- He had an inside helper.

168
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,999
He used a key card.

169
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,879
- Where did he get the weapon?
- He went to the bathroom.

170
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,679
Someone left him a weapon
in the bathroom.

171
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:44,639
Check payments, computer traffic,
calls, ex-wife, friends, and family.

172
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,279
Stop all other work.
Make sure you find that bloody car.

173
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:08,879
- Knock, knock... Am I disturbing you?
- No.

174
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,119
Or maybe a little.

175
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,959
I was going to e-mail you some info,
but I was in the neighbourhood.

176
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,799
- They're nice.
- Yes, they're for my mother.

177
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,319
Oh... right.

178
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,279
I'm just joking, they're for you.

179
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,679
- For showing up unannounced.
- Thank you.

180
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,359
- I'll fetch a vase. Coffee?
- Yes, please.

181
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,879
No blood or sign of violence.
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

182
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,399
Jesper established a foundation that
supports youth that counteract crime.

183
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,199
- What about it?
- The office is at Jesper's.

184
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,839
- There's no separate address.
- It's his foundation.

185
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:06,719
But it rents
part of a property in Frihamnen.

186
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,599
- What the hell have they been doing?
- They filmed it.

187
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:16,199
There's no computer and no camera.
Let's check the flat again.

188
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:42,879
Isn't it weird to keep
photos of your ex-wife on display?

189
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,679
I don't with any of mine.

190
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:55,119
Look at this. Look at the best man.

191
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:59,559
Kent Hammar.

192
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:04,719
Look at this. This is a few seconds
before Jesper arrives.

193
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:10,199
We thought that Kent just happened
to arrive. But look at this.

194
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:22,799
This is 45 minutes earlier.

195
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,999
- He's waiting for him.
- They're cooperating. Anne?

196
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,919
Kent Hammar's born in 1975.
He started working here in 2000.

197
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:40,639
He left Växjö and rented a room
at Jesper's. That's how they met.

198
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,439
Jesper recommended Kent
for the task force twice.

199
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,679
He failed the tests.

200
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:53,519
He was Jesper's best man. It's been
confirmed that they're close friends.

201
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,039
- They're two, so Jesper has an alibi.
- We're checking Kent's time sheet.

202
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:02,279
So we had the right guy.

203
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,959
So that's what I can offer you.
Call me if you're interested.

204
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,839
Thank you, it seems very interesting.

205
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:18,879
Thank you.
For seeing me, if nothing else.

206
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,439
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

207
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:34,279
- Hey... What's going on?
- It pinches, I've got cramps.

208
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:39,239
- Has it happened before?
- No. It's just... I'm pregnant.

209
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:45,439
OK, that settles the matter.
You're going to the hospital.

210
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,039
I've got my car downstairs. Come on.

211
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:56,199
Saga?
Kent Hammar used his credit card.

212
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,399
- Where?
- A service station. He rented a car.

213
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,919
- Do they know the number plate?
- There's a tracking device in it.

214
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,919
- You know where they are.
- Yes.

215
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:14,399
Hi, darling.
Where are you? I'll be right there.

216
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:20,119
Mette is on her way to the hospital.
She's pregnant.

217
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,439
I have to go. Good luck.

218
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,279
- Didn't he have a vasectomy?
- Yes.

219
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,599
They're in the third lane,
the third car from the front.

220
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,759
Space is tight.
There are lots of people. Let's wait.

221
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,279
I have to take a leak.

222
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:19,919
- Kent Hammar is leaving the car.
- Anne and Navid, get him.

223
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:50,279
- Jesper will wonder where he went.
- OK, let's get him.

224
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:14,479
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon!

225
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,999
Drop your weapon!

226
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:37,919
- Send an ambulance.
- He's alive. Take him to the car.

227
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,639
A man has been shot.

228
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:47,639
It's the police! Don't worry.
An ambulance is on its way.

229
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,359
Hi.

230
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,839
- How do you feel?
- It's painful.

231
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,159
- What happened?
- We'd had lunch.

232
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,199
I just collapsed. It hurts like hell.

233
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,759
- What about...?
- I don't know.

234
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,199
I'm here now. It'll work out. OK?

235
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,679
- Hi. Who are you?
- Martin, Mette's husband.

236
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:28,039
Hi, I'm Tom. I've been her doctor
the last couple of hours.

237
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:31,119
The ultrasound gave us two answers.

238
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,359
The children are fine,
and you have kidney stones.

239
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,599
- The children? As in twins?
- Yes.

240
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,799
There are two of each.
Two children, two stones.

241
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:58,359
- What do we do about the stones?
- It might be enough to drink a lot.

242
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,559
They'll pass out with the urine.
We can't crush them now.

243
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:08,239
If necessary we'll remove them
through a small pipe.

244
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,319
Drink a lot, pee, take painkillers,
and keep your fingers crossed.

245
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:20,719
- Is that OK? Good.
- Thank you.

246
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,559
Two more. How will we manage?

247
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:35,399
Can we talk when I don't have
a jabbing pain in my back?

248
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:20,479
- How old is she?
- Sixteen or seventeen, perhaps.

249
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:29,919
Jesper received a reward
for his youth work two years ago.

250
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,999
Yes, he did a good job.

251
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,879
He didn't do it to find victims.
He was trying to compensate.

252
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,679
Both take part, they're sadistic.
Jesper more so than Hammar.

253
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,319
The one we're looking for
doesn't enjoy tormenting anyone.

254
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:59,839
- They're not the ones.
- No.

255
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:02,439
- Are we absolutely sure?
- Yes.

256
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:06,719
- Back to square one.
- I'll go tell the others.

257
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:17,159
- They're not the ones.
- How do you know?

258
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:21,799
There's no link between Andersson
and the rest of the victims.

259
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:26,799
- Maybe they're linked to Hammar?
- What doesn't make sense?

260
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,279
The perpetrator operates alone.
It's risky to have a partner.

261
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:35,799
How do you know?
Sonja Lindberg identified him.

262
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:40,879
She's in the films.
They sexually abused her.

263
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,679
The case isn't over.

264
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:52,719
- Why are you still here?
- We're taking a break.

265
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,919
- Really.
- A coffee break.

266
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,959
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing, we're just chatting.

267
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,959
Really.

268
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:21,239
I got my period this morning.

269
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,079
- How is Mette?
- Better.

270
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,039
They're keeping her there
for some tests.

271
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,799
- She'll be home tonight.
- That's good.

272
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,719
- How's it gone?
- Fine. They're watching TV.

273
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:10,919
- Nikolaj's asleep.
- That's good. Thanks for helping out.

274
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:17,799
- There are sandwiches and coffee.
- Thanks.

275
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:31,399
- Will you get a divorce?
- No.

276
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,879
This is how it started with mum.
You didn't sleep at home.

277
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:48,799
I don't know whether you
didn't want to or weren't allowed.

278
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,519
I was a year younger than the twins.

279
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,719
You returned with a bike
on my tenth birthday.

280
00:36:56,879 --> 00:37:01,919
No. I was there from time to time.

281
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,639
Not that I can remember.

282
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:13,519
I kept my distance. You were angry,
your mother was angry.

283
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:19,079
Then I had Julie
and made a fresh start in life.

284
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:25,719
It felt as if I wasn't allowed
to get involved.

285
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,919
You could have let me decide.

286
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:38,359
Do you know why you didn't?
You always choose the easy way out.

287
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,999
That's just the way it is.
It's how you are.

288
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,599
So am I.

289
00:37:55,879 --> 00:38:01,559
- Did you want me there?
- Yes. For a while.

290
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:08,159
Later I didn't care about you.
I threw the bike in the canal.

291
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:12,639
- Did you?
- Yes, the following day.

292
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,599
If you really love Mette,
why do you cheat on her?

293
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,799
Because... I thought...

294
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:37,679
I thought I needed to.

295
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,159
And I wanted to prove something.

296
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,359
I wanted to be sure
that I'm with the right person.

297
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,239
- Have you worked things out?
- Yes, I have.

298
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:58,199
In some ways you're a fool.

299
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:04,959
- So why did you move here?
- To see if you still didn't care.

300
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,999
- Did you?
- You just moved on.

301
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,959
I'm glad you moved here.
I'm happy about this.

302
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,719
Yes?
I spoke to Frida about it online.

303
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:34,479
She said that I had to
talk to you about it.

304
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,679
That's a clever girl.

305
00:39:54,999 --> 00:40:00,519
Saga? Kerstin Ekwall
used to be a prosecutor.

306
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:03,399
I've checked her cases.

307
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:09,239
All that were won, lost and dropped.
One is interesting.

308
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,959
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

309
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,559
There was an accident on the bridge
in 2001. A woman and her son died.

310
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,279
A car got away.
They suspected drink-driving.

311
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:28,839
The car was reported stolen. There
was no proof that the owner drove it.

312
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:34,039
I remember.
They suspected Sixten Rockstad.

313
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,999
- Kerstin Ekwall dropped the case.
- Carry on.

314
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:45,359
The dead woman's husband was
a Danish task force police officer.

315
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,879
Yes, Saga? I'm at home.

316
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,479
You have to come.
It wasn't Jesper Andersson.

317
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,919
- We may have something.
- Mette is fine. It was kidney stones.

318
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,279
- I thought maybe you wanted to know.
- Yes, I want to know.

319
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:20,319
- When can you come?
- Now, soon, straight away.

320
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:25,319
- Was that Saga? Saga and I...
- You don't have to say anything.

321
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:28,559
She told me nothing happened.

322
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,399
- Everything's fine.
- OK.

323
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:42,319
- "OK"? You sound surprised.
- No, it's just that...

324
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:45,639
- I went to see Saga at work.
- I know.

325
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:50,919
She threw me out because you
don't want us to see each other.

326
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:58,959
- I have to go. Will you guys be OK?
- I just thought you should know.

327
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,919
Saga, there's a visitor for you.
Anton something.

328
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,439
- Hi.
- Hi. What do you want?

329
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,279
- How are you?
- Fine. What do you want?

330
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:28,759
- These are for you.
- Why?

331
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,199
We got off to a wrong start
with the sex.

332
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,719
And I want to...

333
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:47,399
- I want to rewind, get to know you.
- Why?

334
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:54,599
Because I've got a feeling
you're worth getting to know better.

335
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,519
Can we have dinner? Just dinner.

336
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,639
- No sex, you mean?
- Yes, no sex.

337
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:08,959
- Didn't you like it?
- Yes, I did. That's not it.

338
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,239
I want to see
if we can have something more.

339
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:20,199
- Hi again.
- Hi.

340
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:27,279
- Think about it.
- Think about what?

341
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,639
- Do you know who this is?
- Jens. We worked together for years.

342
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:40,239
- Was he a good police officer?
- The best. He could have gone far.

343
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,039
- What happened?
- His wife and child died.

344
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:52,319
He never got over it. He was fired
and lost absolutely everything.

345
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,159
Why are we talking about Jens?

346
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:05,199
- Could he avoid leaving traces?
- Yes, definitely.

347
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:10,279
Deepfreeze a body for a year?
Start a riot?

348
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:20,439
- It's not him.
- Kerstin Ekwall dropped the case.

349
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,959
OK, but he's dead.
He blew his head off years ago.

350
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:28,799
He's in Charlotte Söringer's files.

351
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:33,959
They evicted him in October 2004.
He threatened them.

352
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:39,719
- Gry didn't follow up, he's dead.
- She made the right call.

353
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,879
- Are you serious about this?
- Why shouldn't I be?

354
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:52,519
He's dead. He blew his head off
in his caravan. I saw him.

355
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,359
Did he literally blow his head off?

356
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:01,159
- Why?
- Was his face missing?

357
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:16,279
- A friend of Jens is taking revenge.
- After more than five years?

358
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:20,799
It was bad enough to investigate
the police, but his...

359
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:25,719
No fingerprints were checked.
No DNA either.

360
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:32,719
He was in his caravan. He'd blown his
head off. There was a suicide note.

361
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:38,359
- Isn't there an autopsy report?
- There was no autopsy.

362
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,679
- Why?
- Didn't we know the cause of death?

363
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:46,919
- Is there no autopsy after a suicide?
- This was a colleague.

364
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,279
Let the poor man rest in peace.

365
00:45:55,279 --> 00:46:00,279
- I'll take these with me.
- I spoke to August earlier.

366
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:05,079
- Did something happen between you?
- No.

367
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:11,559
Do you remember our talk with Anja's
mother? Sometimes we tell white lies.

368
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:15,199
- Is that what you're doing?
- No. Not now either.

369
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,319
You'll discover
that his wife Mikaela was Swedish.

370
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:24,919
She and the boy
were going to see her parents.

371
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,679
They were pushed against a lorry
and off the side.

372
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:35,439
The boy wasn't found. There was
no proof against Sixten Rockstad.

373
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,559
- If Jens wants revenge...
- Or someone else.

374
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,759
Why doesn't he
go after Sixten Rockstad?

375
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:59,239
Yes. Thanks for telling me.

376
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:04,999
Sixten Rockstad died in Monaco.
Probably drink-driving.

377
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,279
That's what you call poetic justice.

378
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:19,599
Jens repeatedly asked
if he could investigate the accident.

379
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:23,679
Or his colleagues, at least.
Sweden refused.

380
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:28,999
There's a report against Jens.

381
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:35,079
"...tardy, puts colleagues at risk,
unreliable..."

382
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:41,359
"...suspected substance abuse...
Relocation and psyche evaluation."

383
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,999
It's signed by a union rep.

384
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:51,279
- Do you know who it is?
- Yes. Henning Tholstrup.

385
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:34,599
Daniel looked into the accident.
He was at the same party.

386
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:40,319
- With whom?
- Sixten Rockstad, in Copenhagen.

387
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:44,879
He spoke to the staff about how much
Rockstad had to drink.

388
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,039
If he left in his car,
or if someone else did.

389
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:55,959
- Did he get anywhere?
- I don't know. He received an offer.

390
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:00,319
A good job, well-paid, free housing.
He left the same day.

391
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:05,879
- He was paid off.
- It's not unlikely in Daniel's case.

392
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:13,199
As far as I know he had
no moral scruples whatsoever.

393
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,599
- I'll miss him.
- Thanks.

394
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:28,559
Thanks for your help.

395
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:36,519
Saga? Martin?
I've read what we've got on Jens.

396
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:41,519
A psychological evaluation
advised against active service.

397
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,199
It questioned his suitability
as a police officer.

398
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,839
- The evaluation itself is lost.
- Do you remember the psychologist?

399
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:54,319
- When was it?
- In the late fall of 2003.

400
00:49:55,319 --> 00:50:01,199
In the end he wasn't with it at work.
He'd given up.

401
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,719
They referred to the evaluation
when he was dismissed.

402
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:08,559
It doesn't say who carried it out.

403
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:14,279
- What was Emil Fernskog doing?
- He had an office in Copenhagen.

404
00:50:14,439 --> 00:50:18,959
- He moved to Sweden the year after.
- Jesper Andersson saw him.

405
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,079
Had Fernskog worked with
traumatized officers before?

406
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:36,119
We've found Sonja Lindberg.
She'll be here in five minutes.

407
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,159
- Should I put these in a vase?
- Yes.

408
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:49,479
- What did Anton want?
- To take me out to dinner.

409
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:53,319
He brought flowers
and asked you out.

410
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:58,119
- Yes, isn't that strange?
- Why do you think it's strange?

411
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:05,639
Guys ask girls out when they want to
have sex. We're already having sex.

412
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:09,559
- Isn't that the case?
- No. Well, yes, sometimes.

413
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,639
- What are you going to do?
- When Sonja Lindberg...

414
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:16,799
- With Anton.
- I don't know.

415
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:22,199
- Have dinner. He likes you.
- He doesn't know me.

416
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:26,079
No, he doesn't.

417
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:37,799
Do you know who this is?

418
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,839
He was like a brother to me.
Stefan saved me.

419
00:51:55,359 --> 00:52:01,039
- Stefan... my brother... is coming.
- Yes.

420
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,879
- I'll wait for him where I live now.
- Jens?

421
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:09,919
This guy. What did he save you from?

422
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:16,239
Someone took my stuff.
He kept doing it.

423
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,839
He took my stuff.
He told him to stop.

424
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:27,239
- He hit him.
- Jens hit the guy that took stuff.

425
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:32,359
But... he was beaten up later.

426
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:36,319
Badly, much worse than I was.
All the time.

427
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:44,159
- What was the guy called?
- His name was Bjørn. It means bear.

428
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:51,919
Him?

429
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:02,519
He hit him. He hit everyone.

430
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,159
Thank you. You've really helped us.

431
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:13,519
- When is my brother coming?
- I'm afraid we don't know.

432
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,359
Go ahead.

433
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:41,359
Do you want a name? The companies
that were torched are part of Pica.

434
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,879
- Who's the chairperson? Martin?
- I have no idea.

435
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:49,679
Ida Rockstad,
Sixten Rockstad's mother.

436
00:53:57,439 --> 00:54:03,119
- I spoke to my father.
- Did it go well?

437
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:10,479
- Better than expected.
- Did you stir his conscience?

438
00:54:13,479 --> 00:54:16,719
Not really. It was good.
Thanks for suggesting it.

439
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,679
Thank me by taking me to dinner.

440
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:31,199
- Deal! Where and when?
- It'll be somewhere expensive.

441
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:49,679
I thought you were asleep.
I checked on the children and stayed.

442
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:59,399
Are you OK?

443
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,759
- Do you remember Jens?
- Yes, what about him?

444
00:55:13,879 --> 00:55:19,439
- Saga thinks he's alive.
- He can't be.

445
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:26,439
It might sound insane,
but the investigation points to him.

446
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:42,639
- Well, I'll leave now.
- You can stay.

447
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,439
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

448
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:58,879
I thought I would lose the children,
and I was almost relieved.

449
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:04,439
I'm not sure
I want more children with you.

450
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:09,079
It felt as if I didn't
have to make a decision.

451
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:15,879
- Can we get by with more children?
- If our relationship gets by.

452
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,199
Can we get by?

453
00:56:38,919 --> 00:56:43,999
We should publish that photo.
Let's paste it on every wall.

454
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,239
It wouldn't help. He's probably
changed his appearance.

455
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:53,719
- Do you know what's worse?
- No. What?

456
00:56:53,879 --> 00:56:58,759
He staged his suicide five years ago.
He's planned this longer.

457
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,079
Would gassing Daniel Ferbé
be the end?

458
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:05,559
Why not?

459
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:12,239
It's not enough. He's not done.
