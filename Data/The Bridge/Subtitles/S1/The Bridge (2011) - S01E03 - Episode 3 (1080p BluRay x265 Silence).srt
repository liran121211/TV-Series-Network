00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:04,079
SUMMARY

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,759
The lights on the bridge went out.

3
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:14,919
- Saga Norén.
- Copenhagen Police.

4
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:20,479
Two women killed a year apart.
Dismembered and assembled.

5
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,439
- Someone's making a statement.
- Do you understand my Danish?

6
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,759
- Who are you?
- A protector of the truth.

7
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,119
Why are you calling me?

8
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:48,719
Sorry about the drama.
This is only a beginning.

9
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,479
I was shocked
when I heard the message.

10
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:56,199
It was recorded
three and a half years ago.

11
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,799
- What do you do?
- I'm in the police.

12
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,919
- It's a corpse.
- Oh, OK.

13
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:09,519
- Can the lights be turned on?
- Martin! A dog is alerting.

14
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:13,079
I thought I was about to die.

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,799
- I neither can nor want to anymore.
- Do you want a divorce?

16
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,159
I've been contacted. Homelessness.
It's about the homeless.

17
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,479
Six people have been found.

18
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:32,079
They seem to be poisoned
and have been brought to hospital.

19
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,919
Sonja? It's me.

20
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,919
- He's going to kill homeless people.
- He's started already.

21
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,439
EPISODE 3

22
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,639
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

23
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:28,639
Do you know anything
about the poisonings?

24
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:42,799
- Saga Norén. Do you know...?
- No.

25
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,999
Go... over there.

26
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,879
- In there?
- Go over there.

27
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:34,319
THE BRIDGE

28
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:47,039
I'm going back to Malmö.

29
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,519
- Are you sure it's the same man?
- Yes.

30
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,159
Two women, the car bomb.

31
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,199
- Nine dead homeless people.
- Ten now.

32
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:01,039
- Is your Swedish colleague clever?
- Saga Norén?

33
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:06,759
- Her clear-up rate is fantastic.
- She's very efficient.

34
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,879
She's found time to report you.

35
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:16,599
I'll stall as long as I can,
but try to make her withdraw it.

36
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,239
- Show some finesse.
- Finesse? What do you mean?

37
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,679
The two of you are colleagues.
Just colleagues.

38
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,039
- Am I here because of this?
- No, no. I'll walk you to your car.

39
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,519
We want to attract businesses
and families to our region.

40
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:40,679
It's bad enough that we've got
homeless people, now they're killed.

41
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,319
We have to handle
a trial against five police officers.

42
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,159
The Monique Brammer case
was never mine. I'm not involved.

43
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,399
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Solving the case has top priority.

44
00:05:56,559 --> 00:06:03,159
- And your second priority?
- We need some positive publicity.

45
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:14,679
It seemed to be going well.
He woke up. Suddenly... well...

46
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,599
I wasn't there when mum died either.

47
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,079
Your father
loved you very much, Maja.

48
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,999
Very much.

49
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,319
- Hi.
- Stefan Lindberg.

50
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:58,079
- This way.
- Thank you.

51
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,559
We're running tests, but don't know
what she's swallowed.

52
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:12,359
- Should we contact anyone?
- No, I'm all she has.

53
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:15,239
- OK.
- Thank you.

54
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,159
Forgive me.

55
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,359
Forgive me, Sonja.

56
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,719
- It's mine!
- Let go!

57
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,159
What the hell are you doing?
They want us to leave.

58
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:22,399
- Who?
- The welfare office. There's a bus.

59
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,879
- Aren't you coming?
- I take care of myself.

60
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,479
What are you doing?

61
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,999
- Any news about the survivors?
- Two in Denmark, one in Sweden.

62
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,039
Didn't anyone see
the cases of wine be put there?

63
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:19,479
- Do we know which poison it was?
- Not yet.

64
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,239
And he doesn't leave traces.

65
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,399
The spasms suggest an alkaloid.
The rigor mortis implies strychnine.

66
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,319
But vomiting blood
isn't typical for strychnine.

67
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:37,039
- Get yourself a hobby.
- What?

68
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,359
The bottles and cases
gave us nothing.

69
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,879
It's been more than 24 hours,
and we have nothing.

70
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,399
We'll start from scratch again.

71
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,399
The reporter Daniel Ferbé
has joined us in the studio.

72
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,199
He's been in contact with
the perpetrator or perpetrators.

73
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:10,359
- Which is it?
- I've been in touch with one person.

74
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,079
12 people have died in 24 hours.
What do they want?

75
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:19,719
They, or him,
want to point out five problems.

76
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,519
Five truths about society.

77
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,399
He's a truth terrorist.

78
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,759
They questioned whether we're
equal before the law. What now?

79
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,519
We shouldn't be so upset.

80
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,719
The same number of homeless
freeze to death every year.

81
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,239
They're his words, not mine.

82
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,239
- Why did he contact you?
- I don't know. Maybe he trusts me?

83
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,079
He's pointed out two problems,
what are the three remaining?

84
00:12:56,239 --> 00:13:00,679
I have no idea. He'll let me know
when something happens.

85
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,759
Do you write what he wants?
I'd be done as a reporter.

86
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,119
- I decide what I write.
- Aftenposten's circulation is.

87
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,479
Saga? Congratulations, Gry!
He's broadcasting again.

88
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:24,799
It's on truth.se and truth.dk.
He's covering his tracks better.

89
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,599
- Can't you trace him?
- I'll find the server, not him.

90
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,759
What does he want?
A man tied to a chair?

91
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:38,559
Do you know who he is?
It could be a three year old recording.

92
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,599
Martin. Yes, we're looking at it.

93
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,679
Who? Are you sure?

94
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,999
We'll be right over.
We know who he is.

95
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,599
I had a meeting with my boss.
She's under pressure.

96
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:09,079
Five of my colleagues face trial for
murder.

97
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,199
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

98
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:22,479
It's difficult to tell. Try to say
"oh" or "yes" now and then.

99
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,599
I'm in the car next to you.
How can I not listen?

100
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,079
She needs positive publicity.

101
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:35,399
She'll try to demonstrate
good police work.

102
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,119
- Do you catch my drift?
- No.

103
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,039
When we solve this, she'll make it
look as if Danish police did it.

104
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:52,199
- We should both take credit for it.
- Fine, if that's important to you.

105
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,759
It should be important to you.

106
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:05,319
It must have occurred to you
that this might lead to a promotion.

107
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:09,199
Yes, it occurred to me.

108
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:13,399
- You improve your career.
- It doesn't matter.

109
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:19,439
I can't climb higher up the ladder.
I'm not cut out for management.

110
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:23,919
- Who's told you that?
- No one.

111
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,639
I wanted to let you know.

112
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:34,239
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

113
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:56,399
- Excuse me.
- Move!

114
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:09,079
- Let go of me!
- Calm down. Please! Stop it!

115
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:13,319
- Show me your bag. Let me see.
- No, you can't.

116
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:17,839
- Let go of me!
- Stay still, show me the bag.

117
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,519
Please, let go of me.

118
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,799
- What's wrong with you? Stay still.
- Let go.

119
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,639
Show me the bag.
Hello? I have to check it.

120
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,439
I didn't mean to do it.

121
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:39,639
- I still need to check the bag.
- I'm sorry.

122
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:45,719
- Have they got their own beds?
- It's first come, first served.

123
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:51,799
- But not for Bjørn?
- He was violent towards the others.

124
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,599
- And that pays off?
- In the end no one took his bed.

125
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,359
- Who's the girl?
- His daughter.

126
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,159
She lives in the US.

127
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:07,639
- Was he a sailor?
- He was in the merchant navy.

128
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,879
Has he clashed with anyone else?

129
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,239
Apart from neighbours, businesses,
associates, parking attendants...

130
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,519
and most others in the world?

131
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,919
Hi. You don't have to look hard
to find someone that bears a grudge.

132
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,239
- I know where Bjørn is.
- Or was, at least.

133
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,519
- That's the dart from a stun gun.
- OK.

134
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:32,999
The cartridges contain tiny notes
with the production number on.

135
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:39,119
You can tell who fired,
for how long, and how many times.

136
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,759
- A note?
- No, tiny notes.

137
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,599
We need people to search for them.

138
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,079
I'm sorry.

139
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,599
Yes, that's it.

140
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,959
- What's on your mind?
- Why he's there.

141
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,639
- What's in it for the perpetrator?
- We'll find out, he's keen to talk.

142
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:51,719
I spoke to Lillian
about another matter.

143
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:56,959
You filed a report. What can I do
to make you withdraw it?

144
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,279
- Nothing.
- What?

145
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,719
- What did you do last night?
- We both worked.

146
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:21,839
- I know. Before that?
- Why do you ask?

147
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:27,679
It's what colleagues do, they talk.
I'm just making conversation.

148
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,159
- I had sex as well.
- What?

149
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,319
- How did you find time for that?
- It doesn't take long.

150
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,959
- What's his name?
- I can't remember.

151
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,359
- So he stuns Bjørn.
- Yes.

152
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,479
He ties him to a chair
and posts it online.

153
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,399
Why?
He killed the others straight away.

154
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,279
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
When?

155
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:07,519
We'll head straight there. Bye.
She's awake.

156
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,039
She woke up a short while. She slips
in and out of the unconsciousness.

157
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:18,559
- Unconsciousness.
- Pardon?

158
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:24,159
- It's without the definite article.
- Thank you.

159
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,439
Let's have a quick look
so the trip isn't wasted.

160
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,319
Sonja? Can you hear me, Sonja?

161
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:55,199
Sonja? Can you hear me, Sonja?

162
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,719
- I'll fetch a doctor.
- Wait.

163
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,439
- Sonja? Can you hear me, Sonja?
- Stefan.

164
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,279
I'm Saga Norén
from the County Police.

165
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:19,479
- Stefan was there.
- Stefan?

166
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,319
- Do you know him?
- Everything's fine.

167
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:27,199
- Did you see who brought the bottles?
- Stefan!

168
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:34,799
Did Stefan bring them?
Fight it, Sonja. Stay awake.

169
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:41,759
Fight it, Sonja. Stay awake.
Who poisoned you? Did you see him?

170
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,759
- I saw him.
- Did you recognize him?

171
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
What did he look like?

172
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,599
- Who are you?
- And who are you?

173
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,199
- I'm her brother. Is she awake?
- No.

174
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,799
I'm Saga Norén. This is Martin Rohde
from the Copenhagen Police.

175
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:07,079
- What's your name?
- Stefan Lindberg. Why are you here?

176
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,279
Have you got an ID?

177
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,119
- You found her and drove her here.
- Yes.

178
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,079
How long has she lived on the street?

179
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,999
I don't know.

180
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:42,279
We lost contact when I was 15.
We were in separate foster homes.

181
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:51,599
So... I found her yesterday.
I didn't know she was alive.

182
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:57,839
You find your sister after years,
on the day she's poisoned?

183
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,839
- What? What's wrong with that?
- How unlucky.

184
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:09,239
- Where were you when we arrived?
- I had some things to sort out.

185
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:13,039
They were more important
than your dying sister.

186
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:23,399
- I can show you where I found her.
- There's no need, we know where.

187
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:29,279
Let me know if I can help you.
Can I go be with Sonja? Thank you.

188
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:39,799
- I'll get some flowers for Gry.
- Why?

189
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:46,799
- It's her birthday. Didn't you know?
- Just go, I'll wait here.

190
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,639
- Have you got any Swedish money?
- Yes.

191
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,719
- Can I borrow some?
- Yes.

192
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,719
Aren't you going back to work?

193
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,839
Mum...

194
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,999
I said I'm sorry.

195
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:44,559
- Take a painkiller.
- I did an hour ago.

196
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,359
It's from a stun gun.
Can you trace it?

197
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,399
- Do we know which make?
- No.

198
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,639
Here you are. Happy birthday.
They're from Saga and me.

199
00:26:56,639 --> 00:27:02,119
I didn't buy any flowers.
You said they were from both of us.

200
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,079
- They still made her happy.
- How is that relevant?

201
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,679
Something's happening.

202
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:27,519
I understand, but I can't make it.
We can do it over the phone.

203
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,399
OK. Call me later. Bye.

204
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,919
- You did well on TV today.
- Thanks, Åke.

205
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:44,919
- Your opinion means a lot to me.
- No, you're being ironic.

206
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:51,319
- No. Irony is dead, Åke.
- Sure.

207
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,919
- It went well, we all think so.
- I know.

208
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:02,399
- This guy will be my Sankara Stones.
- What?

209
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:08,719
"Fortune and glory, kid.
Fortune and glory." Indiana Jones.

210
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,599
- Daniel Ferbé.
- I like your "truth terrorist".

211
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,679
- I don't give a damn.
- I can stop calling.

212
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:23,599
- I can find someone else.
- No.

213
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:29,479
Good. I saw you on the air,
have you seen what I sent?

214
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,119
- I'm looking at it.
- You're not the only one.

215
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,679
- What's with the pictures?
- And you're a journalist?

216
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,239
I can find out who they are,
but it's easier if you tell me.

217
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:53,359
Who are they? Hello?

218
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:04,559
What the hell...?

219
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,559
Dad's on TV.

220
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,319
He's called Bjørn Rasmusen.
Four property investors are shown.

221
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:11,359
- From Malmö and Copenhagen.
- I'll answer.

222
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,079
Daniel Ferbé is
in contact with the killer.

223
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:20,119
The four can save Bjørn Rasmusen.
It's unknown how.

224
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,879
- They're chosen to save Bjørn.
- How?

225
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:36,559
- What have they got in common?
- All four are property investors.

226
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:40,439
We're receiving loads of tips
about Bjørn's location.

227
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:49,039
It's impossible to tell where it is.
Otherwise he wouldn't be there.

228
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,999
Danish police is on its way
to Lorentzen and Beckgård.

229
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,599
We'll take Söringer,
send Anne and Navid to Hodell.

230
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,879
- How did it go with Sonja?
- She saw someone.

231
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,519
- Saga! Martin! He's dead.
- Who?

232
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:12,839
- Goran Söringer died in hospital.
- Who owns the business now?

233
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:26,479
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
We need to talk to you.

234
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,719
- Do you remember me?
- Yes.

235
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:38,359
I won't talk to you. I'm happy
to help, but I'll only talk to you.

236
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,799
- Have you got a name?
- Martin Rohde.

237
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,879
Come in.

238
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:58,639
- Aren't you coming in?
- Didn't you hear what she said?

239
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:04,079
- Can't you just listen?
- Yes.

240
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,479
Stop! Hey!

241
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:20,719
- Get out! Get out!
- Bloody drunk.

242
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,719
What the hell do you want me?
What the hell do you want?

243
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,559
I'm hungry as well.

244
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,639
You've only got yourself to blame.

245
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:02,559
All police officers in Malmö
and Copenhagen are looking for him.

246
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,359
Then the camera's switched off.

247
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,639
- If he escaped, won't he contact us?
- Let's hope so.

248
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:14,119
- When was this?
- Nearly an hour ago.

249
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:17,399
Our colleagues
in Copenhagen report-

250
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,359
- that the Danish property investors
don't know Bjørn.

251
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,719
He's not been evicted, had a lease-

252
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:30,439
- or had any other connection
to Hodell's properties.

253
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,279
- Charlotte Söringer doesn't know him.
- They're chosen for a reason.

254
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:41,119
- So what? He doesn't have Bjørn.
- Nor do we.

255
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:14,639
A psychological profile is useful,
but we don't know if it's one person.

256
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:18,199
- There's only one.
- How do you know?

257
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,559
There's something about the wording.

258
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:26,159
Hi, Salvatore.
This is Martin Rohde from Denmark.

259
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:30,919
Why would someone mispronounce
their colleague's name?

260
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,519
It might be a means of suppression.

261
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,959
- Did you hear that, Saga?
- Yes.

262
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,519
Well, well...

263
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,039
- My name's Martin Rohde.
- Salvatore Johansson.

264
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,799
I haven't had much to go by.

265
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:58,719
But... it's some type
of psychotic condition.

266
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:01,679
- Saga? We've found...
- You have to wait.

267
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:09,439
This person is extremely focused
on a single project.

268
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,239
He's not in a relationship.
He is or has been...

269
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:17,319
very successful professionally.

270
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:22,519
I think that he's experienced
something traumatic.

271
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:26,399
His conception of the world
is warped.

272
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:32,039
He's trying to regain balance
and make sense of the world again.

273
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,279
Is he emotionally numb
or a psychopath?

274
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:43,239
He's got a clearly defined target.
He wants us to see things his way.

275
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:48,439
He's willing to make sacrifices
to achieve that.

276
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,759
- A psychopath, the way I see it.
- No. What are his weaknesses?

277
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:57,599
Everything is
meticulously planned and executed.

278
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:01,759
He planned this
for more than three years.

279
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:05,359
That's his weakness.

280
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,639
If someone or something
upset his plans...

281
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:12,799
he'll start to lose grip on things.

282
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,239
In short,
he doesn't want to improvise.

283
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,119
- Daniel Ferbé.
- Who's the woman?

284
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:37,079
Why did you remove
Goran Söringer?

285
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:43,239
He's dead. He died yesterday.
It's his wife.

286
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,719
Maybe you should read
the entire article?

287
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:54,799
- Should I find someone else?
- No, no!

288
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:05,039
What will happen... to Bjørn? Hello?

289
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:29,719
The technicians found the ID number.
The stun gun was registered.

290
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:34,319
- It was handed in to us in 2001.
- To us?

291
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:38,759
It was handed in for destruction,
but that never happened.

292
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:42,559
I thought it went missing,
but it was signed for.

293
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,399
- By Lennart Fransson.
- He's a retired police officer.

294
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:51,839
He's 58
and has an apartment in town.

295
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:01,719
- What was he like as a policeman?
- He did well.

296
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,999
No reports against him.
He was well-liked.

297
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,119
- How can he be involved in this?
- He might not be.

298
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:29,599
Stay here, Gry.

299
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:43,319
It's the police, Lennart.
It's Hans from the County Police.

300
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,359
I'll be back.

301
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:36,479
- Hi. Is dad here?
- No, he just left.

302
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,159
We're having guests tonight.
It's Oscar's birthday.

303
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,719
My brother and my parents
are coming.

304
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,439
- Well...
- Can I wait for dad here?

305
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,399
- Here?
- Yes.

306
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,799
- He'll be gone a while, he just left.
- That's fine, I can wait.

307
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:14,119
- Well, you can sit there.
- Thanks.

308
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:44,359
- Does your mother know you're here?
- No. Can you call her?

309
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:47,119
Tell her that I'll spend the night.

310
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,639
Something happened,
I can't go home.

311
00:44:54,799 --> 00:45:00,279
You can't stay, Anja.
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

312
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:04,599
- You can't just show up.
- What now, then?

313
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:13,039
Filippa's brother and his family
are coming. Her parents.

314
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:18,239
- We haven't got space.
- I don't have to come to the party.

315
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:22,119
- I can find somewhere to...
- Sweetheart.

316
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:26,799
That would have been fine,
but there's nowhere to sleep.

317
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,479
Apart from the neighbours,
they're all spending the night.

318
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,759
- It can't be...
- Some other time.

319
00:45:39,919 --> 00:45:44,119
You're always welcome here.
You know that.

320
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:55,159
I haven't got time
to drive you all the way home.

321
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,399
- I can drive you to the train.
- No, that's OK.

322
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,439
Hey... Is everything OK between us?

323
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:35,759
They haven't found anything
in Fransson's apartment.

324
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:40,839
- Nothing? What happened to Bjørn?
- He got him back.

325
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:46,439
If not we would have found him.
He needs Bjørn for something.

326
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:48,599
- Bye.
- Bye.

327
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:51,799
- Why did he pick Bjørn?
- Why not?

328
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:56,759
- He's big and strong, that's risky.
- He had a stun gun.

329
00:46:56,919 --> 00:47:03,839
- Even so, why did he pick Bjørn?
- Did he take the first he could find?

330
00:47:03,999 --> 00:47:06,759
I would have picked a weak person.

331
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:16,399
- Listen, Hans...
- Bye.

332
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,359
- Are you going to move?
- Do you want to get rid of me?

333
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,399
Nothing's decided.
Karin is looking for a house online.

334
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,119
We feel a bit homesick.

335
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:33,359
- Do you want to take over?
- No.

336
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,039
Whoever takes over,
will appreciate having you here.

337
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:50,719
Extremely focused. Single.
Successful. Clearly defined targets.

338
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:53,759
- Good at planning.
- Exactly.

339
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:56,399
- What?
- Exactly.

340
00:47:57,399 --> 00:48:01,319
That's the perpetrator's
psychological profile.

341
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:07,879
Go home and get some sleep.

342
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:14,279
- How did it go today?
- Fine.

343
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:24,319
The children are asleep in your bed.
Ask your oldest son why.

344
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:30,879
- What did he do?
- Showed them the man that's tied up.

345
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,479
They're afraid.

346
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,399
What's going on?

347
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:04,359
- What is it?
- What do you think?

348
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:09,319
You showed your siblings some shit.

349
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:12,319
- It was reality.
- It's not for them to see.

350
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:16,839
- That's the problem he points out.
- Who is he?

351
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:20,879
Him, the truth terrorist.

352
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,559
He's done more for the homeless
than the politicians.

353
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,279
- He killed ten of them.
- But everyone's talking about them.

354
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,759
- Do I need to worry about you?
- No. Why?

355
00:50:33,919 --> 00:50:38,759
You've taken a year off
and moved here. You have no job.

356
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:43,839
- Help me out here, what's your plan?
- Not to have a plan.

357
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:48,239
- You can't only think about yourself.
- You do.

358
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,999
- You're going to help out more.
- Yes, yes...

359
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:59,599
- Help Mette out. Stop it.
- Yes, I said!

360
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:16,039
- Why is he called a truth terrorist?
- A Swedish reporter used it.

361
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,199
It works well online: T.T.

362
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:29,039
- Turn it off. Come join us.
- I'll be right there.

363
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:38,119
- What happened?
- Dad was nagging.

364
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:46,199
- Did I ever meet him?
- No. Me neither.

365
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,559
- Hi.
- Hi.

366
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:03,799
- Are you visiting someone?
- No. You see...

367
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:10,799
- It's raining outside.
- I know. I took the rubbish out.

368
00:53:15,479 --> 00:53:21,559
I'm just about to have some tea.
You can have some, if you like.

369
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,439
Oh... sure.

370
00:53:33,999 --> 00:53:36,679
Come on in.

371
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,439
- I've only got green tea.
- That's fine.

372
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:07,199
- Nice place.
- Thanks. Take a seat.

373
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:14,879
- Where are you from?
- Copenhagen.

374
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:21,639
- Why are you here?
- It sounds really childish.

375
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:24,479
I ran away from home.

376
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,159
- Why?
- I had a row with mum.

377
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:34,279
That's how it is sometimes.

378
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:54,279
- Can I stay here a little while?
- Sure. Stay as long as you like.

379
00:54:55,879 --> 00:55:00,519
- Cool. I'll stay a while, then.
- OK.

380
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,319
Dad?
There something you have to see.

381
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,319
- What time is it?
- Five o'clock.

382
00:55:19,479 --> 00:55:21,959
- Come on.
- What's going on?

383
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:29,439
- Hello?
- He's got Bjørn. You should come in.

384
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,399
- What's happened? Is he dead?
- Not yet.

385
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:37,679
I'll be right there.

386
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,999
- Saga Norén.
- He's broadcasting again.

387
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,559
- Has he been in touch?
- He wants 20 million.

388
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,159
Five million from each
of the four men, to stop it.

389
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,999
If they refuse, we'll know
what a human being is worth.

390
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:10,559
- How much time have we got?
- He started at five.

391
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,759
He's lost half a litre of blood.
He weighs 80 kilos.

392
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:21,039
7 percent is 5 litres. He'll pass out
when he's lost 40 percent of that.

393
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:26,479
- That gives us four hours.
- After another litre the heart stops.

394
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:33,319
- OK, so five or six hours.
- Let's contact the four men again.

395
00:56:33,479 --> 00:56:37,079
- Did he do that with his eyes before?
- His tics.

396
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:41,319
Wasn't he in the merchant navy?
It's Morse code.
