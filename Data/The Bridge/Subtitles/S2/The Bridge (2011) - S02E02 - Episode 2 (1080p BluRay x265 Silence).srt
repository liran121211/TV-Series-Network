1
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:06,639
Five people were chained below deck.
They were likely kidnapped.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,279
-I can get someone else to help you.
-Why not Martin?

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,759
I don't know how he'll respond
to seeing you again.

4
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:21,479
Goddamn, it's been ages!
I don't live with Mette anymore.

5
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:23,719
But we had twins, did you know?

6
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,119
Oh? I'm living with a guy
named Jakob Sandberg.

7
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:33,479
I want to get good at this.
At having a relationship.

8
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:37,799
I know who were on that ship.
A bouncer saw them leave at 03.45.

9
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,879
-There's a cam there.
-I'll put John on it.

10
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,479
-There was a fox...
-Flashing lights.

11
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:46,759
You'd think they were
abducted by aliens.

12
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,639
-Did that ship run aground?
-I don't know.

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,759
We will get a 12,
with me doing all the work.

14
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:58,599
-Hi...
-I'm at the stables with Tina.

15
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,119
Do you know what happened to Maria?

16
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,119
-I keep seeing him.
-Jens, who killed your son?

17
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,279
Everywhere. He's in here.

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,719
I'm lying to myself and others.
But inside, nothing's happening.

19
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,519
What the hell are you doing?

20
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:18,479
Put it out!

21
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,639
I want to see Jens in prison.

22
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,399
-Axel Möllberg. I've got some footage.
-You saw where it headed after?

23
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,879
Saga, you need to come with me now.

24
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,519
Two more have died - from pneumonic
plague. We're to be quarantined.

25
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,919
I've been with Mette and the kids.

26
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,279
Someone's trying to cause an outbreak
of pneumonic plague.

27
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,999
EPISODE 2

28
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:51,439
<i>Three people have died at Skåne
University Hospital in Malmö.</i>

29
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:55,399
<i>Another two are in critical condition.</i>

30
00:04:55,559 --> 00:05:00,319
<i>With us now is Filippa Belinder,
from the Institute for Disease Control.</i>

31
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,319
<i>-What should one do if infected?
-See a doctor.</i>

32
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,479
<i>Especially if you display the symptoms
high fever, racing pulse, cough...</i>

33
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,559
<i>...breathing difficulties, and chest
pains. But this disease is treatable.</i>

34
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:23,119
Did she say that? Anna-Dea said that?
In that case I think you should do that.

35
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,359
No? Yes, I'll be by soon. Bye.

36
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,639
Third time you've talked to them today.

37
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:37,279
Just to make sure they're fine.
Can you blame me?

38
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,959
It spreads primarily through coughing,
and you're not coughing.

39
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:47,319
-Now you're a virus expert?
-It's not a virus, but a bacterium.

40
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,839
Think out loud, Saga.

41
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:54,959
Someone kidnaps five people,
gives them the plague...

42
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:58,079
...and puts them on a ship
that runs aground.

43
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:01,119
No one's claimed it after two days.

44
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,959
Both of your test results
came back negative.

45
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:10,839
-And negative is a good thing here?
-That's correct.

46
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:14,039
I need to talk
to the Faxborg kids again.

47
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,119
As you may know,
we lost another one this morning.

48
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,359
But there are two left, right?

49
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,599
Their condition is critical.
The antibiotics aren't working.

50
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,679
-So maybe once they're stable.
-No, not maybe. You'll call.

51
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,639
-You ready?
-Yes.

52
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,399
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Pernille Lindegaard, Copenhagen Police.

53
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,519
We're here to assist
with the five kids from the boat.

54
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,479
It's a ship. And three of them are dead.

55
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,919
-Hi.
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

56
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,679
Rasmus Larsson.
I've looked into these plague bacteria.

57
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,879
Basically all hospitals and research
centers in the region stockpile them.

58
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,839
These bacteria are impossible to trace.

59
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:43,719
-Hi, I'm Martin. Welcome on board.
-Thank you.

60
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,079
-Hi. Rasmus Larsson.
-Hi.

61
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:50,079
-You know her?
-I've seen you before, but no.

62
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:53,359
-No. Great to work with you.
-Yeah, likewise.

63
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,599
-Want to get some coffee?
-Sure.

64
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,519
-Rasmus!
-Come on, Rasmus.

65
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,279
-John!
-Yes?

66
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,039
-Heard from Helsingør?
-I haven't received the footage.

67
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,799
-Why not?
-I don't know. I'm on them.

68
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,959
But they're taking their time.

69
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:16,599
-Saga, they found the life raft.
-Where?

70
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,679
A farmer north of Lomma saw them
come ashore two days ago.

71
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,239
He called the police yesterday,
but no one came out.

72
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,839
Check the coastline. Lomma.

73
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,119
-Pernilla?
-Pernille. With an E.

74
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,359
Pernille? Right. Go to Helsingør
to get some footage from them.

75
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,319
-I could do it.
-No.

76
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,559
They found the life raft.

77
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,039
It's not personal.
She doesn't know my name either.

78
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,599
-Where are you going?
-With you.

79
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,119
No. Try to connect places that stockpile
plague bacteria to any of those kids.

80
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,199
OK...

81
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,999
-There were three of them.
-Men or women?

82
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,039
I don't know. They had
these thick jumpsuits and hats on.

83
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:20,679
-Both men and women, I think.
-You think or you know?

84
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,599
I know they ran up to a car
that was waiting up there.

85
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,879
-What make and color?
-I don't know cars. But it was red.

86
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,839
-Big or small?
-Pretty small. And red.

87
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:35,599
Yes, you mentioned that.
Did you see the number plates?

88
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,439
-Someone was waiting in the car?
-Yes.

89
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:41,519
-Man or woman?
-I don't know.

90
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,479
The only thing I recall
is that it was red.

91
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,279
Saying it over and over
doesn't make it more helpful.

92
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,319
-How did it go?
-We found it. Techs are looking at it.

93
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:03,119
Three people
left Faxborg in a life raft.

94
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,079
A fourth person was waiting
in a red vehicle...there.

95
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:12,519
-A red vehicle? Is that all you got?
-Yes. That it's red. And small.

96
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,239
Saga, these kids can't be connected to
places that stockpile plague bacteria.

97
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,439
No, I didn't think so.

98
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,279
Saga, Martin, come look at this.

99
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:27,719
This video was posted online
and got over 4,000 hits in an hour.

100
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,599
The clip is called "Friends of Faxborg."

101
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,719
What the hell is it?

102
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,759
Angola had an outbreak of pneumonic
plague in May. WHO says 319 people died.

103
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,399
Three in the life raft, one in the car.

104
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,719
"The world is bigger than us."

105
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,799
They said something
about a fox in the hospital.

106
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,279
So they're claiming responsibility.

107
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:30,919
Their message is online, too.
It doesn't prove they did it.

108
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,279
Zoom in. The pin on the jacket.

109
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,999
This was found on Maria Holst.

110
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,959
This group has the knowhow and resources
to steal a ship, kidnap five people...

111
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:08,719
...retrieve and handle plague bacteria.
They claim it, leave a symbol.

112
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,439
You know why they leave a symbol.

113
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:15,279
So people know it's them next time.

114
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,039
Hello!

115
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,319
Hi...

116
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,079
-Hello!
-Hi, Frida!

117
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,599
Frida!

118
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,839
Does it hurt?

119
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:32,079
No.

120
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,239
Nice try. Here you go.

121
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,599
Why did you do it, Linus?

122
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,719
-Was it for money? Why?
-No!

123
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,919
I just wanted to show those guys.

124
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
So they'd let me in for real.

125
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,119
-Point them out.
-Come on.

126
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,279
Point them out.

127
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,639
Hey! You guys!

128
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,559
I'm Niklas, Linus' brother.

129
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:52,399
-You hang out together, yeah?
-Sometimes.

130
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,479
Anyway, he's doing fine.
He's out and he'll make a full recovery.

131
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,799
You're Albin, right?

132
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,519
It wasn't my idea. He did it himself.
None of us forced him.

133
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,719
You didn't exactly try
to stop him, either.

134
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:28,919
Nice meeting you guys. Take care.

135
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:47,279
The rat definitely looks like a man.
The pig is probably also a man.

136
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,639
-This frog has appeared again.
-More infected?

137
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,599
No, a woman has died
from a poisoned apple.

138
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,479
Was her name Snow White?
We should talk to her step mom.

139
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,079
-Where did she die?
-At work.

140
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:07,039
They had fruit delivered to the office.
All baskets are being recalled.

141
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,479
-We've issued a warning.
-Saga! I'm coming with.

142
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,079
-Why?
-It'd be good to get out there.

143
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,399
So why don't you go for a walk?

144
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,159
Then try to trace those animal masks.

145
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,639
-We're just devastated.
-Do you stock the fruit here?

146
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,479
No, we get daily deliveries
from different delivery companies.

147
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,479
I've printed out a list of them.

148
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:54,199
I've also got a list
of all our employees.

149
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,439
-I figured you'd want one.
-Yes.

150
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,359
There are seven of us,
eight including me.

151
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,039
They start at six
and work until about nine or ten.

152
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,959
-Once you pack the baskets, then what?
-They go here.

153
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,639
-No surveillance cameras?
-No.

154
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,559
The trailers are lined up,
and the truckers pick them up.

155
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:22,839
-That's always open?
-Yes, for the most part.

156
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,639
-Have you seen this thing before?
-No.

157
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,959
-Positive?
-No, I don't...

158
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,119
-We're going to take a look around.
-Go ahead.

159
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,359
Saga! He came in this way.

160
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:11,479
Make sure the kids stay away
from fruit for the time being.

161
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:15,679
Great. Tell them I said hi
and hug them for me.

162
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,079
Bye.

163
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,599
-Who was that?
-Jakob.

164
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,639
-You didn't want to talk to him?
-No, I'm working.

165
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,319
-What does he do?
-I don't know.

166
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,799
After months of dating
you don't know what he does?

167
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,959
Should I?

168
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,919
If he doesn't want to say,
and you're not interested...

169
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,719
It's fantasy...comics or something.
I'm not really interested.

170
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:50,079
Does that make me a bad girlfriend?

171
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,839
-Does he ask you about your work?
-Yes.

172
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,759
It's a third of one's life.

173
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,239
If you ask him about his work,
you seem to take interest in him.

174
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:20,479
-Did you get the footage?
-Yes.

175
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:25,279
Our Helsingør colleagues are many things
but organized is not one.

176
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:28,759
-When did they leave the club?
-At 3.45 a.m.

177
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,239
Right...

178
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,319
This is where they leave.

179
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,799
Pause it!

180
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:48,039
Zoom in. The guy
on the right was not on the ship.

181
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,719
Where are the fruit company staff pics?

182
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,119
Mads Nielsen.

183
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:09,399
It's him. This is his address and info.

184
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,879
Martin Rohde, Copenhagen Police.

185
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,079
-Is Mads Nielsen here?
-Who?

186
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:45,239
Please step outside
so we can get into the apartment.

187
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,759
-You're with the police, too?
-Yes.

188
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:02,119
Can you do something about my neighbor?
They're playing music 24/7, and loud!

189
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,999
I've told him off.
It doesn't do any good.

190
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,959
-They're not playing it right now.
-No...

191
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,679
You said they played it 24/7.

192
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,439
-He's not here.
-Too bad.

193
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,519
I could use a man around the house.

194
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,599
Don't laugh if it's not funny to you.

195
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,759
I acknowledge their attempts
at being amusing.

196
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,879
-It comes across as fake.
-So I'll practice.

197
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,439
-Or maybe don't do it.
-It's Pernille with his info.

198
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,399
No registered phone number.
He does have a record.

199
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,319
Petty drug charges
and assaulting officers at protests.

200
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:56,519
-Protests against what?
-Nuclear power. The G8 meeting.

201
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,399
Used to be in
a Copenhagen activist group.

202
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,239
-Got an address?
-Yep.

203
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,079
Up there.

204
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,599
Hey! It costs money to park there.

205
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,959
Hey! I'm talking to you!

206
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,599
-Martin Rohde.
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

207
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,759
-Will you be at the EU summit?
-Yes. Want to see our plans?

208
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,759
-Yes, please.
-Another time. We're looking for Mads.

209
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,319
-Mads Nielsen.
-No idea where he is.

210
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:59,839
-We threw that idiot out.
-Oh? Why?

211
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,719
He didn't fit in.

212
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:07,439
-Why was that?
-We threw him out three years ago.

213
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,199
He wanted to go from activism
to terrorism. We did not.

214
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,279
-Know where to find him?
-I want no part of him.

215
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:20,959
-Know anyone who hangs out with him?
-Sorry.

216
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,959
-Have you seen this before?
-No.

217
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,599
-Look at it.
-No.

218
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,559
If you think of something
related to Mads, call me.

219
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,439
STILL HANG OUT WITH MAD MADS?
COPS ARE LOOKING FOR HIM /A

220
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,679
-It costs money to park here.
-Get away from the car.

221
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,239
I said, it costs money to park here.

222
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,519
-What don't you get?
-Go away.

223
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,799
It costs money.
You're parked on my turf!

224
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:21,519
-Get away from the car.
-It costs money to park here. Got it?

225
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,999
Get the fuck out of here!
Beat it, I said!

226
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:28,079
Get out of here!
Get the fuck out of here!

227
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,799
Fuck!

228
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,359
Get in the car.

229
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,879
-Just say it.
-What?

230
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,519
-It was fucking stupid!
-Yes, it was.

231
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,399
They could report you.
I'd be a witness.

232
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,119
Did you see Jens in him?

233
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,239
Only two people got a 12 this time.

234
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:37,079
So either my test was very hard,
or you didn't study hard enough.

235
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,159
There you go.

236
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,519
We're not going to move on
with so many people missing.

237
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,879
Instead we'll go through
the test thoroughly.

238
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,079
- I just need to step out for a bit.
-Sure. Let's begin...

239
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,199
Hi, honey. What's going on?
Did they close the school?

240
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,959
-No, why would they?
-Maybe because of that plague.

241
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,439
I need 1,100 kroner.

242
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,639
-For what?
-A pair of shoes.

243
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,719
-For 1,100 kroner?
-1,600 actually. I've got 400 kroner.

244
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:53,999
You've got your allowance and your pay
from the IT company. That's it.

245
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,159
-I got a ten on my math test.
-Great. You must be happy.

246
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,159
-Do I look happy?
-You demand too much of yourself.

247
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:09,279
If you get this upset over a grade,
how will you cope with real adversity?

248
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:13,079
-The idea is not to have any.
-That won't cut it. OK?

249
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:17,879
If you need a pick-me-up, you can
decide what we're having for dinner.

250
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,599
I don't want fucking dinner.

251
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,079
<i>Pharmaceuticals are the big winners
with a near 8 percent increase...</i>

252
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:46,559
<i>...largely due to a surge in demand for
antibiotics to treat pneumonic plague.</i>

253
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:50,359
-No, no.
-Economy is boring if you're broke.

254
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,559
Forget about those shoes.

255
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:55,279
Easy for you to say, it's your fault.

256
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:58,439
If you'd given me a 12,
I wouldn't be so down.

257
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:04,279
Should I grade you better
because we're sleeping together?

258
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,519
-Yes, that would have been nice.
-It's also dishonest.

259
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,799
How do you think you get ahead in life?

260
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,559
Wow, that's a new one.

261
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:18,999
-You can buy them for me.
-Why would I do that?

262
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:25,679
-I figure it's worth 1,500 kroner.
-What is?

263
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:33,679
You are my teacher after all.

264
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,519
That's not funny, Laura.

265
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,639
Good. Because I'm not joking.

266
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,239
Laura? What's going on?

267
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,439
-I'll pick them up tomorrow.
-Come on, Laura...

268
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,919
Laura!

269
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,919
-I'm going to bed.
-Good night, honey.

270
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,759
Be quiet! Be quiet, I said!

271
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,159
Remember me? Linus' brother?

272
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:09,999
When I was a kid, you know what
my parents and teachers told me?

273
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:13,759
When I didn't get to play
with the others?

274
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,919
"You can't force kids to play together,
to like each other."

275
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,439
Well, I believe you can.

276
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,079
Do we understand each other?

277
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,119
-You're late.
-Had to deal with something.

278
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,519
-Punctuality. Don't underestimate it.
-We've got bigger problems.

279
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,599
You're wanted by the police.
Astrid texted me, said the cops came.

280
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,959
-When was that?
-A while ago.

281
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:29,759
And you didn't say anything?

282
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,119
Maybe we should change locations.

283
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,959
What's up, Katarina?

284
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,519
-People are dying.
-Yes?

285
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,799
It was one thing to plan it,
another thing to carry it out.

286
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,159
Right, it's huge.

287
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,599
Then we feel differently about it.

288
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,239
-You have regrets?
-No.

289
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:01,999
But they died. That's the thing.

290
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,439
You're awfully quiet.

291
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:15,879
I like it. I like that it's growing.

292
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,559
-I'm here for the shoot, then I'm done.
-What?

293
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,639
I can't keep doing this.
I'm responsible for Linus.

294
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,919
I'm all he's got.

295
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:35,119
Nobody gets out, OK?

296
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,719
Finish those signs. I'll get the camera.

297
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,479
We've issued a warrant
for Mads Nielsen.

298
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,439
From the Copenhagen
Climate Change Conference in 2009.

299
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,159
-You see her?
-Astrid. Can we put surveillance on her?

300
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,559
That will drain a lot of resources.

301
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:09,159
What are we doing about the tail
on Marcus Stenberg?

302
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,959
Anything besides Faxborg tying him
to the contagion or the poisonings?

303
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,119
Well, then we drop him.

304
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,959
Mads Nielsen did a few months
for assaulting an officer.

305
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,639
Here's a file on him, the group,
and similar networks in the region.

306
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,599
-And you?
-The fruit companies were a dud.

307
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,959
About a hundred stores
carry those animal masks.

308
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,039
I couldn't find anything
on the frog amulet.

309
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:36,919
I'd say they made it themselves.

310
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:41,599
Would it kill you to say thanks?

311
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,199
No.

312
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,919
I gave you something, you took it.
A "thanks" would be nice.

313
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,079
Right. Thanks.

314
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,399
-I'm out of here.
-Bye.

315
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,719
-You've got a car?
-Yes.

316
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:07,479
-Can you give me a ride?
-Of course.

317
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:14,199
Bye.

318
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,599
<i>The Institute for Disease Control
projects limited spread</i>

319
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:31,559
<i>but cautions the public
to remain vigilant of any symptoms.</i>

320
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,279
-What are you doing?
-I'm reading.

321
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:38,039
I can see that. What are you reading?

322
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,079
"Transmetropolitan Lust for Life.”

323
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,519
-You like it?
-No, I don't like comic books.

324
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,319
-So why are you reading it?
-I'm taking an interest in your work.

325
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:55,359
-Your books told you to do that?
-No, Martin told me to.

326
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,439
My job isn't just reading comics.
There's a business side to it.

327
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,839
Yes.

328
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,439
But you couldn't care less
what I do at work?

329
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,399
No. But I could care about it.

330
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:15,639
Sure, or you could stop paying
attention to that guy, Martin.

331
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,239
-Are you annoyed with me now?
-A little bit.

332
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:29,159
It's me again. Listen, I'm sorry.
Please call me back and I'll explain.

333
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:34,039
I had a lousy day
and I took it out on you. I'm sorry.

334
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,239
Your math teacher called.

335
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,079
Laura, wait. Wait!

336
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,759
-Why are you doing this? For some shoes?
-It wasn't for the shoes.

337
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:54,319
So help me out, I don't get it...

338
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:59,039
No, and you'll never get it.
You're always so fucking content.

339
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:24,199
-Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.
-You're the pig.

340
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:30,439
-I saw your scar. You guys kill people.
-Linus, listen to me...

341
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,119
Fucking murderers.
You kill people!

342
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,359
Fucking murderers!

343
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:39,679
-Linus...
-Fucking murderers! You kill people!

344
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,199
-Linus...
-Murderer! I don't want to be alone.

345
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,359
-You won't be.
-You don't know!

346
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,039
-I will if they catch you.
-They won't.

347
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:51,639
-You don't know! Murderer!
-Listen to me, Linus!

348
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:54,559
I get them things through work.

349
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,599
I'm sort of part of the group, but I've
never killed anyone. You hear me?

350
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,279
You hear me? I'm not leaving you.

351
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,999
I promise.

352
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:58,359
The wife found them like this. I think
the dad tried to reach the phone.

353
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:01,679
Same symptoms
as the woman with the apple.

354
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:06,919
Different-colored liquids
in the glasses.

355
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,079
Is Martin coming?

356
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,719
-No.
-But he's all right?

357
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:31,479
Yes. I'm going to try to find
the receipt for this thing.

358
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:01,679
-Pulling night shifts now?
-I thought it'd be empty.

359
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,399
-I bet you did. What are you doing here?
-I can't really go home.

360
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,719
I thought I could crash here.

361
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:11,919
-Why can't you go home?
-Had a fight with Dad.

362
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,959
-And your partner?
-I don't want to see her right now.

363
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:20,959
Can I stay? Just for tonight?

364
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,159
-Sure, why the hell not?
-Thanks. You're the best.

365
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:31,839
-Hey, you know anyone looking for a job?
-Why?

366
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:35,759
-Lene is on sick leave.
-I can work the reception desk.

367
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:39,559
It's full time. You're in school.

368
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,559
-I'll see if I can find someone.
-Great.

369
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,799
Good night.

370
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:10,439
Good morning.

371
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:17,079
A father and two kids died last night.
Poisoned by tiger prawns.

372
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:22,399
This morning, we found a golden frog
by the frozen prawns in the supermarket.

373
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,959
We've issued a warning and cautioned
the whole food-supply chain...

374
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,359
...to look out for a golden frog.

375
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,719
Here's a preliminary report.

376
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:35,679
-Did you write this?
-Yes.

377
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,119
-You were at the crime scene last night?
-Yes.

378
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:42,159
-I was thinking about the symbol.
-The frog?

379
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,759
-It's a toad.
-Whatever, reptiles.

380
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:48,119
-They're amphibians, not reptiles.
-Saga...

381
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:50,319
-Yes?
-Just... keep going.

382
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:55,519
Yes. So, "the golden toad."
Could be found in Costa Rica until 1989.

383
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,399
Went extinct due to climate change
and pollution - human interference.

384
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,959
There's a pattern. The tiger prawn
industry destroys the mangroves.

385
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,239
In Sweden we've seen calls
for boycotting them.

386
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:13,359
The poisoned apples were South African.
Transports impact the environment.

387
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:19,079
It's all about the negative human impact
on the environment. Hence the symbol.

388
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:26,359
The plague was a way to point
to third-world injustices.

389
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:33,239
So that's what we're dealing with?
A pathos-driven eco-terrorism of sorts?

390
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:35,759
Yes. "The world is bigger than us."

391
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:41,599
Saga, Martin... There's been
another probable poisoning.

392
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,959
Why didn't you answer
my call last night?

393
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,839
I was busy.

394
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:01,679
-Going over that family's place?
-Yes.

395
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,479
Why didn't you call me?

396
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,519
I figured you needed to sleep.

397
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,559
Just because you learned to lie
doesn't mean you're any good at it.

398
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:23,079
I told you I like working with you again
because you treat me like you used to.

399
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,999
Yes, but you're not like you used to be.

400
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,839
No. That may be true.

401
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,559
But I don't want special treatment.

402
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:37,559
I thought you of all people
would understand that.

403
00:45:47,399 --> 00:45:49,399
I'm sorry.

404
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,919
Boris Williams, age 54, a Lund University
professor of Environmental Economics.

405
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:07,279
Rib-eye.

406
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,599
-What are you looking for?
-Where he got the meat.

407
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:18,959
-How do you know it was the meat?
-Biggest environmental impact.

408
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,279
-Martin.
-Five more stores have called.

409
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:27,559
-They've all found amulets.
-It's spreading. Five more stores.

410
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,159
Two of them have CCTV. I've asked
them to send John the footage.

411
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,159
Mads Nielsen worked
for the fruit company.

412
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:39,519
Get lists of the store employees,
but focus on the newest ones.

413
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,559
<i>-OK.</i>
-Was one of the stores Ölanders Livs?

414
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,519
-No.
<i>-Is Rasmus there?</i>

415
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,679
-Yes.
-Tell him to go to Ölanders Livs.

416
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,319
Tell him to look for the toad
among imported meats.

417
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,559
<i>-Then have them shut down.</i>
-Shouldn't a uniformed cop do that?

418
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:03,319
-Yes. But he wanted to get out there.
<i>-OK.</i>

419
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:40,359
Yes, with the police?

420
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,119
-Saga?
-The entry code is 0315.

421
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:40,559
All clear.

422
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:17,999
No, turn that off.

423
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:21,839
It enhances the effects of the drugs.

424
00:50:23,279 --> 00:50:26,639
They kept them here
before putting them on the ship.

425
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,559
Don't touch it, Saga.
Saga! They had the plague.

426
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,439
Come on, let's get out of here.

427
00:50:56,759 --> 00:51:00,479
John? You know who tipped us off
to the harbor location?

428
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,199
I couldn't trace the call.
But check this out.

429
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:06,679
It's CCTV footage from the stores.

430
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,599
That girl.
At 1.45 p.m. she's in Malmö.

431
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:13,599
She enters...

432
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:17,079
Then, one hour later...

433
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,359
...she's in Copenhagen.

434
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:28,519
-Can you zoom in?
-Yes, but it won't be any clearer.

435
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,519
Print out
the sharpest image you can get.

436
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:54,519
Saga! It's a new clip.

437
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,199
Looks like you were right.

438
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:18,359
Yes.

439
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:50,879
What's up?
Why are we meeting here?

440
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:59,279
-The cops came to the harbor.
-How did they find us?

441
00:52:59,439 --> 00:53:02,439
That's what we'd like to know.

442
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,079
What...? You think it was me?

443
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:12,519
Give me your phone.
I said, give me your phone.

444
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:14,879
-Mads...
-You shut up.

445
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:32,599
-OK. Tonight, as planned.
-They've already OK'd something?

446
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:37,399
-This is our own initiative.
-Wait, if the cops know who we are...

447
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,879
They knew about the harbor,
that's it. We're on for tonight.

448
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:48,319
OK.

449
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:51,799
-Where are you going?
-Fix dinner for Linus.

450
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:54,959
-We're all staying put.
-Come on!

451
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,559
-How old is this kid anyway?
-Thirteen.

452
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,879
At thirteen, I was taking care
of myself. Sit down.

453
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:11,999
Sit down.

454
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:22,079
OK.

455
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:26,999
This is the plan.

456
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:52,399
Could you help us?
Our car broke down.

457
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:24,279
Mads, what the fuck?
Cut it out, let's go!

458
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:34,479
Check it out.

459
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,679
What am I looking at?

460
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:41,239
That's five gallons of gas.

461
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:46,359
We just got hold of
five <i>thousand</i> gallons of gas.

462
