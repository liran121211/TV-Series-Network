1
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:05,359
A woman has died
from a poisoned apple.

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,639
Negative human impact
on the environment - hence the symbol.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:13,399
So this is a pathos-driven
eco-terrorism of sorts?

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,479
The man who died. You read about it.
I'm chasing a new keynote speaker.

5
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:23,839
The guy we got ruined my birthday
by getting poisoned and dying.

6
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:27,959
-It's...new boobs.
-You want me to get bigger boobs?

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,359
-What's this?
-For when you need really great sex.

8
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:36,799
-Where are you going?
-With you.

9
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,279
-No. You're staying here.
-OK...

10
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,039
-Where are you going?
-I'm heading out.

11
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,839
Rasmus Larsson, Malmö Police...

12
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,959
-Where have you been all day?
-The ER.

13
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,399
I had a sandwich that contained nuts.
I've got a bad nut allergy.

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,599
Axel Möllberg.
I've got some footage for you.

15
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,399
-You saw where it headed?
-I kept shooting my daughter.

16
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:09,399
-I can take her job.
-Top students don't take gap years.

17
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:13,359
-What did you get yourself into?
-Do I get the job or not?

18
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,039
You know how everything works?

19
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:19,239
I want to see Jens in prison.

20
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,999
One day you just felt so great
you decided to see your son's murderer?

21
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,199
What was that harbor thing?

22
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,839
-Any word?
-They should be pleased.

23
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,439
We're meeting
some higher-ups tonight.

24
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,279
Hey. I love you, Linus.
It's all going to be fine.

25
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,839
-Linus just made a call.
-We're assuming to Niklas.

26
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:56,759
EPISODE 4

27
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,599
Is it them?

28
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,879
Mads Nielsen... Niklas Svensson...

29
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:37,079
She looks like the girl from the grocery
store pictures. Her, we don't know.

30
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,079
-It's the four from the videos.
-Probably.

31
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,279
-That one's the pig.
-How do you know?

32
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,799
The scar on the wrist.

33
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,679
Suicide.

34
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,239
Why do it here?

35
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:58,719
They must've known they'd get caught,
given the scope of our raid.

36
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,559
It's not uncommon with these groups.
It's preferable to getting caught.

37
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,079
Thanks, I got it.

38
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:33,799
Hi, Linus. I'm Rasmus. I thought
we'd go and sit down in here.

39
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,879
You want anything?
Like a sandwich, or a soda?

40
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,359
-Why am I here?
-We just want to talk to you.

41
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,799
I don't know where Niklas is.
Honestly, I don't know.

42
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,879
Right... So it's just you
and your brother?

43
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,519
Why are you asking me that?
Did you get him?

44
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,119
-Is he here? Can I see him?
-No... Hey, let's get something to eat.

45
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,679
Let's get a soda or something.

46
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:25,119
Do you have any change
for the vending machine?

47
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,999
<i>...whether it's the same four
individuals in animal masks</i>

48
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,079
<i>claiming responsibility for recent
attacks, has not yet been verified.</i>

49
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:38,079
<i>-How many people are there?
-Four people.</i>

50
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:42,359
<i>-Have you identified them?
-No, but it's two men and two women.</i>

51
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,919
<i>We think they're involved
in the harbor explosion.</i>

52
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,439
<i>How did they kill themselves?</i>

53
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,199
<i>Some kind of poison.
That's all we know presently.</i>

54
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:55,799
<i>We heard they killed themselves
when the police came.</i>

55
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,079
<i>I can't speak to that.</i>

56
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:03,359
<i>-Did they feel cornered by the police?
-I don't want to speculate.</i>

57
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,319
<i>-Did they leave a message?
-No comment...</i>

58
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
Linus!

59
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,559
Hey...

60
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,999
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,039
<i>Police have thus far
not named the victims.</i>

62
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,879
<i>We don't know how they
ended up in the container.</i>

63
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,519
<i>We believe it's four people -
two men and two women.</i>

64
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:56,039
<i>Yes, it's four people. We have not
yet been able to make a positive ID.</i>

65
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,359
<i>We believe these people
are connected to the recent attacks.</i>

66
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:10,719
<i>Evidence suggests use of poison,
but it's too early to say.</i>

67
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,719
<i>-Could it be a mass suicide?
-I can't comment on that.</i>

68
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,919
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

69
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,839
Julian. Mathilde's brother.
Who are you?

70
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,839
<i>This is Martin Rohde,
Copenhagen Police.</i>

71
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:54,479
<i>I'd like to talk to you about
your sister. Where are you?</i>

72
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,199
I'm at home. What's this about?

73
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,999
<i>Is Mathilde there?</i>

74
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,839
-Where do you live?
<i>-52 Aksel Heides Gade.</i>

75
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:09,359
-I'll be there in 30 minutes.
-OK...

76
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,639
<i>This is where police this morning
found four bodies in a container.</i>

77
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:19,999
<i>There is a flurry of activity here,
with both Swedish and Danish police...</i>

78
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:43,759
-Is this your sister?
-Yes. That's Mathilde.

79
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
-Are you positive?
-Yes, I...

80
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,559
Yes.

81
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,359
She was supposed to be here
for breakfast. She's always broke.

82
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:05,639
-Were you close?
-Yes, in a way.

83
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,639
We liked seeing each other,
but led very different lives.

84
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,919
-Did she really like you?
-What do you mean by that?

85
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:17,439
You seem to represent
everything she opposed.

86
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,439
As I said, we led different lives.

87
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:26,639
-Did you have friends in common?
-No.

88
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,799
-Did she ever talk about her friends?
-Yes, sometimes.

89
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,519
Did she mention any names?

90
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:41,399
There was a Swedish girl.
Her name might have been Kattis.

91
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,199
-I think she was dating a Mads...
-Mads Nielsen?

92
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,719
-Yes, I think that was his name.
-Any other names?

93
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,839
-Not that I can think of.
-When did you last see her?

94
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:58,879
Yesterday. At our father's.
We have lunch once a week.

95
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,199
-How did she seem?
-Normal.

96
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,639
-Could you sit down?
-Why?

97
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,039
-I don't care for your pacing.
-I'm not touching anything.

98
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,799
No, but it's...

99
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,599
OK.

100
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,959
It's almost as if
you don't <i>want</i> people to like you.

101
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:26,879
You've lost a sister. Imagine to be told
she probably didn't like you.

102
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,399
-But she <i>didn't</i> like me.
-Didn't you live together?

103
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,039
Yes. She liked me better than our
parents and was too young to live alone.

104
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,999
-Was she like you?
-No, she was normal.

105
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:44,439
Rather popular. That's why people were
so surprised when she killed herself.

106
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,439
-We hope you'll do it.
-I'm here because Boris was poisoned.

107
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:35,399
If you wanted me so badly,
why wasn't I your first choice?

108
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,839
No particular reason. You're both
highly sought-after speakers.

109
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,439
You're both well-respected
within your respective fields.

110
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:48,599
-We could only hire one of you.
-I'd be delighted to do it.

111
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,119
Thank you. Thank you so much.

112
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,479
-What happens now?
-A lot.

113
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,159
I'm sure, but what do I need to do?

114
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,159
Right now, we need the title
and an outline of your speech.

115
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,959
-For when?
-Yesterday. It's for the program.

116
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,439
What was Boris' speech about?

117
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:10,799
It was called
"Local actions, global challenges."

118
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,839
Seriously? That could be anything.
You know what? Keep it in.

119
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:20,679
-Are you sure?
-No one really listens, anyway.

120
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,919
Katarina Lövgren, age 24,
Swedish, single.

121
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,799
Mathilde Madsen, age 25, Danish, single.
Copenhagen residents. That's it for now.

122
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,159
We're profiling them,
talking to relatives and friends...

123
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,839
I want computers,
phones, diaries - everything.

124
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:48,359
-Diaries?
-Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blogs...

125
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,079
Have we ruled out suicide?
I mean, what's the motive?

126
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,239
They were liabilities.
We'd ID'd two of them.

127
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,079
A network disposes of those
who threaten to expose it.

128
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:02,879
Until further notice,
this is a murder investigation.

129
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,039
-Where are you going?
-Tell Linus Svensson about his brother.

130
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,039
Um... Linus knows Niklas is dead.

131
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,199
-Why did you tell him?
-I didn't, he saw it on TV.

132
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:22,759
-Why was he watching TV?
-That was my bad. That's on me.

133
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,239
-But he knows.
-Yes, that was stupid.

134
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,999
Yep...

135
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,079
Hi...

136
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:39,719
-Andrea Melin, social services.
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

137
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,199
-Do you know how long this will take?
-No.

138
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:47,839
I'm about to show you some pictures.
Tell me if it's your brother.

139
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:52,199
-Excuse me, is this necessary?
-Yes.

140
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:55,839
Linus, is this your brother
Niklas Svensson?

141
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,719
I want you to say it and point him out.

142
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,159
-That's my brother.
-Great. Thanks.

143
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:08,799
-It's my fault.
-What's your fault?

144
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,359
You found him because
I called him, didn't you?

145
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,519
Yes.

146
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,119
-Are we done here?
-No. We also need to question him.

147
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,919
Linus, did you know
what your brother was doing?

148
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,919
I don't mean being a lab technician,
I mean the other stuff - the attacks.

149
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:38,759
Tell them as much as you know.
You're not accused of anything.

150
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,719
Not for the time being.
Did you know what he was doing?

151
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,559
Do you know who
he was doing it with?

152
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,799
Where was he
when he wasn't at home?

153
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,999
Did your brother have a lot of friends?

154
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,679
Did you get a lot of visitors at home?

155
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,559
No.

156
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,399
Let's take a break. If you think
of anything, tell Andrea here.

157
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,719
She can then tell us. OK?

158
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,839
We did get one... Yesterday.

159
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:42,319
-One what?
-Visitor, at home.

160
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:45,479
-Outside.
-Did you know him?

161
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:49,439
They met outside.
I saw them from the balcony.

162
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:53,799
-What did he look like?
-Like...normal.

163
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,799
-Was it him?
-No.

164
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,159
Anything special about him?
Hair? Beard? Tattoos?

165
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,839
What if I've done something illegal?
Would I go to jail?

166
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:16,919
-No, you're too young.
-Juvenile detention, maybe.

167
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:21,239
You won't go to jail, I promise you.
Just tell me what happened.

168
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,719
-I tagged his car.
-You put your signature on his car?

169
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,079
-On the one side.
-What kind of car?

170
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,999
I don't know. It was light...metallic.

171
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,279
Can you draw what you did here?

172
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,359
Denmark sent their files.
You want Katarina or Mathilde?

173
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,839
-Katarina.
-I'll email you everything.

174
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,839
THE MAN...

175
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:21,439
...AGE 30-35...

176
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,999
BLACK JACKET

177
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,359
BLUE JACKET

178
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:55,119
There's this witness, a neighbor
looking through the peephole...

179
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,399
A man was assaulted outside
Katarina's door the day she died.

180
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,239
-It needs to go on the wall.
-Sure.

181
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:06,919
Tell all units in Sweden and Denmark
to look for a car with that tag.

182
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,439
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

183
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,479
Rasmus, call all the body shops.
If it was my car, I'd get that fixed.

184
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,999
-Absolutely.
-Martin?

185
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,999
Cheers.

186
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,999
It's what I always say, problems are
there for us to celebrate a solution.

187
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,119
-Viktoria. I couldn't figure her out.
-What's to figure out?

188
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,959
She's giving a lecture,
you're not moving in together.

189
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:43,519
Alexander actually got me
something else last night. A boob job.

190
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:49,319
-Breast implants.
-You're lying.

191
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,999
Caroline! I'm sorry!

192
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,719
This completely changes
my opinion of Alexander.

193
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:07,239
-He knows exactly what a woman wants.
-He does?

194
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:11,639
Someone offers me a lift, I get down
on my knees and thank him.

195
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,799
-Bodil...
-Things only go one way, that's down.

196
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:19,519
It was the most
humiliating experience of my life.

197
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,319
He said it was for me,
because I'd been griping about it.

198
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:29,239
I've been griping about the sunshade.
He's done nothing about that.

199
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:33,119
Of course it's for him.
Isn't a little spark worth it?

200
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,559
It shouldn't be necessary.

201
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,319
-Did you call that number?
-Stop it.

202
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:46,239
-It's someone who loves you for you.
-It's someone who wants to bang me.

203
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:49,399
And to flirt with you!
And to lust for you!

204
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,719
And to give it to you good!
Everything Alexander can't give you.

205
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,319
-You're not coming in?
-No, this is your department.

206
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:13,439
I'm calling home.
Nikolaj fell ill last night.

207
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,599
Saga?

208
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,639
My son Nikolaj fell ill last night.

209
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,279
Right, I hope he feels better today.

210
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,599
Go be with your dead bodies.

211
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,479
Did they kill themselves?

212
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:39,159
They all had traces
of an ampoule in their mouths.

213
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,319
One ampoule kills within seconds.

214
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:47,559
The poison is identical to the one
injected in the groceries.

215
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:52,639
This is the first victim
of the poisoned groceries.

216
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,239
This one is from the container.

217
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:04,399
Their symptoms are almost identical,
but tiny differences can be spotted.

218
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,039
Pinkish hue.

219
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:16,959
Greenish <i>livor mortis</i>
suggests cyanide poisoning.

220
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,199
Traces of foaming mucus
at the mouth from hyperventilating...

221
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,519
...due to reduced oxygen uptake.

222
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,759
No signs of struggle from
having been force-fed the poison.

223
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,799
Identical symptoms.

224
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,679
She's got a higher concentration
of cyanide in the skin.

225
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,759
And traces in the mucous membrane.

226
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,119
"Swellings and bruises on her hand
above the little finger."

227
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,759
She was pounding hard on the wall,
struggling to get out.

228
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:32,519
It took time. More time
than an ampoule would have taken.

229
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,639
-She was gassed.
-Yes.

230
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,679
I was <i>almost</i> starting to get worried.

231
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,879
-Is this a good time?
-Sure.

232
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,039
I got the pictures.

233
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:13,999
-Which one do you like?
-They're all good.

234
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,599
-Were they taken before the...?
-No, they're all new.

235
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,119
This is the best one.
Thank you, Dharma.

236
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,159
-Do you want to close the door?
-Of course.

237
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,719
Hi, is this Claudio? Hello.

238
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:58,679
My name is Caroline.
My sister Bodil gave me your number.

239
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,639
Close the door.

240
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,719
We can rule out suicide.
They died from inhaling palytoxin.

241
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,879
-They were gassed?
-Yes.

242
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,199
They were locked in,
and gas was pumped in.

243
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,319
The killer aired out the gas,
positioned the bodies and wrote a sign.

244
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:02,719
-Why isn't Linus in a foster home yet?
-They're doing the paperwork now.

245
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:16,759
You said before you thought it was
your fault your brother died. Why?

246
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,479
-I was the one who called him.
-Yes?

247
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,119
On TV, they said they died
because you guys were coming.

248
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,959
You said you went there
because of my phone call.

249
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,719
They didn't commit suicide.
They were murdered.

250
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:36,999
Your call made no difference.
They would have died either way.

251
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,599
So it wasn't your fault.

252
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:45,679
So blaming yourself is just dumb.

253
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:57,239
Thank you.

254
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,759
You're welcome.

255
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:09,959
-Saga, take a look at this. That guy.
-Who's that?

256
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:15,079
A man who was assaulted in Katarina's
building a few hours before her death.

257
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,439
-By who?
-Two women.

258
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,519
Katarina and possibly Mathilde.

259
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,039
Check any assault charges
brought that day.

260
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:27,559
Five, nine, seven, fifteen.

261
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:30,199
I found it. I found the car.

262
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:36,799
An auto paint shop in Brønshøj took in
a champagne-colored Audi A7 Quattro.

263
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:43,279
Tagged on one side.
Registration number is TS59715.

264
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:49,079
-John?
-Hang on, hang on...

265
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:53,839
Belongs to a Julian Madsen. Isn't that
the same last name as Mathilde?

266
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,199
For fuck's sake, that's her brother.

267
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:08,679
To be sent within a week...
I'm going to call you back.

268
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,479
Copenhagen Police.
Is Julian Madsen here?

269
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:15,079
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Where is his office?

270
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,559
There, but he hasn't come in today.

271
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:22,479
This is a warrant to seize computers,
servers, hard drives - everything.

272
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:25,479
-You know where we can reach him?
-No...

273
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,519
-Have you tried him at home?
-Yeah...

274
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,919
-When did you last see him?
-Yesterday afternoon.

275
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,199
What do you want him for?

276
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,199
Do you manage Julian's calendar?

277
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,519
No, I'm not his secretary.
He manages his own.

278
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,239
-Did you take his car to the body shop?
-He asked me. He's my boss.

279
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:04,839
And now you don't know where he is?
Call me as soon as you hear from him.

280
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:08,759
-You realize it's important?
-Absolutely.

281
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:20,159
Age 31, studied at the IT University
and MIT in Massachusetts.

282
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,159
18 employees. Last year's turnover
was 83 million kroner.

283
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,919
How's a guy like that
involved in this?

284
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,359
Martin! A word?

285
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,279
How are you?

286
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:44,879
-What the fuck do you mean by that?
-I talked to Niels.

287
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,199
-You really want to keep seeing Jens?
-Why? Niels doesn't want me to?

288
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,039
-He struggles to see the point.
-After one week?

289
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,199
Is it really helping, Martin?

290
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,639
It will. I know it will.

291
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,439
-We're going by Mette.
-Why?

292
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,679
-To see Nikolaj.
-But he's sick?

293
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,839
Yes, that's why.

294
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:25,079
-This is where she lives?
-Yes.

295
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:28,639
-The last one was much nicer.
-Mette thinks so, too.

296
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,799
Hello?

297
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:44,679
-Hi! I thought I heard something.
-This is Simon and Sanne.

298
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,559
Simon and Sanne, this is Saga Norén,
Malmö County Police.

299
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:53,759
This is Anna-Dea.
We couldn't cope without her.

300
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:02,239
Hey, champ.
Hi... How are you doing?

301
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,239
-OK.
-Is it boring, being sick?

302
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,559
-You reading this one?
-Yes, Anna-Dea reads it to me.

303
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:18,039
-Should I read it to you?
-Please.

304
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,199
All right, scooch over.

305
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,319
Go on. Here we go, sit up...

306
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:40,839
Aren't they adorable? I love kids.

307
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,919
-Why?
-Because they're kids.

308
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:50,319
They're just lovely. And I'm
sort of an extra mom to them.

309
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:55,439
Martin's gone and Mette works a lot.
I don't know what they'd do without me.

310
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,559
-Get another nanny.
-It's not that simple.

311
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,079
Why? Are you specially trained?

312
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,719
No. But you heard what Martin said,
they couldn't cope without me.

313
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:11,279
He didn't mean you specifically,
he meant the services you provide.

314
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:14,559
You're replaceable.

315
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,799
Shall we go? He's asleep.
He drifted off when I started reading.

316
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:27,319
I'll check on him later
and give him something to drink.

317
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:30,399
-You're the best, you know that?
-Thanks.

318
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,399
-Laura...
-Fuck!

319
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,559
You scared the shit out of me.

320
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:48,599
-Are they still there?
-No, but they took a bunch of stuff.

321
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,279
Computers, servers...

322
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:00,239
-What the hell did you do?
-I can't tell you, but I'm fucked.

323
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,599
I need your help.
I didn't know who else to ask.

324
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,839
One of the cops gave me his card.

325
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:16,719
I promised to call him
in case you got in touch.

326
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,359
-You get 5,000 kroner if you help me.
-With what?

327
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,639
First, to get me out of here.
Then I need a computer.

328
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,199
-What did you do?
-10,000 kroner, no more questions.

329
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,519
Deal?

330
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,959
Yes.

331
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,119
-You've got a lovely home.
-Thank you.

332
00:34:55,279 --> 00:35:00,639
-Have you lived here long?
-Yes, seven years. If that's long.

333
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,959
-Do you like it here?
-I do, very much.

334
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,119
There's not going to be a husband
coming home all of a sudden?

335
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:12,559
No, no! He's away on business, so...

336
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,279
No need to explain.
Just wanted to make sure.

337
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:31,479
You want something to drink?
Water? Coffee? Wine?

338
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,199
No. Thanks, though.

339
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,559
-Maybe one glass of wine.
-OK.

340
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:03,519
-Thank you. Cheers, Caroline.
-Cheers.

341
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,679
It could be more chilled.
I think I've got one that's...

342
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,839
Caroline. It tastes fine.

343
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:17,119
It's fine.

344
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,279
Listen...

345
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,959
We won't do anything
you don't want to do.

346
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,639
OK?

347
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:43,799
You're in charge.

348
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,999
Unless you really want me
to take charge.

349
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,719
Yeah? OK.

350
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:26,599
No! No, I can't.

351
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:30,639
I can't do it. I just can't.

352
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:34,439
I think you should go.
I'm really sorry.

353
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,759
Maybe you just need
a little more convincing.

354
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:40,279
No...

355
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:45,479
You want me in charge, right?
Yeah, you want me in charge.

356
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,399
No, don't!

357
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,399
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I don't know how payment works...?

358
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,319
-Right, it's 1,500 kroner.
-1,500 kroner?

359
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:08,879
ALARM DEACTIVATED

360
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,439
You've got her picture on your desk.
How do you know her?

361
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,079
The deal was no questions.

362
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,399
She was my sister. Mathilde.

363
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,639
-And she's dead?
-She was murdered last night.

364
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,279
-The police thought you did it?
-It's complicated, but it wasn't me.

365
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,599
-So who was it?
-I don't know. Yet.

366
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,719
-Any of those cams work?
-Yes, why?

367
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:08,119
I'm meeting someone tonight.
You film it, you get another 5,000.

368
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:12,679
-Why not go to the police?
-Forget it, I shouldn't have asked you.

369
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,599
What was I thinking?
Thank you for your help.

370
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,679
Wait.

371
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,039
Let's call it a night.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

372
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,679
-Can I ride with you?
-Of course.

373
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,879
-You don't have a car?
-No.

374
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:09,279
Bye, Saga.

375
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,959
Well, thank you for the ride.

376
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,759
No problem at all.
No need to thank me every time.

377
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:37,959
-OK. Have a great evening.
-You, too.

378
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,519
-See you tomorrow.
-Yes.

379
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,359
No, I'm sorry. Sorry.

380
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:05,279
It's OK.

381
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,679
-You don't want to come up?
-I can't.

382
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:20,919
OK.

383
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:25,639
-See you tomorrow.
-Yep.

384
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:50,319
I saw you and Lillian on TV today.

385
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:54,079
Interesting case.
I've been following it in the papers.

386
00:42:55,759 --> 00:43:00,119
I was just wondering,
why do they use a frog as a symbol?

387
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:11,199
All right. What do you want
to talk about? Mette? The kids?

388
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:15,319
-August?
-Saga asked about you.

389
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:19,679
-Today?
-No, a year ago, while chasing you.

390
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,799
I told her it couldn't be you.
That you weren't that type of person.

391
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:28,399
You were mistaken.

392
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,439
All that single-minded anger.
The focus you had.

393
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,999
That can't be you. It was some other
Jens who killed all those people.

394
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:44,519
The Jens I knew, where did he go?

395
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,599
He died. You got in bed with his wife
and killed his son.

396
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:55,959
You know what I think? I think you're
fighting to keep the old Jens at bay.

397
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,079
Sounds exciting. Are you trying
to say I'm a schizophrenic?

398
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:05,279
I'm trying to say you're human.
That you're in there, I can see it.

399
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:08,919
And I want to try to talk to you.

400
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,519
I decide if we meet or not.

401
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,879
I'll see you, then.

402
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,399
-Say hi to Mette.
-Will do.

403
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,599
-Hi there.
-How did you get in?

404
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:50,279
-Your colleagues let me in.
-Sloppy. They don't know you.

405
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,799
I brought food.
I thought you'd be hungry.

406
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,959
Yes.

407
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,479
You get to choose between chicken
and... This is chicken, too.

408
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,959
OK, you don't get to choose.

409
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:16,439
-What are you doing?
-Working.

410
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,479
What are you working on?
What's all this?

411
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:25,639
I'm examining evidence we seized
for anything that might help our case.

412
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:27,799
What's this?

413
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,159
It's a list.

414
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,679
I don't know... Put it back.
You need to go.

415
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,639
-I just got here.
-I need to focus.

416
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:41,439
-I can't focus if you're here.
-You keep thinking about my body?

417
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,799
No, because you're a disruption.

418
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,879
And they say romance is dead...

419
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,319
What do you mean?

420
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:02,039
-Was it any good?
-Yeah...

421
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:13,039
-I need to show you something.
-You need to go.

422
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,999
Here. Leave the same way you came.

423
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,599
Julian's phone company
sent through his records.

424
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:28,719
Here, he got a text at 3.18 p.m.
Then he turned off his phone.

425
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:32,119
It came from this number.
A Laura Möllberg.

426
00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:36,239
His receptionist. She tipped him off.

427
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:51,559
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Laura Möllberg?

428
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:53,719
She's not home.

429
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:55,919
-We know each other.
-Yes.

430
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,839
-I showed you the footage of the boat.
-The ship. I know.

431
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,199
-You recognize him?
-Yes. He was here this afternoon.

432
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:14,079
They've been here. A camera's missing
and Laura had used the computer.

433
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,759
How does your daughter know
Julian Madsen?

434
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,719
She works for him.
I don't know in what capacity.

435
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:24,679
Did they say where they were going?

436
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:31,359
I don't know, I wasn't home then.
I saw them on the home security system.

437
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,039
-Call her.
-I've tried numerous times. It's off.

438
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,479
They used the computer,
so we'll take it with us.

439
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,759
OK...

440
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,839
That's where we're meeting.
Try to find a vantage point.

441
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:07,479
Just shoot whatever happens.
Try to get our faces on camera. OK?

442
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:09,999
OK.

443
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,799
-We're up. What do you want to see?
-The latest activity.

444
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:17,839
The first thing is a visit to a site
called "Children and Parents".

445
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:24,639
Someone logged in with the handle
"Stressed Out Dad" at 6.29 p.m.

446
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:28,999
and chatted with someone
called "Mother Of Three."

447
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:34,119
Just one message sent. "D. 10 p.m."

448
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:37,039
10 p.m., sure. But D?

449
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,839
-What have you got?
-Come on.

450
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:58,319
Look at this. A letter, and coordinates.
Latitude and longitude, put together.

451
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:02,399
-It's this location...at 10 p.m.
-One second.

452
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,079
Malmö Stadium.

453
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,999
Set up a perimeter,
and make sure no one gets in or out.

454
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:09,799
No, no, no!

455
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,319
Come on, come on!

456
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:25,399
Come on...

457
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,919
Come on!

458
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,319
Martin here.

459
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,439
They just hung up.

460
00:52:52,439 --> 00:52:54,839
I don't recognize the number.

461
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,599
<i>Hi, it's Laura,
I can't take your call right now...</i>

462
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:14,279
There!

463
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,719
She's been shot.

464
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,919
-This one's locked.
-Watch out.

465
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:40,559
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Send an ambulance to Malmö Stadium.

466
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:42,719
-Is she breathing?
-Yes!

467
00:53:56,999 --> 00:54:00,599
-Find anything?
-No camera in the car.

468
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:04,959
-Julian probably took it.
-Why would he want to shoot Laura?

469
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,359
-He doesn't need her anymore.
-He was meeting someone here.

470
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,239
-Why bring a camera to a meeting?
-To record it.

471
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:18,159
So she needs to be hidden,
but also get good footage.

472
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:26,239
Up on the roof there.

473
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,599
-Right here, right?
-Yes.

474
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:42,719
There it is.

475
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,439
The memory card is missing.

476
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:53,879
It's right here.

477
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:57,199
That's perfect.

478
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:47,559
Oh, hey.

479
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,319
-I'm sorry if I woke you.
-No, I was waiting for you.

480
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:57,919
-You're a bit late.
-The flight was delayed.

481
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,519
Really? I checked online.
It said it had landed on time.

482
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:04,879
Well, it didn't.

483
00:56:10,759 --> 00:56:14,239
-Who was here?
-No one.

484
00:56:14,399 --> 00:56:18,159
Because I saw two wine glasses
in the kitchen.

485
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,199
That was just Bodil, she stopped by.

486
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:26,799
-Oh, Bodil. That must have been nice.
-Yes, it was.

487
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,839
-Get in.
-I'm tired. Can't we just go to sleep?

488
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,999
-Yes. Of course.
-Good night, honey.

489
00:57:08,439 --> 00:57:11,239
-Any news from the hospital?
-Nothing yet.

490
00:57:11,399 --> 00:57:14,759
John checked the chat.
