1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,159
-Who owns the boat?
-Marcus Stenberg.

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,359
Why would anyone steal your ship,
chain five people and run it aground?

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:18,999
Negative human impact
on the environment - hence the symbol.

4
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,999
A pathos-driven eco-terrorism of sorts?

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,959
It could be a Niklas Svensson
at Medisonus in Copenhagen.

6
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,519
We specialize in third-world
vaccines and maladies.

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,719
-Niklas Svensson?
-You'll get a report on his projects.

8
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:41,719
Someone logged in
with the handle "Mother Of Three".

9
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:46,519
-I can't recall.
-You traced Mother Of Three?

10
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,439
Not yet, but they've discussed
a "birthday party" and a "graduation."

11
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,999
I get a text with a pick-up location.
I let it disappear with the other waste.

12
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,999
I'd like for you to do
my sister Viktoria's memoirs.

13
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,199
-How is she?
-The doctors give her six months.

14
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,759
-Tell me something no one knows.
-I'm fucking my sister's husband.

15
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:13,079
-What's my phone doing here?
-How should I know?

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,559
He took his wife's cell phone.

17
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,199
He set up a meeting and beat him up.

18
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,399
Some divers found a boat
with seven corpses.

19
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,959
<i>-Marcus Stenberg.</i>
-I'm the one who sank your boat.

20
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,519
You forgot to tell me
there were seven people in it.

21
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,679
It's going to cost you.

22
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,319
EPISODE 7

23
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,959
Hey.

24
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,599
-Any luck?
-Nothing. What about over here?

25
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,919
-Same here.
-We'll have to try some other time.

26
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,759
-Or we could go fishing.
-That doesn't count.

27
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,439
-It's killing your own food.
-I just changed my list.

28
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,799
I need to shoot my own food.

29
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,239
-What are you doing?
-I'll be right back.

30
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,999
-Viktoria?
-Wait, I'll be right back.

31
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,239
<i>I'm the one who sank your boat.</i>

32
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,239
<i>You forgot to tell me
there were seven people in it.</i>

33
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,879
<i>It's going to cost you.</i>

34
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,319
<i>-Who is this?
-I sank your boat.</i>

35
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,319
<i>I want 100,000 kroner
or I'll tell the police.</i>

36
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,999
We tap your phone,
and he calls you. Who is he?

37
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,639
-I've got nothing to do with this.
-It's the third time you're here.

38
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:01,999
-But I've got nothing to do with this!
-The caller implied the opposite.

39
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:06,479
Yes, but I don't know this person.
I didn't...

40
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,199
I didn't ask anyone to sink my boat.
It was stolen when I was on vacation.

41
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:18,399
So someone steals your boat and sinks it
with seven people on board...

42
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,879
-Nine years later they blackmail you.
-Yes, it...

43
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,759
-And you're clueless?
-It sounds totally nuts, but...yes.

44
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,679
-But I don't believe you. Do you?
-The coincidence is highly unlikely.

45
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,759
Especially since the ship
that ran aground was yours, too.

46
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,839
So she doesn't believe you, either.

47
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,119
I hope you don't have any plans today.
This will take a while.

48
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,679
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

49
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,359
-Did you get anything?
-Yes, kind of.

50
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,799
-What's that?
-It's a hen.

51
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,439
-What will you do with it?
-Not me. You.

52
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,679
I'm thinking something with curry
for dinner tonight.

53
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,119
I'm taking a shower.
Then I'm going to work.

54
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,279
-Thanks for taking me out.
-No problem. I had a good time.

55
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:22,439
Where did you get the hen?

56
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,479
We drove onto a farm.
I went in and shot it.

57
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,679
It was easy, it was caged.

58
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,639
Tattoos, Fugu, now you've shot a hen.

59
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:36,399
-Is this as insane as it gets?
-I don't know.

60
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,599
Hey...

61
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:48,519
-I know how you feel.
-No, you have no fucking idea.

62
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,959
I'm doing all I can to help you.

63
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:58,319
That's not very much,
you know it and I know it.

64
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,479
Hey, I'm sorry.

65
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,359
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,439
I'm tired, and I'm a little achy.

67
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,719
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:32,559
Well... You bring the wine.

69
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:37,519
Will do. See you.

70
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,919
-Did she leave?
-Yes.

71
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,639
-Why don't you join me?
-I have to tend to this thing.

72
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:59,799
No. It's not flying anywhere.

73
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
Come on.

74
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,959
-Julian Madsen?
-No.

75
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,959
-Look at the picture.
-No.

76
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,079
Where do you get your IT set-up from?

77
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,039
I'm not the IT manager,
but I can find out.

78
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,759
-You know Claus Damgaard?
-No.

79
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,559
-He goes by Claudio.
-I don't know a Claus or a Claudio.

80
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:31,639
Where were you last Thursday
between 12 and 3 p.m.?

81
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:35,639
-I don't know.
-You tried to kill Laura Möllberg again.

82
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,319
-I don't know a Laura Möllberg!
-Look at the picture.

83
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,999
I'm looking at it,
and I don't know a Laura Möllberg.

84
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,559
Here's a list with times and dates.
Write where you were.

85
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,839
-I need my calendar for that.
-Where is it?

86
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,999
In my phone.

87
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:07,439
I need Marcus Stenberg's phone.
Are you done with it?

88
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:10,879
Yeah, nothing tying him
to anything or anyone.

89
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
Thanks.

90
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,119
I've got nothing on the 18th.

91
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,639
Of course not.

92
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,119
PRIVATE NUMBER

93
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,959
Pick up on speaker.
Don't mention us or where you are.

94
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,279
-Marcus Stenberg.
<i>-Got the money?</i>

95
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,359
-No, not yet.
<i>-I want them in an hour.</i>

96
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,439
-I need more time for that kind of sum.
<i>-How much more time?</i>

97
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,959
Three hours.

98
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,159
<i>-Where are you now?</i>
-Malmö.

99
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:22,079
<i>OK, listen. Meet me on the footbridge
by Svågertorp station in three hours.</i>

100
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,559
I'll be there.

101
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,079
-So how do we do this?
-Hang on, I need to... There we go.

102
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,439
Right. Well, how do you want to do it?

103
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,599
Asking me questions seems easiest.
This can't take all day.

104
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:57,359
OK... What are your thoughts
when you hear the word "passion"?

105
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,079
What the hell kind of question is that?

106
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:04,239
Your passion, what's important to you,
it says who you are.

107
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,279
I don't want this book to be some mushy
inspiration piece for other women.

108
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:15,119
-How do you want it to be, then?
-Honest.

109
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,919
It will be if you answer in honesty.

110
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,239
Well, ask questions that make sense.

111
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,519
OK. OK...

112
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,719
I'll start a sentence and then you say
the first thing that comes to mind.

113
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,879
-Sure.
-I am...

114
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,199
-Lonely.
-OK...

115
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,599
That's not how you come across.

116
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,239
-Was that the wrong answer?
-No, no. There are no wrong answers.

117
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,839
I just thought...
Your brother lives across the street...

118
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,959
But we're not talking
about him now, are we?

119
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:59,199
No. All right, let's keep going.

120
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,079
I am not...

121
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,839
Content.

122
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,759
-Not with anything?
-No.

123
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,079
<i>I'm very hard to please, I think.</i>

124
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,239
<i>I would never allow...</i>

125
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,279
<i>...anything to stand in my way.</i>

126
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:36,599
We need to decide
if we want bottled or tap water.

127
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,879
-Your call.
-Tap water saves us 50 percent.

128
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:46,639
We'll take that, then. After all,
it's an environmental conference.

129
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,079
How are you?

130
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:54,799
-I'm getting a divorce.
-I'm sorry.

131
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,439
-You know what he did, right?
-Yes, it's in the papers.

132
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:04,519
It says "crime of passion"
but I didn't have sex with him.

133
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,639
-I didn't read anything about that.
-It seems like you're the only one.

134
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,999
Let me know
if there's anything I can do.

135
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,599
Yes, actually there is.

136
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,639
Can you have a look at this one, too?

137
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,079
Of course.

138
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,999
<i>OK, listen up. Stenberg is approaching.</i>

139
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:55,039
<i>Isak, in position in the tunnel.</i>

140
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,639
<i>OK, we'll hang back. Let us know
when Stenberg is in position.</i>

141
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,799
<i>Marcus, stop looking at us.</i>

142
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,319
-Is that him?
-How should I know?

143
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:04,599
I don't know what he looks like.

144
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,599
He's waiting for someone.

145
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,239
Marcus... Establish contact.

146
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,559
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

147
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,359
Is it me...you're looking for?

148
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,519
Who the hell are you?

149
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,519
Go!

150
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,039
Don't move!

151
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:17,079
Ramon Bodski: multiple charges,
you did three years for robbery.

152
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:21,999
-I've stayed away from that shit since.
-Except for blackmail.

153
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:25,759
Nine years ago you sank this boat.

154
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,559
I didn't know there were people in it.

155
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,199
What happened?

156
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,479
-I was contacted.
-By whom, and when?

157
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:46,279
He called... A man called me.

158
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:50,639
He offered me 25,000 kroner
to sink his boat.

159
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,999
-Was it Marcus Stenberg, the owner?
-Yes, that's what he said.

160
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,119
It was an insurance thing.
I didn't know about the people.

161
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,679
"Who the hell are you?" you said
when you saw him at the station.

162
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,639
That was Marcus Stenberg,
the boat's owner.

163
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,119
-No, he didn't ask me to sink it.
-Sure? It's been nine years.

164
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,799
-It wasn't him.
-So what did he look like?

165
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,679
Not like that, that's for sure.

166
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,439
-Describe him to a composite artist.
-It's been nine years.

167
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,399
-But you weren't thrown on the phone.
-By what?

168
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,759
By the language. So the man
who hired you spoke Swedish?

169
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,279
Yes.

170
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,799
The statute on the insurance fraud is up.

171
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:48,959
-Ramon was our only tie to the murders.
-Do we really think he was clueless?

172
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:54,359
If I wanted my boat sunk I'd never say
my name. I say Stenberg's being framed.

173
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:57,239
So we need to focus on him.

174
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,239
Get a background check on him.
Ex-wives, colleagues...

175
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:04,239
-We did that.
-Do it over.

176
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,919
-What about Ramon?
-We hold him on the blackmail charge?

177
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,359
Hans is talking to the prosecutor.

178
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,879
-Yes? What do you want?
<i>-It's Hans.</i>

179
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,999
-Yes, I know. What do you want?
-I want you all to get here.

180
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,599
Romstock chemical company.
They make propylene oxide.

181
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,999
The cooling system collapsed
about 30 minutes ago.

182
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,679
This plant is controversial.
There's a drinking water basin nearby.

183
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,839
The leak is major.
They've evacuated surrounding buildings.

184
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,239
Don't they have a security system?

185
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:11,559
Two automatic, one manual.
None of them worked.

186
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:16,519
This was delivered express, minutes
before the cooling system collapsed.

187
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,399
Hey...

188
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:41,359
How are you? Hey, honey, it's Daddy.

189
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,399
Were you dreaming?

190
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,599
You were dreaming, weren't you?

191
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,159
What's the matter?

192
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,999
I saw him.

193
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,079
I saw the man who shot me.
In my dream, I saw him!

194
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:12,959
-We have to call the police.
-Sure, I will. Right away.

195
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,199
-Now!
-Relax, I will.

196
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,359
You just relax.

197
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,439
-What did they say?
-They weren't in.

198
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,959
-They were busy with something urgent.
-With what?

199
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,439
I don't know what.
I never got to talk to them.

200
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,959
They were out. I left a message.

201
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:25,199
The package had been sitting at the depot
for two weeks before being delivered.

202
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,399
-They know who left it?
-Yep. Niklas Svensson.

203
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,399
The delivery guy was able to finger him.

204
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,279
Svensson had asked that the package be
delivered today between 12.30 and 1 p.m.

205
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:41,879
You're right, Saga.
He's not starting a new cell.

206
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,319
-It's not needed.
-He's getting more invisible.

207
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:50,079
-No one's invisible.
-No. I didn't mean it literally.

208
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:55,519
No, neither did I. You meant,
everyone leaves a trace, right? Me, too.

209
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,119
I talked to Lillian.
We'll keep quiet about the golden toad.

210
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,159
We don't want to people to panic.
They think it's over.

211
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,799
-But it's not over.
-Saga? You have a visitor.

212
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,199
-So this is where you work?
-Yes. What do you want?

213
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,359
I wanted to say goodbye.
I go back today.

214
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,119
It's been very...interesting
spending this time with you guys.

215
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:36,999
Many people use "interesting" if they
dislike something, but won't admit it.

216
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,159
Is that so?

217
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,039
-What did I do wrong?
-You didn't do anything wrong.

218
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:51,759
You're just a little too...outspoken
for my taste, to be honest.

219
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,279
And you seem to be totally
and utterly uninterested

220
00:23:56,439 --> 00:24:00,959
in everything outside your own world.

221
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,439
Then why are you here?

222
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:10,599
I'd like to ask you something personal,
though maybe it's none of my business.

223
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,079
-If you think about the future...
-I don't think about the future.

224
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:18,439
OK, say you're making plans.

225
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,879
Do you see yourself with Jakob?
Do you see any children?

226
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,439
-You want to be a grandmother!
-I am.

227
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:31,679
Jakob has a brother with two daughters.
You have a picture of them at home.

228
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,959
Oh.

229
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,119
Saga, Jakob is very much
in love with you.

230
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,279
Yes.

231
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,799
-Are you in love with him?
-I'm his girlfriend.

232
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:58,119
-Is that going OK, you think?
-I doubt it.

233
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,319
You can go in and save her, if you want.
We have a hit on the breast implant.

234
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:08,479
It's from a Danish company, Esteem.
Sold to the West clinic in 2000.

235
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:14,359
-Perfect. Nice work.
-And... then there's the suicide.

236
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,119
Saga's sister was called Jennifer Norén.

237
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,199
-Should you really read it?
-Why not?

238
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:29,119
If she wanted you to know,
she probably would've told you.

239
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,759
Yeah, probably.

240
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:44,439
Sorry to disturb. I'm Martin Rohde,
Saga's colleague. Sorry, we need to go.

241
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,599
Here. The breast implants.

242
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:49,879
-OK. You're coming?
-Yes.

243
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:55,479
-Pernille can see you out.
-Thanks, I'll manage.

244
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,679
Things went well today again
with the in-law?

245
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,159
-A little worse, I think.
-What did you talk about?

246
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,199
She asked if I wanted kids
and if I was in love with Jakob.

247
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,399
-And what did you answer?
-I didn't, really.

248
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,639
Why not just say
you were in love with Jakob?

249
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,319
If I had been in love, my brain would
have released serotonin or dopamine.

250
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:30,399
I'd feel euphoria,
happiness or contentment.

251
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,239
-So love to you is a chemical reaction?
-Not just me, all people. It's science.

252
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,079
-So maybe it went a little worse.
-Yes.

253
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,599
That's what I said.

254
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,079
Hello...

255
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,719
You scared me! Hi, Caroline.
How long have you been here?

256
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:03,679
-A while.
-How have you been today?

257
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,079
Do you know how the police found out
about Alexander and Claudio?

258
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:12,319
-You reported him.
-Yes. But how did I find out?

259
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:15,399
-I don't know.
-Alexander took my cell phone.

260
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,759
He set up a meeting pretending to be me.

261
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:21,559
Then he deleted the text messages.

262
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:26,799
A colleague restored them.
It was apparently very easy.

263
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,959
OK...

264
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,479
I found a phone today.
In Alexander's clothes.

265
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,199
Apparently he had several cell phones.

266
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,959
I had the text messages
on that one restored, too.

267
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,999
Caroline, listen...

268
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,159
Now I know how he felt
when he thought I was cheating on him.

269
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,079
No! Don't you touch me.

270
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,639
Just listen to me.

271
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,759
I never want to see you again.

272
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:35,919
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Martin Rohde.

273
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,079
We found an implant.
We need some information.

274
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:43,759
-How do you "find" an implant?
-The body around it had dissolved.

275
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,759
-And you're sure it's ours?
-We have a serial number.

276
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,959
We don't store them in a database,
only in the patient's file.

277
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,639
But you keep the files in a database?

278
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,079
Yes, but you can't search
for a serial number.

279
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:02,599
So you'll have to go through
all the files manually.

280
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,079
She died in March
nine years ago, so before then.

281
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:09,759
Esteem delivered the implant
in the spring of 2000.

282
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,679
That won't help. We had
our 20th anniversary last spring.

283
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,799
We were four surgeons at the time.
There are 600-700 files. Maybe more.

284
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,359
-Can we take them with us?
-No.

285
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,039
You can't even read them
unless you get a warrant.

286
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:29,519
-You get a warrant, I'll call Pernille.
-Yeah.

287
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,079
Have you ever felt
a pair of silicone breasts?

288
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:38,399
-Yes.
-How were they?

289
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,319
They were... OK. Why do you ask?

290
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:48,919
I was just wondering.
Does Mette have silicone breasts?

291
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,879
No. Why do you want to know this?

292
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,479
-She's got such nice tits.
-Yes. She does.

293
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,679
The prosecutor let Ramon go.
And he didn't want protection.

294
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,079
-But someone's tailing him?
-No, I don't think so.

295
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:18,759
Hi, it's me. When did you let Ramon go?
Where was he going?

296
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,239
We have the warrant, so just go in.

297
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:23,599
-How many were there?
-Around 600.

298
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,319
-Got an address?
-I'll call when we have something.

299
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:30,039
We've got an address.

300
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,279
Still no answer.

301
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,519
What the fuck?

302
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,319
Why didn't we put a tail on him?

303
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,799
Lack of manpower.
Resources were tied up nationally.

304
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:45,359
And now he could be dead.

305
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,399
-He got a sketch made.
-The artist says we can't use it.

306
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,999
-Why the hell not?
-Ramon wasn't sure about anything.

307
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,519
He kept changing his mind.
Head shape, facial features...

308
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,679
-Hair color, eye color...
-Then what's it doing there?

309
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:08,479
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Found her. Karin Miller.

310
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,439
-21 years old, from Malmö.
<i>-Got an address?</i>

311
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,959
-It's over ten years old.
<i>-Is there a next of kin in the file?</i>

312
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,679
<i>-Her parents. Sven and Ellen Miller.</i>
-Sven and Ellen Miller.

313
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,879
-Tell her "nice work."
-Hello, wait!

314
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,039
<i>-Martin says to tell you "nice work."</i>
-Thanks.

315
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,199
-Tell him I said hi.
<i>-You're welcome. Bye.</i>

316
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:40,039
I had an inkling that Karin was dead.
She wouldn't just disappear like that.

317
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,559
-Was she still living at home?
-Yes.

318
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:46,319
Until the summer,
then she was going to Spain.

319
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:50,239
She was going to train
to be a bartender or something.

320
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,479
-Did she have a job?
-Yes, in eldercare. Part-time.

321
00:32:57,479 --> 00:33:00,879
She had breast implants.
How could she afford them?

322
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,199
I don't know.
She must have saved up for it.

323
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,079
-Can we see her room?
-No. There's nothing left.

324
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:16,279
Ellen and I cleaned it out
five or six years ago.

325
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:21,399
Then, well, Ellen got cancer...

326
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,679
Did she ever mention
the name Marcus Stenberg?

327
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,679
Stenberg?
No, I've never heard that name.

328
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,999
She was found with six others.
Did any of her friends disappear?

329
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,679
-So you don't know who they are?
-No, not yet.

330
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:42,559
No, I don't know.

331
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,159
Thank you for your help.

332
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,719
Let me go! Let me go!

333
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,839
Hey...

334
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:42,319
-Where have you been?
-Romstock chemical plant.

335
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:46,679
Did you know Julian Madsen's firm
did part of their software?

336
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,079
-That's why the cooling system was off?
-Exactly.

337
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,399
Certain files had a virus that wrote
new code for the cooling system by the...

338
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:59,839
-The propylene oxide production.
-Right. It knocked it out.

339
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:04,839
Remember the chat convo with
Mother Of Three from Julian's computer?

340
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:08,799
-The birthday party and the graduation?
-Yes.

341
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:14,359
Romstock started its production
exactly three years ago today.

342
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:21,999
So the question is,
what's the graduation?

343
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,439
-A nuclear power station? Air traffic?
-Yeah...

344
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,799
With a virus like that already planted,
he can knock out just about anything.

345
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,919
Hi!

346
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,599
-What's that?
-Champagne.

347
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:48,599
Well, sparkling wine, but same idea.
We're celebrating.

348
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:52,279
-Where's the law book?
-I cleaned up. In the bookcase.

349
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,199
Hey... Today is
our eight-month anniversary.

350
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:06,199
-We didn't celebrate seven.
-We didn't live together then.

351
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,079
So we're celebrating every month now?

352
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,599
-You don't think it's worth celebrating?
-Sure. Yes.

353
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:17,079
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

354
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,559
All done. Thank you.

355
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:31,719
-What are you doing?
-I need to work.

356
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:36,519
-But you just got back from work.
-I know.

357
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,559
I thought we could do
something together.

358
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,839
-Maybe go out to dinner?
-I ate on the way back.

359
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:03,079
-When do you think you'll be done?
-I don't know.

360
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,239
-You want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

361
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,519
Maybe we can watch a movie later.

362
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:29,719
I need to work.
Thank you for the sparkling wine.

363
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:48,439
-Working late?
-Yes.

364
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,799
Me, too.

365
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:53,919
You have to,
or you don't want to go home?

366
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,599
Well... A little bit of both,
I guess. Yourself?

367
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,599
Living together
is harder than I thought.

368
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:05,159
You have to give and take,
and every relationship...

369
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,159
The leaked propylene oxide
contaminated the drinking water.

370
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:13,359
-Yeah, I heard.
-They've been pro-environment so far.

371
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,439
Poisoning the water
doesn't fit the pattern.

372
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,359
Maybe they protested the location,
and the consequences were unintended.

373
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,479
They must have known
the water would get contaminated.

374
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:33,239
-Any idea what the graduation might be?
-No.

375
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:38,439
John is going through Madsen's clients.
I'll try to ID more boat corpses.

376
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,079
So you'll be here a while? Me, too.

377
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,079
Hey.

378
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:12,199
-He's slept for a few hours.
-OK.

379
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,799
The doctor says he can go home
in a couple of days.

380
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:19,199
That's great. Poor little thing.

381
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,759
-What are you reading?
-An old suicide case file.

382
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:33,239
-Saga's sister.
-Why? Is there something odd there?

383
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:37,919
No, I was just curious.
Saga's mom had Munchausen.

384
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,479
That's why Saga's sister
was living with her.

385
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,519
They found out
when she was ten years old.

386
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,399
The sister? What about Saga?
Was she a victim, too?

387
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,119
It doesn't say that she was.
And she won't talk about her family.

388
00:39:55,279 --> 00:40:00,199
She talks about everything else,
so maybe she didn't want you to know.

389
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,039
Yeah, that's what Pernille said.

390
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,159
-Who is Pernille?
-A colleague.

391
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:13,599
She's working on the case, too.
From Copenhagen.

392
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:22,399
And that's all there is to it.
I'll sleep at your place.

393
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,799
Yes, do that.

394
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,799
-Bye, bye.
-Bye.

395
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:43,199
Well... Doesn't really make that big
of a difference shooting it yourself.

396
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,359
I wrote a draft of my speech
for the EU summit.

397
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,519
-Could you read it later?
-Sure. I'd love to.

398
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,799
I want to make sure
everyone will get it.

399
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,479
-Are you speaking at the EU summit?
-Oliver didn't tell you?

400
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,799
-That's fantastic. Congratulations.
-Thanks.

401
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,159
I spoke to the woman
who's writing your book.

402
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:21,959
Right, Bodil.
You were brutally honest, I take it?

403
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:30,039
I mean, it's a testament. Or a tribute.
I know how much it means to Oliver.

404
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,079
So if it didn't mean so much to him,
you'd talk trash about me?

405
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,279
No, that's not what I meant.

406
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:42,119
-You twist everything.
-It could be construed that way.

407
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:48,359
Well, that's not what I meant.
I'm sorry.

408
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,319
Thanks for dinner, it was good.

409
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:59,879
-Are you going to make it home OK?
-Across the street? I think so.

410
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,639
I'm going to take a bath, then to bed.
I've got an early meeting. Bye.

411
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,639
-Bye. Thanks for a nice evening.
-Thanks.

412
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:16,959
Is it just not possible for you
to say no to her?

413
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,719
What?

414
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:23,679
She poisons the whole evening
and you just sit there.

415
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,879
I didn't notice.

416
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,879
I'm going to bed. Are you coming?

417
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,239
After I send out some work emails
and clean up in the kitchen.

418
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:39,959
-OK. Good night.
-Good night.

419
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:30,919
-Jens won't be coming today.
-Why not?

420
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,399
-He's not feeling so well, he said.
-Is that what he said?

421
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,159
Are you sick?

422
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,119
Did I tell you that Nikolaj was sick?

423
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,599
Munchausen by proxy. Heard of it?

424
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:29,279
His nanny poisoned him
with blood pressure medication.

425
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:31,599
Saga found out.

426
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:40,399
Sure, he wasn't supposed to die,
but this time... she did save him.

427
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:49,959
Here, I brought you coffee.
Or you got an upset stomach?

428
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,519
-Is it?
-No, it's not a stomach thing.

429
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:09,479
I wish someone had been on the bridge
when Mikaela crashed.

430
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:12,119
Someone that could've saved your son.

431
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:24,279
I want you to leave.

432
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:28,399
Yes. I can tell.

433
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,399
We've ID'd one,
maybe two more from the boat.

434
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:05,799
-When did you do that?
-Last night.

435
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:08,679
-I was going to do it this morning.
-What?

436
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,319
-I was going to do it this morning.
-Right, but I did it last night.

437
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,839
Lars Munk-Andersen,
33 years old, from Copenhagen.

438
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:21,919
Was identified through a dental bridge.

439
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,879
Roger Bengtzon, 22 years old.
He worked with Karin Miller.

440
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:28,279
Reported missing at the same time.

441
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:32,039
The police speculated
they were staying away together.

442
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:34,199
But they weren't.

443
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:37,959
Pernille, go talk to
Lars Munk-Andersen's relatives.

444
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,319
Roger Bengtzon's brother
is on his way here.

445
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,839
-I'll go to my desk and...
-Go through all missing persons.

446
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:51,079
Crosscheck forensic reports
for any links you may have missed.

447
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:53,639
Sure thing. Thanks.

448
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:59,399
-Bye.
-Bye, bye.

449
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:02,519
-Roger...
-Roger.

450
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,799
-Roger.
-No, it's Roger Bengtzon.

451
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:09,479
That pronunciation is American
or English. In Swedish it's Roger.

452
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:13,799
No way! OK. Roger...

453
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:21,359
I wanted to think he was on some beach
in Thailand or wherever.

454
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,639
That he'd just said, fuck it all.

455
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:30,199
Had your brother mentioned
that he had problems or felt threatened?

456
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,919
No, nothing like that.

457
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,759
Does the name Marcus Stenberg
mean anything to you?

458
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:39,919
No.

459
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,439
Roger worked in eldercare
with Karin Miller.

460
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,519
-Among other things.
-What else did he do?

461
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,599
What didn't he do?

462
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:59,039
Gambling, poker... clinical trials...

463
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,839
...art school model, porn.

464
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,759
-Always needing money.
-Did he owe anyone?

465
00:49:05,919 --> 00:49:09,719
No, nothing like that.
And no drugs or any shit like that.

466
00:49:09,879 --> 00:49:13,519
-Porn?
-Yes.

467
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,159
-Did your daughter do porn?
-Beg your pardon?

468
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,839
Did your daughter do porn?
Did she have sex on film?

469
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:36,359
No, she did not.

470
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:38,679
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I am.

471
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:42,479
It's a strange question,
but would you know if she did?

472
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,039
Why are you asking?

473
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:48,599
She had breast implants,
like many in that business.

474
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:52,359
-It explains how she afforded it.
-You didn't know her.

475
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:55,039
-No.
-You didn't know Karin.

476
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,959
-Like I said, no.
-She didn't do that kind of stuff.

477
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,719
-She didn't do any...porn.
-No?

478
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:06,879
-Anything else?
-No.

479
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,839
Sorry to have disturbed you.

480
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,479
Next time you ask if someone's daughter
has done porn, be more gentle.

481
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,559
It's highly unlikely
there'll be a next time.

482
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,719
Well, if there is a next time.

483
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,239
-It's got to be hopeless.
-Yeah, you know what she's like...

484
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:34,759
Munk-Andersen was married
with two children.

485
00:50:34,919 --> 00:50:37,639
The wife is sure he wasn't in porn.

486
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:42,159
Wait, how is porn related to
social injustice and the environment?

487
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,439
Many believe porn
and trafficking are linked.

488
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,999
Have you ID'd any more
from the boat?

489
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:53,279
Not yet. One had an injured foot.
We're crosschecking hospital records.

490
00:50:53,439 --> 00:50:56,599
The others, we may never
find out who they were.

491
00:50:56,759 --> 00:50:59,839
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
<i>-Sammy Nyrop.</i>

492
00:50:59,999 --> 00:51:03,519
-We talked about the barrels.
<i>-Yes. What do you want?</i>

493
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,239
I got another text
about picking up a barrel.

494
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,959
<i>-What do I do?</i>
-Do nothing.

495
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,279
Await my instructions.
I'll call you back.

496
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:18,519
He can't know we found Julian,
or he wouldn't use Sammy again.

497
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:21,919
-I bet Ramon's in the barrel.
-We don't know that.

498
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,359
-What about the barrel?
-Let Sammy pick it up.

499
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:30,639
He'll get a text about payment.
We may be able to trace it.

500
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,959
It's our only connection
to Mother Of Three.

501
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:04,279
Do you know who it is?

502
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:08,039
-Why do you ask?
-For no reason.

503
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:11,679
We need your phone.
He'll text you about payment.

504
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,279
We may be able to trace it.

505
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:22,679
-I'll be back later.
-OK.

506
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:28,759
-So...your head still hurts?
-No, they gave me a pill.

507
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:36,639
When's the police coming? Wouldn't
they think it's important I remembered?

508
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:42,679
OK, promise you won't get mad at me.

509
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,079
-I never called them.
-Why not?

510
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:51,799
Because last time
their behavior was inexcusable.

511
00:52:51,959 --> 00:52:56,919
-They shouldn't treat you that way.
-But I can give them a description!

512
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:00,479
They'll have to work it out without you.

513
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:05,479
Ask them to get here - now!

514
00:53:06,959 --> 00:53:08,559
OK.

515
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:20,399
-I want other people to talk to Laura.
-But Norén and Rohde are in charge.

516
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,279
I don't give a shit.
I don't want them near her again.

517
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:27,999
Fine. I'll send someone else
with a composite artist.

518
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:30,959
-Great. Thank you.
-As soon as possible.

519
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,199
Rasmus, Laura Möllberg remembers
her shooter. Can you get on that?

520
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:42,359
Absolutely.

521
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,159
Sammy Nyrop's phone.
He'll get a text about payment.

522
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,479
OK. I'll prep the tracing.

523
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:58,919
You have a visitor.

524
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,559
-Hello.
-What do you want?

525
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:13,519
I got upset.
Last time you were at my house.

526
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,079
-That was not our intention.
-Well, I did.

527
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,119
So I wanted to show you...

528
00:54:22,279 --> 00:54:27,879
...try to prove to you
that Karin didn't do any of...that.

529
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:30,079
Any porn?

530
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,439
So I went through her stuff.

531
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,039
I thought you cleaned everything out.

532
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:40,479
Yes, her room, but we still
had a box left in the attic.

533
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,559
And I found this.

534
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,079
Payment for participation
in a clinical trial.

535
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,279
If she did that, maybe it would prove
she did have the money.

536
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:56,279
-See where it's from?
-Medisonus.

537
00:54:56,439 --> 00:54:59,599
That's where Niklas Svensson worked.

538
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,919
-Yes, Peter?
-I did a routine check.

539
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:26,879
I do them regularly,
especially after Niklas Svensson.

540
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:32,839
Mikkel Höst has used his access card
in a few different places.

541
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:36,199
-Often at night.
-Who's Mikkel Höst?

542
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:39,159
There is no employee with that name.

543
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:43,799
He was in the research department.
That's why I'm telling you.

544
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:45,599
OK.

545
00:55:47,759 --> 00:55:49,799
He got a text.

546
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:55,119
-Can you find it?
-It's still turned on.

547
00:55:56,999 --> 00:55:59,239
Still turned on...

548
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,719
Now it's off. But I got some info.

549
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:14,239
-That's as close as I get.
-It's in Hvidovre.

550
00:56:14,399 --> 00:56:16,599
Medisonus is in Hvidovre.

551
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,839
Hi.

552
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:40,799
-Hey. Rasmus Larsson.
-Right, hello.

553
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,959
Where's Laura?

554
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,399
-Physical therapy. For her shoulder.
-Wait here.

555
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:00,839
What the fuck?

556
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:03,079
Move!

557
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,479
Move! Move! Police!

558
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,719
Laura! Where's Laura?

559
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:20,279
Goddamn it...

560
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,439
Fuck... Goddamn it!
