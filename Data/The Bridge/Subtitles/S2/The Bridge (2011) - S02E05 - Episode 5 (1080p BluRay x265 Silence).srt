1
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,919
-They claim it and leave a symbol.
-A pathos-driven eco-terrorism?

2
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,999
Negative human impact
on the environment - hence the symbol.

3
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:18,679
-You think there are more?
-These groups tend to work in cells.

4
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,519
One day you just felt so great
you decided to see your son's murderer?

5
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,159
I think you're fighting
to keep the old Jens at bay.

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,599
Nikolaj woke up. He's got a fever.

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,679
-I don't know what they'd do without me.
-Get another nanny.

8
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:38,879
Someone logged in
with the handle "Stressed Out Dad"...

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,719
...and chatted with someone
called "Mother Of Three."

10
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:51,119
-I didn't know it was part of the plan.
-Heard what they thought?

11
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:54,839
-She was gassed.
-She was my sister. Mathilde.

12
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:57,319
-So who was it?
-I don't know. Yet.

13
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,839
I'm meeting someone tonight.
Film it, you get another 5,000 kroner.

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,039
-Can you trace "Mother Of Three"?
-Not yet.

15
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:37,279
They discussed a "birthday party”
and a "graduation." There are more.

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,599
EPISODE 5

17
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,639
-You're late.
-Yes.

18
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,359
Hello... Hi.
Are you OK about last night?

19
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,159
-Totally. And you?
-Yeah.

20
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,159
Laura Möllberg is out of surgery.
Doctors say she'll live.

21
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,359
-Can we interrogate her?
-Yes. Later today.

22
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,359
No news about Julian Madsen.
Anything else?

23
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,239
Contents of the SD card
in Laura's camera are coming up.

24
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,039
The man who was hit at Katarina's place.

25
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,919
Copenhagen Police say
he never reported it to them.

26
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,399
Issue a description and a BOLO.

27
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,879
Progress on Madsen's computer
and Mother Of Three?

28
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,239
No, but the chat suggests Julian
was the group's only point of contact.

29
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,719
No one person has the whole picture.
A precaution.

30
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,959
Madsen wants to avenge his sister.
Uses Laura as collateral.

31
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:30,559
But Mother Of Three must have known
he was killing Julian's sister.

32
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,239
Doesn't seem like it.

33
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,039
Laura was shot, Madsen wasn't.
Why, and where is he?

34
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,319
Techs say they found a tranquilizer dart
in the vicinity of Laura's car.

35
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:48,719
-So he wanted him alive?
-That's a reasonable assumption.

36
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,799
Stop. Rewind.

37
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,959
Frame by frame.

38
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,719
-Stop. Can you do anything about that?
-Doubtful. The resolution is pretty bad.

39
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,599
-Try anyway.
-What about the blinking car?

40
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,639
I've got make and color,
but not the plates.

41
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,799
Do your best to get it.

42
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,039
Whoever it is
can't get to Julian that quickly.

43
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,559
-Two perps?
-Or one, remotely operating the blinker.

44
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:05,359
-To deflect attention.
-Is that possible?

45
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,519
It's actually pretty easy.

46
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:12,199
The shooter,
if he wasn't wearing a mask...

47
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:16,959
His position is dead ahead of Laura.
She must have seen him.

48
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:31,639
How do you know Viktoria Nordgren?

49
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:35,559
She's the keynote speaker
at the summit. Why?

50
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,919
She's sent you an email
where she OK's the pics.

51
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,959
-You're reading my emails?
-Are they secret?

52
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,479
No, but they're for me.

53
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,359
-Did you make an appointment?
-For what?

54
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,519
The clinic. Your birthday present.

55
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,879
I'm not doing it.

56
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,919
-Why not?
-Why should 1?

57
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,199
Will you sleep with me then?
If I've got bigger tits?

58
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,919
What do you mean? We have sex.

59
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,279
Do we? When's the last time we did?

60
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:30,279
-You're being silly.
-For wanting my man to take me?

61
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,399
Even if I'm not a D cup?

62
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,399
Some men find me attractive
just the way I am.

63
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,639
-Who?
-I don't know!

64
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,999
At work... Or when I go into town,
I can feel their eyes on me.

65
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,759
Any of them like white wine?

66
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:32,239
Hey... How's she doing?

67
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,199
-Why, what did you hear?
-Nothing. Just that she woke up.

68
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,399
Yes, she's incredibly lucky.

69
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,039
One went through her shoulder,
one grazed her breast, one her head.

70
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,159
-She'll make a full recovery.
-That's great.

71
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,159
-Did she say who shot her?
-No. She recalls nothing.

72
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:55,039
The last thing she remembers
is Julian and her leaving our house.

73
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,199
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Martin Rohde, Copenhagen Police.

74
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:13,319
-Did you see who shot you?
-No.

75
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,559
-You were at Julian's office.
-Yes.

76
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,039
- I tipped him off.
-We know. That's aiding and abetting.

77
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,639
-Would you have arrested him otherwise?
-Maybe.

78
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,119
Do you know who Julian was meeting?

79
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,119
-His sister's murderer.
-Did he mention any names?

80
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,879
He didn't know him.
They made plans to meet online.

81
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,119
You're sure he didn't say
who you were meeting?

82
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:54,519
-Positive.
-Your dad says you recall nothing.

83
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,759
You were filming from a roof.
You were at Malmö Stadium.

84
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,119
Yes, I recall bringing a camera.

85
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,599
You filmed whoever Julian was meeting.
Then you were shot in your car.

86
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:23,159
Sorry, I don't recall.

87
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,719
We'd like for you to come with us.

88
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,439
Come on, Laura.

89
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,919
You don't recall being here?

90
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,919
You don't recognize it?

91
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,959
-You were up on that roof.
-I don't remember.

92
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:18,199
Over there was a car
with the blinkers on.

93
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,359
A white car.

94
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,519
Julian Madsen fell
to the ground right here.

95
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,319
Then a man came towards him.

96
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,199
Get in the car.

97
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,399
Other side.

98
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,559
The shooter was dead ahead of you.
You must have seen him.

99
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,279
What does he look like?

100
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,999
You've gotten down from the roof.
He's chasing you.

101
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,239
You get in the car.
Why don't you drive away?

102
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,439
- I didn't have my keys.
-What do you do?

103
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:25,159
You try to hide? Get out of the car?

104
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:28,119
Call someone?

105
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,839
-I grab...my phone.
-But there's no time to call anyone?

106
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,719
I don't know.

107
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,159
Look at me. Your shooter
was standing dead ahead of you.

108
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,359
Laura, look at me.

109
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,799
You must have seen him.
What did he look like?

110
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,679
You're getting shot.
Where does the first bullet hit you?

111
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,679
-Saga...
-You looked up when you got shot.

112
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,439
Laura, what did he look like?
You want to recall this.

113
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,599
-Laura!
-Saga...

114
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,919
What does he look like?

115
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,359
Laura? Laura?

116
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:30,679
Axel Möllberg? Hi, I'm Beate.
I was the one who...

117
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,999
-I was Laura's teacher.
-Right, sure. Hi.

118
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,639
I saw in the paper Laura had come to.
How is she?

119
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,639
As good as she can be.

120
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,559
She's not here right now.
The police wanted her for something.

121
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,079
-OK.
-Hey...

122
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:54,679
You know it wasn't Laura who spoke
to the principal? It was me.

123
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,279
-No, I did not know that.
-Well, I did.

124
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,879
I just felt it was wrong.

125
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:07,439
Not the fact that you were dating,
I don't have a problem with that.

126
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,439
-It's just that you were her teacher.
-Right...

127
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,999
-But I'm not anymore.
-No, right...

128
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,119
Well, say hi for me.
Tell her I was here.

129
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,879
But hey, wait in her room.
It's on the second floor, room 8.

130
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,039
Right. Thank you.

131
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:22,159
-I want to write a book.
-Everyone does.

132
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,519
I mean it, I'm serious.

133
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,479
Yes, so am I.

134
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:32,719
And what would your book be about?

135
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,399
It'll be about me.

136
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,439
You know I love you dearly, but you
specifically are better in person.

137
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:48,199
I think it could be a really great book.
I've known a lot of women in my day.

138
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:52,079
Interesting women. Famous women.

139
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,759
How famous?

140
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:08,319
You're lying. She just got married!

141
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:11,319
-It was a while back.
-Isn't she a lesbian?

142
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:15,599
-Not that night, I assure you.
-She just had a kid.

143
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,079
I had no part in that,
I can promise you that.

144
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,359
How long have you been doing this?

145
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,359
Just over twenty-five years.

146
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,839
You were but a child!
How did you get started?

147
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,479
What do you say? How about that book?

148
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,399
-You're changing the subject.
-Yes, I am.

149
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,279
I'll see what I can do.

150
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,599
Where's your security?

151
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,959
-You caused her to faint?
-She lost consciousness briefly, yes.

152
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,719
I trusted you, but you two
won't get near her again.

153
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,999
Yes. If the investigation
calls for it, we will.

154
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,239
-What's happened here?
-A fatality in Laura's room.

155
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:19,559
We called the police.
They told us not to go in there.

156
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,279
-Who is she?
-Beate Frelle.

157
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,599
Identical symptoms.
Is there anything edible in here?

158
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,999
No, there's no food here.

159
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,519
Claudio may be writing a book for me.

160
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,679
OK...

161
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,159
It'll be rather revealing.
Not to worry, I'll leave you out of it.

162
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,319
No need. Nothing happened.

163
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,479
-You didn't call him?
-Yes.

164
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,719
-But you didn't fuck?
-No.

165
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:33,559
-Why not?
-I couldn't...

166
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,959
-You sissy.
-It just felt wrong.

167
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,399
I don't want to be like Alexander.
I think he's cheating on me.

168
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,559
Are we talking about the same guy?
Alexander, your husband? The monk?

169
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,279
He's out late more.
Going on more business trips.

170
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:59,919
He got home really late last night.
He said his flight was delayed.

171
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,679
-It wasn't?
-No, I checked with Kastrup.

172
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,759
And it doesn't stop him
from getting jealous.

173
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,119
He doesn't want you,
but damn if anyone else touches you.

174
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:16,119
-You know what I think you should do.
-No!

175
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:22,399
Yes! Call Claudio. Give him
something to be jealous about.

176
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,479
It'll be good for you, Caroline.

177
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,599
Why was the room not guarded?
Where was the uniform on duty?

178
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,919
He took a break
when you came to get Laura.

179
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,999
How did the perp know
that Laura had come to?

180
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,479
It was leaked to the press,
unfortunately.

181
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:45,479
OK. Thank you.

182
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:50,959
The hospital has no CCTV on that floor.
Just two cams on the main entrance.

183
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,319
-Where's the footage?
-On its way.

184
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:58,759
But it's not hard to get in elsewhere,
and the rooms aren't locked.

185
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,119
We need to get organized.

186
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:08,039
Rasmus! You're in charge
of Julian Madsen. Focus on him.

187
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:13,159
Pernille, you take the hospital. Get John
to help you with the CCTV footage.

188
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,239
Then you report back to Saga and Martin.

189
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,799
-Ten thousand...
-What's that?

190
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,359
I was supposed to get 10,000 kroner
for helping Julian.

191
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,999
And now Beate is dead.
For ten thousand...

192
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,999
If I hadn't helped Julian or gone
to the police, she'd be alive now.

193
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,879
We don't always know the consequences
of all the choices we make.

194
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:05,199
If she hadn't come here,
she wouldn't be dead.

195
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:11,399
Honey... It was chance.
There were so many things factoring in.

196
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:51,639
Laura Möllberg. 18 years old.
Top of her class.

197
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,879
Popular. Conscientious.
She sailed, rode horses...

198
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,319
Worked part-time at an IT firm.
Had a brilliant future ahead of her.

199
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,879
Until she was shot, three times.

200
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:16,999
There was a time, you'd have worked
24/7 to nail the guy who did it.

201
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:29,399
-How's the food in here?
-What do you mean?

202
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,159
Anything you miss?
Anything you want me to bring you?

203
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,639
- I go past the Indian place every day.
-No, thanks.

204
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:52,039
This here is a copy of the case file
Saga and I are working on.

205
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,799
I'm not a cop anymore.

206
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:06,439
-You don't say?
-That's right.

207
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,239
So don't read it.

208
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,479
Let go of me!
Let me go! Let me go!

209
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,039
This came a few minutes ago.

210
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:06,319
-Ever seen her before?
-No.

211
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,879
-Is this a new group?
-It's a cell.

212
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:24,199
She's involved with animal testing...

213
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,199
...and her name is Rakel.

214
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,959
They want a law passed
in 12 hours. That's impossible.

215
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,119
They want to kill her.

216
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,119
Got her. Rakel Richardsson is her name.
University Hospital research department.

217
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,119
-Divorced. Daughter.
-Is it her or her daughter's birthday?

218
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,999
-Their next act was the "birthday."
-March and June.

219
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,279
Got an address?

220
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,559
-How old is her daughter?
-She's fourteen.

221
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:13,679
Let's hope
she's with her father this week.

222
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:23,519
Saga!

223
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,719
Nothing.
Nothing in the basement, either?

224
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:20,879
Copenhagen Police, Martin Rohde.
We'll turn you loose.

225
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,679
She saw nothing.
Animal masks and dark clothing.

226
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,639
-Techs are at the house now.
-Did they find a golden toad?

227
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,039
Not yet, but they're there.
They didn't wear them.

228
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:59,279
Saga, Martin... Come here for a sec.
I've filtered the audio from this video.

229
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:02,159
-That was fast.
-It wasn't very hard.

230
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,639
This is the background noise, amped up.

231
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:18,079
-Geese?
-They're everywhere. The other thing?

232
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,039
-It's a wind farm.
-How do you know?

233
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:29,999
There's one right by
my parents' summer cabin.

234
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,279
Sounds exactly like that.

235
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,159
Techs are done
with Rakel Richardsson's house.

236
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,759
They found a snuff box in the backyard
with finger prints on it.

237
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,359
-Carl Sjöberg.
-Known animal rights activist.

238
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,519
He's got priors. Assaulting an officer,
rioting, vandalism, et cetera.

239
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,079
Lives in a collective in Kirseberg.

240
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:49,399
There are 324 wind farms in Skåne,
over 1,000 on Sealand.

241
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,919
I put them on a map.
I'll look for nearby houses.

242
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,399
-Got anything?
-Not yet.

243
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,079
So why are you telling us?

244
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:03,399
Um, because I'm working on it.

245
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:08,159
So you're telling us you're working?

246
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,079
We're going to the collective
in Kirseberg.

247
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,959
The collective was empty.

248
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,959
Camilla Gunnarsson, Rebecca Ståhl,
and Thomas Dahlberg share that address.

249
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,799
All but Thomas are known activists.

250
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:20,479
Camilla Gunnarsson. She and her
brother own a summer cabin together.

251
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,679
-Where?
-Outside something called Gissholm.

252
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,439
Got an address?
Where's that map of the wind farms?

253
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,239
On the server.

254
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:35,079
Those are the wind farms...

255
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,759
...and the summer cabin is right here.

256
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,399
Police!

257
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,079
-Clear?
-All clear!

258
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,039
-Clear?
-All clear!

259
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,359
-Let me out!
-Soon. Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

260
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,439
The people who did this,
did they say where they were going?

261
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,559
-Anything that tells us where they went?
-There were four...

262
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:52,039
-We know. Where were they going?
-I don't know!

263
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,199
-Focus! It's important.
-Where is my daughter?

264
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,719
If we're going to get them,
you must try to focus.

265
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:06,639
-Saga! They found Julian Madsen.
-Where?

266
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,879
Your daughter is with her father.

267
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:19,559
How do we know it's Julian Madsen?

268
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,399
He had a metal plate in his leg
after a skiing accident.

269
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,279
-What's this site?
-Hazardous waste disposal.

270
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:32,839
-They process it.
-And dump it in West Africa...

271
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:37,679
You don't know that.
Jesper Lauge is the facility supervisor.

272
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,159
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
What's in these?

273
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:45,359
We're not really sure,
but it might be potassium hydroxide.

274
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,359
Lye? How come you're not sure?

275
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:53,959
It sat among other barrels of potassium
hydroxide from D&C chemical company.

276
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,799
But we've checked,
and they delivered 16 barrels yesterday.

277
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:02,279
But that one makes it 17.

278
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:04,679
-No signs of forced entry?
-No.

279
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:07,879
And we're working
around the clock right now.

280
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,479
We need a list of all your employees.

281
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,079
-You think it's one of ours?
-We can't rule it out.

282
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,959
Tape your interviews with the employees.
Then send them to us.

283
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,119
-Why dissolve him?
-So we don't find him?

284
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:34,479
But why? The others
were left for us to find.

285
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,279
Yeah...

286
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:43,119
We'll make a little detour
on the way back.

287
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,559
-Hello!
-Hi! It's you.

288
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,199
I'm going to check in on Nikolaj.

289
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,439
-So you're back?
-Yes.

290
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:09,279
I'm thirsty!
And we want to watch a movie.

291
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:15,239
No. That's Nikolaj's.
I'll get you another drink.

292
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:18,959
-Who are you?
-We've met. Don't you remember?

293
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,879
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
I work with Martin.

294
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,239
-You want to see my play tomorrow?
-No, I don't.

295
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:29,799
-She doesn't like kids.
-Why not?

296
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:35,759
I do like kids. I just don't like them
automatically just because they're kids.

297
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,919
-Do you like me?
-I don't know.

298
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,959
I don't know you well enough
to determine that.

299
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:52,639
Will you be
at the press conference tonight?

300
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:56,919
-Sure, if you really want me there.
-I do. Really.

301
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,239
I'll see you later.

302
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,599
-Got a minute, Martin?
-Now?

303
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,839
Yes, now.

304
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,959
Sit.

305
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,999
You gave Jens the case file?

306
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,199
-Parts of it.
-He's serving a life sentence!

307
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,839
-I'll make sure he knows what he did.
-He knows.

308
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,199
In here! But not in here.

309
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,279
I'll make sure he feels
what he did, in here.

310
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,879
His plan was to die, so he wouldn't have
to face the consequences of what he did.

311
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:50,519
So now he's struggling. He's built
a protective wall around himself.

312
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,919
I'm going to tear that wall down.

313
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,639
Let's say you manage
to do that... Then what?

314
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:03,079
Then I win. Then I get to him,
the way he's gotten to me.

315
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,759
That's a big risk for something
that may never happen.

316
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:08,919
I gotta believe I have a shot.

317
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,079
Well, you can't give him access
to an ongoing investigation.

318
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:16,479
I needed a way in!

319
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,839
Just make sure to get it back.

320
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,279
-What did Lillian want?
-Nothing important.

321
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,119
-You're off?
-Yes. See you tomorrow.

322
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:44,479
-Can I come with you?
-Of course you can.

323
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:50,399
Bye.

324
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,679
So you'll let me back in that car?

325
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,719
Yeah.

326
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:18,919
Hi. I'm going to take
a quick shower. I'm off again.

327
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,959
-Where are you going?
-Work dinner.

328
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,759
-You could have said something.
-Sorry. It was decided today.

329
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:58,159
Saga, Techs say Julian's barrel had
a lot more prints on it than the others.

330
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,319
-You know whose?
-Mostly this guy's... Sammy Nyrop.

331
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:06,839
I'm going through
his interview tape right now.

332
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,839
-You're off?
-Yes.

333
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:14,119
I thought you'd be right back.
I mean, no "bye."

334
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,719
-Not until tomorrow.
-OK. Bye. Catch you tomorrow.

335
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:21,479
Why would you catch me?
You mean we'll see each other.

336
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:25,159
-Yep. That's what I meant.
-Bye!

337
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,319
Bye...

338
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,919
Sammy, Sammy...
You're lying through your teeth.

339
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,559
-Hey!
-Hi, it's me.

340
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,999
<i>-You on your way home?</i>
-No, I'm not coming home.

341
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,679
<i>-You need to work?</i>
-No.

342
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,399
So...what are you doing?

343
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,319
-I've checked into a hotel.
<i>-What? Here, in Malmö?</i>

344
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:49,479
-Yes.
-Why?

345
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:53,479
<i>I need to be alone.
I haven't been alone in over a week.</i>

346
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:59,519
You could've said so. I could've met up
with someone or gone to the movies.

347
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,079
-But you'd be home after.
<i>-Well, yeah, I live here.</i>

348
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,239
Then I wouldn't be alone.

349
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:10,959
OK... So how long
are you going to stay at the hotel?

350
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,359
<i>I don't know. A night or two.</i>

351
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:17,719
I'm in no way questioning
our relationship.

352
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:20,279
I just need some quality alone time.

353
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:24,879
Maybe you won't stop reading
those relationship books

354
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,559
but you gotta stop sounding like them.

355
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,399
-But it's true.
<i>-Good to know.</i>

356
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:38,279
OK, so...have some quality alone time,
and I guess we'll talk tomorrow.

357
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:39,759
<i>Yes.</i>

358
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,159
I didn't know
there was a body in the barrel.

359
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,919
I was told to pick it up
and put it with the others.

360
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:08,359
-So this isn't the first time?
-No, the fourth.

361
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,639
-What exactly do you do?
-I get a text with a pick-up location.

362
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:15,719
I let it disappear with the other waste.

363
00:47:15,879 --> 00:47:19,879
It never occurred to you
something illegal might be going on?

364
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,319
No, maybe someone dodging fees
or environmental inspections.

365
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:29,359
Are you stupid?
Environmental inspections? Fees?

366
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,639
OK, I knew it was probably
something illegal.

367
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:37,719
But I never checked the barrels.
I figured they were smuggling something.

368
00:47:37,879 --> 00:47:42,039
-How did they first approach you?
-I got a letter.

369
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:44,199
-You still have it?
-No.

370
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:46,359
What did it say?

371
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:51,399
At first I thought it was
one of those quick-money scams.

372
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,719
-But...it was personal.
-Personal, how?

373
00:47:55,879 --> 00:48:02,439
They knew where I worked, what I did.
And that I have some...problems.

374
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,759
What problems?

375
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:10,439
I gamble occasionally.

376
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:18,279
He gets texts with pick-up points
and where to collect his money.

377
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:22,679
-John is trying to trace the texts.
-What do we do with him?

378
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:26,559
It's unlikely whoever hires him
monitors him constantly.

379
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,879
-So he doesn't know we have him?
-Probably not.

380
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,719
We'll let him go and put a tail on him.

381
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:38,399
CAROLINE:
HI. CAN WE MEET TONIGHT?

382
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:44,879
I'D LOVE TO. WHERE AND WHEN?

383
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:53,839
CAROLINE:
THE PAVILION AT THE PARK AT 9 P.M.

384
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,639
You acted outside your jurisdiction
in official police business

385
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:13,319
and brought a Danish national to Sweden
without clearing it with Danish police.

386
00:49:13,479 --> 00:49:16,439
-So I'm reporting you to IA.
-You're kidding.

387
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,159
No.

388
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,599
Maybe you should thank me instead.

389
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:23,999
I brought this investigation
closer to resolution.

390
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:27,879
That depends on whether
he gets in touch with him again.

391
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,359
What the hell goes on in your head?

392
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:35,919
Get real! I still brought him here.
That's got to account for something.

393
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,519
Yes. I'm not critical of the results,
I'm critical of your methods.

394
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:45,519
Right off the bat, it's plain to see
something's seriously wrong with you.

395
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,679
But this... How the fuck
are you allowed to be on the force?

396
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,279
-I'm an excellent detective.
-Right...

397
00:49:53,439 --> 00:49:58,479
Over-analytical robots devoid of any
emotions are just what the force needs.

398
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:02,079
The fuck...

399
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:14,919
You agree with Rasmus?

400
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:19,559
No. You know I don't. I just
don't think you should report him.

401
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:22,519
-But he broke the rules.
-But he did good.

402
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:25,559
Yes, but he didn't do it right.

403
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,399
He can't talk to you like that,
that was extremely mean.

404
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,319
He was way out of line
and owes you an apology.

405
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:37,799
-He's not the first.
-To be that mean to you?

406
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:42,039
To think I'm incapable of getting hurt.

407
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:45,959
Saga, it's ready for you. Saga!

408
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,639
He chose his sites carefully.
Four barrels, four different sites.

409
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,719
-I wonder what was in the other three.
-Has Lillian sent out Techs?

410
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:07,599
He probably doesn't know we found
Julian. We should lay off the site.

411
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:11,199
-Where are you going?
-To see my daughter's play.

412
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,559
-What's the play?
-Red Riding Hood.

413
00:51:17,399 --> 00:51:21,239
-You're going home, too?
-No, I'm staying at a hotel.

414
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:25,159
-You and Jakob had a fight?
-No, I just need to be alone.

415
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,799
-So you check into a hotel?
-Yes.

416
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:32,399
-Karin and I are getting a divorce.
-Why is that?

417
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,919
It's just not working anymore.

418
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,679
-Did you cheat on her?
-No!

419
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,399
Men are more likely than women
to leave for someone else.

420
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,559
-Did Karin cheat on you?
-No, I don't think so.

421
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,479
This was nice, but I assume
you didn't just invite me to dinner.

422
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:07,119
Well, no...

423
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:11,719
I'd like for you to do
my sister Viktoria's memoirs.

424
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:17,079
This is my second proposal
for an autobiography in two days.

425
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,519
I don't know who the other person is

426
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,959
but I'm certain my sister's
will garner more attention.

427
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,599
Another kind of attention, at any rate.

428
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:34,799
How is she?

429
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:37,439
The doctors give her six months.

430
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,959
Knowing her, that means
at least another 18 months.

431
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,479
She's a remarkable woman.

432
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,999
She's the keynote speaker
at the EU summit.

433
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,679
She's on the Forbes list
of female business leaders.

434
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,119
I think there's a global market.

435
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:03,839
Oliver, you don't need to sell me on it.
We'll be honored to publish it.

436
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:09,719
I'm thinking more in practical terms.
Is she up to writing it?

437
00:53:09,879 --> 00:53:13,239
Does she want to co-author it
with someone, or what?

438
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:18,039
I was thinking you'd write it.

439
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,399
I haven't written anything
in a long time.

440
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,039
But your writing was good.

441
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:31,599
And we trust you.

442
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:43,039
Excuse me, I need to reply to this.

443
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:47,999
ABOUT TO SEE YOUR SISTER

444
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,799
GOOD FOR HER!

445
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:55,319
That was the other autobiography writer.

446
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:58,319
And what does he or she do?

447
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:02,639
He is in the...entertainment business.

448
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:07,239
And his name is Claudio.

449
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:09,999
Cheers to that.

450
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,039
-Mom, what do I do with these flowers?
-Leave them, I'll take care of them.

451
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:29,879
You were the best Red Riding Hood ever.

452
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:33,519
-Thank you.
-No, thank you. Good night, then.

453
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,399
And make sure to hug
your brothers and sisters for me.

454
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,439
-Good night.
-Good night. Night, kiddo.

455
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:48,999
It's good you came.
It means a lot to Johanne.

456
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,759
It's late, and it's a school night.
I'd better tuck them in.

457
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,959
But thanks for the ride.

458
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:05,999
I'm doing better. Something good
will come of my meetings with Jens.

459
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:08,999
Listen, I'd rather not hear about Jens.

460
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:13,919
OK. But I'm doing much better.

461
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:19,079
Mette! Come to the bathroom!

462
00:55:23,399 --> 00:55:26,559
-What's wrong?
-He needed to pee before bed.

463
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:33,079
Oh, but honey...!
There's blood in his pee.

464
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:40,519
He's burning up.

465
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:44,039
Honey, it's going to be all right.

466
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:33,279
-Hey... How's it going?
-Good. I'm staying another night.

467
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:37,159
<i>OK. Mom's coming tomorrow.
It'd be nice if you were here.</i>

468
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:41,119
Yes, I will be.
Have you told her about me?

469
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:43,719
<i>-Of course.</i>
-What did you tell her?

470
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:46,279
That you're amazing in every way.

471
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:49,479
<i>Then her expectations
will likely be too high.</i>

472
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:55,359
I doubt it - it's true. Another session
starts in 14 seconds. I've gotta go.

473
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:57,759
-OK.
-OK. Good night.

474
