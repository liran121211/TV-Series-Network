00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:02,006
A YEAR AND A MONTH AGO

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,127
<i>It's me.

3
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:05,728
<i>It's been awhile, Martin.

4
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:11,117
<i>-You're doing fine.</i>
-You have to let August go.

5
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:14,383
Don't do that to my son.
Punish me.

6
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:15,734
That's what I'm doing.

7
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,664
Sit down.

8
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:26,488
Why?
I need to know why.

9
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,087
Is that because
your wife chose me?

10
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:32,763
Have you killed
them because

11
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,742
you couldn't hold
on to your wife?

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,017
My marriage is over.
I lost my son.

13
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:42,714
My job, my friends.
What else then?

14
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:58,794
Where is he?
Where is August?

15
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:01,927
He is no longer here.

16
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:09,225
You'll never know
whether he suffered.

17
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:12,825
Whether he was scared.
Whether he cried.

18
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:15,945
Whether his death was long
and painful.

19
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,388
You'll never have
a body to bury.

20
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:21,753
You'll never have
a grave to visit.

21
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:23,334
Shut up.

22
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:26,596
You'll live forever
in doubt.

23
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:30,797
Shut up!
Shut up!

24
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,705
Martin!
We've found August!

25
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:38,224
-No, you haven't.
-Yes, we have.

26
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,573
He's in the Ejborgsvej garage.

27
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,438
-Is August alive?
-Yes.

28
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,730
Can you tell me
whether he is alive or not?

29
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,369
Is August really alive?

30
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:58,431
Saga!

37
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:13,367
This ship is weird.

38
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,173
-Which one?
-This one.

39
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:21,938
Faxborg, this is Sund's traffic

-What do they have on board?
-I don't know.

52
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:59,235
We need to close
the bridge.

53
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,687
They're going towards
the bridge.

62
00:07:58,626 --> 00:07:59,976
What happened?

63
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,455
Hello!

64
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,508
-Do you know who they are?
-They have no IDs.

65
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:31,458
-Was it all good?
-It can always get better.

66
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,678
-Has the ship run aground?
-I don't know.

67
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,901
-Have you taken the math test?
-Yes.

68
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:43,758
Why do you sail when you
have other things to do?

69
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:48,590
-The school is later on.
-You have to score there.

70
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:52,934
-I can certainly do that.
-Any more complaints?

71
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:55,364
-No.
-No, alright.

72
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:09,075
<i>-Gdansk to Turku.</i>
-Have a pleasant trip, Faxborg.

He's pronounced 'Turku'

Where were them
when they made contact?

76
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,915
They were going southward,
advancing Kullen Lighthouse.

77
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,350
They came from Halmstad.

78
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:27,334
-So they left the ship?
-Yes, and they left on a boat.

79
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:31,771
-They can't be traced back.
-So you guys can't help me.

80
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:36,995
Thank you.

81
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:04,062
Saga, what about the boat?

82
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:10,025
Ship, it's 12 meters long
and 4 meters wide.

83
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,951
-Okay, ship.
-We found five youngsters chained.

84
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:18,341
-What about the crew?
-The ship was empty.

85
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:22,957
John, I want a list
of missing persons.

86
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Range?

87
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,364
Youngs from 17 to 25 years
old in the last three months.

88
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:28,715
Okay.

89
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,415
Beate!

90
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:52,147
Can I work with another
person apart from Christian?

91
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:58,128
We have a perfect score,
but I'm doing all the work.

92
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,049
-He helps me a lot.
-On what?

93
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,299
-Find someone at my level.
-No.

94
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,013
Why not?

95
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:12,096
I can rate you
on an individual basis.

96
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:13,916
And he's also learning
from you.

97
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:16,653
Teaching is your job.

98
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:42,824
In order to check
the overtime list...

99
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:45,901
-I know who they are.
-Can't you wait a bit?

100
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,930
Let's put it off.

101
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:53,225
The crew member
Victor Bergström

102
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,872
disappeared along
with two friends,

103
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:58,518
a Danish girlfriend
and her friend.

104
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,095
One of his friends,
Fredrik Lundblad,

105
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,126
was reported missing
on Saturday.

106
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,860
The third is
Svante Kallen.

107
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:10,328
Police was looking for them,
with no results.

108
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,600
They're nowhere to be found
since Friday.

109
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:15,526
The girls on the ship were
a Danish woman and her friend?

110
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,179
I think so.

111
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,858
Ok, I'll inform
their parents.

112
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:22,462
I'll go to Copenhagen

113
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:24,665
to check their last
known whereabouts.

114
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,778
-Why?
-I wanna prepare the inquiring.

115
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,389
Saga, come on.
The case is not important.

116
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,239
They were enchained
to a broken ship.

117
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,088
It's an important case.

118
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,804
I'm looking for Martin Rohde.

119
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:04,687
Yes, his boss
is right there.

120
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:07,792
-Saga, long time no see!
-Yes, 13 months.

121
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:12,203
-It's nice to see you again.
-I'm looking for Martin.

122
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,470
Yes, I know.
Come here.

123
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:19,832
When was the last time
you guys last met?

124
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,058
It was at August's funeral.

125
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,036
-Haven't you met ever since?
-No.

126
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:26,686
What do you want from him?

127
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,672
A ship crashed
into the bridge.

128
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,754
The ship had five people
enchained.

129
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:32,816
Two women
are from Denmark.

130
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:36,599
-And we have two missing persons.
-What do you want from him?

131
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,164
They have been kidnapped.
I want an investigation.

132
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:45,149
-If possible...
-Someone else could help you.

133
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,787
-Why not Martin?
-He has other tasks.

134
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,476
What?

135
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:52,445
He is in the group
that coordinates

136
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,779
the police efforts
at the European Council.

137
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,864
-Isn't him here?
-Yes, but...

138
00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:03,721
Saga, his recovery
took a long time.

139
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,450
It's been a long time,

140
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,924
I don't know how
he's going to react.

141
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:11,741
I'm carrying on
an investigation.

142
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:14,993
I know I could've
done that differently,

143
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:17,596
but the outcome'd have
been the same.

144
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:20,008
No one is blaming you.
Not even Martin.

145
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,867
Why can't I see him then?

146
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:28,590
He is on that door.

147
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:04,953
-Long time no see!
-Yes, one year and one month.

148
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:06,338
Yeah.

149
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:09,873
Shall we go to the hallway?

150
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:13,385
Good to see you.
What are you doing here?

151
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:14,991
I'm investigating
a kidnapping.

152
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:17,619
Two Danes missing.

153
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,970
Do you have names?

154
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:23,193
I have something to help you.
Come.

155
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,632
-What a joy to see you again.
-Yes, that's it.

156
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,735
We gotta get there.

157
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:34,170
Maria Holst
and Vibecce Nielsen.

158
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:43,214
-You could have sent me e-mail.
-How?

159
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:45,604
You could've emailed me.

160
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,593
I wanted to visit.

161
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,807
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes.

162
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:58,323
Why haven't you come before?

163
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,101
The investigation didn't
involve Denmark back then.

164
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:05,839
The manager saw them leaving
the Mainstreet club at 3:45 AM.

165
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,190
Do you know where it is?

166
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,573
-Mainstreet Club?
-Yes.

167
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:12,521
-I don't know.
-She was along with four men.

168
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:19,259
Only three men
were chained in the ship.

169
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:24,393
Saga Norén,
Malmö police.

170
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:30,221
When?
Great, thank you.

171
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,509
Maria Holst has died.

172
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,954
So we have
a murder investigation.

173
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:06,630
-How was that with Saga?
-Fine.

174
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,678
She's waiting in her car.

175
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:13,928
-For you?
-Yes.

176
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,587
Yes, she wants me
to go to Helsingor.

177
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:20,212
Is that ok?

178
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,199
I don't know.
Is that what you want?

179
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:30,440
I think it's a good idea then,
Martin.

180
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,935
Okay.

181
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:59,121
-How is it going?
-Fine.

182
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,935
-Are you working hard?
-Yes.

183
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,231
-Are you still single?
-Yes.

184
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:17,955
-You're mean.
-I'm not, Saga. I'm reasonable.

185
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:25,199
We haven't seen
each other for a year.

186
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,542
Don't you have
anything new to tell me?

187
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:29,594
I wanna some catch up.

188
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:34,025
-I don't live with Mette anymore.
-Are you divorced?

189
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:35,789
We just don't live
together anymore.

190
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,153
Have you betrayed
her again?

191
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:38,780
Nope.

192
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,459
I'm just not good for her
and our children anymore.

193
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:47,155
We had twins, you know?
Sanne and Simon.

194
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:48,655
Yes.

195
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,377
-I'm living with Jakob Sandberg.
-The flower guy?

196
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:03,937
-No, that was Anton.
-How have you guys met each other?

197
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:06,751
It was in a bar
seven months ago.

198
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,731
-Are you living together?
-Yes.

199
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:11,991
Full time?

200
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:14,108
Yes, since last Wednesday.

201
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,118
-Are you guys doing fine?
-Yeah.

202
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,143
Good...

203
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:28,842
Nice to know.

204
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:44,269
-Christian Fischer?
-Yes.

205
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,041
Martin Rohde, local police.
Saga Norén, Malmø police.

206
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,375
We'd like to talk
about Vibecce Nielsen.

207
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:54,174
Have you seen her
leaving at 3:45 AM?

208
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,768
Yes.

209
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:59,545
Was she along with four guys?

210
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,216
-Yes.
-Do you recognize those three?

211
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:09,598
I don't. Do you know how many
guys come here every day?

212
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,397
The flyer says the maximum
capacity is 950 people.

213
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:15,158
Yes.

214
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,872
We have full house
every weekend.

215
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:23,456
-Do you recognize her?
-Yes, a girl named Vibecce?

216
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:26,545
She left to smoke a few times.

217
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:29,965
We chatted.
I think she liked me.

218
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,757
Why do you remember her?

219
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:33,948
The way she talked.

220
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:39,266
-Don't you remember the guys?
-Sorry, I don't like guys.

221
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,475
Do you have cameras
at the entrance?

222
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:42,826
No.

223
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:46,563
-Or inside the premises?
-Nope, no cameras.

224
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:54,142
There is a camera there.

225
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,346
-Another there.
-They're police cameras.

226
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:01,350
I'll talk to Barbara
about the issue.

227
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:04,371
No, I'll talk to John.
It's important.

228
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,750
Okay.

229
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,656
Hey, check it out.

230
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:34,745
What is that?

231
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,162
Let me see.
What the hell is that?

232
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:44,674
-I put it on Youtube.
-There will be only five visits.

233
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:48,225
-Can you do better?
-Of course.

234
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:52,444
-I wanna see your apps.
-Did you watch the Barcelona game?

235
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,490
A bit of Messi.

236
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:59,576
-You don't have any pay channels.
-Let's go.

237
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:01,930
Wait, I'll get my coat.

238
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:17,655
Wait!

239
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:25,700
Hey, why did you do that to me?

240
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:30,344
-My cell phone.
-You cellphone what?

241
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,536
-You're hiding it.
-No.

242
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,658
-Come on.
-I left it on the bench.

243
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,342
So what?

244
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:41,035
Maybe someone got it.

245
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:19,295
What's the problem?

246
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,882
Are you still wondering about
what happened here a year ago?

247
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:27,953
No, not anymore.
And you?

248
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:35,615
Yes.

249
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,088
Do you think
it could be forgotten?

250
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,269
I just think about
what I want.

251
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,770
You're lucky.

252
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,095
-Hi.
-Hi.

253
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:50,811
Saga told me you're back.
Couldn't you leave?

254
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:56,375
My son and my grandchildren
moved here.

255
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:58,947
-Good.
-What about you?

256
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:03,464
You know what happened,
but I'm fine.

257
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:10,624
The four are alive,
but they don't say a word.

258
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,847
-Maria died of what?
-Her body was sent for autopsy.

259
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,469
Faxborg was in Halmstad.

260
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,861
It was stolen during the night,
no witnesses.

261
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:22,600
-Who owns the boat?
-Ship!

262
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:26,239
-What?
-Faxborg is a ship.

263
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,692
More than 12
meters in height,

264
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,145
and width is greater
than 4 meters.

265
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,793
-Is that important?
-It could be.

266
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:37,350
-Is that important on this case?
-No.

267
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:40,085
Who owns the boat?

268
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:42,820
Marcus Stenberg,
he lives in Ystad.

269
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,425
Martin, what
have you done?

270
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:51,985
Are you really
working on that case?

271
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:53,845
I'm helping coordinate

272
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,025
the police efforts
at the European Council.

273
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:58,763
But they can do the same
job without me.

274
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:04,875
-Am I answering it right?
-That's right.

275
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:09,438
-I like staying here.
-I'll talk to Lilian.

276
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,054
Go for it.

277
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:23,105
The ship would leave in a week.
So I stayed here.

278
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:24,944
How many people
knew about that?

279
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:26,869
The crew, of course.

280
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,488
The control personnel
and the Port of Halmstad.

281
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:33,930
When bees see smoke, they think
it's fire then they calm down.

282
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,790
It is easy to steal
a ship of that size?

283
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:42,358
It was supposed to be guarded,
I don't know how they did that.

284
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,804
How many people are required
to sail the ship?

285
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:47,494
In theory, a single person.

286
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:52,064
-And in practice?
-A single person with knowledge.

287
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:55,354
But to start and move it out,
it needs two.

288
00:26:57,705 --> 00:27:01,376
My wife...
Marcus Stenberg.

289
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:03,695
Do you like bees?

290
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,875
I don't know,
I just don't think about.

291
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,965
Albert Einstein said
that if bees disappear from earth,

292
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:14,442
we would be extinct
in four years.

293
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,973
Without oxygen,
we would die in four minutes.

294
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:21,098
I still don't like air.

295
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:27,250
Sorry, it was my wife.
Can we leave that for later?

296
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:29,362
Do you recognize
anyone here?

297
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:35,775
No.

298
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:42,052
Do you know why
someone would steal your ship?

299
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,802
I have no idea.
But I would have to...

300
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:50,704
Call my office,
they know the crew.

301
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:54,649
Talk to Linda.
They will help you.

302
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:00,374
-He lied.
-Why?

303
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,283
It wasn't his wife
on the phone.

304
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:04,053
Why not?

305
00:28:04,054 --> 00:28:07,080
When Mette calls you,

306
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,747
you don't answer
saying your first and last name.

307
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,621
-Have you found my phone?
-No, why?

308
00:28:32,622 --> 00:28:34,410
It sent a SMS.

309
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:37,852
What kind of SMS?
Let's see.

310
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:41,546
What the hell...

311
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:44,711
I WANT TO FUCK
AMANDA

312
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:48,815
Here's your phone.

313
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:55,409
-How many people got the SMS?
-All your contacts.

314
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:02,329
What the fuck!
It was just a joke.

315
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:08,761
See you tomorrow,
loser.

316
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:34,048
We had the feeling
that they were about to wake up.

317
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:38,844
Nothing is absolute.
They are weak and confused.

318
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,145
Why?

319
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,825
They were dehydrated,
hypothermic,

320
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:45,504
and had traces
of lysergic acid in their blood.

321
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:49,825
-A LSD predecessor?
-I don't know what they took.

322
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,619
It was like a combination

323
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,620
between drug
and external influences.

324
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:56,959
They're talking about
lights and noises.

325
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,654
It's little crazy.

326
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:01,019
We need to talk to them.

327
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,345
Lundblad is still
unconscious.

328
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:09,745
-Kallen is having a high fever.
-So we'll talk to the other two.

329
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:20,240
Saga Norén,
Malmö police.

330
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:24,611
Can you tell us
what happened?

331
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:29,271
Vibecce, could you
say what happened?

332
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:33,375
Lights...

333
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,900
Flashing...

334
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:42,542
Lights flashing.
Try again.

335
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:47,033
A fox and...

336
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:50,801
A fox...
A fox...

337
00:30:54,705 --> 00:30:56,173
Saga, that is enough.

338
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:08,593
Have you left
Mainstreet with someone?

339
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:10,149
Do you remember
who was that?

340
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:14,050
-Maria.
-No, it was a man.

341
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:23,428
-Where is Maria?
-She's fine. Maria's doing fine.

342
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:27,371
She's in the next room
and she's talking.

343
00:31:27,372 --> 00:31:29,241
What about the bar?

344
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:31,310
With whom have
you left the place?

345
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:32,661
It flashes...

346
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,767
Yes, it flashes?

347
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:41,543
Come on.
You have to explain it better.

348
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,415
What happened?

349
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,171
Thank you,
that's enough.

350
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:50,137
Come on.

351
00:31:50,905 --> 00:31:53,009
-We didn't get a lot from them.
-Nope.

352
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,121
They're disoriented.

353
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,189
They can't remember anything.

354
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,813
Do you really believe
they were abducted by aliens?

355
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:04,152
Wait, I'll have coffee.

356
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:05,468
Why do you laugh?

357
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:08,886
The alien theory
is a joke, right?

358
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:12,785
Yes, it is, but it seems
that you didn't find it funny.

359
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,415
-Have noticed that?
-Yes.

360
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:21,154
It's nice to work
with you again, Saga.

361
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,850
It feels the same.

362
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:27,807
-I mean it.
-Me too.

363
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:31,762
You still treat me
the same way as before.

364
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:34,089
How else could I treat you?

365
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:40,061
Many people changed
after August's death.

366
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:43,418
It's because of you
we're here today.

367
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,300
If you hadn't shot me,

368
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:48,189
I'd have killed Jens.

369
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:54,225
I know.

370
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:57,025
Hey, come on!

371
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,533
-What is happening?
-Hurry.

372
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:01,362
Watch out.

373
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,058
What is happening?
Victor!

374
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:06,655
Calm down!

375
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:14,220
Calm down,
let's solve it peacefully.

376
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:15,521
Okay?

377
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:19,056
There're hostages,
we need extra force here.

378
00:33:19,057 --> 00:33:22,114
-Release Anne-Louise first.
-No.

379
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,929
Release Anne-Louise now!

380
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:28,823
Ok, go away, go away

381
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:31,976
Victor, are you listening?

382
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:36,652
Release Anne-Louise
and then talk.

383
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:39,376
-Put the scissors down.
-No.

384
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:43,737
-What do you want?
-I want to leave here.

385
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,038
Okay, great.

386
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,286
First release
Anne-Louise.

387
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,483
Come on!
No, no.

388
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:54,495
I want to leave here.

389
00:33:56,745 --> 00:34:02,316
I'll handcuff myself,
and then we leave, right?

390
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:04,482
-Martin, what is that?
-I'm harmless, see?

391
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:08,839
-No.
-Let her go and take me.

392
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,432
I'm coming, Victor.
Look at me. Martin.

393
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:16,428
Release Anne-Louise
and take me. Let her go.

394
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,151
Do you want to see
Maria, right?

395
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:20,464
Yes.

396
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:22,631
Release her now,
and you will see Maria.

397
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,039
Release her now,
and you will see Maria.

398
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,422
Release Anne-Louise now!

399
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:33,662
-Do you know Maria?
-Turn around.

400
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:35,044
Do you know Maria?

401
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:36,935
She's dead!

402
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,303
Sorry, dammit!

403
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,530
He changed places
with the hostage?

404
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,276
I couldn't intervene.

405
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:05,586
Avoid him,
unless you want to.

406
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:17,882
-What did Hans say to you?
-He doesn't want our partnership.

407
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:22,320
-Why have you changed places?
-It was a good idea.

408
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:28,332
-It was a bad and dangerous one.
-I am well trained.

409
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,322
Not with your hands chained.

410
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,252
That's okay.

411
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,026
-Do you want a ride?
-No, thank you.

412
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:42,704
I think I'll take the train.
Say hello to Jakob.

413
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:48,021
-He doesn't know who you are.
-Greet him anyway.

414
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,962
<i>Axel?
-Daddy, it's me.

415
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,241
<i>-Are you coming home?</i>
-Not yet.

416
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:03,968
<i>-Why not</i>
-Tina wanted me to stay.

417
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:06,465
<i>You left,
went to school...

418
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:12,014
-And then just disappeared.
<i>-Just for a few hours.</i>

419
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:16,224
<i>-See you at eleven o'clock?</i>
-Yeah.

420
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:22,179
<i>Faxborg crashed into
Öresund bridge this morning.

421
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,864
<i>It happened
when traffic control

422
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:27,156
<i>lost contact with the ship.

423
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:32,308
<i>The ship didn't have
any captains or crew inside.

424
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:36,745
<i>Five youngsters
were on board.

425
00:37:36,746 --> 00:37:40,985
<i>They are under treatment
at the University Hospital.

426
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:45,669
<i>The police haven't said
a word on the matter.

427
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:20,432
Hi.

428
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:23,416
I thought you wouldn't
make it tonight.

429
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:26,592
I'm staying
with Tina on the stable.

430
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:36,180
-You don't talk much.
-Nope.

431
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:43,884
Don't you think
it could help?

432
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:46,904
You know it takes time.
It's a process.

433
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:48,561
I met Saga today.

434
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:51,222
-Saga Norén?
-Yes.

435
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:57,264
How was that?

436
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:59,765
A few hours with her
were more useful

437
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,474
than a year with you.

438
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:08,483
Then, continue with her.

439
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:11,808
I will.
And we're done here.

440
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,236
Okay.

441
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:18,812
It's over for today.
See you next week.

442
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:23,865
His trauma brought
serious consequences.

443
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:27,840
But he would never allow
anything bad to happen to her.

444
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:31,619
The only person he would allow
something bad is to himself.

445
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:58,827
-Hi.
-Hi.

446
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:00,178
You're here!

447
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:04,290
Nikolaj!
Your father is here.

448
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:07,755
Where are the others?

449
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:10,446
Carl and Johanne
are playing tennis.

450
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,280
I have to take them
in 45 minutes.

451
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:14,824
-Hi.
-Hi.

452
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:23,150
-How are you, buddy?
-I'm cooking with Anna-Dea.

453
00:40:23,151 --> 00:40:25,425
-What are you cooking?
-Spaghetti.

454
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:26,776
Spaghetti!

455
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:29,244
-Hi.
-Are you staying for supper?

456
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:31,600
I can't.
I just wanted to talk to Mette.

457
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,966
Okay.
Come, let's continue then.

458
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,878
-Bye, buddy.
-Bye.

459
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:56,208
I won't attend tomorrow's
couples therapy.

460
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:02,494
How should I interpret this?

461
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,905
-Are you giving up?
-You know what I want.

462
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:08,969
-Don't you want to get back?
-Not this way.

463
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:13,665
-I don't want therapy anymore.
-It helped you a lot.

464
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,711
-Helped?
-Yes, of course.

465
00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:17,424
Can't you see?

466
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:20,503
I've only learned to lie
to myself and to other people.

467
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:25,625
I see no change.
I wanna move on.

468
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,040
And what are you
going to do?

469
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:37,040
Lillian put me with Saga.

470
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,006
I'm back to Homicides.

471
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,816
I want you
to give me a break.

472
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:44,167
Martin, shit.

473
00:41:47,827 --> 00:41:50,549
I'm waiting for your recovery
and I'm tired.

474
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,900
I know.

475
00:42:05,865 --> 00:42:07,316
Hey!

476
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:15,025
-How are doing?
-Fine, what are you doing?

477
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:16,476
Unpacking my stuff.

478
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:21,968
-I don't want those books there.
-Where, then?

479
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,196
You can leave them
in the box.

480
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:33,240
We dwell together and you want
to just unpack your stuff?

481
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:35,591
No, just continue.

482
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,882
-Are you working tonight?
-No.

483
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,979
-Wanna do something?
-Why?

484
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,657
You decide.

485
00:42:49,686 --> 00:42:51,036
Okay.

486
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:33,015
I have a co-worker
from Denmark.

487
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:39,740
-Were you thinking about him?
-Yes.

488
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:43,583
-When we fucked?
-Not, it was after the sex.

489
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,722
Do you think about others
when we have sex?

490
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:49,468
No, you?

491
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:56,207
-No, never.
-Okay, fine.

492
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:20,025
-Hey man. How are you?
-I'm fine, thanks.

493
00:44:20,026 --> 00:44:22,736
-Any messages for me?
-No, sorry.

494
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:23,015
-What are you doing?
-Reading.

495
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:27,086
"Relationship
competence"?

496
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,239
"Emotions
and social relations."

497
00:45:31,172 --> 00:45:33,824
"Codes for a better
relationship."

498
00:45:33,825 --> 00:45:36,450
-Where did you get them?
-Library.

499
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:38,983
Why, Saga?

500
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:43,265
-I want to be good at it.
-Like living together?

501
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:47,616
In having
a romantic relationship.

502
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:51,545
You are good at that one.

503
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:57,260
-How can you tell?
-I don't know, I just feel.

504
00:45:57,261 --> 00:46:00,413
This is my first one.

505
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:02,985
Let's go to bed.

506
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:05,279
Check it out.

507
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:10,090
"The discovery of the need
to be loved..."

508
00:46:40,985 --> 00:46:43,635
-Why are you that early?
-I came to see you.

509
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,487
Okay.

510
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:51,318
I did quit therapy.

511
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:53,574
Niels said nothing
about that.

512
00:46:53,575 --> 00:46:55,958
That's because he thinks
I can't decide anything.

513
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,775
You can't.
We have a deal.

514
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:02,429
I know what I want.
I wanna talk to Jens in prison.

515
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,814
It's out of question.

516
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:10,223
You know I'm not living
with my family for a year now.

517
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:15,538
Mette has a maid.
I need to move on.

518
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:17,960
And that doesn't work.

519
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,223
So you're
investigating a murder.

520
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:21,978
We will solve
an issue at a time.

521
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:27,723
I wanna see him in his cell,
you know, arrested and locked up.

522
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:31,304
-You know he's already there.
-It's not enough.

523
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:45,397
Niels has to agree
or it's a no go.

524
00:47:45,398 --> 00:47:46,782
Okay.

525
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:05,929
None of the parents know
why the youngsters disappeared.

526
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:10,872
Marcus Stenberg seems innocent.
Look carefully.

527
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:14,700
So he didn't have any
contact with the lost ones?

528
00:48:14,701 --> 00:48:16,124
Nope.

529
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,413
However, we will continue
to investigate him.

530
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:21,580
-Have you obtained the videos?
-No, they are delaying it.

531
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:24,620
-You know it's important.
-Yes.

532
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:28,517
-It's Martin.
<i>-I've talked to Niels.</i>

533
00:48:28,518 --> 00:48:31,675
<i>He's always here.

534
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,770
<i>We'll perform periodic
assessments,

535
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:36,493
<i>and you'll have to behave
the way he wants you to.

536
00:48:38,105 --> 00:48:40,562
-Can I see Jens?
-At 2 P.M.

537
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:41,863
Has he made any demands?

538
00:48:41,864 --> 00:48:44,734
No, the director said that he
promptly accepted the offer.

539
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:46,224
Really?

540
00:48:46,225 --> 00:48:48,762
At 2 P.M., ok?

541
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:03,990
I'm allowed
to see Jens.

542
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:07,156
Jens, the guy
who killed your son?

543
00:49:08,386 --> 00:49:10,720
-Yes.
-Why?

544
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:13,265
Something good could
come out

545
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:15,586
from a meeting between
victim and perpetrator.

546
00:49:15,587 --> 00:49:21,586
It only has positive effects when
the aggressor wants redemption.

547
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:25,458
-It doesn't apply to Jens.
-Of course not.

548
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:27,087
No.

549
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:28,865
Why do you want
to see him, then?

550
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:39,914
I think about him all the time.
It's spinning in my head.

551
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,100
-Understood?
-No.

552
00:49:48,865 --> 00:49:51,976
I wanna see if he is human.
Do you know what I mean?

553
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:55,446
Is a bad idea.

554
00:49:58,065 --> 00:49:59,415
I have to go.

555
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:02,585
I'm serious.
It's a really bad idea.

556
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:40,378
-What do you want to show us?
-Take it.

557
00:50:40,379 --> 00:50:42,264
Why?

558
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:43,884
Wait, you film it.

559
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,695
Here.

560
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:05,740
What the hell are you doing?

561
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:27,851
Put out the fire!
Put out!

562
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:32,873
Help me! Put it out, Albin!
Put out the fire.

563
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:35,522
I can't.
It's locked!

564
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:40,756
The extinguisher is locked.
Don't go anywhere.

565
00:51:40,757 --> 00:51:43,586
The extinguisher is locked!

566
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:46,697
Stop filming
and help me!

567
00:52:00,945 --> 00:52:02,345
Excuse!

568
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,745
Is Linus Svensson here?
I'm Niklas, his brother.

569
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:09,995
Ok, so he doesn't
have any parents?

570
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:12,184
No, just me.
How is he?

571
00:52:12,185 --> 00:52:16,616
He suffered 1st and
2nd degree burns.

572
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:20,825
-That's good, right?
-It'll hurt for awhile.

573
00:52:20,826 --> 00:52:23,752
But he'll not need
any surgeries.

574
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:26,417
Come, I will show you
where he is

575
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:36,465
Sorry.

576
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:54,135
Saga, you have a guest.

577
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:56,371
Hi.

578
00:52:57,919 --> 00:52:59,505
Saga Norén,
Malmö police.

579
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:02,953
Axel Mollberg,
I have everything filmed.

580
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:19,300
-What was time then?
-8:30 AM.

581
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:22,657
Do you know whether he was
heading towards Sweden or Denmark?

582
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,139
No, I was there
filming my daughter.

583
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,589
-Shit.
-John!

584
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,890
Saga!

585
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:30,823
I need to show
this video to John.

586
00:53:30,824 --> 00:53:32,399
Saga, you need
to come over now!

587
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,431
-No, I have some film...
-You need to come over now!

588
00:53:57,465 --> 00:53:58,815
Shaw we go in?

589
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:02,519
He wanna see you, right?

590
00:54:04,185 --> 00:54:08,207
I'm doing that because
it's something you believe.

591
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:11,101
-Want to proceed?
-Yes, I do.

592
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:10,421
-Saga, I was going to call you.
<i>-Come to the hospital.</i>

593
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:13,393
<i>-Two of them have died.</i>
-Let me tell you...

594
00:56:13,394 --> 00:56:15,189
You need to come
to the hospital.

595
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,858
They died of aggressive
pneumonic plague.

596
00:56:20,301 --> 00:56:22,245
<i>What the hell
are you talking about?

597
00:56:22,246 --> 00:56:25,051
Severe pneumonia
caused by bacteria.

598
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:26,436
We are isolated.

599
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:31,078
Shit, I went to see my children.
Am I infected?

600
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,384
<i>Yes, pneumonic plague.

601
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:36,445
Someone deliberately
infected them.

602
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:40,280
<i>Someone wants to create
a plague epidemic.
