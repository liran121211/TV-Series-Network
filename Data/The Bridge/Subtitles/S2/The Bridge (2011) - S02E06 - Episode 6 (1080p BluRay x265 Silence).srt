1
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:09,519
-Who owns the boat?
-Marcus Stenberg.

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,919
Why would anyone steal your ship,
chain five people and run it aground?

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,999
A woman's died from a poisoned apple.

4
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:23,239
Negative human impact
on the environment - hence the symbol.

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,359
A pathos-driven eco-terrorism of sorts?

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,919
-We had a death.
-How do you know Viktoria Nordgren?

7
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,599
She's the summit's keynote speaker.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,279
I'd like for you to do
my sister Viktoria's memoirs.

9
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:40,319
-How is she?
-The doctors give her six months.

10
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,039
Knowing her, that means 18 months.

11
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,759
-I want to write a book.
-Everyone does.

12
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:51,479
I've known a lot of interesting women.
Famous women.

13
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,239
This is a copy of the case file
Saga and I are working on.

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,399
-He's in jail for life!
-I'll make sure he knows what he did.

15
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,159
One day you just felt so great
you decided to see your son's murderer?

16
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:11,879
Someone logged in
with the handle "Mother Of Three."

17
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,479
-It's the four from the videos.
-Probably.

18
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,839
They were locked in,
and gas was pumped in.

19
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:22,319
-Traced "Mother Of Three"?
-Not yet.

20
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,879
They discussed a "birthday party"
and "graduation." There are more.

21
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,479
-This came a few minutes ago.
-She's involved with animal testing.

22
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:36,039
-Is this a new group?
-These groups tend to work in cells.

23
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,639
EPISODE 6

24
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,119
Get down! Take off your mask!

25
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,999
You're not doing yourself any favors
by not cooperating.

26
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,439
-I'll be back later.
-Sure thing.

27
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,719
His lawyer advised him
not to talk to us.

28
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,479
Try your luck with Thomas Dahlberg.
He seemed more cooperative.

29
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,239
At least in the initial interviews.

30
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,919
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

31
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,399
-I mean, you were attacked.
-It was poorly planned and executed.

32
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,959
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

33
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,559
These are the people
that died from pneumonic plague...

34
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,679
These were poisoned...

35
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,599
These died in the harbor explosion.

36
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,879
All in all, twelve people.

37
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,639
Hang on...
I've got nothing to do with this.

38
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:28,759
Four people donning identical masks
to yours have claimed responsibility.

39
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,159
But this was some other people,
this wasn't us...

40
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,759
These are the people that died. Right?

41
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,799
The prosecutor sees these
as acts of terror.

42
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,799
Knowledge of the attacks and group
affiliation is enough for a conviction.

43
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,439
But we're not affiliated.
Not with any group.

44
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,039
-Why did you attack me?
-Well...

45
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:03,119
We thought maybe we'd be able to
render you in exchange for safe conduct.

46
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,679
-That we'd get away.
-That would never have worked.

47
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,719
-Tell me about the golden toads.
-About the what, now...?

48
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,239
-Why did you stop using them?
-We've never used them.

49
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,159
We saw the animal-mask videos
and thought it'd be a good idea...

50
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,159
-For our cause.
-Your cause?

51
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,159
Yes, animal rights. We kind of went
with what they were doing.

52
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:39,919
-But... Yeah.
-Who's giving you your assignments?

53
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:48,719
-What do you mean?
-Your orders? Who decides what to do?

54
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,639
Well, that's...

55
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,359
That's Carl.

56
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:07,679
<i>Well, that's... That's Carl.</i>

57
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:12,199
<i>-Carl Sjöberg?
-Yes, that's correct.</i>

58
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:15,679
<i>So Carl Sjöberg planned what you did?</i>

59
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,879
<i>Yes.</i>

60
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,279
They're not pertinent to our case.
They're copycats.

61
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:29,439
No connection to Mother Of Three.
They're guilty of abduction and assault.

62
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,599
I'd like to apologize
for what happened here yesterday.

63
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,519
-Did you talk to Martin?
-About what?

64
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:47,639
He said you were out of line and should
apologize. Maybe he'd talked to you.

65
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,319
No, I... Unlike some, I don't need
Martin to tell me when I'm out of line.

66
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,239
By "some" you mean me?

67
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,999
I apologize
for what happened here yesterday.

68
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,759
Thank you.

69
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,799
-Alexander!
-Yes?

70
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,359
-Have you seen my cell phone?
-Um... No.

71
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,799
-Can I borrow yours?
-Why? I need it.

72
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,199
To call my cell!

73
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,519
Thank you...

74
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,479
-What's it doing here?
-How should I know? It's your phone!

75
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,679
-See you tonight.
-Yeah, see you.

76
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,999
Right. I gotta go now.

77
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:34,959
-Can I have a word?
-Sure.

78
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:38,279
Nikolaj, I'm stepping out.
You can still see us.

79
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:40,799
-Martin.
-Thorsen.

80
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,959
-Mette.
-Thorsen.

81
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:47,879
I've been told Nikolaj had a cold
and a sore throat a few weeks ago.

82
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:53,399
So this is probably acute
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

83
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,199
It means the throat infection
has spread to the kidneys.

84
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:04,199
It's harmless. Most patients make
a full recovery within a couple of weeks

85
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,959
and the kidneys resume normal function.

86
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:14,039
But I'd still like to do a biopsy on Nikolaj
to eliminate any other possibilities.

87
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,719
-Of course.
-What are the other possibilities?

88
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,519
The same symptoms occur
in other types of glomerulonephritis.

89
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,079
-In that case, it's a bit more serious.
-How much more serious?

90
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:35,079
In that case, we start a treatment with
steroids and chemotherapy immediately.

91
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:45,519
So I'd really like to do a biopsy
on Nikolaj's kidney as soon as possible.

92
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,959
Great.

93
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:19,239
The new group were just copycats.

94
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,359
So the four that died
in the container were the only cell.

95
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,199
Any remaining cells would have reacted
to the copycats stealing the spotlight.

96
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:34,479
So only Mother Of Three is left.
How long are you staying here?

97
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,079
As long as it takes.

98
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,199
-Has he been diagnosed?
-Something with the kidneys.

99
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:46,719
They're not working properly.
It was called...

100
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,719
-Glomerulonephritis or something.
-Glomerulonephritis?

101
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,119
Call me when you're ready
to come back to work.

102
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,639
Thank you.

103
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,839
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Meet me outside Glostrup Hospital.

104
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,239
Yes, as soon as possible. All right.

105
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,719
-I've been to Mette's house.
-Yes, and?

106
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,679
-We're going to arrest Anna-Dea.
-Why?

107
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,479
-What are you doing here?
-I need to talk to Anna-Dea.

108
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,759
Could you step outside with me?

109
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,079
-Who are you?
-I'm Martin's boss.

110
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,519
-Are you coming? It's important.
-No. I can't. I'm sitting here...

111
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:07,239
I can't right now.

112
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:12,559
Anna-Dea, please step outside with us.

113
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,839
She's poisoned Nikolaj.
"Munchausen by proxy."

114
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:41,759
She makes him ill by administering
blood pressure medication to him.

115
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,559
-It's not true...
-Why did you do that?

116
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,639
-It's a mental illness.
-No!

117
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,679
It makes you crave validation
and attention.

118
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,279
She hates me, Martin.
Don't believe her. It's a lie.

119
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,399
-She puts it in his juice.
-No...

120
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,319
I didn't do anything.

121
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,359
-Get her out of here.
-No, Martin!

122
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,159
Saga is the crazy one!

123
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:23,879
And Nikolaj needs me!

124
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:33,719
Munchausen?
I've never seen that before.

125
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,319
It's usually the parents.

126
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:39,919
-What'll happen to him now?
-He'll get better.

127
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,119
She stopped poisoning him
once he was admitted.

128
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,319
The idea is for him to be discharged
and then fall ill again.

129
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:51,879
-How come you know so much about it?
-I just do.

130
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:56,199
-Yes...
-All right.

131
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:04,239
-Saga, wait for me downstairs.
-You're coming back to work?

132
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,919
-I'm coming.
-Good.

133
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,679
I don't think I could bury another one.

134
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,079
But he was never supposed to die.

135
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:12,279
-He was supposed to be sick forever.
-More or less, yes.

136
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:20,879
-Thank you for saving him from that.
-You're welcome.

137
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,279
I mean it, Saga. Thank you.

138
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,559
Thank you.

139
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,719
All done? Can we go?

140
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,439
-I'll need another minute.
-Then I'll go wait in the car.

141
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,359
Caroline, did you see what happened?

142
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,759
<i>-No, what is it?</i>
-Claudio was murdered.

143
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,839
What? When did that happen?

144
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:55,039
It says that he died last night.

145
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,199
In a park. Some crazy person killed him.

146
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,239
<i>You'll get drawn into this now.</i>

147
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,319
Me? How?

148
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:07,119
<i>It must've happened after he saw you.</i>

149
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,719
What do you mean? I didn't see him.

150
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,599
But... Did you cancel?

151
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,559
<i>No, I hadn't... What do you mean?</i>

152
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,399
He texted me that you were meeting.

153
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,359
Did he say how we agreed to meet?

154
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,119
<i>You texted him, I think. Do you contact
each other in any other way?</i>

155
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:38,079
No. Listen, I have a meeting.
I have to go. I'll talk to you later.

156
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,559
Dharma, can you help me with something?

157
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:05,479
I accidentally deleted some messages.
Can you retrieve them in any way?

158
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:09,119
-Yeah, I think so.
-Thanks.

159
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:20,279
How did you figure it out?

160
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,679
The signs were there
if you knew what to look for.

161
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,959
-And you knew?
-Yes.

162
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,119
How did you know?

163
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,879
I've seen it before, on a case.

164
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,439
Jakob's mother is coming
to dinner tonight.

165
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,599
-First time?
-Yes.

166
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,759
Nervous?

167
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,639
Mothers tend to dislike their sons'
partners more than their daughters'.

168
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,599
I never got along with any of my
mother-in-laws, if it's any consolation.

169
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,279
-Why would it be?
-Anyway, that's how it was.

170
00:19:55,439 --> 00:20:00,159
You don't think it's because
you always cheated on their daughters?

171
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,439
We've got a body.

172
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,559
Claus Damgaard, goes by the name
of Claudio, 44 years of age.

173
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:14,079
A Copenhagen resident,
found dead in a park there last night.

174
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,839
-A Dane dead in Denmark? Why is he here?
-He's for you.

175
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:22,839
-But why?
-He's been battered, as you can see.

176
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:25,959
But that wasn't the cause of death.

177
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,639
The Danes found the same poison
as in the fruits and shellfish

178
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,239
and which killed that woman
in the hospital.

179
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:40,719
-What was his line of business?
-He sold exclusive sexual services.

180
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:43,039
Apparently, he was expensive.

181
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,279
Send me a report.

182
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,239
-He had a small penis.
-I didn't notice.

183
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:05,039
He did. It'd be bigger erect,
but it was definitely not big.

184
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:08,439
-Why are we talking about this?
-It's weird.

185
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,639
-What's that got to do with anything?
-Dunno.

186
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:16,799
I just expected other physical
attributes if he's so successful.

187
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,159
So you think size matters?

188
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,759
He fulfilled fantasies. Few women
fantasize about small penises.

189
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,239
He could still be good at sex.

190
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,919
I'm not saying he wasn't.
Jakob is very good at sex.

191
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,159
-His is barely 4 inches.
-Stop!

192
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,959
I don't need to hear about the size
of your boyfriend's dick.

193
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,159
-Why not?
-Drop it.

194
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,199
I know what you want to ask me,
and I'm not gonna tell you.

195
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,959
-What?
-Forget it.

196
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:40,639
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

197
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,599
-But...why?
-It was on my list.

198
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,839
-What list?
-I'm dying, I'm getting a tattoo...

199
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:52,359
I've got a list. How hard is it
to figure out? It's a bucket list.

200
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:01,799
-Have you thought about the memoirs?
-Yeah, not on my list.

201
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,999
I met a friend last night
who's a publisher.

202
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,399
-She sounded enthused.
-I don't have time, Oliver.

203
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,079
She'll do the writing, I'll assist
with the research. Just meet her.

204
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,639
Why are you so eager about the book?

205
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,439
What you've accomplished is astonishing.

206
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,999
Why not tell people about it? I want
everyone to be as proud of you as I am.

207
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,239
-You're sucking up.
-Yes, I'm sorry.

208
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,319
I'll meet her. We'll see.

209
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,679
Briefing.

210
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,719
Claus Damgaard, a.k.a. Claudio.
44 years of age.

211
00:23:55,879 --> 00:24:01,239
Copenhagen resident, prostitute, likely
active on both sides of the strait.

212
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,639
Beat up and killed with the same poison.

213
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,519
-Hence the connection.
-It can't get leaked to the press.

214
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,439
If Claudio was hooking
maybe the connection is just sex.

215
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,959
It could mean Mother Of Three
actually is a woman.

216
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:21,159
-We need to know who his clients were.
-How? They won't turn themselves in.

217
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,359
-His cell phone.
-None was found on his person.

218
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,999
-No phone plan, say Danish police.
-Are we searching his apartment?

219
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,479
Pernille, ask the Danish police
to send us the file.

220
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,799
What fun do you have for me today?

221
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:42,719
Go through the case again
for anything we've overlooked.

222
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:46,359
-You realize the sheer volume of that?
-Yes.

223
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,959
-I've printed them out for you.
-Thanks.

224
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,199
THE PAVILION AT THE PARK AT 9 P.M.
GREAT SEE YOU THERE.

225
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,359
-Is anything wrong?
-No. It's just...

226
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,359
Someone sent messages from my phone.

227
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,719
I'll figure it out. Thank you.

228
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,279
-Could you close the door, please?
-Yeah.

229
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,679
Hello, my name is Caroline Brandstrup.

230
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,199
I'd like to report a crime.

231
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,479
Alexander Brandstrup? Police.
Will you come with us?

232
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:29,359
Send him over straight away.
All right, thanks. That was Lillian.

233
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,639
They got someone for Damgaard's murder.
They'll bring him over.

234
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,439
-Who's that?
-Claus Damgaard.

235
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,359
He was found dead last night.

236
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,279
Don't know him. Never seen him before.
I've got nothing to do with this.

237
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,679
Where were you last night
between 9 and 12 p.m.?

238
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,199
-At the office.
-Alone?

239
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,639
Your wife claims
you're involved in this.

240
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,479
She's mistaken.

241
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:11,919
-Sure you don't want a lawyer present?
-I'm a lawyer myself.

242
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,319
-Not a criminal lawyer.
-I'm sure I'll manage.

243
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:19,319
People in your position
usually think so.

244
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,759
-You've never met Damgaard?
-No.

245
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,439
Never contacted him
using your wife's cell phone?

246
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,239
No.

247
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:34,239
So when we search your home,
office, car, we'll find nothing?

248
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,959
No.

249
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,759
What... What's this?

250
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,639
Pictures of the people that died
from the same poison as Damgaard.

251
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,239
-He was poisoned?
-How do you think he died?

252
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,919
I... I don't know.

253
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:22,159
He slept with your wife?
Was that why you beat him first?

254
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:30,719
Your field is
international environmental law.

255
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,959
How's that going, you think?

256
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,959
-Are we making small talk while we wait?
-No.

257
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,559
OK.

258
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,079
They found traces of blood in your car
and on the snow shovel.

259
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:59,199
You don't think the wounds
on Claus Damgaard will match?

260
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:09,159
-I didn't kill him.
-No. Not with the snow shovel.

261
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:16,359
He took his wife's cell phone.

262
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,319
He set up a meeting and beat him up.

263
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:22,359
He said Damgaard was alive
when he left him.

264
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,279
Techs found no poison in his home,
but they found a gun.

265
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:29,359
We'll see if the ballistics
match with Laura.

266
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,479
If Alexander left him beaten but alive,
the perp must've showed up right after.

267
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:39,519
-Right.
-How did he know where they were?

268
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,839
Alexander's wife had
a cell number for Claudio.

269
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:46,479
I'll get John to check the traffic
with the carrier.

270
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,599
-So you think Alexander shot Laura?
-Could be.

271
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,279
At least we'll have time
to check his alibi.

272
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,919
-Good luck tonight.
-With what?

273
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,199
Isn't your mother-in-law coming?

274
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:18,479
Just act like you're interested
and you'll be fine.

275
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,319
-But I'm not interested.
-No, but still.

276
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:25,519
Ask her where she lives,
what she does... Normal stuff.

277
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,679
I'm sure you'll be fine.

278
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,439
-Yes. Thanks.
-Thanks for saving Nikolaj.

279
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,279
You've said that many times now.

280
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,999
-Pernille. Want a ride?
-Sure, I'd love to.

281
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,119
-Five minutes.
-OK.

282
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,639
-I'm glad your son's doing better.
-Thank you.

283
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,999
-I need you to do me a favor.
-OK.

284
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,999
You have access
to the Swedish archives, right?

285
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,559
-Can you find an old case file?
-I need to know a little bit more.

286
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:23,519
16 years ago. 14-year-old girl jumps
in front of a train here in Malmö.

287
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,359
-Do you have a name?
-Yes.

288
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,639
Norén.

289
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:33,439
Can we keep it between us?

290
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,639
OK.

291
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,719
-But it'll cost you.
-OK...?

292
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:44,479
-The cups.
-Get out of here!

293
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:48,399
-Is that it?
-I can think of more fun stuff.

294
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,079
I sure hope so.

295
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,399
Where is the real proposal?

296
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,879
That is the real proposal.

297
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:04,039
I know it's not what you want, Richard,
but it's the best offer you'll get.

298
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,919
-I don't think so.
-I do.

299
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:13,039
FDA won't approve Camprax in the US,
your Restopolin and Trombolec patents

300
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:17,239
expire in less than six months,
so how will you make money?

301
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:22,039
-FDA hasn't decided on Camprax yet.
-Not officially.

302
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,039
If it is as you say,
then why do you want to buy us?

303
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,519
Because you don't want to sell.
At least not to me.

304
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,399
-I can sell to someone else.
-Sure...

305
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,519
And who is going to buy
once word gets out on Camprax?

306
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,119
A dying woman's
last desperate attempt to get her will.

307
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,639
Yeah... Seems your company and I
have about the same amount of time left.

308
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,879
Do you know what you can do with this?
Shove it up your pussy!

309
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,879
Up my pussy, you say? I'll be damned.

310
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:11,959
Once you're buried
and you feel your coffin shaking,

311
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,559
that's us, dancing on your grave.

312
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:19,479
I take it that's a no, then?

313
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:23,159
Take it as a declaration of war.

314
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:52,559
-So I gave up my place and moved in.
-You did the right thing.

315
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:56,279
-Look who it is!
-There she is! Hi.

316
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:59,039
This is Saga.
Jeanette, my mother.

317
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:01,559
-I know.
-Pleased to meet you.

318
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:04,599
Saga works on the plague
and poisonings...

319
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:08,199
-Right, the gold frog.
-It's a toad, Mom. Not a frog.

320
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,719
I'm sorry. And how is that going?

321
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,399
I can't discuss the case with civilians.

322
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,319
-I understand.
-I'm just going to see to dinner.

323
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,119
Jakob's brother is a cop, too.
Maybe you already knew.

324
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:28,399
-Yes.
-In Gävle.

325
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,599
Yes, I know.

326
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,199
-Nice place you guys have here.
-It's my place.

327
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:41,839
I know, but you live here together.
That's what I meant.

328
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:47,759
-Where do you live?
-I still live in Växjö.

329
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,319
That's where Jakob was born.
I'm sure you knew that.

330
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:55,359
-No. You like it?
-Yes, it's nice.

331
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,479
But it's a bit on the quiet side.

332
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,999
-It's good you don't live nearby.
-What do you mean by that?

333
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:06,959
Statistically, that could aggravate
relationship problems.

334
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,679
The parents are perceived
to interfere too much.

335
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:14,199
-You've experienced this?
-No. I've read about it.

336
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,639
I've never had a mother-in-law.

337
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:19,919
And still, you want me
as far away as possible?

338
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,679
Dinner's ready, you guys!
Come and sit down.

339
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,479
Yummy.

340
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,799
I stopped by the Indian restaurant.

341
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:39,039
-I'm not hungry.
-No, but you might get hungry.

342
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,439
-Are we waiting for your friend?
-He's not coming.

343
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,519
-Why not?
-I forgot to call him.

344
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:56,039
Did you read it?

345
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,079
Maybe.

346
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:03,399
This is your last chance.
I'm taking it with me today.

347
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:06,359
-Why?
-Lillian wants it back.

348
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:09,999
She chewed me out
when she learned I gave it to you.

349
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,279
Should I feel sorry for you
or be grateful for reading it?

350
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,679
So you did read it?

351
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,159
-Yes.
-Good.

352
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,639
I want to hear your thoughts.

353
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,999
-So I talk, you write?
-Yes. That's the gist of it.

354
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,319
-And what do I talk about?
-Everything.

355
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:52,839
As far as I'm concerned,
the more, the better.

356
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:56,039
Then we'll edit the text
together afterwards.

357
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:00,959
-What if I'm not alive then?
-Then I'll take it up with your brother.

358
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,479
If we're to do this, he stays out of it.
He knows nothing, he reads nothing.

359
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,759
-Can I ask why?
-No. Not at this stage.

360
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,439
OK.

361
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:22,159
If I'm going to tell all,
the same goes for you.

362
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,159
Tell me something about you
no one else knows.

363
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:31,839
Is this some kind of test?

364
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:36,119
More like a...job interview,
I guess you could call it.

365
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,079
I've had sex with that guy.

366
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,999
So have I, actually.

367
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,799
And no one knows about it?

368
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:08,599
-Yes. My sister.
-Then it doesn't count.

369
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,599
Tell me something else - a secret.

370
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,759
I'm fucking my sister's husband.

371
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,759
Call my assistant and set up a meeting.

372
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:52,839
I'll see myself out.

373
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:02,639
Pernille thinks Mother Of Three
could be a woman.

374
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,719
Nothing in here points
to anything specific.

375
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,919
I wouldn't rule anything out.

376
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:31,799
-Nikolaj is in the hospital.
-Why are we talking about him?

377
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:37,039
-Just making small talk.
-You came here to make small talk?

378
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,719
No. I came here to work,
and we've done that now.

379
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:46,079
-This wasn't work.
-Whatever. You weren't hungry, either.

380
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,439
-I have to go back.
-Someone waiting for you?

381
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,919
-Hey, kids.
-Hi, Dad.

382
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:24,519
-Hello...
-Hello.

383
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,559
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

384
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:34,679
-They asked about Anna-Dea.
-Oh? What did you tell them?

385
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:39,079
That she got caught stealing
from people, so the police took her.

386
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,159
-I told them she was a thief.
-OK.

387
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,399
What should I have said?
That she tried to kill their brother?

388
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,879
No, no.

389
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:53,399
They miss her, but I couldn't pretend
that she was a good person.

390
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:58,319
Of course not.
I think you said the right thing.

391
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:03,399
-I'm relieving my mom at the hospital.
-I'll be here.

392
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:10,359
-I think I'll stay the night.
-I can stay for as long as you need.

393
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,639
-Get going.
-Yes. See you.

394
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,279
-Hey, kids! Make room for Dad!
-Yeah!

395
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:56,159
-I want to have sex.
-Now?

396
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,279
-Yes.
-But my mom is right in there.

397
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:02,439
Yes, but we can have sex here.

398
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:05,159
-She'll hear us.
-Does that bother you?

399
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:07,319
Well, yeah, a little.

400
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:11,399
Why? You're an adult.
She must know you're sexually active.

401
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,679
Knowing is one thing. Hearing me
have it is completely different.

402
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:20,319
-You're sure?
-It's tempting, but yes.

403
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,719
OK.

404
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:19,959
Hey. Sorry, I thought you were going
to stay the night at the hospital.

405
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:22,519
My mom stayed.

406
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:27,319
Will you put your arms around me?

407
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:07,719
Morning!

408
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:10,079
-Hello.
-Hello.

409
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,239
-You know how many we're dealing with?
-No. A lot, apparently.

410
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:23,599
-Did the divers touch anything?
-No. They pried open the cabin.

411
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:28,759
They turned around immediately when
they saw what was in it. So they said.

412
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,159
-It was sunk, right?
-It would appear so.

413
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,519
We're tracking down the owner.

414
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:38,719
Will you hold it for me?

415
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:16,999
What are you doing?

416
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:19,319
I'm masturbating.

417
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:22,239
I can see that, but I'm right here!

418
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:25,919
You didn't want to have sex
because of your mom.

419
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,679
No, but I'm still lying right here!

420
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:35,079
I've read a lot of men are turned on
by watching their girlfriend masturbate.

421
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:41,759
I'm going to fix some breakfast.

422
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:45,079
I'm almost done.

423
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,479
-Morning.
-Morning, Mom.

424
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:06,159
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

425
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,079
<i>-It's Pernille. This a bad time?</i>
-Yes. What do you want?

426
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,279
Some divers found a boat
with the bones of seven corpses.

427
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:17,439
<i>They were all shot, it seems.</i>

428
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,559
The police tracked down the owner
and contacted us.

429
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:24,559
<i>-Why is that?</i>
-Guess who the owner is?

430
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,759
<i>-No. I never make guesses.</i>
-Marcus Stenberg.

431
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:31,799
OK. Thanks.

432
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:43,839
There were seven dead people
on your boat.

433
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,719
What are you talking about?
Where was this?

434
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:53,519
We found seven dead people
on your sunken boat.

435
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,599
That's what we'd like
to talk to you about.

436
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:03,879
-I don't know...
-What don't you know?

437
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:11,439
It was stolen...many years ago.
I was on vacation with my then-wife.

438
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,479
I got home, it was missing.
I reported it, claimed the insurance...

439
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,359
I don't understand...what's happening.
I know nothing about any of this.

440
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:28,159
Who beat you?

441
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:34,479
I've got some...problems,
but nothing related to any murders.

442
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:36,639
What problems?

443
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:42,639
About a year ago, the business wasn't
going too well, I needed new capital.

444
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:47,959
So this other firm, Söderberg & Joost,
came in with their capital

445
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,439
in exchange for a minority stake
in the company.

446
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,999
And I suspect, or I know, that they
are using the firm for money laundering

447
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,959
and I also think they put
their goods in my shipments.

448
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,759
-They're smuggling?
-I don't know, I think so.

449
00:49:05,919 --> 00:49:08,679
Can you help me?

450
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:12,319
-Let's say we believe you...
-It's the truth.

451
00:49:12,479 --> 00:49:17,039
Two of your boats have turned up
in our investigation!

452
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,159
If you don't know anything about this...

453
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:25,639
...at least you ought to be interested
in knowing who's after you.

454
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:31,799
Stenberg reported his motor boat
stolen some nine years ago.

455
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:34,799
He got his insurance money.
That was that.

456
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:39,999
I want all missing persons from March
nine years ago and the past six months.

457
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:42,159
-Age groups?
-All. Men, women.

458
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,439
Primarily in Denmark and Sweden.

459
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,039
We found nothing at his home
but this old report says

460
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,919
that Stenberg was
in Thailand at the time.

461
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,679
Maybe he ordered the sinking
and left to have an alibi.

462
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:56,839
That's not enough to hold him.

463
00:49:57,919 --> 00:50:02,439
Pernille, go show Laura pictures
of Alexander and Stenberg.

464
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:06,599
Alexander Brandstrup has an alibi
for the murder of Beate.

465
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:12,319
He was in Stockholm. And the bullets
from his gun don't match.

466
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:17,359
If Alexander didn't do it, how did
the murderer know where Claudio was?

467
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:23,359
Claudio's last four texts were sent
to and from a prepaid phone.

468
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:25,919
-And you can't trace that?
-We tried.

469
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,599
-It must be off or destroyed.
-What did the texts say?

470
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,759
"Claudissimio, where are you?
I'm longing for you."

471
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:46,079
"On my way to the park.
Were we meeting today?"

472
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,279
"No, just missing you.
Where in the park can we meet?"

473
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:54,839
"By the pavilion. Not a good idea.
I'll get back to you."

474
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:58,839
-That supports Alexander's version.
-And that it's a woman.

475
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:01,479
"Claudissimio" definitely banged her.

476
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:05,359
-Anyone got anything else?
-I do. This Boris Williams...

477
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,079
Poisoned-meat guy. He reported
a burglary two days before he died.

478
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:13,719
-What's that got to do with anything?
-I don't know.

479
00:51:13,879 --> 00:51:17,479
Saga asked me
to go through the case from scratch.

480
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:20,279
-Yes. Keep going.
-Yes...

481
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:31,039
-I stayed the night at Mette's place.
-Oh?

482
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,839
It was so nice to sleep at home again.

483
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:37,399
You've never lived there.
It can't be home to you.

484
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:41,039
Home to me is to be
with the whole family.

485
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,799
-Is Nikolaj back?
-OK, almost the whole family.

486
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:51,599
You know very few separated couples
manage to make it work again?

487
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:55,519
Why would you say that?
Can I not be a little bit happy?

488
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:02,039
Yes, but realistic expectations for the
future may help avoid disappointment.

489
00:52:03,759 --> 00:52:07,359
-Could you please not talk?
-Yes.

490
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:09,839
Thank you.

491
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,799
So... Are you doing the list?

492
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:42,239
Yes... Fugu.
Extremely poisonous Japanese blowfish.

493
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:45,199
-I know what Fugu is.
-Want some?

494
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,639
No, thanks. I just wanted to ask
if you'd met with Bodil.

495
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,839
Yes. You'll have your book.

496
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,519
-So you liked her?
-I'm sure we'll get along.

497
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:06,719
-Great. I'll draw up contracts and...
-Do that.

498
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,279
-You know Richard Strandh, right?
-Yes. I met with him yesterday. Why?

499
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:20,959
He was beat up last night
in a parking garage.

500
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,439
-Three guys just jumped him, apparently.
-Oh...

501
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:35,199
All right, talk to you later.

502
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:51,799
We can't board yet. They're not sure
they've located all the body parts.

503
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:54,479
How did it go with your mother-in-law?

504
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,159
Good. I asked where she lived.

505
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:59,759
-Saga!
-Yes?

506
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,159
-What's that?
-A breast implant.

507
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,439
-A breast implant?
-Yes.

508
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,959
-Where did you find it?
-Down there.

509
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:14,479
Try to find a serial number
and send it over. Thanks.

510
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,599
-A breast implant?
-You put it in your boobs to get...

511
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:22,759
Saga, I know what it is.

512
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,679
-OK. So you're going now?
-Yes...

513
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:40,399
-Well, don't go too far.
-No. Ystad. Is that OK?

514
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,639
That's OK.

515
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:02,999
-Did Laura recognize anyone?
-No.

516
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:05,479
We have information
from Copenhagen.

517
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:10,759
A witness saw a white car parked
near where Damgaard was murdered.

518
00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:14,399
-Did she see the plates?
-She took a photo.

519
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:19,999
-It was reported stolen.
-It's like the one from Laura's video.

520
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:22,839
Who's the owner?

521
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,319
-Theodor Bruse in Malmö.
-Send the address.

522
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:49,399
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
Is this your car?

523
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,919
-Could be.
-You're the registered owner.

524
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,319
-So you knew it was mine?
-Yes.

525
00:55:56,479 --> 00:56:01,199
Your car was seen at a crime scene.
What do you have to say to that?

526
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,479
It's mine, but I never drive it.

527
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:07,079
-Who does, then?
-I don't know.

528
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:11,279
-Why don't you know?
-I don't know who drives any of my cars.

529
00:56:11,439 --> 00:56:17,039
-You're saying you have more cars?
-Yeah. I have more.

530
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:28,119
-He owns 187 cars.
-187 cars? Then it's in name only.

531
00:56:28,279 --> 00:56:31,479
-What do you mean?
-He's someone without assets.

532
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:35,839
He has vehicles in his name
to get the drivers out of tickets.

533
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:38,799
And they never know who the drivers are.

534
00:56:38,959 --> 00:56:44,799
We'll hold Bruse and see if he knows who
asked him to be the owner of that car.

535
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:52,959
<i>The police have released a photo
of the boat that divers found yesterday.</i>

536
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,279
<i>They found the remains
of seven individuals on board the boat.</i>

537
00:56:57,439 --> 00:57:00,159
<i>The boat was stolen
from Wimar's Marina...</i>

538
00:57:12,919 --> 00:57:16,919
<i>-Information. How may I help you?</i>
-I need a number.

539
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:27,959
<i>-Hello?</i>
-I'm the one who sank your boat.

540
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:31,919
You forgot to tell me
there were seven people in it.

541
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,279
<i>It's going to cost you.</i>

542
