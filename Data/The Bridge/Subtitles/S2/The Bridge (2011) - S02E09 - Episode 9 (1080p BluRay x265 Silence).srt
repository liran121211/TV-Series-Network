1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:09,119
So that's what we're dealing with?
A pathos-driven eco-terrorism of sorts?

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,159
They've discussed a "birthday party"
and "graduation."

3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:17,399
Romstock started its production
exactly three years ago today.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,279
So the question is,
what's the graduation?

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,879
Our only leads are
Medisonus and Mother Of Three.

6
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:30,519
Our head of security
found a forged access card.

7
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,439
Mikkel Höst has used his card
several times over the last few months.

8
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,919
Very often after normal work hours.

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,119
-And you never employed a Mikkel Höst?
-Never.

10
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:45,159
CEO and majority owner
is Viktoria Nordgren.

11
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:48,719
<i>-I'd never allow...
-...anything to stand in my way.</i>

12
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,359
-I thought you'd be home late.
-It is late.

13
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,639
Police! Freeze!

14
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,639
Peter Thaulov is not
on Medisonus' payroll.

15
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,639
But he does handle security
for Medisonus and other firms.

16
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,119
One is Copenhagen IT Consulting.

17
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,999
Helga Blomgren travels to Thailand
a lot. She has her mail forwarded.

18
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,519
Lennart Blomgren. He's alive.

19
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:35,279
Someone logged in
with the handle "Mother Of Three."

20
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,599
-What do you know about Mother Of Three?
-Mother Of Three? Nothing. Who is that?

21
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,479
I saw the guy who shot me -
in my dream! Call the police!

22
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,279
Yes, that's it. That's him.

23
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,719
EPISODE 9

24
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,999
-Looks nothing like Peter Thaulov.
-No, it doesn't.

25
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,799
Whoever shot Laura
must be Mother Of Three.

26
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,439
Hence Peter Thaulov
is not Mother Of Three.

27
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:46,239
-He could still be Mikkel Höst.
-And he could still ID this person.

28
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,879
He looks familiar,
but I can't place him.

29
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,719
We've searched your home and office.

30
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,759
-What...did you tell my wife?
-We found this at your office.

31
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,239
A Medisonus access card
issued to Mikkel Höst.

32
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,759
-Hang on, that can't be right.
-Yes.

33
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:24,919
In that case it was planted there.
Someone's trying to frame me.

34
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,319
I alerted you to Mikkel Höst.
Would I have done that if it was me?

35
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,239
Gertrud Kofoed told us about him.
You answered questions.

36
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,879
I thought it was about something else.
It has nothing to do with me.

37
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,359
-Who knows about Höst?
-Many people.

38
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,799
I told Medisonus' management,
my bosses at FRIM,

39
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,239
my co-workers at Medisonus
who need to know...

40
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,719
-How many people is that?
-About 20.

41
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,119
And who among those 20 people
is trying to frame you?

42
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,479
-How's it going?
-Good.

43
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,479
I'm almost done. You want some coffee?

44
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,319
No, thank you. Does that mean you'll
be spending less time in the basement?

45
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,519
What's that supposed to mean?

46
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,879
Exactly that. You're down there
in front of your computer a lot.

47
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,359
I'm working.

48
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,039
Sometimes it seems
you'd rather be there than with me.

49
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,399
How's Viktoria today?

50
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,439
I don't know, I haven't seen her.

51
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,799
Why? Is she not feeling well?
Did she tell you something?

52
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,479
-No. Maybe you'd seen her, is all.
-No.

53
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,759
Nothing.
How long can we keep this photo?

54
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,559
48 hours.
What the hell are you doing here?

55
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:14,359
-I've got something.
-You're off the case.

56
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,519
This is from Ängby
high school 1988-1989.

57
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:22,479
That's Viktoria Nordgren. Weren't you
looking into Medisonus when I left?

58
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,719
-You didn't leave, you were reassigned.
-You looked into Medisonus. So did I.

59
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,759
Check out the back row,
in the middle - number six.

60
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,719
-Marcus Stenberg.
-They know each other.

61
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,159
He's shown up three times in this case.
He was a classmate of Medisonus' CEO.

62
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,639
-You think that's a coincidence?
-That's unlikely.

63
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,799
Thanks.

64
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,559
-I don't suppose there's a chance...?
-No. Not a chance.

65
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,599
Right... Right, OK.

66
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:24,199
-I've stopped seeing Jens.
-I told you it would be useless.

67
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:28,279
But it wasn't. I got to him.

68
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:34,039
-You got to him?
-To the old Jens. I got to him.

69
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:37,879
-Did he ask for forgiveness?
-No, but there's no need.

70
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,079
I could see it in his eyes.

71
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,159
-And that's enough for you?
-Yes.

72
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:50,639
That's enough for me, because now I'm
free of him. He's not in here anymore.

73
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,559
And that's enough for me, Saga.

74
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:06,239
-What do you want this time?
-Her.

75
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,799
-Viktoria. What about her?
-You remember her?

76
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,719
Yeah, we dated a couple of months
our senior year. Why?

77
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,399
-Have you seen her lately?
-Not since high school.

78
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,719
-Any reason she'd have it in for you?
-After 25 years? No.

79
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,319
What about when you were dating?
Any problems from back then?

80
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,519
No, like what?

81
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,999
Rape, sexual exploitation,
physical or psychological abuse.

82
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,479
What do you think of me?

83
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,719
Nothing. But violence is
not uncommon in close relationships.

84
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:51,159
OK... So you think she's somehow
involved in what's been going on?

85
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,439
-Do you?
-No.

86
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,679
Do you recognize this person?

87
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,559
No, sorry.

88
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:08,519
-If you think of anything...
-I'll call. I know the drill.

89
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,879
-What did Stenberg say?
-Nothing, really.

90
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,839
Thai police apprehended
Lennart Blomgren.

91
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:27,519
John is working out the technical kinks
so you can question him.

92
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,239
You should be all set.

93
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,839
Lennart, can you hear us?
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

94
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:44,639
This is Martin Rohde, Copenhagen Police.
We need to ask you about seven bodies.

95
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,079
At least three were involved in a trial
at Medisonus in 2002-2003

96
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:54,639
when you were head of research.
Why are you hiding out in Thailand?

97
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,799
What do you want to know?

98
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,999
Tell us about the trials.

99
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,719
It was for a drug that was meant
to mitigate effects of any intolerance.

100
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,079
Gluten, lactose... The new, widespread
afflictions of Western society.

101
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,439
And what happened?

102
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:22,599
We'd just begun trials when we learned
our competitor was doing the same thing.

103
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:27,039
So they asked me to move things along.

104
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,199
So you skipped several steps
in the research?

105
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:36,559
We went from unfinished animal testing
straight to phase-one trials.

106
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,999
Seven subjects.

107
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,919
Later on the animals
exhibited severe side effects.

108
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,919
-I contacted management.
-Who was in management?

109
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,439
I reported only to our global
R&D director in Germany.

110
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,439
-What was his or her name?
-Pascal Brennan.

111
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,559
Then what?

112
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:05,039
They wanted me to destroy
everything to do with the trials.

113
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,239
And I...did as they said.

114
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,159
What happened to the subjects?

115
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:16,519
Pascal got their personal information
and told me I couldn't contact them.

116
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,879
-Did you try to contact them anyway?
-Later on...

117
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,279
But they had disappeared.
They had all disappeared.

118
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:30,559
-I got scared, so I disappeared, too.
-Pascal Brennan, 2005.

119
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:35,639
SCIENTIST DIES IN SINGLE-CAR ACCIDENT
Pascal Brennan Is Dead

120
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,399
-What happens to me now?
-This interrogation is over.

121
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,399
Who were on the board ten years ago?

122
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,079
We'll find out, but Viktoria Nordgren
was already CEO.

123
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,359
Viktoria Nordgren, Medisonus.
Connections to the case?

124
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,559
We know there's a connection
between Nordgren and Stenberg.

125
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,479
Three of the seven in the motorboat
are connected. The rest, too, probably.

126
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,639
The text to Sammy Nyrop came from
the area where Medisonus is located.

127
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,479
The plague bacteria and the poison
are also most likely from Medisonus.

128
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,799
Romstock, the company
with the leak of propyl...

129
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,199
-Propylene oxide.
-Right.

130
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:25,399
Romstock supplies chemicals to Philbs
& Son, Medisonus' biggest competitor.

131
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,119
The attack on Romstock
halted their production for weeks.

132
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,199
We still don't know
what the "graduation" is.

133
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:35,999
Viktoria is speaking
at the EU summit this week.

134
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,999
Speaking at the EU summit? I've heard
that, in connection with someone else.

135
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,399
What are you thinking?

136
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:57,159
Boris Williams - the poisoned-meat guy.

137
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,479
He'd been announced
as a speaker at the EU summit.

138
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:04,479
Rasmus didn't find a toad
where it was bought.

139
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,879
His place was broken into
two days before he died.

140
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,359
How did we miss that connection?

141
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,079
Maybe the meat
was poisoned in his home?

142
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:15,799
That explains why there was no toad.

143
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,599
At 3 p.m.
it's Viktoria Nordgren's speech:

144
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,599
"Local commitment, global results."

145
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,279
-Caroline Brandstrup.
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

146
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:31,999
-We spoke the other day.
-I know, but I'm busy now.

147
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,399
Boris Williams was to speak
at the EU summit.

148
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,799
-Right, but he's dead.
-I know.

149
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,999
But why was he replaced
by Viktoria Nordgren?

150
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,799
It was always going to be
one of the two.

151
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,399
So Viktoria Nordgren was
the only possible candidate?

152
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,279
Yes. Why do you ask? Hello?

153
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:57,079
That was Lillian. She got a warrant
to search Viktoria Nordgren's place.

154
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:00,519
She has cancer.
She only has six months to live.

155
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,319
-Why is that important?
-No way she could do all that.

156
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,519
So we assume she's not alone.
Laura's shooter was a man.

157
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,599
-Is she married?
-No. But she has a brother.

158
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,039
Can you get a picture of him, John?

159
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,879
This is him right here.

160
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,399
I'll be damned.

161
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,719
Send us his address.

162
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,639
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Where are you?

163
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,919
<i>-At home.</i>
-Come over.

164
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,799
<i>-What's up? Did something happen?</i>
-Come over now.

165
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,159
-Who was that?
-Viktoria.

166
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:22,319
She wanted me to come over.

167
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,559
And you certainly don't mind.

168
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,279
Pernille, you're on speaker.

169
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:53,479
<i>Medisonus' stock rose 6.8 points
after the plague broke out.</i>

170
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,639
Does Oliver work at Medisonus?

171
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:01,919
<i>No, but between the Nordgren siblings
they control almost 50 percent of shares.</i>

172
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,519
What did they make off the outbreak?

173
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,639
<i>The value of Viktoria's shares rose
by 200 million kroner.</i>

174
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,399
-Viktoria?
-In here.

175
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,319
Hi.

176
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,399
Sit down.

177
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,599
-How are you?
-Sit.

178
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,759
I saw Bodil today.

179
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,759
Enough already.

180
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,999
-You stop meddling in my life.
-I just wanted to help...

181
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,119
I don't give a shit what you wanted!
You think I need you.

182
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,599
I don't. I never did.

183
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,439
I've tolerated having you
running around me,

184
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,439
buying a house
30 yards away from mine...

185
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,719
That you're here seeking validation
every ten fucking minutes,

186
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:21,319
and never showed the slightest hint
of any talent or initiative.

187
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,759
You're useless.

188
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,439
And my life is literally too short
to have useless people around me.

189
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,599
-I've only tried to...
-Yes!

190
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,679
You've tried. But it hasn't
worked out all that great, has it?

191
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,919
-Sorry, I...
-Cut it out!

192
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,719
-Leave the keys and get out of here.
-The keys...?

193
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:48,279
Put the keys on the table and leave.

194
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:51,759
I decide if and when
you enter this house again.

195
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,999
Viktoria.

196
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,639
What?

197
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,199
You said I never showed
any talent or initiative.

198
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,439
That I'm useless.

199
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,959
You have no idea what I've done for you.

200
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,479
I was the one who spread the plague.

201
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,599
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

202
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,479
<i>I had those kids infected
and had the boat run aground.</i>

203
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,719
<i>Our stock shot up almost seven points.</i>

204
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,079
How do you think you got
that EU summit job?

205
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:27,959
-Boris died.
-Exactly.

206
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,199
I've always been there for you.

207
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:40,199
The side effects of the intolerance drug
could have ruined us.

208
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,359
-I dealt with that, too.
-What do you mean?

209
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,879
I sank them
in Marcus Stenberg's motorboat.

210
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,479
Remember Marcus?
Who knocked you up in high school?

211
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,919
He broke up after your abortion.

212
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,119
<i>He had it coming, like all those who
try to get away with mistreating you.</i>

213
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,959
<i>Like that little Claudissimio of yours.</i>

214
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,239
He wanted to write a book
about all the people he'd fucked.

215
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,719
I want everyone to respect you
the way I respect you.

216
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,759
The way I love you, Viktoria.

217
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:37,479
They need to see how amazing you are.
People are so easily forgotten.

218
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,759
But I'll make sure everyone
remembers you and what you've done.

219
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,519
-Oliver...
-My finale will make you immortal.

220
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,239
-Oliver...
-You're going to save Europe.

221
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,519
<i>-Oliver, hear me out...
-It's too late.</i>

222
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,519
<i>-The wheels are in motion.
-Go to the cops.</i>

223
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,359
I know you wouldn't want this,
but that's impossible.

224
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:05,399
Everyone knows you're ill. You'll be
a saint, who died quietly in her sleep.

225
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,919
No... Oliver!

226
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,879
No...

227
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,479
Oliver!

228
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:52,679
-The doors are open in both houses.
-Wait here.

229
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,559
-What's our play?
-You take Oliver's house. Martin, come.

230
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,239
Copenhagen Police!

231
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,639
Just go in.

232
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,199
Hans, you'd better come over here. Now.

233
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:41,359
-So your brother was trying to kill you?
-Yes. Suffocate me with a pillow.

234
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,399
Then your sister-in-law
comes to the rescue?

235
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,079
Yes.

236
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,479
I don't remember what happened...

237
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,479
Saga?

238
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:02,239
This was found in one of his drawers.
Is it the same poison from the food?

239
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,039
Palytoxin.

240
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,879
-Did you know he kept this at home?
-No.

241
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:23,359
She has great timing,
your sister-in-law.

242
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:30,199
And Oliver confessed
to all this before he died?

243
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,639
You don't believe me.

244
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,959
Your sister-in-law
has good timing, is all.

245
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,399
How did Gertrud know you were in danger?

246
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,399
I don't know.

247
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:51,239
-Why were you at Viktoria's?
-He was trying to kill her...

248
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,559
-I had to stop it.
-How did you know that?

249
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:59,479
-I saw it.
-You saw it?

250
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,479
You couldn't have seen it from here.

251
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:12,999
<i>Did he say why
he'd done all these things?</i>

252
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,039
<i>He said...</i>

253
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:23,199
<i>...that he wanted people to respect
and love me the way he did.</i>

254
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:27,559
Why are you monitoring Viktoria's house?

255
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:31,439
-We're not doing that, it's all Oliver.
-Yes, but why?

256
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,559
He had a...twisted relationship
with his sister.

257
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,279
-Incestuous?
-No...

258
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:49,239
He'd watch her, and he'd film her...
but it wasn't mutual.

259
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:53,279
So Viktoria didn't know
her house was being monitored?

260
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:57,599
-But you knew?
-I found out a few days ago.

261
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,759
Oliver had been down here a lot,
and was acting weird.

262
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,199
How do you feel about Viktoria?

263
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,519
-Huh?
-I like her.

264
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,359
Both as my sister-in-law and as my boss.

265
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,759
She had nothing to do with this.
It was all Oliver...

266
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,199
Viktoria says Oliver confessed to some
crimes before he died. You heard him?

267
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:47,039
<i>Our stock shot up almost seven points.</i>

268
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,399
<i>How do you think you got
that EU summit job?</i>

269
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,199
<i>-Boris died.
-Exactly.</i>

270
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,959
<i>I've always been there for you.
All these years.</i>

271
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:08,079
<i>The side effects of the intolerance drug
could have ruined us.</i>

272
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:10,519
<i>I dealt with that, too.</i>

273
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,479
<i>What do you mean?</i>

274
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:18,559
<i>I want everyone to respect you
the way I respect you.</i>

275
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:20,719
<i>The way I love you, Viktoria.</i>

276
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:26,519
<i>My finale will make you immortal.</i>

277
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:29,319
<i>You're going to save Europe.</i>

278
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:29,359
-So...
-We're not done yet.

279
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,319
The finale is in motion
and "will make Viktoria immortal."

280
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:36,279
-And "she'll save Europe."
-The EU summit.

281
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:39,839
It's perfect.
The impact couldn't be greater.

282
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:45,159
Oliver didn't care about that. It was
all done for Viktoria and Medisonus.

283
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:50,479
-They're not mutually exclusive.
-How would an attack benefit Viktoria?

284
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:53,079
-Plus, she'll be there.
-Only briefly.

285
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:57,359
Oliver talked about Europe.
The EU summit is this week.

286
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,319
-There may very well be a connection.
-We proceed as if there is one.

287
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:11,319
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Martin Rohde.

288
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:14,359
-You're the one who's been calling.
-Yes.

289
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,639
FRIM has pulled Peter Thaulov, you ask
about my speaker... What's going on?

290
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,039
You recognize this man?

291
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:25,439
No, I...

292
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,319
You haven't seen him
in preparations for the summit?

293
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:32,959
-Might he do something at the summit?
-No. He's dead.

294
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,079
He may have planned something.
You need to beef up security.

295
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:41,079
-Who is he?
-Viktoria Nordgren's brother, Oliver.

296
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:44,239
Get this picture out
to anyone you work with.

297
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,359
We'll go over all your buildings again.

298
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,439
Check if anyone involved has been
a client of Copenhagen IT Consulting.

299
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,199
-Why?
-The attack may be computer-triggered.

300
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,359
Copenhagen IT Consulting?

301
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,079
They were involved
in an attack on a chemical plant.

302
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:08,639
-I'll make sure this gets out.
-Thank you.

303
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:51,079
I found chats with Julian on Oliver's
computer. Oliver was "Mother Of Three."

304
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,519
-We know that.
-Now we're positive.

305
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,239
Search Julian Madsen's computers again
for anything on the EU summit.

306
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,919
No, John's going home
to get some sleep - everyone is.

307
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,199
Another unit will go through
the material overnight.

308
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,879
-They know what they're looking for?
-I can tell them.

309
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,439
-I want to stay.
-You heard me!

310
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,759
-Hi.
<i>-Where are you?</i>

311
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,759
-Going to a friend's place.
<i>-Your stuff's gone.</i>

312
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,599
<i>-Yes. I moved out.</i>
-So you chose the living-apart option?

313
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:38,319
<i>No, I chose to move out.</i>

314
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:42,679
But we'll still see each other,
and do stuff, and have sex?

315
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,919
<i>I don't think so. That didn't work.</i>

316
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,439
-What's not working?
<i>-Us. You and me.</i>

317
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,719
You can have your own room, too.

318
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,759
-It's not about having our own rooms.
<i>-Then what's it about?</i>

319
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:00,479
<i>What did I do wrong?
What's not working?</i>

320
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:04,359
Obviously, you didn't want me around.

321
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,399
I do, just not everywhere, all the time.

322
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:13,759
If I'm with someone, I kind of need to
feel I can be everywhere all the time.

323
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:19,719
So we're not together anymore?

324
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:22,999
<i>No, we're not together anymore.</i>

325
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,639
Hey... I need to get some sleep.
I think I'm coming down with something.

326
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:43,239
Anything I can do for you?

327
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,479
I just need to get some sleep.

328
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,959
You want me to get you something?

329
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,159
No, thank you.

330
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:57,519
-Sleep tight.
-You too, honey.

331
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,159
What part of "get some sleep"
didn't you get?

332
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:32,719
Nothing, but I didn't want to sleep.

333
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:37,559
-We're releasing Thaulov.
-Why?

334
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,359
There wasn't enough to detain him.

335
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,519
He could still be Mikkel Höst.

336
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,679
He had alibis for all the times
the access card was used.

337
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:50,639
-It all points to Oliver.
-He did have palytoxin at home.

338
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:54,439
Yes, and he planted the access card
at Peter Thaulov's.

339
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,799
-How did he know we were looking for it?
-Gertrud knew. Maybe she mentioned it.

340
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:03,239
We'll have to ask her.
Jakob's moved out.

341
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,039
-What? Why?
-We're not together anymore.

342
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,359
I'm so sorry. How do you feel?

343
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,479
It's good to have the place to myself.
It's sad I failed as a girlfriend.

344
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,439
Right, that's understandable.

345
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,399
I put a lot of time into it.
More results would have been nice.

346
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:37,439
Julian and Ramon were both found in lye,
so we weren't meant to find them - why?

347
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,279
Oliver was methodical and organized.
He put them there to hide something.

348
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,279
-Did we have an appointment today?
-No.

349
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:03,359
So what are you doing here?

350
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:08,119
-You're going to help me find something.
-Oh, I am?

351
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,999
You're going to re-examine
Julian and Ramon.

352
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,239
What am I looking for?

353
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:18,759
Whatever they didn't want us to find,
since they were in lye.

354
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:49,119
-Morning. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

355
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,199
In here.

356
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,319
-Here's your change of clothes.
-Thank you.

357
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:19,399
I feel bad I didn't tell you
about the cameras.

358
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,959
It's all right.
Good thing they were there.

359
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,639
Or we wouldn't have proof of anything.

360
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,559
They actually thought it was you?

361
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:34,599
Yes, it would appear so.

362
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,239
I should have known...

363
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,359
...that everything wasn't right.

364
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,519
Yeah, I guess we both should have.

365
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,959
I don't think I've ever said
"thank you" to him or...

366
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,239
...complimented him or anything.

367
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:06,599
That's no reason
to go around killing people.

368
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,959
Hey... Won't you sit down for a bit?

369
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,119
No. I'm busy, so...

370
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:21,799
Come on, sit down.
Come here.

371
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,479
Hey. What you did,
or was forced to... Hey!

372
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,479
-Martin.
-Yes?

373
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:09,719
Good news and bad news. There's nothing
in Madsen's computers on the EU summit.

374
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:13,319
-What's the good news?
-I looked at Oliver's cell.

375
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:16,839
He received this text
a few hours before he died.

376
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:21,839
Pictamatic was the last site
he visited on his computer.

377
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:26,479
He never logged out
and only followed one user: Rekna125.

378
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,439
This image was posted yesterday.

379
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,359
And this one about three hours ago.

380
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:43,079
Can you find out
where that canister goes?

381
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,599
-And trace the phone that sent it.
-I'm on it.

382
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:01,799
Hey. Where have you been?

383
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,679
-The medical examiner.
-What the hell for?

384
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,959
Martin! I found the guy
that posted those pics.

385
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,719
Fabian Widman, 32 years old.
Lives in Copenhagen.

386
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:15,799
He's an aircraft technician at Kastrup.

387
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:18,239
-For fuck's sake!
-What pics...?

388
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,479
Let's go! The finale is on.

389
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,159
We're there in two minutes.

390
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,119
-The airport police detained Widman.
-Good.

391
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,799
If this canister does contain
an airborne contagion

392
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:02,959
and is on a plane due to land
in, say, Schiphol in Amsterdam,

393
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,679
it could theoretically spread
all over Europe within 24 hours.

394
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,199
Factor in people with connecting flights
infecting even more passengers...

395
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,399
-Then the scope widens.
-Yes. It'd spread globally.

396
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,679
This way, he's up here.

397
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,599
One or more flights may have
a biological weapon on board.

398
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:44,159
-Has it taken off?
-We don't know.

399
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,199
We're figuring out what flights
Fabian has had access to since midnight.

400
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:54,879
<i>This is your captain.
We can't find a fault,</i>

401
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,039
<i>but a loss of cabin pressure
has been detected</i>

402
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,639
<i>so we ask all passengers
to put on your oxygen masks.</i>

403
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:06,399
<i>We will soon begin our descent
into Frankfurt, so please remain calm,</i>

404
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,279
<i>and follow the instructions
of the cabin crew. Thank you.</i>

405
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:16,039
What's the flight
and what's in the canister?

406
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:26,079
-What's the flight?
-You know the emissions of air travel?

407
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:29,599
One roundtrip to Thailand
is like a year of driving.

408
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:33,839
What's the flight
and what's in the canister?

409
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:03,759
You sent a pic to Oliver Nordgren.
Do you know who he is?

410
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:10,919
You're an environmentalist? He doesn't
give a shit about you or about nature.

411
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:15,239
He's killed a bunch of you.
He doesn't give a fuck about nature!

412
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:18,799
He used you people. He used you!

413
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:22,479
He doesn't give a fuck about nature,
do you get that?

414
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,399
So what's the flight
and what's in the canister?

415
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,279
<i>There is no sign of cabin pressure loss
anymore. You may take off your masks.</i>

416
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:43,839
<i>We apologize for this incident
and wish you a good day ahead.</i>

417
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,639
Are you ready for that?

418
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,959
Oliver Nordgren is dead.

419
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:15,919
All the murders that are about to happen
will be on you. Are you ready for that?

420
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,279
Are you ready to go to jail for life?
To kill all those people?

421
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:28,599
-It's too late.
-What's too late?

422
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,119
-What's too late?
-I connected it to the oxygen system.

423
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:36,719
Flight 443 to Frankfurt
had a loss of cabin pressure.

424
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:39,319
-Masks are on?
-Yes. They'll land now.

425
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:42,919
Then they're all infected.
What was in the canister?

426
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,879
-I don't know!
-Nobody gets off. Quarantine everyone.

427
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:16,719
<i>The Kastrup flight was quarantined
in Frankfurt immediately upon landing.</i>

428
00:48:16,879 --> 00:48:19,479
<i>All passengers,
22 of whom are Swedish,</i>

429
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:23,159
<i>are infected with the same
aggressive pneumonic plague</i>

430
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:27,559
<i>found on the ship
that ran aground some weeks ago.</i>

431
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:29,919
<i>Passengers have been quarantined.</i>

432
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:36,159
<i>Thanks to speedy antibiotic treatment
all passengers are expected to live.</i>

433
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,319
<i>What about the motive?</i>

434
00:48:38,479 --> 00:48:42,839
<i>This attack has also been linked
to Oliver Nordgren.</i>

435
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:49,359
<i>The motive would be to strengthen
Medisonus' position on the market.</i>

436
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:51,199
<i>Was he acting alone?</i>

437
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,559
<i>Unconfirmed sources say a Copenhagen
IT firm delivered the plane's software.</i>

438
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,599
<i>-They are thought to be involved.
-Thanks, Fredrik...</i>

439
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:08,079
-Does that mean we're done?
-Oliver confessed the whole thing.

440
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:13,479
There's a proven connection between him
and Julian Madsen. So yeah, we're done.

441
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:17,679
-Are we sure he was alone?
-Everything would suggest that.

442
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:23,519
I've got beers and sandwiches coming.
Lillian is on her way here.

443
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,119
I think I'll go home to Mette,
but thank you guys.

444
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:30,799
I'm going home, too.
Thank you, good teamwork.

445
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:34,319
-Thanks, I've learned a lot.
-OK.

446
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,679
-Great working with you.
-It was great working with you, too.

447
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:17,319
-You're good for me.
-Good.

448
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:21,119
-Don't let a year go by this time.
-No.

449
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:24,399
Saga...

450
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:30,399
I know what you and your sister
were subjected to as kids.

451
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:36,239
I Know your mother had Munchausen.

452
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:44,359
-How do you know?
-I read the report on your sister.

453
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:47,759
I read the report
on your sister's death.

454
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,799
-Saga...
-Don't!

455
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,359
Saga.

456
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:06,639
Saga, sometimes it's good
if other people know.

457
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:08,359
Saga!

458
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:45,519
-Hey.
-Hi...

459
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:54,479
Where are all the kids?

460
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:57,279
The big ones are with friends.

461
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:00,439
The little ones are with Mother.

462
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,639
OK.

463
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:13,879
That thing with Saga,
her sister... The suicide.

464
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,359
I tried talking to Saga about it.

465
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:23,119
It went really badly.

466
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:32,239
When Nikolaj was in the hospital...

467
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:39,239
It really felt as though we could
find our way back to each other.

468
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,719
The other night when we had sex...

469
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:51,199
I woke up, and I just
couldn't stay in bed.

470
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:55,839
I had to get up and leave.

471
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:07,519
I can't just pick up where we left off.
And keep going.

472
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,879
I just can't.

473
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,839
What are you saying?

474
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:30,919
I don't love you anymore.

475
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:49,919
I want you to move out.

476
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:41,959
-You came, after all.
-Your night shift guys were sloppy.

477
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:45,399
That, or you failed to tell them
what to look for.

478
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:49,439
These are the times
Mikkel Höst used his access card.

479
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,119
This is our emergency call
from when Laura Möllberg was shot.

480
00:56:54,279 --> 00:56:57,999
Mikkel Höst used his card
five minutes before we called.

481
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:03,039
We know Oliver shot Laura Möllberg,
so he couldn't have been at Medisonus.

482
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:08,039
We're not done. There must be
at least another person involved.

483
