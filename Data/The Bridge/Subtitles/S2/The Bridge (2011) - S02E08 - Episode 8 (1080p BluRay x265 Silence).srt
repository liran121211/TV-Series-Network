1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:09,279
-They claim it and leave a symbol.
-A pathos-driven eco-terrorism of sorts?

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,959
Can you trace Mother Of Three?

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,879
Not yet, but they discussed
a "birthday" and a "graduation."

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,959
This was delivered just before
the cooling system collapsed.

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,839
Romstock started its production
exactly three years ago today.

6
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:29,199
So the question is,
what's the graduation?

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,079
A witness saw a white car parked
near where Damgaard was murdered.

8
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,759
-I want you to do my sister's memoirs.
-How is she?

9
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:46,559
The doctors give her six months.
Knowing her, that's 18 months.

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,719
Rasmus Larsson, Malmö Police.

11
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,239
-Where have you been all day?
-My lunch contained nuts. I'm allergic.

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,039
One day you just felt so great
you decided to see your son's murderer?

13
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,319
-He's serving a life sentence!
-He has to know what he did.

14
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,959
-He knows what he did.
-In here! But not in here.

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,799
The shooter was dead ahead of you.
What did he look like?

16
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,399
I saw the shooter in my dream.
Call the police!

17
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,519
Laura! Fuck!

18
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,439
Niklas Svensson is a lab technician
at Medisonus in Copenhagen.

19
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,039
We specialize in third-world
vaccines and maladies.

20
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:38,519
Payment for clinical trial.
See where it's from?

21
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,679
Medisonus.

22
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:45,239
EPISODE 8

23
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,479
Isn't that the one? Dispatch.

24
00:01:56,839 --> 00:02:00,079
...vehicle used
in the Claus Damgaard murder.

25
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,439
We're in pursuit.

26
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,199
There!

27
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,439
Wait! Hey, wait!
We need to question her.

28
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,079
-She's unconscious.
-Can you wake her up?

29
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,879
-No...
-Have you tried?

30
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,639
Well, no...

31
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,399
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, now.

32
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:41,319
We need to question her. Can't you
give her something to wake her up?

33
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,519
No, I'm sorry.

34
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:51,479
-We didn't see anything.
-No. It all happened so fast.

35
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,999
-OK. They didn't see the driver.
-Nor if it was a man or a woman?

36
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,919
-No.
-How many?

37
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:02,479
They don't know.
Techs will have a look at the car.

38
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,639
Why didn't he just kill her?

39
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,559
He kidnapped Julian Madsen
and Ramon, too.

40
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:11,239
But first he tried to kill her,
and now abduct her.

41
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,559
Shouldn't you be talking
to our head of security?

42
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,439
-Peter didn't call you?
-Should he?

43
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,479
Yes, he found a forged access card.

44
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,119
-Then we'd like to talk to him now.
-Sure...

45
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,159
-Can you get Peter?
-Yes.

46
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,959
We want to ask you
about something else.

47
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:55,319
-Why is that?
-It's about a clinical trial from 2002.

48
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,119
OK. Stay here and I'll find out.

49
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,439
-Can I borrow that?
-OK.

50
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,599
Thanks.

51
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,839
Do you know the name of the product?

52
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:18,479
No. But this payment
was made in September 2002.

53
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,999
Payable to Karin Miller.

54
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:26,999
All right. We have no record
of a clinical trial from that time.

55
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,439
-None at all?
-No.

56
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,159
Because in the summer of 2001...

57
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,199
...we began phase-3 trials for Numloxen,
and that's on the market now.

58
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:45,559
It wasn't until spring of 2003 that we
started phase-1 trials of Fedlunil.

59
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:49,079
Lennart Blomgren
was responsible for both.

60
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,279
-Who's he?
-He was head of research before me.

61
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,119
-He retired in 2004.
-Do you have his contact details?

62
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,399
No, sorry. But I bet you won't have
a problem finding them yourselves.

63
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,439
Come with me, please.

64
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:11,519
Mikkel Höst has used his card
several times in the last few months.

65
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,879
Very often after normal work hours.

66
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,599
-And he was never employed here?
-Never.

67
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:32,199
-Do you recognize this man?
-No.

68
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,399
No. Sorry.

69
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:39,519
-You have CCTV?
-Yes. In several places.

70
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:43,519
So if you can determine
when and where the card was used

71
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,159
you should see the person on camera.

72
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,759
He managed to avoid the cameras.

73
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,479
-So he knew their location?
-Seems so.

74
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,199
Why didn't you call us straight away?

75
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,319
I wanted to rule out corporate espionage
before I called you.

76
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,279
-And have you? Ruled out espionage?
-Not yet, no.

77
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,239
-When did he last use it?
-Two days ago.

78
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,399
Where?

79
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,839
We don't use this area anymore.

80
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:30,319
It stood out to me
seeing the card was used here.

81
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,199
-How do you get an access card?
-Through HR.

82
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:37,639
Can anyone change the information?

83
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,799
Not without access
to a specific program.

84
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,239
-Who has access to it?
-Me and two colleagues.

85
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,359
-Then we'll need to question you.
-Of course.

86
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,599
What's this been used for?

87
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,919
Animal testing
in a controlled environment.

88
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,239
Mikkel Höst dodges the cameras.

89
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,559
He knows the building,
even the old parts.

90
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:19,639
He may have been briefed
by Niklas Svensson.

91
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,199
Could Mikkel Höst be
Mother Of Three?

92
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:24,359
Could be.

93
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,959
Could Mikkel Höst be
the one at Katarina's place?

94
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,319
The neighbor saw him.

95
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,319
I don't know.
This could be anyone.

96
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,239
-Could you describe him?
-I already did.

97
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,199
-Not to us.
-Listen, I didn't see that much.

98
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,359
I heard a noise.

99
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,799
I looked through the peephole
and saw the girl and that man.

100
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,919
She sprayed something in his eyes,
they ran and then I called the police.

101
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,199
-Sprayed something in his eyes?
-I don't know...

102
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,119
It must've been strong.
He was screaming.

103
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,679
-How tall was he?
-He was lying down. Average height?

104
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,359
Any distinctive features,
like a beard or a tattoo?

105
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
There's no mention of any spray.
Why didn't you say that?

106
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,119
I did say that.

107
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,119
No, it just says he had dark hair,
jeans, and a blue jacket.

108
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,079
-Black. It was a black jacket.
-No, it says blue here.

109
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:33,359
-It's wrong. It was a black jacket.
-Are you positive?

110
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,839
Listen, my brain works just fine,
and I'm not color blind.

111
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:40,519
Right. OK.

112
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:51,479
It could be Rasmus.
The man in the hallway could be Rasmus.

113
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,639
-Our Rasmus? Why do you think that?
-He has a black jacket.

114
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,479
He was supposed to ID the woman
who had distributed the poisoned goods.

115
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,599
It was Katarina Lövgren. Remember
that day he came back with red eyes?

116
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,999
-Allergies, he said.
-Yes. Hazelnuts.

117
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,759
The little shit...

118
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,439
Reports from Copenhagen
end up on your desk, right?

119
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:34,239
Did you file Katarina Lövgren's
neighbor's statement?

120
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,839
No. Rasmus took Katarina,
I took Mathilde. Why?

121
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:41,959
Can you get me
the original report from Copenhagen?

122
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,359
Get it, and email it to me.

123
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,559
-I got Danish for everyone.
-Nice!

124
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:56,039
-Are we celebrating?
-No, I never celebrate with pastries.

125
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,159
-It's so rare that we're all here.
-Just a tiny piece for me.

126
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,559
All these pastries
with the coffee make you fat.

127
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:07,519
I know a great diet for that.

128
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,239
You just do this one exercise
10-15 times a day.

129
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,639
-What exercise is that?
-"No, thank you."

130
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,279
That's inaccurate. A diet is
what you eat, not what you don't eat.

131
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:25,519
-It was a joke, not a debate argument.
-Yes, I got that.

132
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,519
So maybe you should try
cracking a smile?

133
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,519
Martin says it shows when I laugh
at jokes I don't find amusing.

134
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:48,079
The Danish report says the jacket was
black and he was sprayed in his eyes.

135
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,959
In the Swedish report
that we have on file,

136
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:57,599
it says the jacket's blue
and nothing about a spray.

137
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,199
You're saying he doctored the report?

138
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:03,479
Rasmus has a black jacket
and his eyes were red.

139
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,959
And he's not allergic
to hazelnuts, as he claims.

140
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,679
-How do you know?
-Martin brought Danish.

141
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,719
They contained hazelnuts.
Nothing happened.

142
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,639
You gave him pastry with hazelnuts
without warning him?

143
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,159
-Yes.
-Jesus, Saga. He could have died!

144
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:25,519
-No. He's not allergic.
-You were positive about that?

145
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,439
Had he been allergic,
he would have asked about it.

146
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:34,239
-Or he was counting on his colleagues...
-Hans. He's not allergic.

147
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,719
He doctored evidence
and tipped our hand to them.

148
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,759
We could have taken them otherwise.

149
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,879
I'd like a word with you. Now.

150
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,399
Hello. Welcome.

151
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,359
-Peter. Your guest is waiting outside.
-Thanks.

152
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:51,239
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
You've been waiting long?

153
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,479
No, I just got here. Good to see you.

154
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,879
Right. Laura Möllberg, any news on her?

155
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,159
She's still unconscious.
They'll call as soon as she comes to.

156
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,319
Medisonus...

157
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:13,479
-Shouldn't we wait for Rasmus?
-No.

158
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,159
John! Medisonus.

159
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,039
A leading Nordic pharmaceutical
company based in Denmark

160
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:22,839
with offices
in another twelve countries.

161
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:28,719
Some 6,000 employees.
1.8 billion dollars in sales last year.

162
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,159
CEO and majority shareholder
since 1999 is Viktoria Nordgren.

163
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:36,879
She practically inherited
the company from her father.

164
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,559
A forged access card
was used there two days ago.

165
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:45,039
That person has access
to toxins, viruses, bacteria.

166
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,039
It's been about the environment
or global injustice so far.

167
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,479
How do the boat victims fit in?

168
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,919
They don't, but three of them
were in a Medisonus clinical trial.

169
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,919
But there's no record of any trials
in Denmark or Sweden at the time.

170
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,079
It could be a coincidence.

171
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:07,839
It's unlikely, given the connection
to Marcus Stenberg.

172
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,759
-What's up?
-Rasmus has been reassigned.

173
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
He's no longer part
of this investigation.

174
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,399
-Why not? What happened?
-He doctored a report.

175
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,679
He lied to his superiors,
and thus obstructed the investigation.

176
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,199
Rasmus was the man
in Katarina Lövgren's building.

177
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,079
-Did you know about this?
-Yeah.

178
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,759
-What did he doctor?
-A report from Copenhagen.

179
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,999
Can we move on? We're looking
for someone who knows Medisonus well.

180
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:54,079
-What are you doing?
-We just lost a member of the team.

181
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,959
-Yes. Hans explained why.
-Seriously...

182
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:05,559
John, we need Medisonus' staff lists
from ten years ago.

183
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,159
-Huh?
-Medisonus' staff lists.

184
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,799
-Go back ten years.
-OK... Ten years? That far back?

185
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,679
That's when Karin Miller
received payment.

186
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,999
What about Lennart Blomgren?
Head of research.

187
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,159
I've got him right here. He's dead.
He drowned while winter swimming.

188
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,399
The year after he retired.
But his widow still lives in Malmö.

189
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:43,159
-Nikolaj is coming home tonight.
-OK. Congratulations.

190
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,599
Why don't you and Jakob
come over for dinner?

191
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,759
-Why should Jakob come with?
-Because he's your boyfriend.

192
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,239
Yes. So we have to do
everything together, then?

193
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,119
Do you do anything together?
You just work.

194
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,239
-We have sex.
-Right, of course.

195
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,679
Bring Jakob so I can get to know him.

196
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,719
Why? I don't want to get to know Mette
just because you're with her.

197
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,999
But I can come to dinner.

198
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,119
It was to get to know Jakob.
It was just a suggestion.

199
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,239
-And they never found him?
-No.

200
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:25,759
The current was strong by the ice hole.
He was declared dead the year after.

201
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,679
Did he leave any notebooks
or calendars behind, from 2002 onwards?

202
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,279
No. But I don't know if he had any.

203
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,439
You don't know
if your husband had a calendar?

204
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,839
Did he have an office? A computer?

205
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:44,839
No, he went into his office to work.
At home, he was off from work.

206
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,399
You recall if he mentioned
a clinical trial in 2002?

207
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,599
-Who recalls conversations from 2002?
-I do.

208
00:19:55,959 --> 00:20:00,079
Can you look again to see
if there's anything from Medisonus?

209
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,999
-Sure. Now?
-Yes.

210
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,159
And give us a call.

211
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,319
She has no pictures of him.

212
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,039
-Do you have pictures at home?
-No.

213
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:26,159
-Maybe she's like you.
-She didn't seem to be like me.

214
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,199
<i>-Hi, there.</i>
-Hello!

215
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,879
<i>You're calling early today.
Everything OK?</i>

216
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,279
The police came.

217
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,799
I need more information
on Helga Blomgren.

218
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:25,399
-How much more?
-As much as possible.

219
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,559
-What about Medisonus' staff lists?
-When we get them...

220
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,239
Saga... Viktoria Nordgren.

221
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:44,439
I understand you've been to my company.
I'm here so I may be briefed.

222
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,719
-On what?
-On what's going on.

223
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,399
Why are you so interested
in Medisonus?

224
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,759
We can't disclose information
about an ongoing...

225
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,079
-I can't help you otherwise.
-We haven't asked for your help.

226
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,639
We want the same thing.

227
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,599
I want any involved employees caught
before they can hurt the company.

228
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,239
But you see, we want them caught
before they hurt any more people.

229
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,519
I know Niklas Svensson was
an employee of ours.

230
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,239
That the plague bacteria and hydrogen
cyanide may have come from us.

231
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:25,479
-Most likely.
-But you're not positive?

232
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:28,079
-No. I said, "most likely."
-Exactly.

233
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:32,119
As long as you're not sure,
please use the word "possibly,"

234
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,039
or even less certain wording
as to their origin.

235
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:41,439
If you need anything else,
please see me directly.

236
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,719
We'll make sure to do that.

237
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,159
-Can we question her?
-Not yet.

238
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,959
They don't know what's in her system.
They'll try to wake her tomorrow.

239
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,039
-Anything on the white car?
-No. Completely clean.

240
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,639
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

241
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,119
-Hi.
-Where have you been?

242
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,799
-Buying a present for Nikolaj.
-Is that supposed to be a Stegosaurus?

243
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,879
-I think he'll like it.
-Oh.

244
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:58,399
When I was Nikolaj's age
I was in the hospital, too.

245
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,079
-Something with the appendix.
-Oh?

246
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:06,919
It wasn't like these days. My parents
couldn't spend the night there.

247
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,639
I was looking forward to coming home.

248
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,799
What about you? Where you
in the hospital when you were younger?

249
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,559
Why do you ask?

250
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:23,199
I was just thinking about Nikolaj.

251
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,559
-Were you hospitalized?
-Yes.

252
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:33,919
-What was wrong?
-Why do you want to know?

253
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,839
Hi.

254
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,599
How are you?

255
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,159
Are you in pain?

256
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,119
Gertrud told me the police came
to Medisonus today.

257
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,839
-What did they want?
-What do you think?

258
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:15,479
Gertrud said it was
about the golden toads...

259
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,159
So you already knew what they wanted!

260
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:22,919
-Let her in on your way out. It's Bodil.
-This late?

261
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,359
It's not late!
Stop treating me like a child!

262
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:44,759
Hi. She's a bit tired tonight,
so maybe don't keep going too long.

263
00:26:55,719 --> 00:27:00,719
Hi. How are you?
Oliver said you were a bit tired.

264
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:03,919
Oliver talks too much.

265
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,879
You partake? It's medicinal.

266
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,039
No, thanks. I'm OK.

267
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,719
I hear you're not sleeping well.

268
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:31,679
Do you, now?

269
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,999
The guards say you're having dreams.
What are your dreams about?

270
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:42,479
-I'm not interested.
-This is another case.

271
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:46,519
-I'm not interested.
-Feeling too much like a cop?

272
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,319
You should've died on the bridge,
but you're alive.

273
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,199
You're alive
with all of this on your conscience.

274
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:39,359
This...was August.

275
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:46,559
When he was a boy. Do you remember
your son when he was that little?

276
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,039
Let me tell you something.
I'd do it again.

277
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,959
I don't believe you.

278
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,159
Don't kid yourself.

279
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,799
When Saga stopped me
from shooting you on the bridge...

280
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,799
I've been so angry at her
but...today I'm grateful.

281
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,999
That I didn't see you die on the bridge,
but instead get to see you like this.

282
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,919
They're here!

283
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,679
-Hey, champ. Welcome home.
-Hi.

284
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,759
Hi, Nikolaj. We have presents for you.

285
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,279
-Get in there.
-Come on.

286
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:25,319
-Welcome home.
-Thanks. And the little ones?

287
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:29,959
They're asleep. It's late.
I've tucked them in.

288
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,439
-Can we talk about your brother?
-OK...

289
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,759
The first time we met, you said
you wanted to leave him out of it.

290
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,759
-He shouldn't know or read anything.
-That's right.

291
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,399
Why?

292
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:00,079
I know Oliver a little bit,
and I know how fond he is of you.

293
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,599
Yes, he is.

294
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,839
-But it's not mutual?
-I didn't say that.

295
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:10,239
-But he can't be a part of this?
-My book, my story, my company.

296
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,719
Why would I want him pawing at all that?

297
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:20,959
Right, the company.
You're the head of Medisonus.

298
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,639
But you're the younger sister.

299
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:31,039
Oliver is older, qualified,
and he has business experience.

300
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:35,399
Why is it that Medisonus
was passed on to you?

301
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:39,999
The official reason was,
he wasn't interested.

302
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,519
Unofficially, he wasn't up to it.

303
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,559
-May I write that?
-Sure. It's the truth.

304
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:55,559
<i>Oliver has maximized the returns on his
talents, he holds a 19-percent stake</i>

305
00:31:55,719 --> 00:32:01,559
<i>but he doesn't have what it takes
to run a company like Medisonus.</i>

306
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:05,599
<i>-Why not?
-He's weak.</i>

307
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:13,479
<i>And to be honest, weakness is not
exactly a character trait I appreciate.</i>

308
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:16,519
<i>No...</i>

309
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:21,959
You have a sister. What's that like?

310
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,319
Caroline found out
about me and her husband.

311
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,759
Oh. Well, I didn't say anything.

312
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,319
No, I know that.

313
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:35,119
Sure you don't want some?
I mean, you're Danish.

314
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,679
You're the ones who should be smoking
while us Swedes are appalled.

315
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,559
OK...

316
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,239
I need to go lie down for a bit.

317
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,679
-You want me to leave?
-Not at all. I just need some rest.

318
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,039
Hi, darling. Are you home?

319
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,959
-Yes. I'm in here.
-Hey.

320
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,399
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

321
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,279
I left a plate for you in the fridge.
I thought you'd be late.

322
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:27,359
It is late. Will you come join me?

323
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,359
-Yes. I just need to reply to an email.
-OK.

324
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:41,239
I shot a hen on a farm,
in one of those cages.

325
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:47,399
Why did you shoot a hen in a cage?

326
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,279
There were no waterfowl around.

327
00:33:53,479 --> 00:34:00,119
No, but killing my own food
was on my bucket list.

328
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,319
-You're what-now list?
-My bucket list.

329
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:07,439
-What's that?
-A list of things to do before I die.

330
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,759
You have that? Can I see it?

331
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:13,079
It's all in here.

332
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,799
-What's on it?
-Why do you want to know?

333
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,519
It shows who you are.
Or who you want to be.

334
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,479
I've gone parachuting, swimming
with dolphins, taken my pilot's license.

335
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,279
Seen the Taj Mahal,
slept with a gigolo...

336
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:39,759
I've eaten Fugu...and killed a hen.

337
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,479
What does that say about me?

338
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,599
That you had fun.

339
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:50,879
And I had this done.
Pull it down a little.

340
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,439
It's so pretty.

341
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:02,039
What else is on the list?

342
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,799
More than I have time for.

343
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:08,319
Such as...?

344
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:11,199
I've never changed a tire on a car.

345
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,999
I'm sure that could be arranged.

346
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:21,399
Go to Nepal, sing together with Sting...

347
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:27,039
Sleep with a woman.

348
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:34,919
-So you're sitting here...
-Yes.

349
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,919
A phase-1 clinical trial
usually involves 5-10 people.

350
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,559
There were seven on that motor boat.

351
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,359
-But there were no trials then.
-Then why were they paid?

352
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,799
Their finance department
may be able to help us.

353
00:36:54,959 --> 00:37:00,519
Leave it for tomorrow.
These murders are nine years old.

354
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,879
Shouldn't we focus
on the graduation instead?

355
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:07,239
Our only leads are
Medisonus and Mother Of Three.

356
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:10,479
Did you ever feel Karin was in the way?

357
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,639
In the way? What do you mean?

358
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:16,239
That nothing was really yours?
Everything was shared.

359
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:19,159
No, I never felt that way.

360
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,599
-You're thinking about Jakob.
-No, I'm thinking about myself.

361
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:28,239
Sure. I mean,
your relationship with Jakob.

362
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:32,559
-It's difficult.
-Yes. Relationships are tricky.

363
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,959
No, it's not a relationship issue.
It's that he lives with me.

364
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:41,999
A lot of people would say
that's a relationship issue.

365
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:46,799
Oh. Thanks.

366
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,599
Saga, Hans...

367
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:55,239
A name on Medisonus' staff list
came up in our case.

368
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,519
-A name?
-Who?

369
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,599
Are they asleep?

370
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:13,079
The big ones are reading.
But they're all in their own beds.

371
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:16,999
That's good.

372
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,199
-I went to see Jens again today.
-OK.

373
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:32,879
But this was the last time.
He will never say he's sorry.

374
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,919
But today...he realized what he did.

375
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,999
He couldn't fight it anymore.

376
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:50,279
So I got to him.

377
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,839
Not as much as he got to me but...

378
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:22,599
Hi, Saga. You're what?

379
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,199
She's outside.

380
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,239
What's going on?

381
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,239
Peter Thaulov is not
on Medisonus' payroll.

382
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:34,719
He handles security
for Medisonus and other firms.

383
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:38,079
-One is Copenhagen IT Consulting.
-Madsen's firm.

384
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,679
He works for FRIM Security,
a major Nordic player.

385
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,119
FRIM coordinates security with us
for the EU summit. Where is he?

386
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:49,639
-His wife says he's at Medisonus.
-Meet you there.

387
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,919
Peter Thaulov? Yes, here he is.

388
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,479
He came in at 8.30 this morning
and left at 2 p.m.

389
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,479
A Caroline Brandstrup asked for him.

390
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,799
-Caroline Brandstrup?
-Yes.

391
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,159
-And he hasn't been back?
-No.

392
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,719
-Tell him to call me.
-I will.

393
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:24,639
Caroline Brandstrup organizes
the EU summit in Copenhagen.

394
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,359
Hello. I was here earlier
to meet one of your guests.

395
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:46,479
-Right. Mr. Duksa?
-Yes. Can I borrow an elevator card?

396
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,199
-Is he expecting you?
-Yes. You can call up.

397
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:54,199
-That's probably not necessary.
-OK. Thanks.

398
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,439
Peter Thaulov, born 1975. Married,
no children. Syrian-Danish origin.

399
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,639
Studied engineering at BTU.
Has been with FRIM since 1999.

400
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:28,959
And as you know,
handles security at Medisonus.

401
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,399
He's perfectly placed.
Free access to everything.

402
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,559
What else do we know?

403
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,559
Affiliated with Friends of the Earth
1990-1996. No activism after that.

404
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,919
FRIM handles security at Bella Center,
where all big EU meetings are scheduled.

405
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,519
Ask FRIM if Peter Thaulov has been
assigned duties at Bella Center.

406
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,599
We need to have him
arrested in his absence.

407
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:55,519
-Then we can issue a BOLO.
-Call Lillian.

408
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,559
Caroline Brandstrup?
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

409
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,319
<i>-We need to discuss Peter Thaulov.</i>
-Peter? Why?

410
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,719
Official police business.
Did you see him today?

411
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:11,399
We went over a few details
at Bella Center regarding the summit.

412
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,559
What are his duties?

413
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:16,559
He's responsible
for media accreditation.

414
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,559
You know where he was going after that?

415
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,039
<i>No. I dropped him off
at Radisson Blu Royal Hotel.</i>

416
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,799
<i>-In Copenhagen?
-Yes.</i>

417
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,879
-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
-Martin Rohde.

418
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:37,119
-Were you here this afternoon?
-Yes.

419
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,599
Do you recognize this person?

420
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,079
-He's here right now.
-He's here now?

421
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:55,519
-Hey.
-What do we know?

422
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,679
The group is planning a final attack.
All the delegates are staying here.

423
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,839
-And the man he's visiting?
-Rasa Duksa.

424
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:08,159
He's with the Lithuanian
environmental ministry. He came today.

425
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,879
-What's their relation?
-We don't know.

426
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,319
Rasa Duksa pushed for the closure
of the Ignalina nuclear plant.

427
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:18,959
So he does have a past
as an eco-activist.

428
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:22,839
-OK. We go in.
-Thanks.

429
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,439
Police! Get down!

430
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,919
Oh.

431
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:51,359
You're at the hotel
where all the delegates are staying.

432
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,239
Yes, because...

433
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:59,519
Because Rasa is a delegate, OK?

434
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,359
I mean, you just found me naked
in a hotel room with another man.

435
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,959
-What's this?
-Dates and times. Fill it out.

436
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:23,159
-How much does my wife need to know?
-You have bigger problems.

437
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:26,159
No. I don't want to hurt my wife.

438
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,759
Most women are hurt more if they're left
for another woman, rather than a man.

439
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,199
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving my wife.

440
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:40,039
What do you know about Mother Of Three?

441
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:44,439
Mother Of Three? Nothing.
Who is Mother Of Three?

442
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,999
OK. Let's start over then. Tell me about
your first meeting with Niklas Svensson.

443
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:54,399
-I didn't know him.
-You worked at the same place.

444
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,559
Yes, but I didn't know him.

445
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:59,199
-But you've met him?
-I'm sure I have.

446
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,159
So tell me about the first time.

447
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:09,799
Duksa corroborates his story.
Met in Thailand a year ago...

448
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:14,839
Been meeting in secret ever since...
Knows nothing about anything else.

449
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:20,399
-Did he say why he arrived earlier?
-To meet Thaulov, he says.

450
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:27,679
Techs are going through the hotel room
and Thaulov's house.

451
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,559
We'll get their report in the morning.
Good night.

452
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:34,359
-Are you going home?
-Yes.

453
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:38,399
-Can I come with?
-I can take you to a Metro station.

454
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,839
What? Why? It's just nearby.

455
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:46,719
When I was staying at a hotel, yes.

456
00:46:46,879 --> 00:46:51,479
I've moved in with Mette now,
so it's not on the way.

457
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:57,319
-You moved in with Mette?
-Yes. That's what I want.

458
00:46:57,479 --> 00:47:01,399
OK. Congratulations to Mette.

459
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,319
I thought you were asleep.

460
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,119
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

461
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:45,559
Are you too tired?

462
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,399
You're back.

463
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,039
Yes, I am back.

464
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:11,999
Jakob!

465
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:14,999
What time is it?

466
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:20,479
-It's 4.63 a.m.
-You're going into work this early?

467
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,999
No, I just got back.
I'm about to leave again.

468
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,479
I've been thinking about us.
We put up a wall in the other room.

469
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:33,319
That way we'll get another room
that will be just mine.

470
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,919
-You want your own room?
-Yes. That you can't enter.

471
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,279
A room in the apartment
that I can't enter?

472
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,479
-Yes.
-Do I get my own room, too?

473
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,159
But you're not as bothered by me
as I am by you.

474
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,319
But we're living together.

475
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,639
Or, we could live apart.
It's more common than you'd think.

476
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:03,559
What the hell are you thinking?
That's not how it works.

477
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,439
-Did something happen?
-No. Nothing's happened.

478
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,439
We've got a relationship problem.
I'm trying to solve it.

479
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:19,519
Why don't you think about
which option you'd prefer?

480
00:50:22,879 --> 00:50:24,959
See you later.

481
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,759
Hey... Daddy's here.

482
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:26,839
Daddy's here. It's OK, honey.

483
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,159
Good morning.

484
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,839
-Morning...
-Good morning.

485
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,759
-What's this?
-This is from Thaulov's house.

486
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:54,399
This is Medisonus,
that's the hotel room over there.

487
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,999
John is going through the computers.

488
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:59,799
-Did you find anything?
-Not yet.

489
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:07,679
-What about all this?
-It also needs to be categorized.

490
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,639
OK.

491
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:33,279
And this?

492
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:39,479
-A Medisonus access card.
-He had one on him yesterday.

493
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,159
Saga! You asked me
to check out Helga Blomgren.

494
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,519
-I don't have time right now.
-I think you do.

495
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:00,479
She travels abroad quite a bit.
Thailand...

496
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,359
-Not unusual.
-She has her mail forwarded.

497
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,839
-Same address every time.
-So she owns property in Thailand.

498
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:13,519
She doesn't own it.
A certain Leif Brännmark does.

499
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:19,639
Lennart Blomgren.
And he's not dead at all.

500
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:30,479
Hello, Oliver. Come in and sit down.

501
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,159
The book's off.
I'm calling the whole thing off.

502
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,079
-It's too big a strain on Viktoria.
-Why? What happened?

503
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:50,039
She's ill.
She needs to preserve energy.

504
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:53,359
And she's still running the company.

505
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:56,279
We can meet
for shorter periods at a time.

506
00:55:56,439 --> 00:56:01,999
No. Last night was the last time.
You're not to bother her anymore.

507
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:11,479
OK, with all due respect, Oliver...
Shouldn't Viktoria decide for herself?

508
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:15,239
You stay away from her!
You hear me?

509
00:56:15,399 --> 00:56:17,439
I can't just not show up.

510
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,719
You two are to have
no interaction henceforth.

511
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:25,199
If you do, I have to assume
you're willfully trying to hurt her.

512
00:56:26,919 --> 00:56:29,999
Would you be a doll
and check this for me?

513
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:37,359
It's issued to a Mikkel Höst.

514
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:44,319
-Mikkel Höst? Are you sure?
-Yes.

515
00:56:44,479 --> 00:56:47,159
Even shorter hair.

516
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,719
-Shorter still?
-Yes, that's right.

517
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,199
Yes, that's it.

518
