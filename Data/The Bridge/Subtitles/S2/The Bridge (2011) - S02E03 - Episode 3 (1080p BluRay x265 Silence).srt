1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,279
The pin on the jacket.
They claim it, leave a symbol.

2
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:09,559
Negative human impact
on the environment - hence the symbol.

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,439
So a pathos-driven
eco-terrorism of sorts?

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,599
-Murderers! You're killing people!
-I won't leave you.

5
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:20,759
I can't do this.
I have Linus to think of.

6
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,999
Nobody's leaving, OK?

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,119
The police, please.

8
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,999
-The cops came.
-How did they find us?

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,359
That's what we'd like to know.

10
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:38,959
Five more stores have found amulets.
Two of them have CCTV.

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,759
Print out
the sharpest image you can get.

12
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:46,559
-See you tomorrow, loser.
-Point them out to me.

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,079
Do we understand each other?

14
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:56,119
I want to see Jens in prison. I need
to see that he's in there - locked up.

15
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,799
-I got a ten on my test.
-You must be happy.

16
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,399
Do I look happy?

17
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,919
You can buy them for me.
You're my teacher after all.

18
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,079
Your math teacher called.

19
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,519
-Pulling night shifts now?
-I can't go home.

20
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,839
-I thought I'd crash here.
-Sure, why not?

21
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,759
That's five gallons of gas. We just
got hold of five <i>thousand</i> gallons.

22
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:40,359
EPISODE 3

23
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:57,079
What the hell...?

24
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,999
<i>There's a tanker standing here.</i>

25
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,199
<i>-I'm going to check it out.
-Copy that.</i>

26
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,959
Can we go to the harbor?

27
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,679
We won't get close
and there's little left to examine.

28
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,439
-Fatalities?
-Unknown, but four people are missing.

29
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,959
-Voytek Rosenau had this in his pocket.
-Who is Voytek Rosenau?

30
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:51,319
Polish truck driver. He was assaulted
last night and his tanker got jacked.

31
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,759
-What do we know?
-No more than I told you on the phone.

32
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,719
I bet this time
it's about car pollution.

33
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,799
I don't know. They'll probably
upload a video about it.

34
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,599
The pictures of the girl from the store.

35
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,719
Saga? Ölanders Livs -
no toad was found in the meat section.

36
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,439
-Did you look hard?
-No, just under the first piece.

37
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,719
But it might be in the cracks!

38
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,519
There were three of us.
We looked through everything.

39
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,919
-We found nothing.
-You missed it.

40
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,199
We went through it twice.
We did not miss it.

41
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:48,799
-You must have!
-Except we didn't.

42
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,359
The driver is out of surgery.
The doctors say we can question him.

43
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,679
-Rasmus!
-You want me to come with?

44
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,999
I've been involved in questionings
in my previous cases, so...

45
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,719
Oh. Yeah, no.
See if you can identify her.

46
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,159
These are pictures from stores
with golden toads.

47
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,319
The man who died.
I'm sure you've read about it.

48
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,839
I know it's extremely short notice.

49
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:32,799
All you have to do is show up,
and we'll take care of the rest.

50
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,959
That's great.
See you tomorrow, then. Thank you!

51
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,759
-We booked her?
-Not sure yet. She'll be here tomorrow.

52
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,279
-And the programs?
-Worst case, we use the old ones.

53
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,159
Put a leaflet in
when we know she's a yes.

54
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,359
-Do I give her clearance?
-Yes.

55
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,639
And get some pictures of her
we can use. That'd be all, Dharma.

56
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,919
-Remember to call Alexander.
-Right.

57
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,799
<i>Hi, honey. You sure are
one busy birthday girl.</i>

58
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,039
I know, I'm sorry I left
before you woke.

59
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,919
<i>Maybe you can prepare the dinner party
tonight if I mail you what to do?</i>

60
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,759
-Will you be late?
-I hope not.

61
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,239
<i>-Should we cancel?</i>
-No, I want my dinner party and gifts!

62
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,959
Yeah...

63
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:30,239
I've got to go. I'll see you tonight.

64
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,319
There's just one more thing...

65
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,559
Hey! What's this?

66
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,239
The explosion woke me,
but I didn't dare to call you.

67
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,479
You were the ones who did it, right?

68
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:27,919
-Did anyone die?
-I don't know, I wasn't there.

69
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,399
I hope not.

70
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,679
-Thanks.
-How's it going?

71
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,399
How it's going? Well, I'm thinking
this can't be this girl's first rodeo.

72
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,319
So I'm going through police footage
from a bunch of protests.

73
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:04,599
-You need help?
-It's probably not worth it.

74
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,559
Nazi lieutenant over there
is just going to get on my ass.

75
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:13,039
Voytek, the truck driver,
said two of his assailants were women.

76
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,839
So two of the animals in the video
are probably women.

77
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:20,119
-How's the search?
-Great. Got an instant match.

78
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,999
Why didn't you call? Who is it?

79
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,639
It was a joke. Look at this picture,
it could be fucking anyone.

80
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,399
-Right...?
-Right, so... No, no match yet.

81
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,479
OK...

82
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,519
-Saga doesn't get irony.
-I've noticed.

83
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,719
But I sure do. So why don't you
stop taking the piss?

84
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:56,079
Sure thing.

85
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,679
-Beate?
-Yes.

86
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,439
-May I have a word?
-Sure.

87
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:34,799
Please have a seat.

88
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,759
-I need to ask you something.
-Yes?

89
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,359
Are you having
a sexual relationship with a student?

90
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,199
I... I can explain.

91
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:17,199
-Beate...
-She is over eighteen.

92
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:20,559
And it hasn't affected
the school in any way.

93
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:24,759
Everything has been going on
outside of school.

94
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,959
That's irrelevant.
You're one of my best teachers.

95
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,879
-But rules are rules.
-Right.

96
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,039
I need to ask you to pack up your things
and leave the premises.

97
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,279
Right away.

98
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,879
-You happy now?
-What?

99
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,079
-A fucking pair of shoes, Laura?
-I tried to call and apologize.

100
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:03,679
-You get my dad involved...
-You go to the principal?

101
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,039
My career down the drain
for a pair of shoes!

102
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,079
You're sick.

103
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:17,239
I hope you like living alone,
because no one could ever stand you.

104
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,039
What did you do?
What the hell did you do?

105
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,079
You made a mistake,
she made a bigger one...

106
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,879
-She'll think I did it!
-It can't be that bad.

107
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,759
-I'll call the school and explain...
-Don't do anything!

108
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,759
You've already outed me
as a total bitch.

109
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,599
-Hi.
-Hi? What are you doing here?

110
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,839
-Is Lene still on sick leave?
-Yes.

111
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:48,959
-I can take her job.
-But it's full time. You've got school.

112
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,119
I think I'm dropping out.

113
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,559
No, don't.
Not for a reception-desk temp job.

114
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:57,119
I'm taking a break, anyway.

115
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,199
Top students don't take gap years.
What did you get yourself into?

116
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,399
Do I get the job or not?

117
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,159
-You know how everything works?
-If not, I'll ask someone.

118
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:17,559
-I've got to run. I'll see you later.
-Sure thing.

119
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,639
-I was wondering if you'd come.
-Why haven't you gone in?

120
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,679
-They're about to give him a bath.
-OK. You want to go for a smoke?

121
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,119
-How are things going with you?
-Good.

122
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,919
-And with you?
-They're going.

123
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,679
-Need me to lend you more money?
-No.

124
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,399
-What happened at the harbor?
-I know, that was sick.

125
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,559
-I didn't know it was part of the plan.
-It was Mads' idea.

126
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:18,479
-Have you heard what they thought?
-Not yet.

127
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,279
But I think
they should be quite pleased.

128
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,519
OK. We're shooting a video later.
I'll pick up Kattis when we're done here.

129
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,879
Which one are you?

130
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,919
You don't know? Take a guess.

131
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,559
-The hare?
-The fox.

132
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:45,599
Right, of course.

133
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,599
-What are you checking?
-If it's the same people in both videos.

134
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,119
-You think there are more of them?
-Could be.

135
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,519
These groups tend to work in cells.

136
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,119
The pig is definitely the same guy.

137
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,399
The scar on the wrist.

138
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,639
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
We'll be right there. Bye.

139
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
That's the spot.

140
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,399
Come on!

141
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,599
Are you and Pernille having sex?

142
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,399
No. What makes you think that?

143
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:20,519
You spend a lot of time together
and she's always touching you.

144
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,039
-She does?
-Yes.

145
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,999
Well, we're not.

146
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:32,359
Are you and Mette still having sex
even though you're separated?

147
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,519
No. It's been a long time.

148
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,079
-So who are you having sex with?
-No one.

149
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,479
How do you cope? You used to
have sex with people all the time.

150
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,039
That's one good thing about living
with someone. Sex is easy to come by.

151
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,159
Jakob is good at having sex.
He does as I say.

152
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,359
Well, that's great. Congratulations.

153
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,319
Thank you. Are you?

154
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:14,959
-Am I good at sex?
-Yes?

155
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,639
Why would you possibly
need to know that?

156
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,479
-We're talking about it.
-No, <i>you</i> are.

157
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:24,799
-Yes?
-And I think you should stop.

158
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,999
OK.

159
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,919
-But if...
-Saga.

160
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:41,319
-It's this one.
-What about it?

161
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:47,279
We don't throw our boxes here,
and it belongs to none of our suppliers.

162
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,799
We know... No, don't!

163
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,439
You provided a list.

164
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,799
Since it's apples,
I thought I should call.

165
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,639
"Utile Frukt AB."

166
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,639
It went out to Sherens Livs
in Möllevången, Malmö.

167
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,639
Thank you.

168
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,199
-Where are you going?
-Just heading out. Get some air.

169
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,759
Hi. Rasmus Larsson, Malmö Police...

170
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:07,839
Come on, hurry up!

171
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,599
-Hello?
<i>-You on your way?</i>

172
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,439
-Why not?

173
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:42,399
<i>- I told you, I've got Linus.</i>
-We told you no one gets out.

174
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,599
You needed me in the beginning.
I've done my part.

175
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:51,439
-Three things, that's enough.
<i>-So you're not coming?</i>

176
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,639
No.

177
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:07,999
Hi! I hope I <i>am</i> interrupting.
Happy birthday! Oh, little sis.

178
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,079
-Are you stressed?
-I'm chasing a new keynote speaker.

179
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:18,759
The guy we got ruined my birthday
by getting poisoned and dying.

180
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,399
-People are so rude.
-I'll have to cancel our lunch.

181
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,119
No, Caroline, you don't have to.
You've got people under you.

182
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,679
Delegate some of this stuff,
and take an hour off.

183
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,639
All right, fine. Two minutes.

184
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,319
Two.

185
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:50,839
-What did Alexander do for you?
-I left before he woke.

186
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,599
-Any morning sex, at least?
-Stop it.

187
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,399
Isn't your birthday
the one day you get physical?

188
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:00,279
-It is not!
-When did you last have sex?

189
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,119
If you need to think about it,
it was too long ago.

190
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:16,119
-I know exactly what to get you.
-Not another sex toy.

191
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:21,639
What? It made the unwrapping of your
Christmas gifts all the more exciting.

192
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,359
Seriously... You!

193
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,999
-What's up with you?
-A cop rang on her door.

194
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,599
-A cop?
-Easy now.

195
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,359
Kattis, go make yourself a cup of tea.

196
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:44,639
Niklas isn't coming,
because of his fucking kid brother.

197
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,279
OK, I'll send someone to talk to him.
In the meantime, you talk to her.

198
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,519
OK.

199
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,239
Here.

200
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:13,439
Thanks.

201
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,599
-So he just found you?
-Yes.

202
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,519
You know what we've done.

203
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,679
And the police just send one guy?
Who just knocks on your door?

204
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,279
-Well, I can't help if you think...
-Something you want to tell me?

205
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,719
-No.
-What's that?

206
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,079
-You remember who bought this?
-The box?

207
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:53,839
-It had apples in it.
-No idea, we get a ton of those.

208
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:57,359
-You sell a lot of whole boxes?
-No, but it happens.

209
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,039
-I sold one last week.
-To whom?

210
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,519
Young guy, my age. Niklas, I think.

211
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,519
-You know him?
-No, but he answered his phone in here.

212
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,959
Brown hair, average height,
thin, blue eyes.

213
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,519
<i>-OK. Is that all?</i>
-He's Swedish, the name's Niklas.

214
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,199
-Start a search around Mads Nielsen.
-And that activist, Astrid.

215
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,119
-Mads and Astrid know each other.
-And Astrid Simonsen.

216
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,359
<i>-Get Rasmus to help you.</i>
-He took off.

217
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,519
<i>-Where to?</i>
-Don't know.

218
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,719
OK.

219
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,999
Niklas. Who's this?

220
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,639
OK, I'll be down.

221
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,239
Who are you? What's this?

222
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:36,519
Great. Thanks for letting me know. Bye.

223
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,479
<i>-Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.</i>
-It's me. Pernille.

224
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:53,839
It could be a Niklas Svensson, age 23.
Appears alongside Astrid and Mads.

225
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,599
Studied biochemistry, but dropped out.

226
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,079
He's a lab technician
at Medisonus in Copenhagen.

227
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,439
They say he's been home
with his younger brother.

228
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,319
<i>-Where is home?</i>
-Two secs.

229
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,479
Do we understand each other?

230
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,839
What the fuck is this?

231
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:32,919
It happens around here
with these nice cars.

232
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,719
For fuck's sake...

233
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,079
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
This is my colleague Martin Rohde.

234
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:27,599
-Is Niklas home?
-No.

235
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,719
-Where is he?
-Out.

236
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:34,479
-When will he be back?
-Dunno.

237
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,359
We need to come inside.

238
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,799
-You live here with your brother?
-Yes.

239
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,359
-Where are your parents?
-Dead.

240
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,679
Niklas! The police are here! Run!

241
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,039
Niklas!

242
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:45,799
Fuck... Saga!

243
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,319
He's running down the stairs!

244
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,159
Goddamn it!

245
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,039
-Saga?
-In here.

246
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:12,679
-Where's the kid?
-He was gone when I came back.

247
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,959
-Did you issue a BOLO?
-Not to be picked up, surveillance only.

248
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:30,479
We specialize in third-world
vaccines and maladies.

249
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:35,959
We focus our research on malaria, AIDS,
different fever illnesses... This way.

250
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,839
Did Niklas Svensson
have access to palytoxin here?

251
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,719
Is that what they used
in the poisonings?

252
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:46,279
-Just answer the question.
-Please, have a seat.

253
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:51,519
We stock biochemical substances
for reference, among them palytoxin.

254
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,439
-Could Niklas Svensson access them?
-It's not entirely implausible.

255
00:33:57,439 --> 00:34:00,959
-Why can't you just say yes?
-Beg your pardon?

256
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,599
You're being evasive.
Why can't you just say yes?

257
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:10,879
We have procedures in place
for access to biochemical substances.

258
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,719
I've not yet been able to look into
whether Niklas signed out anything.

259
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,879
We'll let you know when we do.

260
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,079
Could he have gotten
the plague contagion here?

261
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,919
-We were afraid that's why you called...
-Just answer the question.

262
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,839
We stock several different strains
of <i>Yersinia pestis</i>. So, yes.

263
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:36,399
-Why do you stockpile plague?
-Antibiotics resistance research.

264
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,279
Right, OK. What about Niklas Svensson?

265
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:44,639
We'll procure a detailed account of
all the projects he's been involved in.

266
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:49,079
Especially those involving
any other harmful substances.

267
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,239
Yes, of course.

268
00:34:57,399 --> 00:35:00,399
-How's it going?
-Good, I think.

269
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,919
-Do you have a driver's license?
-Yes. Why?

270
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,319
Someone tagged my car. Could you
take it to the shop in Brønshøj?

271
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:14,519
-Sure.
-Thank you.

272
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:28,999
Hey. You came after all.

273
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:31,879
The cops came.
Where was I supposed to go?

274
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:36,319
-You weren't followed here? Positive?
-Yes, I'm positive.

275
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,519
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

276
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:55,079
<i>-It's me.</i>
-I took off. Where are you?

277
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,639
-Don't go home.
-Where should I go?

278
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:02,399
-Just stay away. I'll sort this.
-Where are you? I can come to you.

279
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,679
-Turn it off.
<i>-Hello?</i>

280
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:07,759
-I can't talk. I'll call later.
-Turn it off.

281
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:10,159
Hello?

282
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,399
-It's prepaid. No one has the number.
-They are too close. Turn it off!

283
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,279
Done.

284
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,559
-What do you want?
-Where's the box I left in the hallway?

285
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,839
-I threw it out.
<i>-What? Why?</i>

286
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:59,519
It was in the hallway. I told you,
trash goes in the hallway for disposal.

287
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,399
<i>-I take it out when I leave.</i>
-This wasn't for disposal.

288
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:07,839
-Don't leave it in the hallway, then.
-It was pictures and stuff!

289
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:11,879
-Didn't you notice?
-I didn't look. It was in the hallway.

290
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:15,879
-Where is it now?
<i>-The waste room. They collect Thursdays.</i>

291
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,079
<i>-It should be there.</i>
-Thank you very much. Bye.

292
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:26,679
-Was it Jakob? You threw his stuff out?
-Yes. They were in the hallway.

293
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:30,079
Shouldn't you establish
some common rules?

294
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,639
I did as you said and showed interest
in his work. It annoyed him.

295
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:38,639
-Maybe show it in another way.
-Maybe you give bad advice.

296
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,319
Three wives, constant infidelity...
You're bad at relationships.

297
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:51,239
-No, I'm not.
-You can't make one relationship work.

298
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,839
I can, for stretches.
And I'm still married to Mette.

299
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:57,239
-You're separated.
-Still married.

300
00:37:57,399 --> 00:38:00,719
Why are you married
if you're not living together?

301
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,479
I won't give you any more advice
unless you ask for it.

302
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,639
Good.

303
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:23,879
-The car will be ready Thursday.
-Thanks.

304
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:29,479
-I'm off, unless there's anything else.
-No, that'll be all. Thanks.

305
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,919
OK. See you tomorrow.

306
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,199
-I called the cops.
-What?

307
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,399
I was the one who called the cops.

308
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,479
Why the fuck did you that?
You're trying to get us all arrested?

309
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:23,319
No, them. Only those two.

310
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,479
They've confirmed we're getting
to meet higher-ups tonight.

311
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,439
I need to sort Linus out.
He's all alone...

312
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,439
-He's 13. He can sleep at a friend's.
-Maybe for a night.

313
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,079
Listen, you're going. They said
for all four of us to be there.

314
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:51,639
-Mads and Niklas.
-They know we're looking for them.

315
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,639
We've talked to everyone around them.

316
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:59,039
We're staking out known activist
hangouts. Nothing yet.

317
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,879
-What do we know about the women?
-Even less.

318
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,519
None of the people we talked to
mentioned any sisters or partners.

319
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,999
-Sorry.
-Where have you been all day?

320
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:13,919
I had to go to the ER.
I'm such an idiot.

321
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,639
I had a sandwich that contained nuts.
I've got a bad nut allergy.

322
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:21,599
-What kind of nut allergy?
-Doesn't matter.

323
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:25,279
-It could be useful to know.
-Hazelnuts, mostly.

324
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,439
-You're fine now?
-Yes.

325
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,559
-Did you get anywhere with the pics?
-No.

326
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:33,639
-And Linus?
-He's also stayed underground.

327
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:37,239
We're staking out the four friends
from the yearbook.

328
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:40,039
And the apartment,
in case he comes back.

329
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,799
And we're tracking his phone.

330
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:50,839
All right, thank you.

331
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,119
-Can I get a ride with you?
-Of course.

332
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:04,239
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

333
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,119
2239 here, we have a visual
of Linus Svensson. Standing by.

334
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:34,799
-What are you doing here?
-Can I stay here tonight?

335
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:41,759
-Is this some kind of test?
-No.

336
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:44,359
Why can't you sleep at home?

337
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,719
Something happened.

338
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:57,319
All right, come in. Close the door.

339
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,039
Let's hear three short hurrahs
and a long one for Caroline.

340
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,879
And the long one...

341
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:21,759
-Cheers!
-Thank you. Cheers!

342
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,599
Caroline, you want to see
what I got you?

343
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:41,559
I thought I'd get my presents
after dinner.

344
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,359
Forty-five is the new thirty.
Now is when life really begins.

345
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,759
It's a cruise for two.
I'm one of the two.

346
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:57,199
Of course. That's great! Thank you.

347
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:03,439
Oops. Looks like I've got one more gift.

348
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,839
-What's this?
-Sort of an...emergency number.

349
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:13,559
For when you're in need
of really great sex.

350
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,039
Caroline, he makes house calls, too.
Happy birthday.

351
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:28,159
What did Alexander get you?

352
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,399
-These.
-How imaginative.

353
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,479
Cut it out, I wanted these.
I'm happy with them.

354
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,839
Sure, but maybe
you've got other holes to fill.

355
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:42,159
-You are so obsessed with sex!
-Yes.

356
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,279
Maybe we share other things
that are more important.

357
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,759
Good to be home.

358
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:01,359
-Thanks for the ride.
-No problem.

359
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,639
You want to get a beer?

360
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:06,559
Yes. But some other night.

361
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:18,639
-It's nice to have you on the team.
-Thanks. I think so, too.

362
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:49,279
-Was this your idea?
-No, it was mine.

363
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,479
-Don't you have other things to do?
-You've lost weight.

364
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,119
Yes. But don't let that fool you.

365
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,799
I'm doing well.

366
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:08,359
-How are you doing?
-Great.

367
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:18,639
So one day you just felt so great
you decided to see your son's murderer?

368
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,239
You're not doing great, Martin.
I can tell.

369
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:37,359
You're angry.

370
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,959
I feel your anger.

371
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,079
I recognize it.

372
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:47,759
You want it to go away. It won't.

373
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,119
It'll only grow.
Until it becomes who you are.

374
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:56,399
No. Because I'm not you.

375
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:00,239
We're not so different.

376
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:11,479
-So what are you doing here?
-I felt like seeing you. And now I have.

377
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:18,759
-How is Saga?
-I wouldn't know.

378
00:48:18,919 --> 00:48:21,519
-You haven't seen each other?
-No.

379
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,519
I figured you would stay in touch.
She almost saved your son.

380
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,599
-Hi?
-I need to see the kids.

381
00:48:56,919 --> 00:49:00,479
-They're asleep.
-I need to see them.

382
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,039
Come in.

383
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,119
-Did she get her hair cut?
-Yes. Last week.

384
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:55,799
I'm missing out on so much.
This is all wrong. I belong here.

385
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,959
You'd never know it.

386
00:49:58,959 --> 00:50:02,479
-No, but I'm trying.
-Are you really?

387
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:07,159
You come here, get some love from
the kids, then you disappear again.

388
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:11,599
Do you realize
I don't have a life anymore?

389
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:16,599
It's just been put on hold. This is
my life now - a house and five kids.

390
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:21,079
I can't move on. Do I look
for someone new, do I live alone?

391
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:23,559
-Wait for you to come back?
-I will.

392
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:27,279
I don't know anything!
I'm living day to day.

393
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,479
Nikolaj woke up.
He's got a temperature.

394
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,519
I got you another gift.

395
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:09,759
-What's this?
-It's...new boobs.

396
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:15,239
-New boobs?
-Well, no, not new ones...

397
00:51:15,399 --> 00:51:19,639
It's for...breast implants.

398
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:22,159
You want me to get bigger boobs?

399
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,999
Not me, but you're always saying
they're a little saggy and sad.

400
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:32,719
Yes, but...that's just how I look.

401
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:39,079
-I thought you'd be happy.
-That's what you thought?

402
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:49,799
Did you manage to find
a new keynote speaker?

403
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:52,999
Yes, most likely.
Tomorrow I'll know for sure.

404
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:56,239
Well, fingers crossed.

405
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:59,239
Hey. You OK? Where are you?

406
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:02,719
At a friend's. When can I see you?

407
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,559
-Tomorrow, I hope.
-Niklas!

408
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:10,039
I've got to go. I love you, Linus.
It's all going to be fine.

409
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:12,239
<i>-Go to bed.</i>
-But where...?

410
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,279
-Jakob?
-Yeah?

411
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:33,799
What's this?
What have you done with my files?

412
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:36,999
I put them on the desk for now.

413
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:40,999
I'll sort it out tomorrow.

414
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,559
-You don't have any pictures out.
-No.

415
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:56,439
-Why not?
-It's unnecessary.

416
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:01,279
You never mention your family.

417
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:04,399
My sister's dead.
I never see my parents.

418
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,759
-Why not?
-They're no good for me.

419
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,519
-And your sister?
-She jumped in front of a train at 14.

420
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:15,919
Why haven't you told me?

421
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,439
Is it important?
Does it affect your opinion of me?

422
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,479
No, but I want to know all about you.

423
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,799
But that's impossible.

424
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:31,759
Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.

425
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:37,919
-Hi.
-Linus made a call.

426
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,559
-To whom?
-To a prepaid. We assume it's Niklas.

427
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:44,759
It's still on,
so I'll locate it any minute.

428
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:57,959
Let's see...

429
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,559
-It's the old industrial area.
-I'll go there right away.

430
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,479
Hey, Saga. This is not a good time.

431
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,759
-We've located Niklas.
-I'll be there right away.

432
00:55:20,919 --> 00:55:22,959
Good!

433
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:20,999
