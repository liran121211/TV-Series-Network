PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:16,802
The murder of Margrethe Thormod,
Director of Immigration, has received...

3
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:20,484
The press is going crazy.
They want to know if it's terrorism.

4
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:23,842
Red October?
It sounds like the radical left.

5
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:28,322
No films where you see them,
no spokesmen, no manifestos.

6
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:31,682
- How is Saga doing?
- Not so good.

7
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:39,202
- Where's that gay Iranian they deported?
- Taariq Shirazi went underground.

8
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:44,002
There was a marked increase in threats
against Thormod after the deportation.

9
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,562
They know Margrethe was here.
It's probably best if you move on.

10
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:53,682
Get out! I'll call the cops.

11
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:58,802
I think we've found new tenants.
A woman and a son. She has it really bad.

12
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:02,882
Why did Mom die?
Are you going to stop looking for us?

13
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:08,442
They disappeared almost 8 years ago.
Am I starting to leave it behind me?

14
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:13,042
The Supreme Court acquitted me
of the murder of my mother.

15
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:32,142
EPISODE 2

16
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:56,242
I'll call you right back.
What happened?

17
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:59,402
Hey! What happened to you?
Can you hear me?

18
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:02,162
- What happened?
- I don't know. She fainted.

19
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:05,922
Hello. Are you awake?
She just fainted all of a sudden.

20
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,082
Can you hear me? Hello?
Are you with us?

21
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:11,682
Do you think we should
call an ambulance?

22
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:13,922
What happened?

23
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:18,562
- Sorry.
- Are you with us?

24
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:23,082
- Let's do it.
- Should we call an ambulance?

25
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:25,762
She just woke up.

26
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:29,202
Hey. Try to get up.

27
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:32,122
- Hey, are you okay?
- Sorry. Thank you.

28
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:36,282
Yeah, I'm totally fine.
I just get a little dizzy sometimes.

29
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:39,762
- Should we call someone?
- No, it's fine. Thank you.

30
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,762
How did it go?

31
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:28,962
- 150 kroner.
- I have this, too.

32
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:33,002
You can get at least
1000 kroner for this.

33
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,002
Cool.

34
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:49,510
THE BRIDGE IV

35
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:11,402
Hi.

36
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:17,802
- How's it going?
- Good.

37
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:26,042
You were damn lucky.

38
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:38,002
Did Elsa say anything?

39
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:41,602
She said she felt betrayed.

40
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:45,522
She thought it could somehow
get you to stay.

41
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:51,042
I'm going to work again.

42
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:54,402
Don't you think it would be good
to take it a little easy after this?

43
00:05:54,522 --> 00:06:00,282
No, returning to work
will help me put this behind me.

44
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,762
No.

45
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:17,322
We know you're in contact with Taariq
Shirazi. He lives at your sister's place.

46
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:20,122
He shows up outside your apartment.

47
00:06:24,402 --> 00:06:26,322
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,802
Are you screwing, or what?

49
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:40,122
Is he so good that it's worth
getting mixed up in a murder case -

50
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:44,842
- that could end up being
classified as terrorism?

51
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:49,762
Hi. Where are we?

52
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:53,682
He still thinks it's a good idea
to keep quiet.

53
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:58,402
You know why you're here.
Margrethe Thormod was at your club.

54
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:02,442
What was she doing there?
Who was she meeting?

55
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,962
If he walks out that door,
then I'll answer your questions.

56
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:11,802
- Why's that? What did I do?
- Silas, we need to know why...

57
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:15,602
As soon as he walks out that door,
I'll answer your questions.

58
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:24,427
- Jonas.
- Are you serious?

59
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:41,802
Margrethe was there to meet Taariq.
He doesn't know why.

60
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:44,882
- So he says.
- Does he know where Taariq is now?

61
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:49,362
Maybe, but he won't tell,
and that's probably understandable.

62
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:54,962
Is it? I'm all for feeling sorry for him,
but he's our primary suspect.

63
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:59,162
- Silas isn't going to say anything.
- Maybe I should have been in there.

64
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,842
Lillian.

65
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:09,962
Saga is being released today.
I'd like to have her here.

66
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:13,642
Isn't it a little early?
She's had a hard time.

67
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,042
She needs it, Lillian.

68
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,482
She needs to be a detective again.
You know she's damn good.

69
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:26,162
And Red October is Swedish.

70
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:29,282
I'll have a chat with Linn.

71
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:36,482
Lillian. Do you seriously mean that?

72
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:39,522
- Are you seriously thinking of using her?
- Saga?

73
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:43,202
- She's just come out of prison.
- Because she was acquitted.

74
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:47,482
Is she stable enough? You said yourself
that she had a hard time.

75
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:50,802
- Can you really afford more mistakes?
- Mistakes?

76
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:54,202
Martin's in prison.
Hanne lost a leg.

77
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:57,762
No one was charged with murdering Danish
citizens; the suspect committed suicide.

78
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:01,842
- Are you finished?
- I'm just trying to help you.

79
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:55,922
You've always had only clean hits.

80
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:59,522
There were errors both in your shooting
and when you drew your weapon.

81
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,762
You passed, but
the result was worse.

82
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:05,122
I couldn't practice.

83
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:09,682
- So that doesn't concern you?
- No.

84
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:15,722
Welcome back.

85
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:29,722
Can I start working now?

86
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:35,522
Lillian asked for your help
with Henrik Sabroe in Denmark.

87
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:40,602
Is that okay? You can start
by reading through the case.

88
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:54,562
- You can borrow my office for a bit.
- Great.

89
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:05,722
Yeah, I'm looking at it now.

90
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:11,322
It just confirms what I said.
It's not Red October.

91
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:14,522
- Yeah, I can write something.
- Hello.

92
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,122
It's no problem.

93
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:22,402
The usual rate?
Okay, good.

94
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:26,602
You'll hear from me.
Yep. Bye.

95
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:29,122
You're not ready?

96
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:33,842
I'm going to run
10 kilometers today.

97
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:39,362
- Do you have a hangover?
- No. I was beaten up when I came home.

98
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:44,442
- By that group?
- No, that girl you brought home.

99
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:48,562
Robin S.
Turns out her ex is fucking jealous.

100
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:54,122
Seriously. You need to stop
pretending to be me. Understood?

101
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:57,002
- I mean it! That was the last time.
- Yeah, I promise.

102
00:12:57,122 --> 00:13:00,162
Scout's honor.
On Mom's grave.

103
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:04,762
- So no run today?
- No.

104
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:11,322
- Should I run the jacuzzi instead?
- Patrik, I have to work. See you later.

105
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:15,602
Okay. I'll just have some breakfast.

106
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:20,642
How's it really going
with your NA meetings?

107
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:23,562
- It's going okay.
- Just okay?

108
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:29,162
- No, no, it's fine. It's helping.
- I don't want any more problems.

109
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:34,682
- Do you think this will be a problem?
- It's Saga, after all.

110
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,282
Hey.

111
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:42,202
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

112
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:48,242
- Good to see you.
- Yes.

113
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:51,442
Yeah...

114
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,882
Well, where is my desk?

115
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,402
We don't have fixed desks,
so you can sit where you want.

116
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:01,282
Why don't you have fixed desks?

117
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:05,482
It's something we're testing to be
more flexible and increase creativity.

118
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:09,082
Objectivity is more important
to an officer than creativity.

119
00:14:09,202 --> 00:14:12,322
Yeah, but now we're trying this.

120
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:15,562
What should I do with my things?

121
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:21,242
Just take this around with you.
There.

122
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:25,842
- There you are.
- You can sit there.

123
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:38,442
- Hi. Jonas Mandrup.
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

124
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:41,482
Yeah, I know that.
I've heard a lot about you.

125
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:44,522
We'll have a briefing for Saga.

126
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:48,322
That isn't necessary.
I've read all the material.

127
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:01,162
Red October put out a video
on the internet today.

128
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:04,882
- They claim they didn't kill Thormod.
- I know. I saw it.

129
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:08,042
It's been impossible to track them,
but we're trying.

130
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:11,362
You questioned Silas Tuxen this morning.
Did you get anything?

131
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:13,842
He says Thormod was meeting Taariq.

132
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:17,562
But he didn't say where Taariq was,
assuming he knew.

133
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:20,722
What reason did she have
to meet with Taariq?

134
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:29,042
None. She had absolutely no reason
to be in contact with him.

135
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,762
We have a witness who says
that they met.

136
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:35,322
Maybe he's lying, or
maybe he just misunderstood.

137
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:40,322
She introduced herself. As far as we know,
he has no reason to lie.

138
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:44,602
Last time, you said she was cheating.

139
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:48,562
- Let me hear it.
- Hear what?

140
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:52,802
You come here with crazy allegations.
How far along are you?

141
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:57,122
For technical reasons, we can't disclose
details of the investigation.

142
00:15:57,242 --> 00:16:00,802
No details. I'm asking how far
along you are, if you have suspects...

143
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:04,562
Niels. We can't disclose anything.

144
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:11,042
- Niels, you'll hear from us.
- I want to see where she was killed.

145
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:15,002
- It's still cordoned off.
- Why? Because you found something?

146
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:21,042
Did you not hear that we can't disclose
details about the investigation?

147
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:23,962
Discoveries at the crime scene
are classified as details.

148
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:34,642
Why do you want to see
where it happened?

149
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:38,722
It could be horrible.

150
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:43,402
- I need it to move on.
- She was stoned to death, Niels.

151
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:51,642
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be there in a little bit.

152
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:15,962
Yeah, hi, it's me.

153
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:19,522
No, no, no.
They know nothing.

154
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:23,082
Continue as planned.

155
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:43,042
I haven't gotten my paycheck.

156
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,482
- Good thing you said it.
- We agreed on the end of the week.

157
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:49,322
Take it easy.
I haven't forgotten.

158
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:09,762
Do you think it's him?

159
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,602
We're the sellers.

160
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:28,802
Can I see?

161
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:31,562
The money first. 1000 kroner.

162
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:34,682
Come on, man.
Let me see the passport.

163
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,322
The money.

164
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:49,882
Let go! Give me the passport now!

165
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:52,762
Just give him the passport, Julia.

166
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,322
Hey, what are you doing?

167
00:18:55,442 --> 00:19:00,602
What are you doing?
Let her go! Let her go, I say!

168
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:22,842
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?

169
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:29,682
Do you have any food we can have?

170
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:38,122
- And you live off of selling passports?
- Among other things.

171
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:41,562
Do you have one I can buy?

172
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,802
If you're blond, 55, and named Louise.

173
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:50,442
But if we get hold of one
that looks like you, then...

174
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:52,802
Okay. Thanks.

175
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:57,842
I'm going back to work.

176
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:02,122
- But take care of yourselves.
- Likewise.

177
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:04,482
Okay, make yourselves at home.

178
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:09,122
- I don't know if we can afford it.
- Don't worry.

179
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:11,602
Come.

180
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:23,642
Here's a bedroom.

181
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:31,082
There's another down there.

182
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,202
Bathroom.
Kitchen.

183
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:41,602
Living room.

184
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:50,882
- Can you make do out here?
- I have no choice.

185
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:55,362
Not much goes on here, but it's safe,
and that's the most important thing.

186
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,762
- Why is it empty?
- The previous tenants...

187
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:01,442
Didn't respect the contract.

188
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:06,362
- What kind of contract?
- It's nothing special.

189
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:11,522
I'll come back to help with furniture.
There's some in the silo we drove by.

190
00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:15,522
You can just take it. It costs nothing.
We help each other here.

191
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:20,162
If anything comes up,
I live just down the road.

192
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:23,162
- Okay, see you later.
- Thanks.

193
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:30,682
It's not so bad.

194
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:35,522
It'll be fine.

195
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:46,122
Yeah?

196
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:50,442
I thought we agreed that Alexis
would move into that empty house.

197
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:55,202
We did, but the situation has changed.

198
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:58,842
- Frank's friends showed up.
- Yes, but it's not Frank's town.

199
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,122
It's mine.

200
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:05,962
And you know what I think about
those who question my decisions.

201
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:23,042
Here are the keys to my house.

202
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:26,202
Am I going to live at your place?

203
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,962
- Do you have another place to live?
- No.

204
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,962
I'll find my own apartment,
or a hotel in the meantime.

205
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:37,202
- Or you can just live at my place.
- You live there.

206
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:46,842
Saga, Henrik.
We know where Taariq is.

207
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:57,362
Lillian. It's me and Henrik leading
this investigation, right?

208
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:59,962
Yes, but right now I'm sending
Saga and Henrik out.

209
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:03,122
- You're prioritizing her over me.
- She's not the competition.

210
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:08,402
Equality before competence.
It's not the first time, is it?

211
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:30,082
Taariq Shirazi. Henrik Sabroe, police.
We want to talk to you.

212
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,642
Taariq!

213
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,562
Hey, stop!
Taariq!

214
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,882
- Open the door!
- Put your hands against the wall!

215
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:42,642
Put your hands against the door!
Turn around!

216
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:48,842
You called them, huh?
You called them, huh? You shit!

217
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:51,122
You shit!

218
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,922
Margrethe Thormod was killed by stoning.
That punishment is used in Iran.

219
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,682
You said if you went back
you were sentenced to death.

220
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:09,122
Look at the photo.

221
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:13,162
Margrethe Thormod was the most
responsible for your deportation.

222
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:23,562
I didn't kill her.
She tried to help me.

223
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:27,962
- With what?
- Money, a new passport, a new identity.

224
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:31,602
So first she deports you,
and then she helps you stay?

225
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:35,882
She said she had to make
bad decisions -

226
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:39,802
- and that there's something
wrong with the system.

227
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,562
And so she'd be able to sleep at night.

228
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:46,122
- By breaking the law?
- By being humane.

229
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:51,162
- I wasn't the first she helped.
- So you confirm the meeting at The Cave?

230
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:53,562
Yes.

231
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:57,202
- How long was she there?
- 30 minutes. Maybe a little more.

232
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:02,282
But she got a call and was very stressed.
She said she needed to leave right away.

233
00:26:02,402 --> 00:26:05,162
- Who called her?
- I don't know.

234
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:08,522
- Where was she going?
- I don't know.

235
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:12,442
- She jumped into a black car.
- What was the make? Model?

236
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:14,802
I know nothing about cars.
It was black.

237
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:18,642
- Did you see the plate number?
- No.

238
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:28,202
We'll just take a break.

239
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:37,922
It's good.

240
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:42,482
- Elderflower?
- No.

241
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:51,362
Do you own the whole town?
And all the houses?

242
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:56,322
Yeah, since 1998, when my husband
committed suicide. Up on the farm.

243
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:02,762
Frank mentioned something
about a contract.

244
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:08,402
We don't care where
you come from -

245
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:12,322
- what you believe in,
or how much money you have -

246
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:16,642
- or who you sleep with.
We're interested in only one thing.

247
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:21,162
You should be the best version
of yourselves so long as you're here.

248
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:26,082
- What does that mean?
- You should be good people.

249
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:30,402
Take care of the town, of nature -

250
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:33,522
- of the land.
Help each other -

251
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:36,242
- make a little extra effort.

252
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:40,442
Be the best version of yourselves
and hope -

253
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:43,842
- that it's enough
to be allowed to stay.

254
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:02,642
Here's the rental contract.

255
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:07,922
So...
Tell me a little about yourselves.

256
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,642
Is this your cell phone?

257
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:33,962
Yes.

258
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:37,642
The call Margrethe Thormod received
when she was with you -

259
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:40,762
- came from this phone.

260
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:49,282
There's a GPS program installed
that's tracking another cell phone.

261
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:52,642
Margrethe Thormod's.

262
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,642
I don't understand.

263
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:05,962
A program in your phone shows
where Margrethe Thormod's phone is -

264
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:08,522
- with almost exact precision.

265
00:29:12,522 --> 00:29:16,202
But I don't have...
I don't understand.

266
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:19,642
I got that phone today.

267
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:22,722
- You got it today?
- Yes.

268
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,762
- From whom?
- From two girls.

269
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:29,525
- What are their names?
- I don't know.

270
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:31,858
Where did you meet them?

271
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:36,042
It was outside the restaurant.
They were selling a passport to a man -

272
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:39,802
- and he wanted to take it from them,
but I came out to help them...

273
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:42,682
- ...and as thanks, I got the phone.
- Just like that?

274
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:46,162
They just give you their phone
as thanks for helping?

275
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:50,522
It wasn't their phone.
I think they stole it like the passport.

276
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:56,202
- How old were they?
- Young. 14, maybe 15.

277
00:29:56,322 --> 00:30:00,402
It's hard to say. One was younger.
I think they were sisters.

278
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:03,762
- And you've never seen them before?
- No.

279
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:09,562
So two young girls you'd never met.
You don't know their names.

280
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:14,282
They just tell you they're criminals,
and then give you their cell phone.

281
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:31,002
You don't believe me? Huh?
I got it from them!

282
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:36,482
I promise it's true!
I got it from them!

283
00:30:39,082 --> 00:30:41,402
You have to believe me!

284
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,602
There.

285
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:04,162
We've had 11 reported pickpockets
in this area in the last 14 days.

286
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:08,322
The same pattern.
Young girl acts sick, people help -

287
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:11,362
- she gets better,
and they find they've been robbed.

288
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:14,562
- Where's Taariq's restaurant?
- It's here.

289
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:18,642
- We believe him now? Huh?
- Saga.

290
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:22,882
Technicians found two sets of fingerprints
on the phone besides Taariq's.

291
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:27,722
- Small. Could be young girls'.
- Do we know who owns the phone?

292
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:31,362
- The murderer wouldn't have left tracks.
- Cameras?

293
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:34,442
They managed to avoid the cameras.

294
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:38,882
- Okay, what do we do?
- Taariq stays. We put out an APB.

295
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:41,842
- So we believe him.
- We can't take any chances.

296
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:47,202
If they stole it from our culprit, they
must be found. We'll hold Taariq.

297
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:53,922
Hello, hello!

298
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:07,642
In school, he rips paper into shreds
and sharpens pencils.

299
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:10,682
Hello, hello!
Who do we have here?

300
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:14,562
Take it easy, honey. Out.
Come on, out. Come on.

301
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:22,162
I know most of them like you -

302
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:24,962
- but my daughter is afraid of clowns.

303
00:32:25,082 --> 00:32:28,842
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- I said it before.

304
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:32,002
It must have slipped my mind. Sorry.
Does she want a balloon animal?

305
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:35,242
No, she doesn't.

306
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:48,842
Hello, hello!

307
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,802
He's gone now.

308
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:55,762
Are you okay?

309
00:32:56,802 --> 00:33:00,282
Shall we keep reading?

310
00:33:00,402 --> 00:33:03,042
- Hey, Patrik.
- Hey.

311
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:06,482
There's a girl who doesn't
like clowns.

312
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:09,482
I know. Leonora.
The nurses told us.

313
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:12,242
- When did they say that?
- At the morning meeting.

314
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:15,202
- Where was I?
- You were next to me.

315
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:18,402
Ah, I see. Yep.

316
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:22,322
See you tomorrow.
Thanks for today.

317
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:34,682
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things -

318
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:37,562
- I cannot change -

319
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,882
- the courage to change the things I can -

320
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:45,162
- and the wisdom to tell the difference.

321
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:52,282
Congrats.
Isn't it great she was acquitted?

322
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:55,202
Yeah. Thanks.

323
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:59,402
- It's tea water.
- Perfect.

324
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,242
Thanks.

325
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:05,682
- Are you together?
- Why do you think that?

326
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:09,082
It sounded that way
when you talked about her.

327
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:11,562
It's not that simple.

328
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:16,322
- Either you're together or not.
- That's not how it is with her.

329
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:22,602
- Why not?
- Because she is who she is.

330
00:34:24,922 --> 00:34:27,002
How did you meet?

331
00:34:27,122 --> 00:34:30,522
I wanted her help to find the girls.

332
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:34,802
Then it became something else.

333
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:36,682
You don't know what?

334
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:41,162
The thing is, I need her more
than she needs me.

335
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:46,282
Well, that's shitty.

336
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:49,682
Yeah.

337
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:14,682
- Do you know what time it is?
- 10:07 PM.

338
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:18,282
You can't be an investigator
24 hours a day.

339
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:22,962
- But I am.
- Come on.

340
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:25,922
We'll continue tomorrow.

341
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:44,002
No, no.
No, no.

342
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,242
Don't bring that.

343
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:07,362
- I'm going now.
- Yeah. Great. Thanks for today.

344
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,922
Is that okay?

345
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:15,562
- I can certainly stay.
- No, it's fine. Thanks a lot, Susanne.

346
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,002
What are you thinking about?

347
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:25,482
- Margrethe... Her helping Taariq.
- If he did it?

348
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:31,482
Sometimes she needed to make decisions
she didn't agree with.

349
00:36:31,602 --> 00:36:35,482
Well, that's fine.
She was a good person.

350
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:40,362
She just never told me, and
we didn't have any secrets.

351
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:44,882
Do you think... Do you think
there was something she didn't tell me?

352
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:49,322
Do you mean what the police suggested?
That she was cheating?

353
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:53,002
Just...
Did she say anything to you?

354
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:56,722
- Anything that might get her killed?
- No.

355
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,482
And she loved you.

356
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:01,602
So much.

357
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:35,562
- Saga, what are you doing?
- Checking apartments in Malmo.

358
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:51,682
When I asked you -

359
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:56,282
- why you didn't want to live here,
you said it was because I live here.

360
00:37:56,402 --> 00:37:59,242
I'm not good at living with anyone.

361
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:02,642
Okay. What about you and me?

362
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:07,522
Sometimes I'll live here, sometimes
I'll live alone, and we'll have sex.

363
00:38:07,642 --> 00:38:11,322
- Only with each other?
- Do you want sex with other people?

364
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:14,922
I'm just trying to understand
what we're doing.

365
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:20,602
- I'll never be like Alice.
- I know that.

366
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:26,202
- Do you still see her?
- No.

367
00:38:26,322 --> 00:38:28,682
What about the children?
Do you see them?

368
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:31,722
Yeah.

369
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,722
- So it has nothing to do with the drugs?
- No.

370
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:44,122
We weren't doing so great,
Alice and me.

371
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,922
Did you have a bad relationship?

372
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,482
We had some problems.

373
00:38:52,602 --> 00:38:55,402
- Did you fight?
- No.

374
00:38:57,242 --> 00:39:00,122
She pulled away more and more.

375
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:02,562
Got very quiet.

376
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,682
We didn't really talk.

377
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:14,162
But I'm glad you're here.

378
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:17,402
Yeah, you said that.

379
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:13,402
Bro, is that you?

380
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:19,482
What are you doing?

381
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,522
You can't be here.

382
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:27,522
You can't be here.

383
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:32,282
Do you hear what I'm saying?
You can't be here!

384
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:38,482
Do you hear what I'm saying?
Get out of here!

385
00:40:39,962 --> 00:40:43,602
Go! Hello?
Get out!

386
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:36,162
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

387
00:41:36,282 --> 00:41:39,002
We thought it was
an unknown perpetrator.

388
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,642
If it was bad between you and Alice,
she might have gone willingly.

389
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:46,802
No, she didn't do that.
It wasn't that bad.

390
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,002
You didn't talk about it,
so it might have been.

391
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:52,122
She would never have taken
the children from me.

392
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:56,002
- Did Alice have any girlfriends?
- Yeah. Why?

393
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:58,842
Women trust each other
if there are relationship problems.

394
00:41:58,962 --> 00:42:01,682
Yeah, but I talked to all of them
after they disappeared.

395
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:05,322
- It's not in the reports here.
- Because they didn't know anything.

396
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:10,082
- Or they didn't want to tell you.
- Alice didn't disappear willingly, Saga.

397
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:13,442
She was abducted or killed.

398
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:17,882
And I need to realize soon
that we'll never find the girls.

399
00:42:32,522 --> 00:42:35,922
I'm just going to lie down again.

400
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:53,202
She sometimes doubted
if he still loved her.

401
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:58,522
Do you know if Alice talked
to others about this?

402
00:42:59,722 --> 00:43:02,522
She mentioned someone from work.

403
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:06,162
- Do you know who it was?
- No, she never said.

404
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:09,802
- Man, woman?
- A man, but it was just a coworker.

405
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:14,922
She loved Henrik. She would never
take the children and just disappear.

406
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:18,242
I need to go.
You'll have to pay.

407
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:23,362
Lise said Alice talked a good deal
with a man at work.

408
00:43:23,482 --> 00:43:27,922
We have a list of male employees.
I want to take a look at it.

409
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,082
You could have asked me
to come along with Lise.

410
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:38,922
She might not have been honest
about what Alice thought about you.

411
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:42,322
- Was she, then?
- Yes.

412
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:47,762
- Do you want to know what she said?
- Do I?

413
00:43:47,882 --> 00:43:52,042
- That's what I asked.
- Yeah. What did she say?

414
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,602
She said you were more a policeman
than a husband.

415
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:58,642
That you were out with coworkers
and drank too much at times.

416
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:03,042
And that you let Alice take care of
the children and took her for granted.

417
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:06,522
- Also that she wasn't sure you loved her.
- Thanks, that's fine.

418
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:10,202
- But she said more.
- Yeah, but it's fine. Thanks a lot, Saga.

419
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:13,242
You're welcome.

420
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:24,922
The neighbor called it in. They found
him dead in the jacuzzi this morning.

421
00:44:28,802 --> 00:44:31,922
I talked to the prosecutor
about Richard Dahlqvist.

422
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:35,322
The connection to Red October
and Margrethe Thormod is enough -

423
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:37,642
- that the case is yours.

424
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:45,362
No signs of violence.

425
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,962
He didn't drown.

426
00:44:48,082 --> 00:44:52,162
- Heart attack?
- Unusual for a man his age and shape.

427
00:44:52,282 --> 00:44:54,962
- What are you doing?
- Stay there.

428
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:57,482
I live here!
It's my house.

429
00:44:57,602 --> 00:44:59,562
I'm asking you to stay there.

430
00:44:59,682 --> 00:45:03,242
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police. Who are you?
- Richard Dahlqvist. I live here.

431
00:45:04,522 --> 00:45:07,562
You have a twin brother.

432
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:21,602
He was probably murdered
instead of you.

433
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:27,802
- Did you feel threatened?
- No.

434
00:45:27,922 --> 00:45:31,482
Were you in contact with Red October?

435
00:45:31,602 --> 00:45:36,402
- It's not them. It's not them.
- Were you in contact with them?

436
00:45:36,522 --> 00:45:39,642
Yeah. Some texts.

437
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:42,402
- Then we need your cell phone.
- Why?

438
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,962
Because of the texts.

439
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:24,402
We put things here we don't need,
but could be useful to others.

440
00:46:24,522 --> 00:46:27,642
You can just take what you want.

441
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:31,082
- You're not coming?
- I'll stay here.

442
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:33,882
- See you later, then.
- Yeah. Bye.

443
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:25,002
Hey.

444
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:28,282
Did I scare you?

445
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:33,082
Frank said I could take what I want.

446
00:47:33,202 --> 00:47:36,682
- Frank is my dad.
- Okay.

447
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:41,162
- Astrid.
- Christoffer.

448
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:47,762
- This was mine once.
- Is it okay if I take it?

449
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:51,482
- It wouldn't be here otherwise.
- I guess not.

450
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:56,442
- I can help you.
- Okay.

451
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:00,602
There.

452
00:48:06,722 --> 00:48:09,322
- I'll get Lillian.
- Okay.

453
00:48:19,642 --> 00:48:22,322
- Do you want something?
- Yes. I sat there.

454
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,762
Yeah, okay. Now I sit here.
It's a flexible office.

455
00:48:29,562 --> 00:48:33,642
- I heard you were in Sweden.
- We'll brief you when Lillian comes.

456
00:48:33,762 --> 00:48:36,842
Then we don't have to do it twice.

457
00:48:36,962 --> 00:48:39,002
Okay.

458
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:33,722
- Patrik Dahlqvist.
- He worked as a hospital clown.

459
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:37,282
Richard's twin brother.
We think they were after him.

460
00:49:37,402 --> 00:49:40,242
It was Richard who was
in contact with Red October.

461
00:49:40,362 --> 00:49:43,762
The day before last, both brothers went
to meet them, but they didn't show.

462
00:49:43,882 --> 00:49:46,882
Richard received a text
to meet alone next time.

463
00:49:47,002 --> 00:49:50,442
- They were watching him, then.
- Saga, you're bleeding.

464
00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:54,322
- Where is Richard now?
- Linn got a hotel room in Malmo.

465
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:57,068
- The video from Red October?
- Nothing.

466
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,068
Everyone leaves digital tracks.

467
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:02,322
- Not these people.
- Or you haven't found them.

468
00:50:51,202 --> 00:50:54,682
My favorite police.
I've missed you.

469
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:02,042
- How are you?
- Good. What did you find?

470
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:06,322
- I've just started.
- You've had the body several hours.

471
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:10,482
You or me?
Which do you prefer?

472
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:19,362
Here.

473
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:21,442
Take this.

474
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:26,522
You'll get used to it again.
So, which is it?

475
00:51:26,642 --> 00:51:29,442
You or me?

476
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:33,002
If you've just started,
you don't have much yet.

477
00:51:33,122 --> 00:51:35,962
I have a pretty good theory.

478
00:51:44,282 --> 00:51:49,642
He bit his tongue.
Convulsions.

479
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:58,442
Marks on his palms. Burns.

480
00:52:00,882 --> 00:52:03,442
Blisters.

481
00:52:05,842 --> 00:52:09,082
- He died of electric shock.
- Good.

482
00:52:43,922 --> 00:52:47,082
Ida! Police! Run! Ida!

483
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:51,042
Hey! Stop, you two!
Police!

484
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:16,162
- What do we do now?
- We need to get away from here.

485
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:19,002
Lay low for a bit.
Let's go to Malmo.

486
00:53:22,722 --> 00:53:24,402
Hi.

487
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:27,362
Hi.

488
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:32,082
- Hi, John. Welcome.
- Thanks.

489
00:53:32,202 --> 00:53:35,682
- You can sit there.
- Okay. Hi.

490
00:53:36,802 --> 00:53:40,442
- Hi there.
- Jonas Mandrup. Who are you?

491
00:53:40,562 --> 00:53:45,562
John Lundqvist. Technical Investigator
from Malmo. I'm going to help you a bit.

492
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:49,322
Are you? That sounds great.

493
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:54,562
Make sure you get what you need.
Start with Richard Dahlqvist's phone.

494
00:53:57,282 --> 00:54:00,202
Patrik Dahlqvist died of
a strong electric shock.

495
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:03,362
And it couldn't have been
a problem with the jacuzzi?

496
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:07,642
That's not how he was found. The body
was placed like this after he died.

497
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:11,922
Anything new on the girls?

498
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:16,562
A couple colleagues found the place
they were living, but they got away.

499
00:54:16,682 --> 00:54:20,642
Okay. Maybe we should try to get
more Swedes over here to help us.

500
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:23,722
We're trying to get on top of things.

501
00:54:23,842 --> 00:54:26,722
Saga, Henrik, take Richard's phone
to him in Malmo.

502
00:54:26,842 --> 00:54:32,122
Text Red October, asking to meet.
Put surveillance on him and go.

503
00:54:32,242 --> 00:54:37,882
- We're exposing him to danger.
- Not if we do it right.

504
00:55:00,202 --> 00:55:02,642
Where are the guards here?

505
00:55:18,722 --> 00:55:21,002
Where the hell is he?

506
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:24,402
Come on, let's get back.
I'll call Linn.

507
00:55:29,482 --> 00:55:31,162
Saga.

508
00:55:31,282 --> 00:55:33,322
Saga?

509
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:54,202
Saga.

510
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:57,282
Saga, what's wrong?

511
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:02,322
Saga, are you okay?

512
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,602
Come on, Saga. Come on. Breathe.
Just breathe. Nice and easy.

513
00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:11,282
Just pull to the side.
Nice and easy.

514
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:34,162
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. I don't know!

515
00:56:34,282 --> 00:56:36,442
I don't know.

516
00:56:57,322 --> 00:56:59,322
Thank you.
