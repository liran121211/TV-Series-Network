Margrethe Thormod.
Director of Immigration Services.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello! Get out!
Get out of here, I said!

00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,720
Patrik Dahlqvist.

5
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:21,234
I think we've found new houseguests.
A woman and son. They have it really bad.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,720
- Who do you want me to be?
- Her.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,440
Not Agnes.
She's not nice.

8
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm pregnant.
But I've decided to get rid of it.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,353
- Do I not have a say?
- Not legally.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,369
- You can sleep where you want.
- Do you have children?

11
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,907
- I did.
- Are they dead?

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,800
Margrethe Thormod was responsible
for your deportation.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,320
I didn't kill her.
She jumped into a black car.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,950
Surveillance lost him in traffic.

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,907
<i>Hello?</i>

16
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:02,040
Morgan Sonning? I know what you did.
We need to meet.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,640
- Love you.
- Love you too, Dad.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,160
- I need to set an example.
- But you know Dimitri.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,480

EPISODE 4

21
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,760
What do you want?

22
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,640
- I saw your car.
- Uh-huh.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,120
When you picked her up.

24
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:55,480
- Picked up who?
- Margrethe Thormod.

25
00:01:57,276 --> 00:02:01,440
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Outside of the club.

26
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,360
Sorry.

27
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:07,715
I want money, or else
I'm telling the police everything.

28
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,880
- Say what you want. I'm going now.
- No!

29
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:14,757
You're not.

00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:24,814
THE BRIDGE IV

31
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,400
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.

32
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:34,480
- What did he do here?
- He borrowed my laptop.

33
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:41,970
He wanted to check something
on the internet.

34
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,560
PC 14 921.

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,872
Black Audi owned by Morgan Sonning.
He lives here in Copenhagen.

36
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:59,644
I knew he knew something
about that car.

37
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:02,800
No, he's not home.
He drove off about an hour ago.

38
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Did he say where he was going?

39
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,000
A black Audi with plate number
PC 14 921.

40
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,640
- Is that your husband's?
- Yes.

41
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,800
Do you know if he used it
on the afternoon of the 28th?

42
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,840
Why are you coming in a taxi?
Did something happen?

43
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,840
- We'll talk about it later. Can you pay?
- Morgan Sonning?

44
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,451
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is my colleague, Henrik Sabroe.

45
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:30,800
- Why don't you have the car?
- We need to talk to you about the 28th.

46
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,858
I was robbed.
Can I get money to pay the taxi?

47
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:37,040
- Did you hear what I said?
- Can you wait a second?

48
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm okay, but can you go in
and get money to pay the taxi, please?

49
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,680
Yeah, of course.

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,285
- We want to talk to you about the 28th.
- Yeah, I heard that.

51
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,360
Can we talk at your place?

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,925
You want us to take you
to the police station?

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,760
- Why didn't you call the police?
- What would you have done?

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,520
Send a car out there?

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,000
Probably not.
It wasn't a high priority.

56
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:11,640
- I was just a bit curious.
- You were curious?

57
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:16,440
- So it was him?
- Yes, it was him.

58
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,080
He thought he'd seen my car
pick up Margrethe outside of a club.

59
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:26,280
I didn't understand what he was
talking about, and was about to leave.

60
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,446
Then he took out a gun and took my car,
my wallet, and my phone.

61
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:37,800
- Where was your car on the 28th?
- In the shop.

62
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:40,680
- Where's that?
- In Sweden.

63
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,040
- You brought your car to Sweden for work?
- Yeah, it's my brother's shop.

64
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I try to support him a bit.

65
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,760
- Where were you?
- The 28th? In Hamburg with my wife.

66
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,520
When he called, he said, "I know what
you did." Did you know what he meant?

67
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:01,809
- I don't know. I was just curious.
- And we couldn't talk about it at home?

68
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,440
My wife would have thought I did something
I wanted to keep secret.

69
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,480
- We think so, too.
- Okay.

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,950
But that's your problem, isn't it?

71
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,800
<i>Leave your name and number
and I'll call you back. Bye.</i>

72
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:22,760
Sarah, where the hell are you?
You should have been looking after her.

73
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,560
Where are you?

74
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,360
Everything looked good
until this happened.

75
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,120
- What happened?
- I don't know.

76
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:44,280
She was getting better.
Sarah called and said she was better.

77
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,440
- Is she rejecting the kidney?
- It doesn't seem like it.

78
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,800
But we don't know what happened.
As soon as we know, we'll tell you.

81
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:44,760
- William! Where is she?
- Where the fuck have you been?

82
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:48,522
- Where is she?
- You should have taken care of her!

83
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:52,070
I tried. There was a crazy guy.
A clown.

84
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,613
- Where is Leonora?
- She's been poisoned.

85
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:02,400
Tell them that.
Tell them she was poisoned.

86
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,920
They need to find it and help her.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

87
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:06,800
William, I have two daughters myself.

88
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:32,160
- How long have you been up?
- A little bit.

89
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:36,160
- I don't like waking up alone.
- I just came out here.

90
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:41,462
- Where is he?
- Working. He left a note.

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,200
"Good morning. Food's in the fridge.
Just take what you want. See you tonight.

92
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
Hugs."

93
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:52,680
He's cute.

94
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:59,680
- Are we going to stay?
- Who are the only ones we can trust?

95
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,061
- Ourselves.
- Exactly.

96
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,400
If someone calls you up saying
"I know what you did" -

97
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:13,560
- and you choose to meet that person,
it's because you have something to hide.

98
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,153
That he's hiding something
doesn't mean it's illegal.

99
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:22,080
- Maybe he's fucking around.
- Jonas' explanation for everything.

100
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:26,280
It's estimated that a fourth of Sweden's
population has been unfaithful.

101
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,760
- In Denmark, the numbers are higher.
- The world's happiest people.

102
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,840
That doesn't follow. You can't connect
unfaithfulness with happiness statistics.

103
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,378
Sure I can.

104
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:42,280
Morgan Sonning's car was near The Cave
on the 28th. The times match.

105
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,920
Unfortunately, tinted windows.
There's an APB out on it.

106
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,120
Since Taariq has Swedish credit cards now,
the Swedes were informed.

107
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:50,676
Good.

108
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,431
Yeah, okay.
I'll check Morgan Sonning's alibi.

109
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:59,160
- We'll take the shop in Sweden.
- Okay.

110
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,800
My brother's car came on the 26th.
He got it that Monday.

111
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,760
It was seen in Copenhagen
on the afternoon of the 28th.

112
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,320
No, it wasn't.

113
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,582
Surveillance footage
from Copenhagen on the 28th.

114
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,760
I don't know what to tell you.

115
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:51,640
- How many employees do you have?
- Three.

116
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,960
But the keys are locked inside.
Only I have the code.

117
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,640
- And where were you on the 28th?
- Here, as far as I know.

118
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,120
No, I wasn't.
We were at the hospital with our son.

119
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:13,600
- The cars out there, are they ready?
- Some of them.

120
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,960
- Was your brother's car there the 28th?
- Probably.

121
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,599
- Probably? Was it there or not?
- It was ready. So yeah, it was there.

122
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:42,400
- Hi. May I see your driver's license?
- Yes.

123
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:48,436
Thanks.

124
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,447
- Is it your car?
- Yes.

125
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,694
- 911?
- S. 911S.

126
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,600
- Late '70s?
- '77.

127
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,480
A car was taken from here
and driven to Copenhagen on the 28th.

128
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,120
Is it only Tobias Johansson
who has access to the keys?

129
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:22,012
Does he not trust you?

130
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,760
- You'd have to talk to him about that.
- So no one else could have taken the car.

131
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,520
No one else. Only Tobias.
Do you want to sell it?

132
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:31,920
No, I don't.

133
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,760
- What did you pay for it?
- Nothing. I won it.

134
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,920
- You won it? How?
- On a bet.

135
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
Someone bet this car?

136
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,120
David Leander.
He was in my class at the police academy.

137
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:53,440
- What did you bet on?
- He said I wouldn't graduate.

138
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,560
I said I'd be the best in the class.

139
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,360
Damn is that stupid, man.
How did things turn out for him?

140
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,144
He's the Police Chief in Stockholm.

141
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:09,275
It's Lillian.
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

142

<i>at the border with Taariq Shirazi.</i>

144
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,724
I'm with you now.

145
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,838
Hey.

146
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,554
You let me go.
They'll kill me if I'm sent back.

147
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:17,229
You need to help me again.

148
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:22,080
Taariq, you need to let her go.
Then we'll help you.

149
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,939
I want to seek asylum here in Sweden.

150
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,360
We can look into that, Taariq.
That's no problem.

151
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,640
- Is that true?
- You don't need to go back to Denmark.

152
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,280
- Is that true?
- Yes.

153
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,320
Not you, her.
Can I stay here?

154
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,516
I won't be sent home?

155
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:44,670
No, you can absolutely stay here.

156
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,808
- You're lying.
- No, it's true.

157
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:50,959
- You're lying!
- Taariq, it's true.

158
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:53,586
Tell me the truth.

159
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,200
I'll shoot her!
Tell me the truth!

160
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,823
I'll shoot her!

Sweden has an extradition agreement
with Denmark.

162
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:14,520
Robbery, possession of arms, and extortion
will get at least five years in prison.

163

What happens after that?

164
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,840
After prison, you'll be deported.

165
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,240
Taariq, no.
No, no. Taariq!

166
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,748
No!

167
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,969
We shouldn't have let him go.

168
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,440
He never understood we fleeced him.
It wasn't our fault.

169
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,078
I know. Knowing he'd be deported
made him kill himself. We couldn't...

170
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:41,097
But I let him go. We gave him hope,
and then we crushed him.

171
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:46,332
That we let him go didn't mean anything.
He would have killed himself in jail.

172
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:50,720
- Listen to Saga. It wasn't your fault.
- I feel guilty as hell.

173
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,440
It's counter-productive.
We couldn't have done anything.

174
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,038
To hell with that whole system.

175
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,800
A young, frustrated man.
Different values ...

176
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,960
- I know who hit me.
- You saw that it was Christoffer?

177
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,941
- No, but who else could it have been?
- Someone else.

178
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:17,320
So it's random that this happened
exactly when they moved in?

179
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,880
- Your son wanted the house.
- This isn't about that.

180
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:29,160
But yes! He should have moved in.
He would have respected the rules.

181
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,960
How do you know that
Sofie and Christoffer don't?

182
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,714
You're not going to throw them out.

183
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:41,855
No. What you're suggesting
makes me want to throw you out.

184
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:51,720
Hey.

185
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:04,200
- Is there anything to what he said?
- That depends on what he said.

186
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,938
There has been more trouble here
since they came.

187
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:11,684
Because people like Theo
are making them into troublemakers.

188
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:17,400
I think you need to remind them
what's expected to be welcome here.

189
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Okay.

I've been better.

193
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:41,040
Yeah, I can imagine.
It was a mistake letting him go.

194
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:44,678
But we just do what we're told, right?

195

Come on.

- Good.

The shop where the car was,
what do we know about it?

198
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,360
Three employees, but only the owner
has access to the keys.

199
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,680
Yeah, but if you work at a garage,
you can hotwire a car, right?

200

Check the workers. Why steal a car
in Sweden to kidnap someone in Copenhagen?

201
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,200
- Maybe the car means something.
- Or its owner.

- Are you sure?
- It was in her file.

211
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,915
So they knew each other.

212
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:56,245
Hey.

Hey, Bro.

- Look.
- Thanks. We just had to come.

216
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,596
So someone stole your car that night.

217
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,800
- And my phone and my wallet.
- What a pain.

218
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,122
- Where did you go?
- Just out.

219
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:39,400
- So why were the police interested?
- Someone said they saw the car.

220
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,800
- Saw it doing what?
- I don't know.

221
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,640
- But the car was at your place, right?
- Yeah, but...

222
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:49,800
- What?
- The keys were locked inside.

223
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:55,480
But if it was taken with
the extra keys... You had them.

224
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:03,480
Didn't you know that woman who died?

225
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,360
That woman who was stoned.
You knew her.

226
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:12,376
Yeah, we were in the same group.
I knew who she was, but that's it.

227
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,600
She tried to take your place
as Chairman, didn't she?

228
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,160
- Where'd you get that from?
- From Tobias, I think.

229
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,967
I assume he got it from Morgan.

230
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,194
- Hungry, huh?
- Yeah.

231
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,577
He just hangs there constantly.

232
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,800
And Tobias never gets permission
to play with them anymore.

233
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,920
I was actually doubting
whether I could breastfeed.

234
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,050
Because of the silicon.

235
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,520
- But it's going really well.
- That's nice.

Oh, sweetie.

There.

00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:33,457

- How do you know all this?
- A message from whoever poisoned her.

Find out what she was given

- Drive.
- Shouldn't we watch?

- But that doesn't mean...

No, we pay and get the antidote

Keep the finger off the trigger -

00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,680
Just shut up!

330
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,400
Quiet.

331
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,960
Hi.

332
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,240
We've found no poison. We found
traces of opioids in Leonora's blood.

333
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,160
- What is that?
- A strong tranquilizer.

334
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,080
It would explain her difficulty breathing
and her heart rhythm.

335
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,440
- She wasn't poisoned?
- No, not really.

336
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Her condition hasn't worsened
like it would if she were poisoned.

337
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,400
We've given her naloxone,
and it seems to be helping.

338
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,000
- I'd say she's out of danger now.
- Excuse me.

339
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,320
William!

340
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,840
- We got it. The antidote.
- She wasn't poisoned.

341
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,080
Leonora. Come on.

342
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,320
- Leonora. Come on.
- Honey!

343
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,320
- Honey!
- What's happening?

344
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,200
- Leonora?
- What the hell did you do?

345
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,520
We need some help!

346
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,240
Is there a doctor here?

347
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,680
- Leonora!
- Get away.

348
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,080
Commencing CPR.

349
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,120
- What do we have here?
- Cardiac arrest.

350
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,960
- 6, 7, 8, 9...
- 160.

351
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,920
Release.

352
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,320
- Defibrillating.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...

353
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,040
Adrenaline.

354
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,760
Asystolic.

355
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,120
Come on... Please.

356
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,240
Who was the first person you kissed?

357
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,280
Her name was Matilda Friberg.

358
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,840
She was in the class above me.

359
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,120
Okay. My turn.
I choose truth, too.

360
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,440
Was it you who hit Theo?

361
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,800
- No.
- Okay.

362
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,160
It was Agnes.

363
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,360
Why did you do that?
Or why did she do it?

364
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,640
No more questions.
Your turn.

365
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,120
- Dare.
- Wimp.

366
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,360
Your parents left you.
You grew up with your uncle.

367
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,600
He was a magician.

368
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,080
But you were his slave,
and one day you had enough.

369
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,600
Did I kill him?

370
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,760
You ran off and joined the circus.

371
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,960
And one night you sold your soul
to be the world's best magician -

372
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,720
- who could change reality.

373
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,680
Astrid, I don't know if...

374
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,320
Shh. It's not you.

375
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,880
It's fine.

376
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,160
It's not us.

377
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,560
How often do you think about
your little sister?

378
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,800
That depends.

379
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,920
- When did you think of her last?
- Yesterday.

380
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,920
Why?

381
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Two sisters showed up
in the investigation.

382
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,400
They're older, and they were closer
than me and Jennifer -

383
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,360
- but the older one really took care
of her little sister.

384
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,720
And you can recognize yourself in that?

385
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,280
No, she's a lot better at it
than I was.

386
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,200
Your mother, was she diagnosed
with Münchhausen by proxy?

387
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,880
You changed the subject.

388
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
- Did I?
- Yes.

389
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,040
Was she diagnosed?

390
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,880
No.

391
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,120
But you sent them to prison.
Both her and your father.

392
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,360
Yes, I acted on the information
I had at that time -

393
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,360
- and was forced to get
Jennifer out of there.

394
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,480
- So you took care of your sister.
- Not well enough.

395
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,200
- What do you think of your mother now?
- I don't think about her.

396
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,080
Not at all?

397
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Never?

398
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,680
Sometimes I'm forced to.
I got some boxes from her estate.

399
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,400
What was in them?

400
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,240
Memories of Jennifer.

401
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,960
Everything was from,
or rather about her.

402
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,320
Nothing about you?

403
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,000
No, I was cut out from the pictures
where we were together.

404
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,920
- How did you feel?
- I don't know.

405
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,160
Try to put it into words.

406
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,080
Why?
Can't we just continue?

407
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,760
Try. It's important.

408
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,000
It...

409
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,320
It didn't feel good.

410
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,360
Good.

411
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,480
Hey.

412
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,760
- Did it go well?
- She wasn't as concrete this time.

413
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,600
Have you found out more
about the people from the shop?

414
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,880
Yeah. Moyo Mayers is a drug offender.
The others are clean.

415
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,840
There's no connection to
Thormod, Dahlqvist, or Sonning.

416
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,880
We got an initial report
from Forensics on Sonning's car.

417
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,800
A hair was found, and the DNA results
are coming tomorrow. Car wasn't hotwired.

418
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,240
What Henrik means is Thormod
knew the person who called.

419
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,760
Why?

420
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,640
Because she left Taariq
to get into an unknown car.

421
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,600
Maybe they said they were from the police
and someone she knew was in the hospital.

422
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,400
- Hospital police don't send out cars.
- You think people think about that?

423
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,713
If I call you and say something happened
to your husband, would you hesitate?

424
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,280
- Yes, because I'm not married.
- But if you were married.

425
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,240
- Would you think it was strange?
- Yes.

426
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,440
Okay, of course you would, but...

427
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,440
So we don't know if Margrethe knew
the person who called or picked her up.

428
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,000
No.

429
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,240
I don't think we'll get further tonight.

430
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,840
- Want to come home?
- Are you going to cook?

431
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,680
- Will the girls be there?
- I assume so.

432
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
I'll eat, and then we'll see.

433
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,760
- Wow. You look nice.
- Thanks.

434
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,000
- Are you going out?
- Yeah.

435
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,240
With a man?

436
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm going to eat with Lars Rasmussen
from the prosecutor's office.

437
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,000
- Are you together?
- No, it's the first time.

438
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,800
- You didn't meet anyone after Hans?
- No.

439
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,520
- It was almost two years ago.
- I know that, Saga.

440
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,120
But surely you have sex
with someone or something.

441
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,520
- See you tomorrow.
- Have a really nice evening.

442
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,160
Hello?

443
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,760
Girls?

444
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,040
What the hell?

445
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,640
No...

446
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,720
The necklaces.
They fucking took them.

447
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,480
They fucking took everything.

448
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,200
I'm hungry.
Are you going to cook anyway?

449
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,360
- Am I... Am I going to do what?
- Are you going to cook?

450
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,920
No, I don't think I'm going
to do that right now, okay?

451
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,200
I'm going. I need to be alone
to mull things over.

452
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,080
- Mull what over? Our child?
- The embryo? No, I've already decided.

453
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,400
I've decided to get rid of it.

454
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,560
You've decided?

455
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,640
So why did you even tell me
if you didn't want to keep the child?

456
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,840
- I thought you'd want to know
- Know what?

457
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,200
That it's something I'd really want
but can't have?

458
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,480
- Why do you want it?
- Because it's ours. It's a child.

459
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,840
Not yet.

460
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,640
You think it can replace your daughters,
just like with those girls.

461
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,200
You're dead wrong.
Just go, and I'll see you tomorrow.

462
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,120
Bye!

463
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,400
- Hi. You're here.
- Yeah, but I'm leaving.

464
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,920
I can't do this.

465
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,680
- But you are here.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,400
I need to go.

467
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,320
You're looking for them, but not us.

468
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,760
- It's been a while, eh?
- What's up?

469
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,320
See ya.

470
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,400
I, Hans Torgny Pettersson,
take you, Lillian Larsen -

471
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,600
- to be my wife.

472
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,760
Lillian, I was unbelievably lucky
to have met you -

473
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,320
- and that you chose to be mine.

474
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,480
It wasn't luck.
It was a miracle.

475
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,400
Everything is so much easier
when we're together.

476
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,200
You are my true love
and my best friend.

477
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,480
What do you want?

478
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,800
I've thought it over about the child.

479
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,040
- Okay.
- I don't want to have it.

480
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,960
But you do. So I think I'll give birth,
and then I'll give it to you.

481
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,800
You'll give it to me?

482
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,960
I'll sign away all rights and duties.

483
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,320
You'll have custody. I'll have nothing
else to do with it. What do you think?

484
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,680
What about you?

485
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,400
- Where are you in all this?
- Nowhere.

486
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,600
The child becomes yours, not mine.
And we can have sex sometimes.

487
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,640
Mull it over.

488
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,480
- I will.
- Good.

489

490
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,000
Do you want to stay here?

491
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,040
I could really use your company.

[ Jacuzzi Murder Connected
to Stoning in Denmark ]

When you were out...
When you were robbed.

494
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,320
What were you really doing?

495
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,760
The alarm company called.
The alarm went off at work.

496
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,360
- What happened?
- Nothing, it seems.

497
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,800
It was just a false alarm.

00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,160
- Did you notice the baby today?
- No, what about it?

500
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,120
It's too bad people don't have
more training in biology.

501
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,000
Then maybe your brother
might have wondered -

502
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,840
- why their baby has brown eyes -

503
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,680
- even though he and Nicole
both have blue eyes.

504
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,520
- And that doesn't make sense?
- No, sweetie. It doesn't.

505
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,000
Nicole was fucking around.

506
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,040
- Fuck.
- What a surprise, huh?

507
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,000
Good morning.

508
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,360
William Ramberg killed his daughter
in Malmo last night.

509
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,960
- What does he have to do with us?
- A hospital clown was involved.

510
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,440
- Is Ramberg here?
- Go question him at the hospital.

511
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,840
If you can.

512
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,960
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

513
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,280
Do Margrethe Thormod or Patrik Dahlqvist
mean anything to you?

514
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,360
William.
Have a look at these photos.

515
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,720
Do you recognize either of them?

516
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,560
- I killed her.
- We know that.

517
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,640
But do you recognize either of them?

518
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,520
I thought she was poisoned.

519
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,880
Why did you think that?

520
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,080
Patrik was a clown at the same hospital.

521
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,960
So maybe he was the real victim
and not his brother.

522
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,920
So we think there's a connection
between Margrethe, Patrik, and Leonora?

523
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,960
- A 12-year-old girl is unlikely.
- William is hard to hit.

524
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,520
So they get his daughter instead.

525
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,080
So a connection between
Margrethe, Patrik, and William.

526
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,600
- Is there one?
- We haven't found one yet.

527
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,120
- Hello, it's Henrik.
- Hey, it's Kevin.

528
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,200
- Sorry if I'm disturbing you.
- That's fine, Kevin. What's up?

529
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,120
You didn't come yesterday.
To the meeting.

530
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,120
It was a hard night,
but everything is okay.

531
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,560
You know you can always call
if you're having a hard time.

532
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,160
There's no danger.
I'll get through it.

533
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,040
- Nothing happened.
- You know that...

534
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,160
You're the only one who's really
right in the head here.

535
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,120
I missed you.

536
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,360
- Thanks for thinking about me.
- Yeah, of course.

537
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,280
I promise not to miss any more meetings.

538
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,240
- See ya.
- Yeah, see ya. Take care of yourself.

539
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,160
Bye.

540
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,640
Hey. I thought we'd go in the forest
so we could hunt for real.

541
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,200
Sure, but I don't know
if I want to kill an animal.

542
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,440
You don't need to.
You can just enjoy being out in nature.

543
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,920
Okay.

544
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,800
Christoffer?

545
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,840
Is that you, Frank?

546
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,440
Hi, Sofie.

547
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,360
- Sorry you had to wait.
- What did you find?

548
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,720
She was poisoned, as we know.
A fast-working neurotoxin.

549
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:03,360
Hundreds of different toxins.
All peptides.

550
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,760
Small proteins that block ion channels.

551
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,720
They stopped the nerve signals
to the muscles -

552
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,960
- including the heart.
That's what she died of.

553
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,480
The poison Leonora died of
probably came from a cone snail.

554
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,720
- Where are they found?
- In coral reefs.

555
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,040
Or aquariums, or laboratories
where medicine is made from the poison.

556
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,640
Is anyone in our investigation
connected to the pharmaceutical industry?

557
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,680
- Not that we know of.
- The video?

558
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:48,600
Sent from a phone we can't trace.
But nothing reveals the person's identity.

559
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,520
- But there are some dead pixels.
- Which are?

560
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,720
It's exactly what it sounds like.
Look at this.

561
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,480
The small black squares are dead pixels.

562
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,080
- How does that help us?
- Not at all right now.

563
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,720
But if we find the camera,
it's like a fingerprint.

564
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,880
So that video made William
kill his daughter.

565
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,680
The two others killed the perpetrator
themselves.

566
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,360
Maybe they're not working together.
We just think that -

567
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,160
- because Margrethe and Richard
had a connection to Red October.

568
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,280
If Patrik was the real victim,
then that connection doesn't matter.

569
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,680
So the victims aren't connected.
Three totally different methods.

570
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,840
- Could it be the same perpetrator?
- Stoning.

571
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,680
Electricity.

572
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,000
Poison.

573
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,920
All three are methods of execution
for the death penalty.

574
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,760
- How many different methods are there?
- Seven around the world.

575
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,520
Those on the board, shooting,
hanging, gas, and beheading.

576
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,040
So there's four left.

577
