00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:03,310
EPISODE 6

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Niels Thormod.
I'm a psychologist.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,600
- Will you tell me your names?
- We want to talk to Henrik.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,600
We saw the guy we took the phone from.
The murderer.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,880
- Can't you just go?
- Did you really think you could hide?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,560
Leave my family alone.
Understand?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,200
We're going to go home and get Mom.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,200
We need to shift focus. The horse was
directed at Vibeke. Leonora, at William.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,960
I want to find that fucker
who killed Leonora.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,865
The victims aren't the victims.
It's the ones closest to them who suffer.

11
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:45,865
We need to find a connection between them.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,560
- Is it the baby?
- I had an abortion.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,360
Henrik.
I think I'm in love with you.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,320
You're not in love with me because
you can't love. Now get out.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Lillian!
I think I've found the link.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,840
It's Tommy.
It's all about Tommy.

17
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:24,076
FIVE YEARS EARLIER

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,480
Tommy!

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,760
Hey, hey.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,240
Something came up.
Do you have a smoke?

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
What's up?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,720
KG went into William's turf.
We're going there this afternoon.

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,600
- What's going to happen?
- He's pushing them out.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,600
- When?
- We're meeting at their clubhouse at 4PM.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,800
How are you going to get them to leave?

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,040
- I just know that William's pissed.
- Is William going?

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,640
I couldn't ask him directly,
but I assume so.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,360
Okay. I'll talk to Lillian.

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,560
- You're coming?
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,280
I mean it.
I need to get out of this.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,680
Tommy, you're going to get out.
I'm going to take care of it.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,840
Okay.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,880
KG is on the way into William's turf.
It could be violent.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,440
It could also be nothing.

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,680
A business meeting.
Two men talking together.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
- Tommy didn't mean that.
- He didn't know, either.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,080
Is William going to be there at all?

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,680
If we show up, they might think
we have an informer there.

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,360
- We wait.
- Tommy's counting on us.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
We need to be 100% sure.

41
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,280
Otherwise, months of work are wasted.

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,280
- Henrik promised Tommy we'd come.
- Then he's going to break that promise.

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,800
We wait to see what happens.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,280
Okay.

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Hi, honey.

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,480
- Is there going to be a party?
- Where have you been?

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,080
- You know I can't tell you.
- Or you don't want to.

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,520
I wasn't here, anyway.

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,280
- I miss you all the time.
- Yeah, sure.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,840
- Put that on the gift table.
- But it's for you.

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,040
- You're really sucking up, huh?
- Exactly.

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,800
Is it working?

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,560
Because I saw it and thought
that you usually like it.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I want to say happy birthday to Brian.
We'll just go out so we don't bother you.

55
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,480
- You can just help, too.
- No, I can't.

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,360
There's way too many treats.
I can't keep my hands to myself.

57
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,240
- Where is he?
- He's in the bedroom.

58
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,720
Brian! Your dad is here.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
Hi, Dad.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,400
Hi, my boy.

61
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,640
Congrats. Put your jacket on.
We're going out.

62
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,880
When I turned 17, I wanted a motorcycle.
Dad gave me a chain lock.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,960
My dad thought it was a good start.

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,760
Grandma's coming this afternoon.

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,320
- Are you staying?
- No, I have to take care of something.

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,120
But say hi for me.

67
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,200
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

68
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Yeah, we're going to Manchester.
To a home game.

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,120
- Old Trafford. You and me.
- What? We are?

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,080
- No, thanks.
- Hello! Didn't you turn 17?

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,160
It's just a joint.

72
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,880
You can't say anything to Mom.

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,520
I know there's been all sorts of shit
these last years -

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,440
- but it's going to be better now.

75
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
- What are you doing?
- Nothing you need to be mixed up in.

76
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,640
- Is it dangerous?
- No, of course not.

77
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,640
But it ends today.
Hey, Moyo!

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,880
What's up?

79
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Not a bad birthday, eh?

80
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,360
Where the fuck are you?
It's about to go to hell here.

81
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,160
What's going on, man?

82
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,840
Shoot!

83
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,360
Shoot!

84
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Hey, hey, hey. Easy now.

85
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,080
Henrik!

86
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,920
Why the fuck didn't you come?
You said you were coming.

87
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,880
Because the others wanted to wait.
I couldn't do anything.

88
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,760
- You fucking had them. They were there.
- I tried. The others didn't want to.

89
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,760
They wanted more information.
I couldn't do shit.

90
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
People died.

91
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,400
The guys that came out, they...

92
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,240
We shot them.

93
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,880
How many?

94
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,960
A lot.
There was blood everywhere.

95
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
Shit, man.

96
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm done here.
I'm getting out now.

97
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay, okay. Tommy,
you just need to stay a little longer.

98
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,640
Because we need to get William
and the people above him.

99
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,108
- You'll get money, a new identity.
- Fuck you.

100
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:41,237
- We're going to take care of you.
- Fuck you.

101
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,600
Now we're just waiting
for them to retaliate.

102
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,440
I can't do this anymore.
I told him. They won't listen.

103
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
What would happen if you stopped?

104
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,040
Then the whole deal's off.
Then it's prison and all that shit.

105
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,800
I can't do this anymore.
Can't you say I'm mentally unstable?

106
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
That I can't continue if I'm sick?

107
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,040
I understand you're afraid, and
I understand you don't want to continue.

108
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,200
I understand you have regrets.
But I can't say that you can't do it.

109
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,360
I can make sure you get a prescription
for some sedatives.

110
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Is it because the police pay for me
to be here? Are you afraid to lose money?

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,320
No, I just can't say you have a diagnosis.
It won't work.

112
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,840
- I thought you wanted to help me.
- Yeah, I'm trying to.

113
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,240
Go fuck yourself, you fucking fool.

114
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,280
- Tommy? Tommy?
- Are you Richard?

115
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,320
- You wanted to talk about something.
- Yeah, I want to talk about something.

116
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,080
- I'm just going to start this here.
- Yeah, that's fine.

117
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,209
[ SIX DEAD IN GANG WAR
POLICE INFORMED BUT DIDN'T ACT. ]

118
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,240
For fuck's sake.

119
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,280
- Can I do anything?
- Like what?

120
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,040
It wasn't your decision.

121
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,520
- You think that makes a difference?
- Yeah, it should.

122
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,400
- Yeah?
- Did you read it?

123
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,120
We need to bring Tommy in.
They're going to kill him.

124
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,920
We know it was Tommy,
but the article didn't expose him.

125
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,240
It said, "The informant nervously
breaks the filter from his cigarette."

126
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,160
Tommy always does that.
He breaks the filter off.

127
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,680
Okay. We'll take him in. Go there.
I'll call for backup.

128
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,200
- This is Moyo.
- Yeah, it's me.

129
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,880
William wanted to meet.
I need to ask for your help.

130
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,840
You know the farm. There's a stop
at the end of the main road.

131
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,880
Just to the left.

132
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Wait there with the car.
I may need to leave in a hurry.

133
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,200
Fuck, Tommy, what's this about?

134
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,080
Just wait there. I'll call you.
Can you be there in 15 minutes?

135
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,480
Okay.

136
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,760
Okay. I need to go now.

137
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,320
And Moyo? Thanks.

138
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,840
Looks cool.

139
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,400
It turned out really good.

140
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,240
Where are the others?

141
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,160
They're coming.
Sit down.

142
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,920
- Something to eat?
- No, thanks.

143
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,840
- What are we doing now?
- We need to find out who it is.

144
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,280
And how much he told the police.

145
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,240
So...

146
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,640
Everyone knows
what happens to an informer.

147
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,880
- I need to piss. Is there a...?
- Out in the hall.

148
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,000
No, no, no!

149
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,760
Come on, for fuck's sake!

150
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,840
Are you done pissing?

151
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:41,103
THE BRIDGE IV

152
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:47,583
NOW

153
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,840
We should have seen the connection.

154
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Yeah.

155
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,680
- Who is Tommy?
- Lillian can explain.

156
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,960
Who is it?

157
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,200
Tommy Petersen. Criminal and informer.
Promised a reduced sentence.

158
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,480
He was caught, tortured, and murdered.

159
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,120
And Henrik was his contact.

160
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,360
I understand why you were criticized.

161
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,040
The case was investigated.
No one was to blame for what happened.

162
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,080
That doesn't mean you didn't
make mistakes. Six people died.

163
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,080
- Seven including Tommy.
- Hi, Henrik.

164
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
Let's concentrate on Tommy's family.
They have the strongest motive.

165
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,880
Nicole Johansson. The car is connected
to her husband's garage.

166
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,840
What's he doing there?

167
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,640
That's Tommy and Nicole's son, Brian.
He's 21 and in a wheelchair.

168
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,040
Henrik, where are you going?

169
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,400
- Let's keep going.
- Solveig Petersen. We know her.

170
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,840
- Yes, what do we know about her?

171
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,280
Tommy's mother. She's still looking
to bring Tommy's killers to justice.

172
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,240
Most recently, at the Human Rights Court.

173
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,480
- And where is she located now?
- She lives in a camper. No phone.

174
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,720
We'll put out a bulletin on the camper.
What do we know about Brian Petersen?

175
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,280
Hi, Henrik.
What are you doing here?

176
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,960
What the fuck are you up to?
Your name isn't Kevin.

177
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,480
You're pretending you're my friend.
Maybe you can walk, too?

178
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,320
Can you?
Can you walk?

179
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,560
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Come on. Walk!

180
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,960
What the fuck are you doing?

181
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,440
Okay, sorry.
Sorry. Here.

182
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,880
- Come on.
- No, stop.

183
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,920
Just go inside. I'm from the police.
Nothing happened.

184
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
Just go inside. Here.

185
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,720
- It's okay.
- We're just talking.

186
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,440
Your name isn't Kevin.

187
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,800
No, well...

188
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,120
I wanted to be anonymous at the meetings.
Not use my real name. Lots of people do.

189
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
What are you doing at those
NA meetings? Why do you come?

190
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,320
You know I'm trying not to do drugs!

191
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,960
Tommy? Tommy Petersen?

192
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,320
- What about him?
- Yeah, what about him?

193
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,400
- What does it have to do with my dad?
- Where were you on the 28th?

194
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,240
- Why?
- Because I'm asking.

195
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,480
I was home. I didn't do anything.
I played on the computer.

196
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,320
- Alone?
- Yeah.

197
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,640
- What about the night of the 29th?
- I was home then, too.

198
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,720
Alone.

199
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay.

200
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,680
Henrik!

201
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,760
- What are we doing?
- We're going to chop wood.

202
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,520
Chop wood? Seriously?

203
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,400
- We need to help each other.
- But they don't like us.

204
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,600
- Not me, anyway.
- That's not true, Christoffer.

205
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,760
Theo wanted the house for his son,
then we came along.

206
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,000
It's our fault, you mean?
You take the blame for everything.

207
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,200
I want to go back to my old class.

208
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,360
- It won't work now that we live here.
- Then we can move back.

209
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,200
Now that Dan is...

210
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,440
Yeah, maybe.
Come on.

211
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,000
You don't think it was
the last break-in we'll have?

212
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,480
We have open doors. We trust each other.
That's how we do it.

213
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,320
If someone can't deal with that,
they shouldn't live here.

214
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,720
It's not about whether we like them.

215
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,600
It's about our values and peace of mind.

216
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,560
We need to react
before the whole town goes to...

217
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,400
- We wanted to help.
- What?

218
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,800
- We wanted to help with the wood.
- Go ahead.

219
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,720
Hi.

220
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,560
He doesn't have an alibi for the 28th and
29th. Same for Patrik's killing.

221
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,880
- But he's in a wheelchair.
- Thanks, I know that.

222
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,400
- He has an alibi for the clown and horse.
- I'll double-check.

223
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,240
Three executions left. If the motive is
revenge for Tommy, you may be victims.

224
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,800
Are you sure he needs everyone?

225
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,640
We need to find the others
who betrayed Tommy.

226
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,720
Who's closest to you?
Family, siblings?

227
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,120
Sex partner?
That guy from the Prosecution Service?

228
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,560
I don't know. There's actually no one
I'm that close to anymore.

229
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,280
- You love no one and no one loves you?
- Not that I can think of, no.

230
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,680
You're the closest to Henrik.

231
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,880
- Maybe.
- Then you need a bodyguard.

232
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,920
- I don't want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

233
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,240
Beheading and hanging I can take care of.
A bodyguard won't help if they shoot me.

234
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,640
But all precautions from now on.
Start by questioning Nicole.

235
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,640
- I want to look into Kevin.
- You mean Brian.

236
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,720
- I want to see if what he said is true.
- But his name is Brian.

237
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Okay.

238
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,800
But I've left that all behind me.
My old life with Tommy.

239
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,560
- We just want to check some dates.
- You should talk to Solveig.

240
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,440
- Tommy's mother.
- Do you know where she's located?

241
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,760
No, I don't want to know, either,
because she's a real bitch. Right?

242
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,320
- Yeah, she's real special.
- How was your and Tommy's relationship?

243
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
Well, he was totally hopeless.

244
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,800
But you were always happy and carefree
when he was around.

245
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,120
- If you know what I mean.
- No.

246
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,960
No, but it never would've
worked out anyway.

247
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,640
I think he was seeing someone else
at the end.

248
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,000
- Do you know her name?
- No, because I'm not sure.

249
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,560
I just need to go to the bathroom.

250
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,840
Would you like to hold him?

251
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,240
- How old is it?
- Almost seven months.

252
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,600
It's so big.

253
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:32,360
Was she in pain, your wife?
Did she have abdominal cramps?

254
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,080
Did she give birth vaginally?

255
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,880
Yeah, she did, but...
I don't know.

256
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,320
- Who's the father?
- I am.

257
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,400
- No, you're not.
- What the hell do you mean?

258
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:52,600
The baby has brown eyes, and you both
have blue. It's physically impossible.

259
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,240
That was stupid.

260
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,520
Yeah, they weren't too crazy about it.

261
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,440
But now we have someone
who fucked around in this case.

262
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,360
- Should I go back and say I'm sorry?
- No, I think it's too late.

263
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,800
Do you understand now
why I don't do smalltalk with you?

264
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,360
- What are you doing?
- Providing security.

265
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,160
- What nonsense.
- If it stops break-ins, is it stupid?

266
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,200
Does Harriet know you've started
your own little security service?

267
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,720
If she listened,
it wouldn't be necessary.

268
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,040
Go home.

269
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,200
Hey.

270
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,920
Hey.

271
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,600
I talked to Christoffer.

272
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,080
- More problems with Theo?
- No, absolutely not. But...

273
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,240
He misses his old school.

274
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,760
The commute is too far from here.

275
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,720
- To his old school?
- Yeah.

276
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,320
So we thought that maybe
we could move back.

277
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,920
To Malmo.

278
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,400
So Dan can find you?

279
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,200
You're safe here.

280
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,880
Christoffer told me, Frank.
I know what happened.

281
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm so grateful.

282
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,040
For everything you've done
to protect him and us.

283
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,040
Is this gratitude? You just leave
when you don't need me anymore.

284
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,680
He shot his father.

285
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,480
He'd be in prison
if it wasn't for me.

286
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,120
I made myself an accomplice
in a murder for your sake.

287
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:30,560
But he wants to go back to school, so you
just go. Is that fair after all I've done?

288
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,560
- No.
- No, it's not.

289
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,040
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
I'm sorry.

290
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,440
I've done it before.
Helped people who shit all over me.

291
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,720
We're not shitting on you. Without you,
we'd never have managed.

292
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,200
We'll stay.
Of course we'll stay.

293
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
Good.

294
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,400
How did you betray Tommy?

295
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,840
The last time I saw him,
he was upset and scared.

296
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,440
He wanted out and asked for help.

297
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,720
- With what?
- Talking with you. The police.

298
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,800
Declaring him unfit.
Mentally ill.

299
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,320
I couldn't do it.

300
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,480
But I made sure sedatives
were prescribed.

301
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,480
- Did he mention a lover?
- No.

302
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,240
Other relatives besides his mother,
son, and wife?

303
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,160
No, not that I can remember.

304
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,240
If there's someone...

305
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,920
...getting revenge on the people
who betrayed Tommy...

306
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,160
Does that mean it's my fault
that Margrethe was murdered?

307
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,120
Yes, she was an innocent victim
used to get at you.

308
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,640
Yeah. Jonas Mandrup.

309
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,920
This is Tobias Johansson.

310
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,280
I just wanted to say that...

311
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,640
My wife has the code to the key cabinet
at the garage.

312
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,040
She's borrowed cars before.

313
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,080
No, not you! Why did you go and
destroy everything, you ugly bitch?

314
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,360
Hey! Take it easy.
I'll take this questioning.

315
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,640
Sit down.

316
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,480
- I'm going to fucking report her.
- Yeah, you do that.

317
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,160
The Swedes like being reprimanded.
But we're not talking about that now.

318
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,560
We have evidence that you left
the hospital the night of the 28th.

319
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,880
From who?

320
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,480
From Tobias?

321
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,160
Yeah, okay. That's right.

322
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,520
I went home -

323
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,960
- because it wasn't necessary
for us both to be there.

324
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,760
That's the only alibi you have.

325
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,520
Do you know what you did this week?

326
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,880
No, but that's why people
have a calendar, right?

327
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,440
I don't need a calendar.
I don't do anything. I'm only with Sonny.

328
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,600
I breastfeed, then he wakes up,
and then he shits -

329
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,320
- and then I change diapers,
and then I clean up vomit.

330
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,520
It's nothing I need to
write in a calendar.

331
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,240
No. So you don't have an alibi?

332
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm coming!

333
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,920
It's you?

334
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,200
- You fucking destroyed everything!
- What's going on?

335
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,680
You can ask your husband about that.

336
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,960
- I checked Kevin's journal.
- His name is Brian.

337
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,560
- You know what I mean.
- Yes, but his name...

338
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,520
- Do you understand who I'm talking about?
- Yes.

339
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,520
Good. So stop.
He's wheelchair-bound.

340
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,960
He fell from a balcony. He was on drugs.
He couldn't commit those murders.

341
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,120
And we checked all his accounts
and cell phones.

342
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,680
Both Nicole's and Brian's.
Nothing stands out.

343
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,040
So what do we do with
white trash wife and her baby?

344
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,000
We keep her. No alibis,
access to the car, strong motive.

345
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,880
- Solveig Petersen?
- We haven't found her yet. Let's go.

346
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,760
Henrik, Saga?
Come with me.

347
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,600
What the hell is with you two?

348
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,400
He's angry at me
because I had an abortion.

349
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,200
You were pregnant with Henrik's...?

350
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Yes. I had an abortion because
it would've come between us.

351
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,720
- Can you work together?
- Yes.

352
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,880
I need both of you for this.

353
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,760
So I expect you to act professionally
and keep your private lives outside.

354
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,560
Okay.

355
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,560
For your sake.

356
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,680
It's easy to be wise in retrospect,
but you could've handled it better.

357
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,360
Yes. I just tried to appreciate
what I have.

358
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
Thanks.

359
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,960
You can't blame yourself.
What should you have done?

360
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,000
- Should you have lied for Tommy?
- I could have done something.

361
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,880
He was desperate and what did I do?
I gave him some sedatives.

362
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,480
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to the girls.

363
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,400
But they don't want to talk to you.

364
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,400
No, they need me.
I know I can help them.

365
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,560
This time I'll do it right.

366
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,840
I know what you're thinking,
that this is just my job.

367
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,880
But it means something to me,
and I'd like to help you.

368
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,320
I can make sure you have it better.
I can make sure you get out of here.

369
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,440
- You just need to tell me your names.
- What do we get out of it?

370
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,720
We want to go to the movies.

371
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,960
I'd like that too,
but this isn't a negotiation.

372
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,200
Decide if you want to talk to me,
and ask the staff to contact me.

373
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,040
It's up to you now.
I'd like to help you.

374
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,240
He's a bit like Henrik.
I think he's sweet.

375
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,440
Sweet people can be useful.

376
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,720
How?

377
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,960
If he thinks we trust him,
he'll trust us.

378
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,720
When we get the chance,
we take off.

379
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,480
Bye.

380
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,320
- Yeah?
- It's Douglas. Can we meet?

381
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,520
- Of course. When?
- Just come.

382
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,120
- What's this about?
- It's best that we meet.

383
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,360
Okay. I'll try for tonight.

384
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,600
Good. See you later. Bye.

385
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,360
You said you know how
to resolve the conflict with Henrik?

386
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,240
Yes. I'll find his daughters.

387
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,200
And you think that will
resolve something?

388
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,800
Then he can't be disappointed
and angry with me.

389
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,880
- Why wouldn't he be?
- Then he'll have children. His own.

390
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,320
Do you feel guilty about the abortion?

391
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,880
No, but I didn't know
Henrik would react the way he did.

392
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
If you had known that,
would you have handled it differently?

393
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,800
It wouldn't have made a difference.

394
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,080
If Henrik had had the child,
we couldn't have been together.

395
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,200
- But now you want to make it all better?
- Yes.

396
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,840
- By finding his daughters.
- Yes.

397
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,480
Do you see the pattern?

398
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,800
I want you to think about it
for next time.

399
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,000
I'll walk you out.
I'm going out to another patient.

400
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,440
Not everyone can come to me,
so I go to them.

401
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,400
What are you doing?

402
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,520
I live here.
I can't live at Henrik's -

403
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,800
- and it's not safe at the hotel,
so I live here.

404
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,320
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Goodnight.

405
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,480
Make a list of people you'd really miss.
They need to be protected.

406
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,840
Okay. Thanks.

407
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,920
You're welcome.

408
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,800
Goodnight.

409
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,560
- Can't you just turn it off?
- No, I can't.

410
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,400
- Seriously?
- Yeah. What do you want?

411
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,320
Alice paid taxes on personal benefits
the year before she disappeared.

412
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,040
- Yeah?
- Something about wellness and health.

413
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,040
- Do you know what it was?
- No.

414
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,000
Did she talk to a psychologist
or therapist at work?

415
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,040
I don't know.
She didn't tell me, anyway.

416
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,560
- Hang up.
- Who's that?

417
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,960
Her name's Tanja.

418
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,600
- Are you having sex?
- We are.

419
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,120
And we're going to continue now.

420
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,200
Come on.

421
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,200
It's Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
I contacted you about Alice Sabroe.

422
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,760
Yes, it's...

423
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,440
11:56PM.

424
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,520
No, it can't wait until tomorrow.

425
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,480
I want to know about benefits
Alice used for health and wellness.

426
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,800
You didn't have therapists there.
Could she have talked to someone else?

427
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,640
Do you remember his name?

428
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,440
What do you want?
I told you everything about Dan and Sofie.

429
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,880
This is about another case.
Alice Sabroe.

430
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You were her coach
when you worked at Parsimonia.

431
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,320
Yeah. It was a long time ago.
She disappeared.

432
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,600
You reacted to my colleague's surname.
Why didn't you ask about Alice?

433
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,960
I didn't know how much she told him,
and we have a confidentiality agreement.

434
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,200
- Did she come back?
- No, she was found murdered.

435
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,080
That's terrible.
What about the children?

436
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,040
- They haven't been found.
- I have a daughter myself.

437
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,760
Okay. Come with me.

438
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,720
- What did you usually talk about?
- Mostly about her home life.

439
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,960
About her husband, Henrik.

440
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,800
What did she say about him?

441
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,960
That it wasn't going well. I suggested
couple's therapy. Alice didn't want to.

442
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,360
Why not?

443
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,360
She'd met another man.

444
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,520
- Did she mention his name?
- No, she didn't.

445
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,280
I think she was considering
leaving her husband.

446
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,280
Could she have mentioned him, and
you forgot you wrote it down?

447
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,720
Yeah. I'll look at my notes
and see if I can find anything.

448
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,120
Do that. And call me.

449
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,360
Okay.

450
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,120
Hi.

451
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,520
I'm happy you wanted
to see me again.

452
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,480
I assume you don't trust adults.

453
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,880
Is that something
you want to talk about?

454
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,400
Our stepdad.

455
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,080
We couldn't stay there.

456
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,080
- Does he live here in Copenhagen?
- Jutland. We don't want to go back.

457
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,360
Do you want to explain
why you don't want to go back?

458
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,800
He wasn't very nice.

459
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,840
What's his name?

460
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,360
My name is Julie.

461
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,680
And this is my little sister, Ida.

462
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,680
Julie and Ida.

463
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,560
That's really nice.

464
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,760
We got a match on Solveig's car.
She's on the way.

465
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:50,520
Alice met a coach at work.
He wasn't an employee, but I found him...

466
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,640
Is this leading anywhere?

467
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,554
If she had someone else,
would you want to know?

468
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,240
- Did she?
- Yes, but the coach didn't know who.

469
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,280
- Are you sure?
- Not 100%.

470
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,840
If you don't have evidence,
then don't tell me that.

471
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,000
- Easy.
- Let me go!

472
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,480
- It's easier if you cooperate.
- Go with my colleague...

473
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,640
- Who's questioning her?
- You and me.

474
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,400
Lillian would really like us
to do it together.

475
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,920
Good.

476
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,840
Where were you on the 28th?

477
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,680
Figure it out yourselves.

478
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,280
Write where you were on these dates.

479
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,200
Oh, now you want to talk to me, huh?

480
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,640
When I wanted to contact you after
Tommy's death, I didn't feel very welcome.

481
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,680
- I didn't work on that case.
- No, but he did.

482
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,200
You have a strong motive for revenge.

483
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,120
When society betrays you, you need to
take the law into your own hands.

484
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,120
Is that what you did?

485
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,800
Not at all. I'm just happy
someone's avenging Tommy's death.

486
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,440
The people that did it deserve it.

487
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,840
We're going to keep you until
you give us what we need.

488
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,080
So we'll start again.
Where were you on the 28th?

489
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,800
- Saga, it's me. I found a letter.
- Good.

490
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,760
From Tommy to his mother. He mentions
a Steph. They had a relationship.

491
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,760
How does it feel to know
that you're next?

492
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,840
- Are you threatening me?
- No.

493
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
But with them out of the way
it'll be your turn soon.

494
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,720
- Tommy wrote letters to you.
- Did you mess with my things?

495
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,280
- We have a search warrant.
- It's my private property.

496
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,040
If you're suspected of a crime
punishable by imprisonment -

497
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,560
- a search must be undertaken
to look for evidence in the case.

498
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,880
Tommy mentioned a Steph in the letters.
Who is that?

499
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,680
Why should I tell you?

500
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,720
Steph, is that a man or a woman?

501
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,760
- Steph? It's a man.
- It's a man?

502
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,160
No, wait a minute.
I think it's a woman.

503
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,160
It's a woman?

504
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,800
Was there anything else
I can help you with?

505
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,040
Why did you go?

506
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,320
We decided that we would
act professional together.

507
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,280
Malene Sonning has a daughter
named Stephanie.

508
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,440
Stephanie Balling, 33.
Daughter of Malene and Peder Balling.

509
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,200
Volunteered in Colombia,
but came home three months ago.

510
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,640
- Address?
- She hasn't registered an address.

511
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,760
That's all we have on her.

512
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,680
If it's Morgan you're after,
you'll have to talk to my divorce lawyer.

513
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,480
We're here because of
your daughter, Stephanie.

514
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,280
- Stephanie?
- Do you know where she is?

515
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
She's in Colombia.
Did something happen?

516
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,360
She came home three months ago.

517
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,080
You didn't know she came home?

518
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,360
No, I didn't.

519
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,760
Do you know if she had a relationship
with Tommy Petersen four years ago?

520
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,160
I didn't even know
she came home.

521
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,800
Do you think she tells me
about her boyfriends?

522
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,320
- Does she have keys to the house?
- Yeah.

523
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,720
You were the one who figured it out about
Morgan and Nicole and the baby, huh?

524
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,760
Yes, and I'm sorry for that.

525
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,320
You don't need to be.
It was good for me to know.

526
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,320
- Yeah, was there anything else?
- No. Thanks.

527
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,680
Thanks.

528
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,840
Stephanie could've taken the extra key to
Morgan's car when they were in Hamburg.

529
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,320
- Why then?
- She needed a car. They didn't get along.

530
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,760
Her mail is being sent to Christiania.

531
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,480
We have surveillance there.
No news.

532
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,360
Hello? Yeah.

533
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,040
Okay. I'm coming down.

534
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,560
Kevin.

535
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,160
Hey.

536
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,800
- Sorry if I'm disturbing.
- It's okay.

537
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:52,000
We're friends.
I mean, you mean something to me.

538
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,440
Then you come and rip me out of my chair
and ask what I've done -

539
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:02,080
- and talk about my dad...
What the fuck is going on?

540
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:08,440
We think the killings we're investigating
are connected to your father.

541
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,400
Why do you think that?

542
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,120
Do you know anything
about a Stephanie or a Steph?

543
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,200
- Someone in contact with your father.
- No.

544
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,440
- Did you ask Grandma?
- Yeah, we tried, but...

545
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,280
It was hopeless.

546
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,920
What about Moyo, my dad's friend?

547
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,440
- The guy who works in the shop in Malmo?
- Yeah.

548
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,920
My mom helped him
get a job at Tobias' place.

549
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,000
Okay.

550
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,680
Thanks, my...
For coming here, too.

551
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,200
How are you doing really?

552
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,840
- Did you fall off the wagon again?
- No.

553
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,480
See you at the next meeting.

554
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,960
Of course. See ya.

555
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,800
What was your relationship to Tommy?

556
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,360
Me and Tommy were like brothers.
We had big plans.

557
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,680
Then it all went to hell.
It was your fault.

558
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,360
What did you do after Tommy's death?

559
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,600
Sandra and I moved to Sweden
to get away from it all.

560
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,560
Then Nicole got me a job at the shop.

561
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,240
- Are you almost finished with that?
- I haven't done anything.

562
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,200
It's fucking unreal that you all got off.
But I have Sandra, and I won't lose her.

563
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:50,040
Sandra, Sandra, and Sandra. Convenient.
Your wife is your only alibi.

564
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,520
- We're good together.
- Are you?

565
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,600
Then maybe I'll go talk to her
while you stay there.

566
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,800
Can you let me out?

567
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:40,240
I dreamed about you a few nights ago.
It was a long time ago.

568
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,000
And I was happy to see you.

569
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,400
Astrid.

570
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,920
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

571
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,600
- Why are you speaking Danish?
- I wasn't.

572
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,920
I heard you.

573
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,280
It wasn't me.
It was Magdalena.

574
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,400
- But you aren't dressed up.
- One doesn't always need to be.

575
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:09,572
[ Anna. Beloved daughter.
Beloved sister. ]

576
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,240
Is that your sister?

577
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,360
Don't tell anyone.
Not to Frank or your mother.

578
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,640
- Okay?
- Okay.

579
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,920
Hello?

580
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,200
Sandra?

581
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,400
I'm from the police.

582
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,880
Hello?

583
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Hello?

584
00:58:08,221 --> 00:58:13,221
