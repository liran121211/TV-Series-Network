1
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:38,008
Strange

2
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:53,988
What the hell...

3
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:47,728
The Bridge

4
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:02,520
Episode 1

5
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,832
It's over there.

6
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:31,380
The phone's ringing.

7
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,416
Don't take it.

8
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:39,952
- It's Saga.
- It's her or me.

9
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:48,840
Hans Pettersson. I can't answer right now,
but leave a message. Thanks.

10
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:53,288
It's 7:37. According to our agreement,
I can call after 7:00.

11
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm at a crime scene. Call as soon
as you can.

12
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:54,700
Saga. I have the pictures from
the murder scene.

13
00:05:55,016 --> 00:06:00,228
It's probably just a crime scene.
She was killed somewhere else.

14
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,712
Okay. I have the pictures.

15
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,462
Have you gotten the surveillance videos?

16
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,856
They're on the way. What I will say
is that I've identified her.

17
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,800
Helle Anker. Danish citizen.

18
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,128
Reported missing in Copenhagen
yesterday by Natalie Anker.

19
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,552
- Her sister?
- Her wife.

20
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,232
How do you know it's her?

21
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:28,352
I found this picture on the internet.

22
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:32,376
It's from a charity event. Can you see her wrist?

23
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,924
Yes.

24
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:37,848
This is from the technicians.
It's the same tattoo.

25
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,036
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

26
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:43,896
Where were you? You didn't answer at
7:37 and you didn't call back.

27
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:46,088
I was home, but I overslept.
I got your message.

28
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:48,648
We've identified the victim.

29
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,500
Give me just two minutes.

30
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,840
- What are you going to do?
- Give me two minutes.

31
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,188
Print everything we have on
her. Also the pictures.

32
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:00,938
Absolutely.

33
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:17,384
Helle Anker. Founder of Ankerfert,
an insemination clinic.

34
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:21,408
It was sold in 2000.
Entrepreneur and debater.

35
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,828
Has a son with Natalie Anker, as well
as a son from a previous marriage.

36
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,520
Morten Anker. The father
is Villy Bartram, dead.

37
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,580
She left a meeting in Malmo yesterday
at 3PM, but never came home.

38
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,056
Did she drive back over the bridge?

39
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:40,468
We haven't found anything yet.

40
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:44,572
She was probably abducted in Sweden.
I'm going to see the wife in Copenhagen now.

41
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:50,092
Saga, it doesn't matter where she
was abducted. She was a Danish citizen.

42
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:53,184
You must have a
Danish colleague with you.

43
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,552
Saga Norén?

44
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:09,864
I've heard that she's unfit
to be a police officer.

45
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,320
Where did you hear that?
She's very competent.

46
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,616
- A special personality, but...
- You don't like her.

47
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:21,384
The address.

48
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:25,732
Isn't there someone else
you can give this to?

49
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,482
I'm giving it to you.

50
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:34,416
Isn't she the one who
turned Martin in?

51
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,368
- Rikard?
- I'm here.

52
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:01,080
- Have you been in the bedroom?
- Yes.

53
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,648
Have you seen my necklace? You know,
that silver chain that looks like a bracelet.

54
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,904
Yes, I know which one you
mean, but unfortunately not.

55
00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:13,104
It falls off when I sleep.

56
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,504
I'll keep an eye out for it.

57
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:21,144
Lise Friise Andersen.

58
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,912
If your colleagues threw
your coat in the toilet

59
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,388
- would you also just regret that it happened?

60
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:45,504
- They are adults in a workplace.
- This is my daughter's workplace.

61
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:47,168
That they are children does not
excuse this behavior.

62
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,488
No, of course not.

63
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,336
So what are you going to do?

64
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:56,472
I will talk to the teachers and remind
the students about our zero tolerance...

65
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,668
Why should you talk to
all of the students?

66
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:02,808
- We don't know who it was.
- Yeah, we do.

67
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:10,992
I know that Molly has behavioral issues
and has participated in such things

68
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:13,200
- but we can't accuse her of everything
that happens at the school.

69
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,568
Make sure that it doesn't happen again.

70
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:21,104
Of course.

71
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:26,088
I will personally take care of it.
Karen is fortunate.

72
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:30,364
She has a stable family environment
and parents who love her.

73
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:34,976
Should she just fish out her jacket
and be happy that she has it good?

74
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:39,336
- That wasn't what I meant.
- I hope not. Come, Sweetie.

75
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,236
- Hanne Thomsen, Copenhagen police.
- Saga Norén, Malmo police.

76
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,704
- Shall we go?
- Are you going to leave the car there?

77
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:04,056
- Is it a problem?
- Yes, you're blocking the lane.

78
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,336
I mean for you, personally?

79
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,848
No.

80
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:09,312
Ok, so let's go.

81
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,664
You know that Helle Anker
was a bit of a celebrity.

82
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:17,914
- Yeah?

83
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,600
She was very active in the debate
about gender/LGBT questions.

84
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,716
You know, "there is no sex, just people".
She is such a little Swede.

85
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:32,088
Do you mean the perception that
Swedes are a little more politically correct?

86
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:33,844
A little more?

87
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,696
- Did she receive threats?
- Certainly.

88
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,576
She was regarded as extremely
provocative in some circles.

89
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,408
I met her eight years ago.

90
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,456
She was so brave.

91
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,460
But she was also unpopular, no?

92
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,568
Yes, so are all brave people.

93
00:11:53,818 --> 00:12:00,000
Your wife's body was placed in a
special manner. I have pictures.

94
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:06,168
She sat at a table with three mannequins.

95
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,764
A man and two children. Like a family.

96
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,696
- Unlike us, you mean?
- No, I didn't mean that.

97
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:20,496
There was toy food and cutlery
on the table. A fire truck and a robot.

98
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:27,264
- That means nothing to me.
- Has she received any threats?

99
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,600
Yes, quite a lot, actually.

100
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,608
She had just started a gender-neutral
kindergarten here in Copenhagen.

101
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,848
Sorry?

102
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:40,992
The first in Denmark.

103
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:46,224
- Were the threats written?
- Most were.

104
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,208
Some called, others shouted
at her on the street.

105
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,872
Do you have some of the written ones?

106
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:58,184
Thanks. They'll come to
take your fingerprints.

107
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:01,372
[background] Mom?

108
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,512
Can you go now?

109
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:07,560
There's one more thing.
Morten. Was he close to his mother?

110
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,320
He isn't close to anyone.
He isolated himself after Afghanistan.

111
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,796
- Where does he live?
- In the woods in Værløse.

112
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,684
- In a trailer.
- [background] Come on, Mom!

113
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:24,000
- I'm coming now, sweetie.
- Come now, Mom!

114
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,640
How am I going to tell him?

115
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,160
- How old is he?
- Four.

116
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,384
Most four-year-olds don't understand
abstract things like death.

117
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:37,060
They react more strongly to the
survivors' grief than the loss itself.

118
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:41,688
Just go back to your child.
We're finished. Thank you.

119
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,528
- May I ask some questions?
- Not now.

120
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:55,180
You don't like gender-neutral
kindergartens. You snorted up there.

121
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,432
Does that make me a bad officer?

122
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:00,312
No, how is that?

123
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:04,872
You would have shown pictures of her wife with that terrible smile.

124
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:08,352
Yeah. Did you think that was a bad idea?

125
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:11,544
I think you showed extremely poor judgment.

126
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:15,456
Saga Norén, Malmo police.

127
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:18,168
Thanks.

128
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:22,776
That was Forensics.
Helle Anker was missing her heart.

129
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:26,476
- What did she do?
- She's missing her heart.

130
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:38,532
We're delivering Aleksander Dover
to the apartment at Lundbergsgatan 7.

131
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:44,816
Good luck.
I hope we don't meet again.

132
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:45,508
On the other side.

133
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:51,120
That's the door. First on the left
with the white curtains.

134
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:01,752
Hi, sweetie. Did it go well?

135
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,992
What happened?

136
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,676
Karen...come on. Sit up and
tell me what happened.

137
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:31,800
She waited outside.
I should have never told on her.

138
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:38,280
Come.

139
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:41,768
We shouldn't go there.
It will only make it worse.

140
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:45,744
- We're not going there. Come.
- No!

141
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:49,344
Come with me. Now.

142
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:58,052
This is Molly's face. I want you
to hit it as hard as you can.

143
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:02,768
Near the eyes or the nose.
Not the mouth. Teeth can hurt your knuckles.

144
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:06,220
My teacher says that one shouldn't hit back.

145
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,252
- Then she can turn the other cheek.
- She says that it doesn't solve anything.

146
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:12,432
That depends on how hard you hit the first time.

147
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:13,704
Come on.

148
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,216
Harder.

149
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:20,904
Come on.

150
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:26,352
Make a fist and keep your wrist straight.
Put all your weight into it. Come.

151
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,696
That's better, but you must hit a lot harder.

152
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:37,440
Harder. Better.

153
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,352
Like that. Much better.

154
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,376
Good! That's good, Karen.

155
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,296
Why do you think they took her heart?

156
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:04,584
To merge with the victim, maintain
control, or remember it.

157
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,640
Or also just to show that she was heartless.

158
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,440
That kind of symbolism is extremely unusual.

159
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,112
- Do you have any hobbies?
- Hobbies? No.

160
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,280
- Where do you live?
- Copenhagen.

161
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,552
- Which area?
- Frederiksberg. Do you know where it is?

162
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:26,302
Yes, I know it well.
Are you happy there?

163
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,408
How is your family life?

164
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,640
- What are you doing?
- Small talk.

165
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,880
We will only work together.
Nothing else. OK?

166
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,404
Exchanging personal information can improve...

167
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:43,276
If you want a colleague you can be friends with -

168
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:45,816
- maybe you shouldn't have put Martin in prison, eh?

169
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,372
- Morten Anker?
- Maybe. Who are you?

170
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:21,364
Saga Norén, Malmo police.
This is my colleague, Hanne Thomsen.

171
00:19:21,614 --> 00:19:25,056
And what do you want?

172
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:28,128
Unfortunately, we have bad news.

173
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:30,768
Your mother is dead.

174
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:32,518
Killed.

175
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,448
Okay. Thanks.

176
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:44,976
Yeah, now I know. Thanks.

177
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,240
When did you see her last?

178
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,040
- Why do you want to know that?
- Because I'm leading the investigation.

179
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,080
I don't know.

180
00:19:57,052 --> 00:20:02,256
She came here. It was ...
It was spring or summer.

181
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:05,592
- Did you like her?
- She was my mother.

182
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:08,400
It doesn't say anything about your
relationship. I don't like my mother.

183
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,896
- Why the questions?
Can't you leave me be?
- Where were you last night?

184
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,704
I am always here.

185
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:23,232
- There isn't anyone who can confirm that.
- I know what you're thinking.

186
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:29,592
And you ... you're trying ...
I didn't touch her.

187
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:33,672
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- Would you rather do it at the police station?

188
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:37,968
Then you might want to try
being a little more cooperative.

189
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,000
I can't remember when I saw her.

190
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:51,984
Can you think of anyone who
would do her harm? If you do.

191
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,336
- I don't have a phone.
- Take it anyway.

192
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:59,040
- May we see inside your trailer?
- No. It's mine.

193
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,104
- I'll get a search warrant.
- Yeah.

194
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:07,032
So, I think I'll have to get going.

195
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:21,288
I'm going now.

196
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:24,480
Hope it's nice.

197
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,152
It will be.

198
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,232
Oh boy. Hi.

199
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,864
Hi.

200
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:52,872
Do you like it? M. M. Brandt.

201
00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:57,120
I don't know. It...

202
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:00,912
- Do you?
- I know nothing about art.

203
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,832
- Do you?
- Yeah. A little bit.

204
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,976
I hear you're talking about Brandt.

205
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:13,300
Mads Michael, that's what M.M. stands for.
Born in Copenhagen in 1923.

206
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,552
He wasn't a sculptor, but a furniture
designer, architect and scenographer.

207
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:21,700
He studied astronomy in Copenhagen.

208
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:27,504
Many works are about universal
truth with earthy metaphors.

209
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:31,852
This work, 'Character', was made
some years before his death -

210
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:34,464
- when he had met his second wife.

211
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:39,288
She was a lot younger than him.
She was only 27, and he was over 60.

212
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,456
May I interrupt you, Emil?

213
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,616
There's something I've just thought.

214
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:49,800
Does the museum have a bar or
restaurant where one can sit more quietly?

215
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,440
- Down the stairs and to the right.
- Down there?

216
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,392
Thanks so much. Or?

217
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:00,336
Sure, why not?

218
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:02,908
Thanks.

219
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,864
Now let's see...

220
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:29,928
Helle Anker is dead.
You know who she was.

221
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,576
She, who didn't believe in boys and girls -

222
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:38,112
- because sex is not something biologically
certain, but socially constructed.

223
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,568
We are what we are born to be.

224
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,128
But according to Helle Anker we were
heading straight for disaster -

225
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:51,336
- if our children didn't grow up as
some non-biological nothings.

226
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:55,204
Helle Anker was a modern,
lesbian woman -

227
00:26:55,276 --> 00:27:01,224
- who would destroy the nuclear
family and blacken traditional values.

228
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:04,680
I have said it before.
I say it again.

229
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:07,296
She was a threat to our society.

230
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:12,360
There were many who listened when she scattered her
anarchist propaganda in the media.

231
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:15,192
Now she is gone -

232
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,320
- and I hope that her death also means -

233
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:24,984
- that her crazy ideas and experimental
school for children are buried with her.

234
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,936
John, have you gotten the
videos from the site?

235
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:46,920
- Yes, but they gave us nothing.
- I want to see them.

236
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:56,332
Won't you introduce me?

237
00:27:56,856 --> 00:28:02,980
- Yep. Hanne Thomsen from Copenhagen police.
- Hi. John. Welcome.

238
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,888
A laser pointer, and then the camera dies.
It's the same with the other.

239
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:16,780
- So 'Hen' knows the area.
- The cameras weren't hidden.

240
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,012
Sorry. 'Hen'. What does it mean?

241
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:23,672
It's a gender-neutral personal pronoun.

242
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,576
'Hen' is a practical word when
one doesn't know the gender.

243
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,548
It's politically correct, in any case.

244
00:28:31,572 --> 00:28:35,092
- Do we have anything from the bridge?
- We've seen everything after 3:00 yesterday.

245
00:28:35,592 --> 00:28:39,916
Helle Anker's car never passed
the tollbooth. It's gone.

246
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,372
So she was abducted in Sweden.
We must search for the car.

247
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:46,012
It's done. Hi.

248
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:49,228
Hans Pettersson. I'm the boss here.
Good to meet you.

249
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,744
Lillian has spoken highly of you.

250
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,312
We may have found the murder scene.

251
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,512
Lars Andersen. Director of Andersen
Transport and Logistics.

252
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:37,296
Tell us what happened.

253
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:40,224
This had to be loaded for a
run early tomorrow.

254
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:45,484
My staff were checking it,
and then they found blood.

255
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,696
- Are they locked?
- Not always.

256
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:52,704
They should be locked,
but sometimes we slip up.

257
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:55,152
Do you have alarms? Surveillance cameras?

258
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,968
No cameras. We have an alarm
in here, but not out there.

259
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:03,192
There's a security firm that comes
to look during the night.

260
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,768
- How many have keys?
- All staff have keys.

261
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:09,624
- And how many is that?
- Here in Malmo we are 17.

262
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,248
Do you know if the gate was locked when
the first person came to work?

263
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:15,912
I don't know even know who was here first.

264
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:18,840
Find out.

265
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:22,036
- Do you think you'll be finished soon?
- I don't know.

266
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:25,776
I have customers waiting.
Can you hurry a little?

267
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:28,896
No.

268
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,448
This place is not randomly selected.

269
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:43,520
It could just as well have been done
where she was found.

270
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:48,240
I'm going in to work.
You don't need to come along.

271
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,124
Because it's late, or because you
don't want me to come?

272
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:52,872
Both.

273
00:30:56,208 --> 00:31:00,024
- Thanks ever so much for today.
- You're welcome. See you tomorrow.

274
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:05,640
Thanks.

275
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,616
- That was nice.
- Yeah. Do you want a lift?

276
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:13,944
Yeah. We can also continue somewhere else.

277
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:19,272
Unfortunately I have to get up
early tomorrow. But I want to.

278
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:21,584
So long as I get 3-5 hours of sleep.

279
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:25,296
- How can you handle that?
- I take drugs.

280
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:30,408
What do you think?

281
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:34,296
- Where do you live?
- You live closer.

282
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:35,880
How do you know that?

283
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:40,728
Everyone is closer, unless you live
in Jylland. So let's go to your place.

284
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:47,768
John, I need a map.

285
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:53,160
- Of what?
- The site and its surroundings.

286
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:02,784
Andersen TL. It was there that she was killed.

287
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:07,632
She was found here.

288
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:11,748
The shortest route.

289
00:32:15,748 --> 00:32:19,208
Nobelvägen, Trelleborgsvägen.
There are cameras near both.

290
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:22,096
We know when he turned off the cameras.

291
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:25,420
The car must have come past
ten minutes before it.

292
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,156
I'll look into it tomorrow.

293
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:32,040
- Why not now?
- Because most people have gone home for today.

294
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,844
He is newly divorced, and the wife
has the children every other week.

295
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:39,440
Just go home.

296
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:45,532
Saga, that meeting that Helle Anker
went to in Malmo, what was it about?

297
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:49,348
It was a meeting with other
gender-neutral kindergartens.

298
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,228
- How many knew about it?
- She wrote about it on Twitter.

299
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:57,344
- So everyone.
- No, only those who followed her on Twitter.

300
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:09,696
- How is it going with Hanne?
- I don't think she likes me.

301
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:14,880
- Is that a problem?
- Not for me.

302
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:13,896
Goddamn it, Alex. Come here.

303
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:19,128
- How good it is to see you again.
- I'm here to pick up the money.

304
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,872
It was gone.

305
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:26,864
- Is it gone to this here?
- What do you mean?

306
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:29,880
The house, the car ...
Where did you get the money from?

307
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:35,956
Do you think I've taken it?
I didn't even know where it was.

308
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,184
How would I know that?

309
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,416
We robbed an armored car.
Two years ago.

310
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,904
Do you want to see the newspaper?

311
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:53,096
Hell, Alex.
How can you believe that?

312
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:56,552
Come on. Stay here.
Come in and have a beer.

313
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,512
I don't want to have a beer.
I want the money.

314
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:11,408
What are you doing here? The girls have
gone to bed. You mustn't be here.

315
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:16,952
Give me one minute to explain,
Samira, and then I'll go.

316
00:36:17,452 --> 00:36:18,624
Okay. Wait.

317
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:34,296
I'm going to run away.
I'm going to leave Sweden.

318
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:36,964
Otherwise they'll kill me.

319
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,000
- Who?
- Those I put in jail.

320
00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:46,416
That cop, Hans Pettersson,
said that I had a choice.

321
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:52,656
I had to turn them in, otherwise they
would charge you and take the girls from us.

322
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:55,416
I had no choice.

323
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,100
I thought that you wouldn't need for
anything, but now the money is gone.

324
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,296
- It doesn't matter.
- I'm going to fix it.

325
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:09,480
- I have a plan.
- Alex...

326
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,424
Say hello to the girls.
Tell them that I love them.

327
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:57,120
I'm slipping out too.
It's kind of a special day today.

328
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,008
That's the reason I came late this morning.

329
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:04,392
Today Lillian and I have been
married for three months.

330
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,832
Martin has been in prison for six months.

331
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:11,020
He has nine and a half years to go.

332
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,004
Do you regret that you don't visit him?

333
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:20,596
- Why would I do that?
- You think about him.

334
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:24,076
That doesn't mean that I can see him.

335
00:38:26,076 --> 00:38:29,400
- You were friends, after all.
- I can't visit a convicted murderer.

336
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,224
- Don't you miss him?
- That's not relevant.

337
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:37,536
We can see each other when
he has served his sentence.

338
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:39,864
That's ten years away, Saga.

339
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:41,544
Nine and a half.

340
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:55,852
- Don't stay too long.
- No.

341
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:29,976
Morten?

342
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:32,736
What are you doing here?

343
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,904
- Was it you who sent them?
- The police? No. They know who you are.

344
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:59,640
I didn't do anything to her.

345
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,104
Everyone thinks that it was me, but I...

346
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:07,848
I didn't do anything to her.
It was someone else.

347
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,272
Not me.

348
00:40:22,132 --> 00:40:24,528
What are you really doing here?
What do you want?

349
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:29,304
I want something of hers.

350
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:35,856
- I have nothing at all of hers.
- You can take what you want.

351
00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:46,744
Take this. She bought it when you and
her and Villy were in Barcelona.

352
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,840
Take it.

353
00:40:56,644 --> 00:41:01,392
Does my father know?
That Mom is dead?

354
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:10,560
Morten, Villy has been gone
for many years now.

355
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,888
- What is this?
- Happy anniversary.

356
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,596
- Three months.
- It's a quarter paper anniversary.

357
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:49,848
I bumped it up.

358
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,312
How did it go with Hanne and Saga today?

359
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,144
I don't know.

360
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,408
I met her only briefly.

361
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,984
Hanne is clever.

362
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,884
I don't know if she understands Saga.

363
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:12,400
- Who does?
- I do. Don't you?

364
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,528
I appreciate her as an investigator.

365
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,304
But?

366
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:23,112
It's hard to get close to her -

367
00:42:25,348 --> 00:42:27,696
Does it have anything to do with Martin?

368
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:30,072
I was this close to losing my job.

369
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:34,536
- That wasn't Saga's fault.
- No, it was Martin's fault.

370
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,056
Saga did what was right.

371
00:42:37,232 --> 00:42:41,256
She's always right. That's why I admire
her as an investigator.

372
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,748
Should we let the talk about
Saga go for tonight?

373
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:50,060
I only mean that it hasn't
been easy for Saga.

374
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:54,824
- Are you worried about her?
- No.

375
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:57,408
Well, yes. Maybe a little.

376
00:43:13,684 --> 00:43:17,880
- It's Natalie Anker, Helle's wife.
- I know. What do you want?

377
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:23,400
It's maybe nothing, but
Morten was just here.

378
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:29,160
He said that he never touched
her, but that someone else did it.

379
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,472
We'll go see him tomorrow.

380
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:35,976
Good. Is there anything new?

381
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:40,348
- Andersen TL, do you know of it?
- What is it?

382
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:45,096
A transport company.
Danish, but with a branch in Malmo.

383
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:48,936
- No, why?
- It was there that Helle was killed.

384
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:53,808
Did Morten or anyone else
ever call her heartless?

385
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:02,392
- Why do you ask?
- Just answer the question.

386
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:07,392
- No. Why do you ask?
- Just answer.

387
00:44:10,276 --> 00:44:12,552
Did someone take out her heart?

388
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:20,448
Did someone take her heart?

389
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,444
So Andersen TL means nothing to you.

390
00:44:25,944 --> 00:44:28,472
- Answer me!
- You have never heard of it.

391
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:31,584
- Did someone take her heart?
- Well then.

392
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:34,128
Thanks for calling.

393
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,296
Are you sleeping?

394
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:02,064
Her name is Line. Møller.

395
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,792
She's a store manager, or works in an office.

396
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:15,072
I can't remember which.
30-35 years old.

397
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,664
She lived in Valby in a three-room.

398
00:46:21,484 --> 00:46:25,728
I think there were three rooms.
We never went all the way into the apartment.

399
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:29,640
Shh. Be quiet.

400
00:46:32,644 --> 00:46:37,152
- See if you can get a little sleep.
- Yeah.

401
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:12,552
- Good morning.
Did you not go home yesterday?
- No.

402
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,428
- You must not work all night.
- I went home after midnight. Today.

403
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:20,208
- Where is Hanne?
- She hasn't come in yet. Look.

404
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:24,364
Helle got this on Friday. Typed.

405
00:47:24,864 --> 00:47:28,112
It doesn't look like the other threats.
It's very articulate.

406
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:34,136
It contains no obscene words, profanity,
or threats about rape.

407
00:47:34,636 --> 00:47:37,468
"You don't know what a family
is or should be."

408
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:43,512
"I can only provide information
and guidance. Otherwise, you must
face the consequences."

409
00:47:44,012 --> 00:47:48,824
- She was found in a staged ...
- I know that. What else?

410
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,776
There's no apparent connection between
the transport company and Helle Anker.

411
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:57,444
Lipstick, mannequins, toys.
Is there nothing else?

412
00:47:57,944 --> 00:48:00,408
Not yet. The technicians are working on it.

413
00:48:00,892 --> 00:48:03,000
Helle Anker's car is still missing.

414
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:07,880
The victim, the method and the
places can be important.

415
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,592
If the motive is hatred or revenge,
it's important that the body is found.

416
00:48:19,456 --> 00:48:23,136
- Saga Norén, Malmo police.
- It's Hanne.

417
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:25,804
- Where are you?
- I'm not coming in.

418
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,080
I've asked to be taken off the case.

419
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:28,660
Why is that?

420
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:34,128
We've been authorized to search
Morten Anker's trailer.

421
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,600
You've requested a transfer,
but it's not approved yet.

422
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:43,444
I don't want to wait to be approved
to work alone in Denmark.

423
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,360
See you there. I'm leaving now.

424
00:49:03,628 --> 00:49:05,232
Okay, so we're doing this.

425
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,288
Why do you want to be taken
off the case?

426
00:49:10,372 --> 00:49:12,840
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to work together.

427
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,584
- Is it because of Martin?
- No.

428
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:20,712
I'm one of those who believe who
Martin got exactly what he'd deserved.

429
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,392
This only has to do with you and me.

430
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,144
Ah.

431
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:53,664
It's locked.

432
00:49:54,364 --> 00:49:57,532
We have permission to go in.
Open it.

433
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:23,712
Wait!

434
00:51:15,484 --> 00:51:19,224
This is Saga Norén, Malmo police.
Send an ambulance.

435
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:25,944
Yeah. Good. Hurry up!

436
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:49,352
Hi.

437
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:16,584
He's a war veteran.

438
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:20,712
You couldn't have known that he
would place a bomb in the trailer.

439
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:24,960
- I should have thought about it.
- She's going to survive.

440
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,272
She wanted to be taken off the case.
She didn't want to work with me.

441
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,684
I'm going to drive you home now, and
someone else will drive your car home.

442
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:39,000
- No, I'm driving. I'm going to work.
- You drive, but you drive home.

443
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,036
See you tomorrow.
Saga, that is an order!

444
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,232
Hey, Saga.

445
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:33,384
What happened to you?
You're covered in blood.

446
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:40,412
Stop, Saga! I know that you
don't want to speak to me.

447
00:53:40,912 --> 00:53:42,912
Dad is dying.

448
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:45,672
Wait, Saga.

449
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:49,272
He would so like to see you.
Stop now.

450
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,792
Saga, we have to get closure.

451
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:58,440
Your crime is past the statute
of limitations. You risk nothing.

452
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,744
Saga, Dad is dying. Jennifer is gone.
It's only us two left.

453
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:08,924
Open up, Saga.

454
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:11,576
Would you please open up?

455
00:55:09,896 --> 00:55:11,472
I didn't touch her!

456
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:14,616
What the hell are you doing, man?

457
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,192
Can you let her go?

458
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,880
Lillian. Hi.

459
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,408
I heard about Hanne.
How is she doing?

460
00:57:09,484 --> 00:57:12,936
They're fighting to save her leg,
but it doesn't look good.

461
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:17,928
- She was in Sweden, no?
- Yes, she was assisting the Swedes.

462
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,456
So now you need someone else over there.
So take me.

463
00:57:24,004 --> 00:57:26,640
- Why?
- Because I'm good.

464
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:35,676
Okay. Read up on the case, get
ready, and contact Saga Norén.

465
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:41,216
- Saga Norén? ... Good.
