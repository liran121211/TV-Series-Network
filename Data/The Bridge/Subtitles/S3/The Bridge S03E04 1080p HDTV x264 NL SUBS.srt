00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Previously

2
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:20,412
That was what he said.
"My brother shot me."

3
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,528
Look on the back.

4
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,476
Killbrothers.

5
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:28,692
- Morten didn't have any brothers.
- He had Killbrothers.

6
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,324
- I will pay it back.
- Take that gun and shoot!

7
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:38,940
- Are you ready?
- Just go. I'll be there in an hour.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
It's Hans!

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,088
He has a pulse.

10
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:51,612
He's lost a hand, and
he's in a coma.

11
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:58,264
Dad died this morning.
Now it's only you and me, Saga.

12
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:05,580
Henrik, I thought that you wanted
to ask your new partner for help.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,068
- Saga, I've found something.
- We've found something on Lise's vlog.

14
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:15,160
A Rikard Johnsson,
Ringstedgade 21 in Copenhagen.

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,904
I'm taking over the kindergarten
that Helle started.

16
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:23,724
Drive to Natalie Anker's.
She's the next victim.

17
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:27,256
Drop the knife!
Stop!

18
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:39,168
EPISODE 4

19
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,528
Are you in pain, Dad?

20
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:51,020
You can't get any more
pain killers now.

21
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:04,220
I know that you're where
you never wanted to end up.

22
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:10,100
It's unfair, but you
won't lie here any longer.

23
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,164
Goodbye, Dad.

24
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:09,948
The Bridge

25
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:16,724
We're looking for 'Knightrider',
Rikard Johnsson.

26
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,764
A Swede living in Copenhagen.
We're monitoring his apartment -

27
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:24,968
- but he's hardly ever there.
Yes?

28
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:30,640
Grew up with his mother in Helsingborg.
Moved at age 17, when she died.

29
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,676
Works as a cleaner.

30
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:37,796
His employer says
that he's a loner.

31
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:41,016
The police in Denmark have
said exactly the same thing.

32
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,768
He is wanted.
His passport has been revoked.

33
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,728
- Has he left the country?
- No. He lives in isolation.

34
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:50,968
He'll go where he feels safe.

35
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:53,564
- Do we know where he cleaned?
- Not yet.

36
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,828
- His phone?
- The call lists are on the way.

37
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:06,136
What about Lise? It seems
like Rikard adores her.

38
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:12,448
He thinks they have a connection.
Maybe he'll go visit her.

39
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:27,372
- Did he say anything else?
- No, time and place. Here and now.

40
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:29,920
What the fuck is
he looking for, man?

41
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:43,284
- On time for once, eh?
- What are we going to do?

42
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:46,020
You'll go to Sweden
and pick up a bag.

43
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,812
- Which of you is going?
- What do you mean which one?

44
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:51,180
One gets to stay here as collateral.

45
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:52,072
That wasn't the deal.

46
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,384
You send your girlfriend
to solve your problems.

47
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:56,748
They're our problems.

48
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,388
- I'll go.
- No.

49
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:04,864
No, you shouldn't be alone
with him. You go, I'll stay.

50
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:06,420
Okay.

51
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:11,436
Here's the code to the locker
and the address. Drive carefully.

52
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:14,652
I'll hurry.

53
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:54,832
- Hi. We've been waiting for you.
- What have I done now?

54
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:58,620
- Mom, I need to go to the toilet.
- Then run up.

55
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:03,444
- Do you have good news or bad?
- Most bad, unfortunately.

56
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:07,860
I thought so.
Here. Help out a little.

57
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:16,908
So despite my post, he
didn't attack Bente Knudsen.

58
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:17,440
No.

59
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,836
- How did you find him at the Ankers'?
- We tracked him via the comments section.

60
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,828
- He might want to seek you out.
- Why's that?

61
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:30,828
He looks like this.

62
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,436
If he contacts you ...

63
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
It's Rikard.

64
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,280
- Do you know him?
- He cleans our house. He has keys.

65
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,300
Karen? Karen, open up!

66
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,612
- Karen?
- Mom?

67
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:55,648
Karen! Karen, open up!

68
00:07:56,148 --> 00:08:00,580
- Rikard! Don't you touch her!
- You need to let us take over.

69
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,676
- Don't you touch her!
- Lise.

70
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:18,204
Rikard, my name is Henrik Sabroe.
I'm from Copenhagen Police.

71
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,708
I would very much like for you
to let Karen go.

72
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,692
Rikard?
Just try to talk to me, Rikard.

73
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,536
I want Lise, otherwise Karen dies.

74
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:36,372
We'll make sure, but just let
Karen go so that we can talk about ...

75
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,880
No, I want Lise,
otherwise Karen dies!

76
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:42,880
Rikard, I won't talk
before you release Karen.

77
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,752
There are reinforcements on the way.
Hopefully they'll be here in fifteen minutes.

78
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,752
This is your fault.

79
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:55,184
- How's that?
- He knows that I've helped you.

80
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,528
I can get in and
take Karen's place.

81
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:00,692
You mustn't do that.
You said that you could 'get in' ...

82
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:04,284
- There's another way.
- You will let Karen go.

83
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:06,924
No matter what you have done -

84
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:12,084
- you were never close
to killing a child.

85
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:20,780
You've already crossed one line.
You don't need to cross another.

86
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,780
Shut up.

87
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:28,164
Rikard, there's something that goes
to pieces inside if you do that.

88
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,548
It will never be the same again.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

89
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:39,740
If she dies now, then she
takes something of you with her.

90
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,964
Shut up.

91
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:51,036
To lose a child ... Life is
never quite whole again.

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,340
Do you understand what I'm saying?

93
00:09:57,112 --> 00:10:00,932
I don't know if you've tried to undo
something, but a child ...

94
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,764
I'll kill her!

95
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,516
Where's Saga?

96
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,444
-In there.
- Come on, man.

97
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:16,572
- Karen?
- Calmly.

98
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,764
You ...

99
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,676
Rikard, can you hear us?

100
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,704
- I've done everything for you!
- Talk to him.

101
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:30,012
I know that! I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

102
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,364
Will you please be so kind
as to not harm her?

103
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:37,740
I'll come in if you let her out.

104
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:41,316
Let her come out,
then I'll come in.

105
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:44,924
Shut up.

106
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:48,156
- Rikard, can you hear us?
- Karen.

107
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,296
Shut up! Everyone shut up!

108
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,484
- Mom!
- Rikard, take it easy now.

109
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,052
Shut up ...

110
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:02,732
Drop the knife.

111
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,188
Mom!

112
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:13,452
Saga!

113
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,608
Alright.

114
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,652
Saga, it's fine. Come.

115
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,572
It's totally fine. Come here. Drop it.
Like that. Yeah, just like that.

116
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:37,620
It's really fine. Come on. Release it.
Here. It's fine. Like that.

117
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:39,852
It's fine.

118
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:17,820
Come in.

119
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,708
- It's time.
- Okay. I'm coming.

120
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,964
I know that you're sitting and waiting
for wine and hors d'oeuvres in the foyer -

121
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,148
- but you must wait
a couple minutes more.

122
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:41,172
What have you learned today?

123
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:47,916
Now that you've changed his tune,
you need to show the man home.

124
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,524
And the boss and Agneta,
who is such an energy waster.

125
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:55,772
Is that what you've learned?
Is what what you've learned here today?

126
00:12:57,448 --> 00:13:01,768
No, I hope that my
life story has shown -

127
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:05,324
- that happiness is actually a choice.

128
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:11,560
All that you need to do right now
starts here and now. It lives here.

129
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,244
The feeling of how you see yourself.

130
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,668
Thanks for listening.

131
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,104
There. Thanks so much.

132
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,020
- Hi, Claes.
- Hi, Annika.

133
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,972
- That was really good. As always.
- Thanks.

134
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:46,388
- What can I do for you today?
- Will you sign my photo from Örebro?

135
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:51,952
You skipped the story
about the batteries today.

136
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,600
I forgot that, actually.

137
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,420
Here you go.

138
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,876
- Can I take another?
- Yeah, of course.

139
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,364
I'll be right with you.

140
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:10,748
Okay. Thanks.

141
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:13,288
Hi.

142
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,100
- What's your name?
- Rafaela.

143
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:23,916
No!

144
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:28,836
Hey! What are you doing?
Give me that! Hey!

145
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:34,524
What are you doing?
What's happening? Hey!

146
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,308
Linn.

147
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,936
- Have you found him?
- Yes.

148
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:53,920
- Is he here?
- He'll be here any minute.

149
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,908
I want to be part
of the interrogation.

150
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,728
That's not an option.

151
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:03,544
You may be allowed to observe,
but you cannot take an active part.

152
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:06,928
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

153
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:14,700
Why did you go in?

154
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:21,692
If the hostage is in imminent danger,
the police officer must ...

155
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:26,436
Yeah, I know the rules, but
that wasn't what I meant.

156
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:30,260
- That was what you asked about.
- Okay.

157
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,800
So I'll ask like this.

158
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:38,944
How has your father's
death affected you?

159
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,328
As I said, we weren't close.

160
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:47,632
- And that Hans is still in a coma?
- That doesn't affect my work.

161
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,380
So that's not why you've
been a little reckless?

162
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,768
I'm not reckless. I probably saved Karen
and Natalie Anker. It's just my job.

163
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:02,412
Your mom called.

164
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,472
- Why?
- She's worried about you.

165
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:09,496
You have not processed
what's happened.

166
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,524
She has no right to
talk to you about me.

167
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:16,192
She would you like you
to come to the memorial service.

168
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:19,000
Rikard has been treated.
He's here now.

169
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,748
- And his defender too?
- He doesn't want one.

170
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:31,960
Helle Anker. Fabian Christensen.
Hans Pettersson.

171
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,428
Tell us about them.

172
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,340
Come on.

173
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:51,440
A lawyer would say that it's
always best to talk with us.

174
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:02,144
We're not going to let you go
just because you don't confess.

175
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,540
I really thought you were
proud of what you've done.

176
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,964
Lise may not have appreciated it,
but you have made a difference.

177
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:17,532
You've surely done something good,
haven't you? You made a real difference.

178
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:22,236
Just look at these photos.

179
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,804
Helle Anker. Fabian Christensen.

180
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,916
Hans Pettersson.

181
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,260
Shall we start with Hans?

182
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,724
Had they planned to smuggle
it across the bridge?

183
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,668
Yeah.

184
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:31,092
- Do we know what's in it?
- No.

185
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:34,476
- Shall we open it?
- I don't need to know that.

186
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,100
Marc owes money
to Lukas Stenstrup.

187
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,244
I think it's payment for
some of the debt.

188
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:45,612
I don't want to know. Colbert,
just make sure it's resolved.

189
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:47,916
I will, Freddie.

190
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,628
What was it you said
to Lise in the apartment?

191
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,900
"You failed me."

192
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:15,060
That hurts.

193
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,172
Then you get angry.

194
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,900
Was that what happened?

195
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,804
Come on.

196
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:48,468
Linn. They must get him to talk.

197
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:52,372
- Is he saying anything?
- Not a word.

198
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:55,408
He will. We have time.

199
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:59,196
It's not enough. We must connect
him to the murders, to Hans.

200
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:01,912
Come with me.

201
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:08,964
It must be very difficult for you.
We're investigating several murders -

202
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:13,356
- and a brutal attack on a
police chief, not your husband.

203
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,448
You must take a step back.
You cannot come and go as you wish.

204
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,820
- I have employees here.
- Lent to my department, under my command.

205
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:28,860
I wanted to be accommodating
because I feel for you -

206
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,888
- but in reality that's wrong.

207
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:34,916
You're personally involved.
You're not thinking clearly.

208
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,876
You don't know what I'm thinking!

209
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,588
- Do you have it good here?
- In this division?

210
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:54,264
- In my husband's office.
- It's only temporary.

211
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,748
Yeah. It is.

212
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:15,612
My grandfather risked everything
and started EkdahlsHus -

213
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:19,288
- so not only my mother, but
all families were given the opportunity -

214
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:24,684
- to buy and live in a good, solid,
nice house for a reasonable price.

215
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,952
We're now opening our eleventh branch
in the North, but the first in Denmark.

216
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:33,476
It's about time, isn't it?

217
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,700
Then let's cut the ribbon.

218
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,112
- Good speech.
- What are you doing here?

219
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:48,420
Saying hi to my girlfriend.

220
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,444
I've booked a table at
a restaurant tonight at 8:00.

221
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:57,832
- Can you make it?
- I really don't know.

222
00:22:58,332 --> 00:23:02,292
- Stop it. No one knows you in Denmark.
- You never know.

223
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:09,096
You met your best friend's son
in Copenhagen and ate dinner together.

224
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:13,292
- Anna.
- Yeah. I'm coming.

225
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,756
I'll try. I'm not promising anything,
but I will try.

226
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,620
Hi.

227
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:46,884
- How did it go?
- Not so good.

228
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,788
What now? Jeanette?

229
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:02,076
- I lost the bag.
- What?

230
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:04,908
There were some men who drove
up beside me and just took it.

231
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:09,756
Sit down.

232
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:25,212
Here's 7500. It's not much, but
it's all I could get.

233
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:29,028
You can also have the car.

234
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:35,004
Do you have any idea
what that bag was worth?

235
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:39,060
- Surely more than 78,000.
- Far more than 78,000.

236
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:01,044
I promise I'll get the money.

237
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,992
I'll get your money.
I'll find a solution to this shit.

238
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,388
Shut the fuck up, man.

239
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:32,460
From now on you don't owe
me shit. Do you understand?

240
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,868
We're even.

241
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:39,732
Piss off.

242
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,420
Fuck off.

243
00:25:57,664 --> 00:25:59,916
- Are we really even?
- That's what he said.

244
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:05,124
How the hell ...
Where did you get the money from?

245
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:07,164
I sold some jewelry
that I had hidden.

246
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:11,964
- From me?
- Yeah.

247
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,332
I'm really sorry, Jeanette.

248
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:23,292
Can we just go home?

249
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:40,116
- Did it go well?
- Perfectly.

250
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,772
- What's happening?
- He's not saying a word.

251
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,060
Does he think he can go free
by not talking with us?

252
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:14,632
The motive is attention.
He should want to take credit for it.

253
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:20,224
He seemed surprised when he saw Hans.
Like he didn't know ...

254
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,080
We've gotten his schedule.

255
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,668
We don't know when they were killed,
but it's definitely possible he did it.

256
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:36,396
- We'll try another round with him.
- It can wait. You have something else to do.

257
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:03,276
That's Hans' hand.
He has a ring like that, at least.

258
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:18,660
Shut up, man.

259
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:39,348
It's the same again.
Spectacularly staged. Lighting.

260
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:43,648
Helle Anker dies first. Her heart
and her car lead us to Hans -

261
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:46,668
- who is missing a hand,
which we find here.

262
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:50,204
There's nothing that connects
Fabian Christensen with the other three.

263
00:28:51,304 --> 00:28:52,804
No, there's really not.

264
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:58,608
Could Richard have done this after
he ran away from Natalie's last night?

265
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:02,492
The doctors say that he has
been dead for 12 hours at most.

266
00:29:03,956 --> 00:29:06,976
- Do we know who he is?
- Not yet.

267
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:09,732
It doesn't look like
he's missing anything.

268
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:17,436
Shut up, man.

269
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:53,660
Hi, Claes.

270
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,760
- Hi.
- Sorry for bothering you.

271
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,276
I read about your dad.
I'm sorry.

272
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:04,812
- Thanks.
- Was it sudden?

273
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,120
No ...
He had been sick a long time, so ...

274
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,412
Even if one is prepared,
it's always a bit of a shock.

275
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:21,236
I just wanted to give my condolences
and see how you were doing.

276
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:23,636
Okay. Thanks.

277
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,200
Do you have someone here,
or do you want to be alone?

278
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,604
I can stay a while.

279
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:37,216
Come in.

280
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:44,052
Gather around.

281
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:52,864
Sorry.

282
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,496
Lars Ove Abrahamsson, 72 years old.

283
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:05,152
Retired gym teacher from Oxie,
but I want to know more.

284
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:09,564
He has a sister, Margaretha.
She's on her way home from Gdansk.

285
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:13,656
Now the question is whether we've got
the right man. Rikard isn't talking to us.

286
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:17,824
We must decide whether we want
to spend more time with him.

287
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:20,824
It would seem he read
about Helle's murder -

288
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:23,920
- and killed Christensen
for Lise's sake.

289
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,740
- Do we have facts to confirm that?
- Only Fabian wasn't missing body parts.

290
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,424
Further, we've only found
Rikard's fingerprints on Fabian's car.

291
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:37,096
And there was a photo of
Christensen in the letter to Lise.

292
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:41,776
Has Lise Friis Andersen said
anything about Lars Ove on her blog?

293
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,960
Vlog.

294
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,428
Sorry?

295
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:49,720
If one puts out a video clip instead
of text, it's called a vlog, not a blog.

296
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,280
- No, not as far as we know.
- I can have a chat with her.

297
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:04,876
In addition, we found a typewriter
at Rikard's place, but no pistol.

298
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,508
Okay. We have him for the
attempted murder of Natalie Anker -

299
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:11,484
- and so we'll try to
get him for Christensen.

300
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:16,072
But we assume that Rikard has
nothing to do with these three.

301
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:20,660
- What is the connection between them?
- We haven't found anything yet.

302
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,960
So we know where to start tomorrow.
Thanks for today. Good job.

303
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,168
Linn. This analysis
at the whiteboard ...

304
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:35,348
It's usually me who does it.
Since it's my case.

305
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:40,364
No, Saga. It's our case.

306
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,536
Sit down.

307
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:55,096
I try to learn about my coworkers,
so I've read a little about you.

308
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:58,048
Your performance reviews
with Hans puzzle me.

309
00:32:58,864 --> 00:32:59,968
Ah.

310
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:05,564
It seems like he asked how you
were, and then you were finished.

311
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:12,624
It may seem unnecessary -

312
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:19,072
- but it's about developing and
utilizing the staff's skills.

313
00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:22,096
Hans knows me and what I can do.

314
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:26,416
So he hasn't said that there have
been complaints about you several times?

315
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:32,612
- Who has complained?
- No coworkers.

316
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,496
Most are witnesses
or other non-suspects.

317
00:33:36,996 --> 00:33:40,812
They have seen you as
insensitive and unpleasant.

318
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,368
- You didn't know anything about it?
- No.

319
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:52,116
We're in the middle of
a complicated murder case.

320
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,408
I don't doubt that you are
an extremely valuable resource.

321
00:33:56,908 --> 00:34:01,908
But afterwards I will look at
possible sensitivity training.

322
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:04,164
Coaching or the like.

323
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:06,780
Ah.

324
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:09,208
What do you say to that?

325
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:12,808
I am already well aware
of my limitations.

326
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:16,696
Limitations are another
word for new possibilities.

327
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,168
Not for me.

328
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:25,172
- Was there anything else?
- No. You can go home now.

329
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:52,556
- I knew you would come.
- I knew too.

330
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:02,252
- Have you ordered?
- No, I waited for you.

331
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,232
Thanks.

332
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:13,712
You are so beautiful.

333
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,452
It's true.

334
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,240
Does Håkan never give
you compliments?

335
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,336
No, not so often.

336
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,584
He doesn't understand
how lucky he is to have you.

337
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,964
Hi.

338
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,988
- Do you have just five minutes?
- Yeah.

339
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:51,300
- Hi Karen.
- Hi.

340
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:58,572
- How is she?
- Good under the circumstances.

341
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,500
- We're just about to eat.
- Yeah, of course.

342
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:05,200
I just need to know if you know
a Lars Ove Abrahamsson.

343
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,200
No.

344
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,148
Are you sure? Swedish, 72 years old,
retired gym teacher.

345
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:13,788
Lives in a small community
outside of Malmo, Oxie.

346
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,740
- Why do you ask?
- Because he's dead.

347
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,948
Killed.

348
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:22,528
You've just arrested Rikard.

349
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:26,056
So you haven't named
him in your video blog?

350
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,364
No. Does this mean that
it's the same murderer?

351
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:34,356
There's something to suggest it.

352
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,476
So this doesn't have anything
to do with my videoblog.

353
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:43,692
That doesn't mean that what you're
doing is okay. Have a good night.

354
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:56,508
It's getting late.

355
00:36:58,144 --> 00:37:00,828
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

356
00:37:02,968 --> 00:37:05,436
- You look good.
- Thanks.

357
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:41,220
Lillian. Hi.

358
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,820
I was in the shower.
What do you want?

359
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:47,724
I want to know if
you'll help me with something.

360
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,404
Of course. What?

361
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,988
Linn would like me to keep a certain
distance from the investigation.

362
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,172
Keep me away, quite frankly.

363
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,396
I need you to give me
access to the investigation material.

364
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:06,660
I would really appreciate it.

365
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:10,668
- Of course I will.
- Thanks.

366
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:15,108
I need to go. We'll talk.

367
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,276
Thanks. Hi.

368
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,536
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- I'm a member.

369
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:19,784
It seemed like an efficient way
to find someone to have sex with.

370
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:23,628
Okay. Good luck.

371
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,456
Thanks. Same to you.

372
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:37,792
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- Frederik Hansen. Hi.

373
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,488
- Shall we have sex?
- Sorry?

374
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,664
Shall we have sex?

375
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:49,476
That's a bit sudden ...

376
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,604
I'm glad that you persuaded me.
It was just what I needed.

377
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:01,708
That's what I said.

378
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:09,260
- Not here.
- Okay. Where's your hotel?

379
00:40:12,232 --> 00:40:14,804
Our model home is
completely furnished.

380
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:44,224
Think if we could always
have it be this way.

381
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:47,512
- We can't.
- Why not?

382
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,852
I love you.

383
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,088
But now that's how it is.

384
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,616
- I hate it.
- No.

385
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:02,516
No, you don't.

386
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:21,180
Ah, you're sitting here.

387
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:25,740
You made it sound easy to
find someone to have sex with here.

388
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,428
It is a singles club.

389
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:32,040
Many of those who come are
looking for something more long-term.

390
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,712
Are you also doing that?
Looking for something long-term?

391
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:38,748
Why are you asking?

392
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:42,352
Otherwise your evening must
also have been a failure.

393
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,052
Are you suggesting what
I think you're suggesting?

394
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:53,820
No, I'm not suggesting anything.

395
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,492
It could be interpreted
that you think we should have sex.

396
00:41:57,664 --> 00:41:58,452
Yes.

397
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:06,112
Yes, it could be interpreted like that,
or yes, you think we should have sex?

398
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:09,492
Yes, I think we two should have sex.

399
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,380
Okay.

400
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,396
But it has to be at your place.

401
00:42:20,152 --> 00:42:24,020
- Why? You surely must live closer.
- We'll have a shorter drive to work from your place.

402
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:28,052
- You're thinking of staying the whole night?
- Yeah. Is that a problem?

403
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:31,912
No.

404
00:42:33,524 --> 00:42:35,056
Come.

405
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,528
You can get ready and lie down.

406
00:42:57,352 --> 00:42:58,740
Shouldn't we just have
a drink first?

407
00:43:00,064 --> 00:43:02,676
Do you need alcohol to have sex?

408
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:04,500
No.

409
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:07,024
Good. Get ready.

410
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:10,332
Okay.

411
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:29,348
- What do you like best?
- What?

412
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:33,016
- What do you like best?
- I don't know.

413
00:43:34,016 --> 00:43:37,264
I prefer missionary with
my legs in a certain way.

414
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,536
I don't like being touched, but
I can touch you how you want.

415
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,036
I don't want to kiss,
but oral sex is good.

416
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:50,252
Do you have any wishes?

417
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:53,556
No. That sounds damn good.

418
00:44:14,272 --> 00:44:18,592
- Do you want to borrow my toothbrush?
- Your toothbrush or a toothbrush?

419
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,256
- My toothbrush.
- No thanks.

420
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,184
- You look tired.
- Do I?

421
00:44:24,684 --> 00:44:27,256
- Yes.
- I just slept badly.

422
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:31,264
Or else the orgasm usually
drains the muscles of energy -

423
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:35,328
- and makes a man
feel exhausted.

424
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:37,792
Thanks for that really great
information, Wiki -

425
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:41,460
- but I have a little bit
of a sleeping problem.

426
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,348
- Are you ready to roll?
- Yes.

427
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:50,588
- Do we tell people at work?
- Do we tell people what at work?

428
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:56,580
That we've had sex.
Does one tell people that at work?

429
00:44:57,784 --> 00:45:00,496
- One doesn't tell.
- Okay.

430
00:45:07,192 --> 00:45:08,028
Marc?

431
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:17,820
Dammit.

432
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:57,328
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

433
00:45:57,828 --> 00:46:01,644
I let you sleep.
Do you want breakfast?

434
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,216
- No, but coffee would be good.
- You must eat.

435
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:10,028
I made scrambled eggs. Sit down.

436
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,760
Coffee ...

437
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:24,764
Have you already decided who
will be in charge of the funeral?

438
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:27,584
Why haven't you called?

439
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:29,584
I don't understand what you mean.

440
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,372
I have a funeral business.

441
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:37,552
Ah, I didn't know that.

442
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:43,436
I told you after the
reading in Södertälje.

443
00:46:44,076 --> 00:46:47,028
Oh yeah. I had forgotten that.

444
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,964
- I haven't really gotten that far.
- No, that's clear.

445
00:46:54,464 --> 00:47:00,048
But when you're ready,
I can take care of it all for you.

446
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:04,444
Thanks.

447
00:47:08,152 --> 00:47:12,400
Karin Pettersson is coming today. Hans'
ex-wife. They were together 20 years.

448
00:47:12,616 --> 00:47:13,644
Good.

449
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:26,156
This should tell us something. The
placement of the bodies. The lighting.

450
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:33,316
Maybe that's the meaning.

451
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:37,044
It's not who, but how.

452
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,764
Maybe it's a coincidence
that it's these three.

453
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,292
The person shot Aleksander Dover
to get a hold of Hans.

454
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:50,508
But no one can come up with
a connection between the three.

455
00:47:58,812 --> 00:47:59,460
Saga.

456
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,624
- I want to ask you a favor.
- What?

457
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,060
I want to ask you to
look at a case.

458
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:13,528
- What is it?
- An investigation. A cold case.

459
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,284
It's actually closed. Archived.

460
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:19,000
- Totally Danish?
- Yeah.

461
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,536
2009. Missing persons.

462
00:48:25,144 --> 00:48:29,244
- Why should I look at it?
- Because you might find something new.

463
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:31,624
- Was it your case?
- No.

464
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:36,324
I've checked all the cars that passed
the surveillance camera that day.

465
00:48:36,824 --> 00:48:40,920
- A white van. Guess whose it is.
- I don't guess.

466
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,828
The youth center where Lukas works.
I recognize the license plate.

467
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:51,172
Come.

468
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:55,788
- Will you look at it?
- When I get time.

469
00:48:56,272 --> 00:48:57,880
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

470
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:09,516
- Yeah, it's our car.
- Who drove it?

471
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:14,172
It could be anyone here.
The keys hang in a key cabinet.

472
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:17,100
- Is it not locked?
- No.

473
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:20,724
But everyone writes in the
driver's log, which is in the car.

474
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,548
Here.

475
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:28,260
Sorry. It's empty.

476
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:34,116
The 5th here at 4:50
it was at 181,320 kilometers.

477
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:39,708
And the next one is the
day after at 10:30 -

478
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:42,732
- and it was at 181,565.

479
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:47,244
So someone had also driven
245 kilometers that night.

480
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:50,276
- And you don't know who.
- I have no idea.

481
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,260
- Was that all?
- Yeah. You can go.

482
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,868
We'll stay and wait for the technicians.
So they can take the car.

483
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:16,672
- Hello?
- Hi.

484
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:20,200
Welcome home.

485
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,792
- How did it go in Copenhagen?
- Good, thanks.

486
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:27,312
- Did you meet up with Ulrik and Gunilla?
- No, I was too busy.

487
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:31,720
- Hi, Mom.
- What the hell are you doing to me?

488
00:50:32,724 --> 00:50:37,548
- I've just come home from Copenhagen.
- Are you near a computer?

489
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:41,248
Look at Aftonposten,
then call me.

490
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:05,396
EUROVISION STAR HAS
SECRET TRYST IN COPENHAGEN.

491
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:46,144
What did you say her name was?

492
00:51:46,576 --> 00:51:50,724
Her name is Helle Anker.
His name is Lars Ove Abrahamsson.

493
00:51:54,784 --> 00:51:58,288
No. Sorry.

494
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,516
Listen ...

495
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:05,652
You've worked together
with Hans a long time now.

496
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:07,624
Yes.

497
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:12,016
Have you met his new wife?
Lillian?

498
00:52:12,516 --> 00:52:14,968
- Yes, many times.
- Karin.

499
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:20,676
We want to know if there's a connection
between your ex-husband and these two.

500
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:23,532
Why did the same person
want to hurt them?

501
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,976
I understand, but I can't
be of help, unfortunately.

502
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:31,172
What is she like? Lillian?

503
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:34,280
What is she like?

504
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:39,244
She's nice. Police Chief
in Copenhagen. Younger than you.

505
00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:44,520
It all went so fast.

506
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,228
Wedding and new flat
and all of that.

507
00:52:47,944 --> 00:52:52,480
I can understand that. If you
think of anything else -

508
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,380
- please call us.

509
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:06,824
Was he different with her?

510
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,932
He came late now and then. He didn't
do that when you were married.

511
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:14,916
I understand.

512
00:53:16,644 --> 00:53:18,228
Yeah, many thanks for coming.

513
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:27,832
Saga. Will you come with me?

514
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:30,312
- What are we doing?
- Just come now.

515
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,164
- What are we doing here?
- The memorial service is here.

516
00:54:10,984 --> 00:54:14,664
- I know that, but I don't want to be here.
- I support you.

517
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:19,780
I think that it's
important to say goodbye.

518
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,448
I can't!

519
00:54:56,272 --> 00:55:01,736
Research shows that physical contact
can hasten awakening.

520
00:55:03,832 --> 00:55:06,808
And familiar sounds such as voices.

521
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:10,044
So I can tell you
what's happening at work.

522
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,680
Linn, your replacement, wanted me
to go to my dad's memorial service -

523
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,316
- but I couldn't.

524
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,680
My mom ...

525
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:33,644
My mom made my sister
sick in front of me.

526
00:55:36,016 --> 00:55:40,720
Everything pointed to Münchhausen By
Proxy. I had to get her away from there.

527
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:43,976
Otherwise I was afraid that
she would die.

528
00:55:50,276 --> 00:55:54,232
I couldn't have done differently.

529
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:02,992
Hans ... It would be really good
if you woke up now.

530
00:56:08,152 --> 00:56:09,260
Hans.

531
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,508
Who was that with
Lukas Stenstrup?

532
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:26,820
His name is Mehmet. It was he
who drove the car the night of the 6th.

533
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,524
Did he say why?

534
00:56:29,024 --> 00:56:30,996
Yeah. He had to visit
his girlfriend in Lund -

535
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:34,820
- but one cannot use the
car for private purposes.

536
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,056
Maja Nyrén, the girlfriend, confirms
that Mehmet was there until 4:00.

537
00:56:41,056 --> 00:56:44,444
It fits with the times on the camera.
But we cannot rely on one person.

538
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:49,192
See if Øresundsbroen has photos,
and if one can see the driver.

539
00:56:49,648 --> 00:56:51,568
Okay.

540
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,372
Good work.

541
00:56:55,768 --> 00:56:58,452
- I'm not in trouble, right?
- Fuck no.

542
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:02,964
- Who really had the car?
- Just get in.

543
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,972
Reported Missing

544
