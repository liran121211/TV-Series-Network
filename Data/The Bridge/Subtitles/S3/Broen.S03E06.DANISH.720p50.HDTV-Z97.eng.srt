PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:08,644
- What is it?
- It looks like a burn mark.

3
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:12,608
- You may have missed something.
- You can just see it there.

4
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:14,864
Goodbye, Dad.

5
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:19,780
- What are you doing here?
- We fuck. Surely we can be seen together.

6
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:25,324
And therefore we've donated money so the
museum can build a whole new wing.

7
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:28,800
- There's only a week left.
- Jeanette has moved in.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,676
But I shouldn't meet her.

9
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:33,504
Why do I need to be here?
It's not fucking okay!

10
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:36,768
Not smuggling bags.
Not racing on the forest roads.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,424
It's my son you have in your belly.

12
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:46,496
- She's just using you.
- She isn't. She loves me.

13
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:51,320
Was it the first time?
For god's sake, Anna, with Benjamin?

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,916
- Anna.
- She had her fun.

15
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,936
She got caught, and now it's over.

16
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:01,856
- What were you talking to Linn about?
- You, of course.

17
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:05,192
That you drove your
little sister to suicide.

18
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:13,376
- The brand marks resemble characters.
- It's the Babylonian number system.

19
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:17,332
I've thought about
where I'm happy -

20
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,256
- and that's with you.

21
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:21,920
I love you.

22
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,584
EPISODE 6

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,320
There. Now you can go in.

24
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:41,004
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, Love.

25
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:43,900
Hi.

26
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,032
- Did Håkan not pick her up?
- He didn't.

27
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:56,624
- The school called several times.
- I turned off my phone.

28
00:01:57,124 --> 00:02:03,152
- Where is Håkan?
- He wrote that he went to the summer house.

29
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,984
- I'll call him.
- Don't do that.

30
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:09,412
A day or two to himself
could be good for him.

31
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:11,552
And for you.

32
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,880
So you have a chance
to get it together a little.

33
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:18,560
Mom ... He died.

34
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:22,256
- Benjamin died.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:25,984
But there are many of
us who need you.

36
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,804
THE BRIDGE

37
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:20,264
There is a connection between the killings
of Helle Anker, Lars-Ove Abrahamsson -

38
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,292
- the attempted murder of
Police Chief Hans Pettersson -

39
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,252
- and the shootings of Aleksander Dover
and Morten Anker.

40
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:34,352
We ask people to contact us if
they've seen anything.

41
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,448
You already know how
Helle Anker was found.

42
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:42,392
She sat at a table together with
three dolls: a man and two children.

43
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:47,144
Hans Pettersson was strung up outside of
the ghost train in an amusement park.

44
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:52,540
Crucified or like a scarecrow.
There aren't any religious motives.

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,204
Lars-Ove Abrahamsson
sat in a beach chair in an empty pool.

46
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:06,608
- What are the similarities between them?
- I can't comment on the details.

47
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:36,152
The brand marks in the
victims' mouths were numbers.

48
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:40,300
The Babylonian number system.
It's 3500 years old.

49
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,180
It's a base-60 number system.
There's no character for zero.

50
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,648
The code on Morten Anker's refrigerator.

51
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,336
Sorry. Visitor.

52
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,232
Hi.

53
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:28,732
I think I know something about
the murders you're investigating.

54
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:35,524
Well?

55
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:38,984
I saw the press conference on tv.

56
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,512
The first one ... Helle ...

57
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,616
- Helle Anker.
- Yeah. I saw the photos on the internet.

58
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:51,580
It made me think of a Dutch
painter named Waarheid.

59
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:55,348
It's a pseudonym that means
'truth' in Dutch.

60
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,044
- Why are we talking about him?
- He made a piece.

61
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,896
There's a room with a man -

62
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:06,124
- and around him hang marionettes
of women and children.

63
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:08,144
- What's the point?
- Sorry.

64
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:12,944
The point is, the piece is
called 'The Perfect Family'.

65
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:16,780
- That means ...
- We understand what it means.

66
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,548
There's also another piece
called 'The Nightmare'.

67
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:23,576
It's a scarecrow in a
big pile of birdseed -

68
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:30,096
- which is surrounded by dead birds
that didn't dare to eat anything.

69
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:32,664
Keep going. It's fine.

70
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,452
Frank Nielsen painted
'A Day at the Beach'.

71
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:42,128
It's an abstract painting,
but that's what it's called.

72
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,300
Do you understand what I'm thinking?

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,608
You think that some of the murders
are inspired by the titles of the artwork.

74
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:50,932
Yes.

75
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:55,560
Every crime in the world
could be named after works of art.

76
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:01,800
If you have a dead person
who has a little smile on -

77
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:03,536
- you could call that 'Mona Lisa'.

78
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:08,240
- Sure, it ...
- In principle, you could do that.

79
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,168
Thanks so much for coming.
It's always good to get some tips.

80
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:18,632
- Do the pieces have anything in common?
- No, they don't.

81
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:23,024
But they all belong to Freddie Holst and are
on exhibition at the museum where I work.

82
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:27,488
We want to see that exhibition.
Now. Immediately.

83
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:37,320
- You're not allergic, are you?
- No.

84
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:38,832
Thanks.

85
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,432
Hi.

86
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:46,752
I'm Jeanette.

87
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,640
- Is the kitchen in the guest house broken?
- It's nicer with company.

88
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,312
I can make sure that someone
from the staff eats down there.

89
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,552
- I think I'll go.
- No, you stay here.

90
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:10,944
You may come and go as you please.
I apologize on my wife's behalf.

91
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:12,792
I'm going.

92
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,644
What the hell is going on with you?

93
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:26,616
You're going to listen to the radio now?

94
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,744
Honestly, Åsa.

95
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,872
The silent treatment?
What are you, twelve years old?

96
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,760
And Swedish radio ...

97
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,892
What a mess.

98
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,636
How long did you follow
Anna Ekdahl to get the photos?

99
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,160
I got a tip that she was in Copenhagen.

100
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,180
I wish I'd never gotten it.
I'm getting death threats on the internet.

101
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,696
- Twitter is like a hate competition.
- Tina, he died. Benjamin, he died.

102
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:21,768
- And how exactly is that my fault?
- You took the photos.

103
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,176
Tina.

104
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:31,272
Cross your fingers for me.

105
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,680
Here we have 'A Day at the Beach',
Frank Nielsen.

106
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,744
It's said that the artist placed
four animals in the painting -

107
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:54,444
- but I can't see them.

108
00:10:54,992 --> 00:10:59,880
- How many pieces do you have here?
- 32.

109
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:04,728
Do you know the names of all of them?
Can you make a list?

110
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:08,808
- Now.
- Of course.

111
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:16,368
Do you think there's anything to this?

112
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:23,672
- It's the best we have right now.
- So Holst, too.

113
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,324
And you think this has something
to do with my art?

114
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:42,824
- Maybe.
- You don't know any of those people?

115
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,632
I've never seen them,
never heard about them.

116
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:50,280
Is there anyone who's threatened you?

117
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,568
- Do you know what I do?
- Not in detail.

118
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:59,640
I make companies profitable.

119
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,760
- By firing people?
- Yeah, sometimes.

120
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:07,680
Sometimes I restructure the
company, downsize, outsource.

121
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:11,520
I do what's necessary and don't let
emotions get in the way.

122
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:16,080
- Not everyone appreciated it.
- My father didn't appreciate it.

123
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:19,560
- Did I buy your father's business?
- No, not you. Someone like you.

124
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,464
- Ah, someone like me.
- Yeah.

125
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:27,724
We want a list of the businesses
you have worked with in the last few years.

126
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:31,656
Of course, but it's quite a few
and still a little far-fetched.

127
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,000
Does this mean anything to you?

128
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:43,992
It's the account number of
my secret account in Switzerland.

129
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:49,848
No, I'm joking with you.
I don't have any accounts in Switzerland.

130
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:02,644
Sorry. He's pressing on my
bladder all the time.

131
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:06,216
It doesn't matter.
I like looking at you.

132
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:10,392
- Claes ...
- Can't I say that you're beautiful?

133
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:14,140
- Pregnancy suits you.
- Thanks.

134
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,096
It's so nice to see
how well you're doing.

135
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:21,056
- It's been going well for a while.
- I know. I read about you.

136
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,232
I follow you on Facebook.

137
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:34,852
Do you feel uncomfortable
with me and Freddie?

138
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:38,768
I would be lying if I said
that it didn't give me a little pain -

139
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:42,164
- but the important thing is
that you're happy.

140
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:47,092
- Are you happy?
- What kind of question is that?

141
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:51,536
It's a question we should ask ourselves
and our loved ones more often.

142
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,616
Yes, I'm happy.

143
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:05,644
- Okay. Have you heard my talks?
- No.

144
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:09,388
I have a talk tomorrow in Malmo
if you want to come and listen.

145
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:11,984
We'll see. Maybe.

146
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:17,716
- Thanks for lunch, and for the company.
- It was really nice.

147
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,240
- Fucking hell.
- She's only going to hurt you again.

148
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,920
She let you down once. She's having
children with the guy who crushed you.

149
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:40,468
Why are you seeing her at all?

150
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,836
Wait a minute. Everything about
you has been strange -

151
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:47,456
- but this crosses the fucking line.

152
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:49,576


153
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:51,748
- Sorry, but someone has to ...
- No, you don't need to do anything.

154
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,452
I felt flattered by your attention,
but this ...

155
00:14:56,952 --> 00:15:01,208
- Out of the car. Out! Out!
- We're in Denmark.

156
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:06,004
You came here, so you can
get back. Out of the car.

157
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:09,604
Out, for fuck's sake! Close the door!

158
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:35,124
John checked up on Claes Sandberg,
Freddie Holst's former partner.

159
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:38,576
- Why former?
- He had alcohol problems.

160
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:43,040
Holst sent him to rehab.
So Holst could take care of the business -

161
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,912
- he took over Sandberg's part. When
he got full control, he sold it.

162
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:52,300
- Nice guy, huh?
- Sandberg got less than half.

163
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:55,344
He also lost the art he'd
bought with his wife.

164
00:15:55,492 --> 00:16:00,388
Three years later, Holst also married
Åsa, Claes Sandberg's ex-wife.

165
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,608
Bring him in for questioning.

166
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:12,608
I understand that you're skeptical,
but it was for the best that it happened.

167
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:18,772
It took several years to realize it,
and yes, I hated Freddie -

168
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:22,368
- I admit it.
But happiness is a choice.

169
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:28,352
- He stole your joint business.
- No.

170
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:31,448
He stole a portion of the
profits from the sale.

171
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:35,404
- You lost all your art.
- Yes, among other things.

172
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:40,084
- And your wife.
- He didn't steal her. She left me.

173
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,896
- She left you for him.
- She would have left me anyway.

174
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:47,212
You have to understand
what state I was in.

175
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:52,036
I was deeply unhappy. I made
Åsa unhappy, and I drank.

176
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:57,844
When Freddie betrayed me, I had
to realize what was important in life.

177
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:01,232
- So you chose happiness.
- Yeah.

178
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:05,256
But like I said, it took time.

179
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,628
Are you happy?

180
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,936
- Who, me?
- Yes.

181
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:14,760
Are you serious?

182
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:19,540
- Are you happy?
- Define happiness.

183
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,740
Happiness is a lasting
feeling of well-being

184
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,520
- that is independent of external
circumstances, positive or negative.

185
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:33,432
Okay. You know what, Jesus?
I think the interview is over.

186
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:13,080
- Do you like it?
- Sorry. I was just curious.

187
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:17,856
It's okay. Of course you
can see the nursery.

188
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:20,256
We've done everything so
that he'll lack nothing.

189
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:24,264
Yeah. I can see that.

190
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:27,912
Here.

191
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,280
Only for Marc.

192
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:34,344
Yeah.

193
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:43,420
- Is there anything wrong?
- No.

194
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:45,672
It's stupid, but ...

195
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:49,968
I'd imagined that my child
would have a green room.

196
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:54,000
- It's not your child.
- No, of course.

197
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,592
I didn't mean it that way.

198
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:03,120
But I agree with you that green
is better. And now it's two against one.

199
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,128
Is he kicking?

200
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:12,480
- No. I think he's sleeping.
- May I feel anyway?

201
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:18,768
Um ... Yeah. Of course.

202
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:30,840
Oh!

203
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,680
The search at Sandberg's place
didn't yield anything. Let him go.

204
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,920
- Have we checked his alibi?
- Of course.

205
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,232
The night Helle Anker was killed,
he was in Varberg.

206
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:55,760
When Morten Anker was shot, he was
in Borås. There's no link to the victims.

207
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,748
Do we really believe all that about
Holst? All we have are the titles of the art.

208
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:06,680
- It's too early to write him off.
- Especially now.

209
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,884
What is it?

210
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,624
The list of companies Holst
has done business with.

211
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:15,324
- Number four from the bottom.
- Andersen TL.

212
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,196
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

213
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:32,308
- What were you reading?
- When?

214
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:36,844
Yesterday. When I came. You said
you were reading something or other.

215
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:39,344
Why do you want to know that?

216
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:44,208
It hit me that we have sex, but
I don't know anything about you.

217
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:48,388
- That's the way I want it.
- Why?

218
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:53,376
Everyone I've been close to
has left me and/or hurt me.

219
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:56,832
Okay.

220
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:12,392
'Psychology: The Science of Mind
and Behavior', Nigel Holt.

221
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,440
A year ago, we needed capital
and so Freddie Holst came in.

222
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:27,072
Wasn't it you who started the business?
And then he took control?

223
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:31,272
Yeah, but it was either that
or bankruptcy. We were lucky.

224
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:34,704
Does it have to do with the murders?
Why are we talking about Freddie?

225
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:38,764
Has he made major changes
since he arrived?

226
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:41,304
Saga, just continue.
I'll be there in a minute.

227
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:43,564
Has he?

228
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:14,712
Many of the things from the
crime scene are in the catalog.

229
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:18,652
- And that helps us how?
- The order form on the back is missing.

230
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:26,172
- What did he say in there?
- Eight were fired. Two were warned.

231
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,384
He stopped working with
two suppliers.

232
00:23:30,796 --> 00:23:33,176
So at least ten have reason to dislike Holst.

233
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:37,492
- Why don't you like him?
- I don't like his type.

234
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:41,376
- What's his type?
- He's one of those who are raking it in.

235
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:46,400
Making money in a capitalist economy
is probably not that bad.

236
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:49,152
Can I not get permission to
dislike the man?

237
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:49,924
Sure.

238
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:54,864
- There are people you don't like.
- No, not without reason.

239
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:04,036
Hi. Rasmus Larsson.
It's good you could come.

240
00:24:04,536 --> 00:24:07,784
- It's regarding the threat.
- What threat?

241
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:12,032
Then I must have misunderstood.

242
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:17,600
Saga was at my place last night.
It was very unpleasant.

243
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,984
I'd like to hear more about that.

244
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:26,644
But first I want to discuss
the investigation and trial -

245
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:32,144
- which led to you lose custody
of your other daughter, Jennifer.

246
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,344
332-3948 ...

247
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:41,928
And 337-3951 ...

248
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:49,248
And finally there's a fire truck.
112-9833.

249
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:55,176
And when was that?
Yeah, good.

250
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,192
And where was that sent to?

251
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:06,216
There was one order with all the things. It
was sent to a postbox in Malmo in August.

252
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,984
And you know whose postbox it is?

253
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:15,624
I don't understand ...

254
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:21,964
Toys from the crime scenes were sent to
your business. You don't understand that?

255
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,488
Sure, sure, but to whom?

256
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:28,776
Those you dismissed, they were
still here in August, weren't they?

257
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:34,104
Yes. They were dismissed,
but they continued until September 1st.

258
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:39,892
We need a list of employees, as well
as terminations and warnings.

259
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:41,184
Of course.

260
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,160
Who empties your postbox?

261
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:45,648
Usually it's Kjell Söder.

262
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:49,896
He was the first at work the morning
after Helle Anker was killed.

263
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:54,460
- Is he working today?
- No, he quit.

264
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,640
He was going to travel.

265
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,160
- When did he stop working?
- About a week ago.

266
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:05,496
That day you were at the business,
that was his last day.

267
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:27,032
- The newspaper ended our collaboration.
- That's what Matilda said.

268
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,996
Is it worse to take photos
than to publish them?

269
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:35,072
It's not, but Matilda needs
to make it look that way.

270
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:38,528
I've called around.
I can't get work.

271
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,408
- What should I do?
- You can buy my photos.

272
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:46,304
Tina! I can't do that.
You're screwed.

273
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:50,304
I'm sorry. Really.

274
00:26:57,012 --> 00:26:59,120
[Hidden number]

275
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,712
Anna Ekdahl (Eurovision 1996)
is in Copenhagen with her lover ...

276
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:11,380
- Hello, it's John.
- Hi, John.

277
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,416
- It's Tina.
- I can hear that. Thanks for last time.

278
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:20,312
Can you help me with
a phone number?

279
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:24,144
I've received threats.

280
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:48,368
What was Rasmus Larsson doing here?
Don't you know what he's done?

281
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,176
Everyone makes mistakes, Saga.
He is aware of it.

282
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:54,124
He put the whole case at stake.

283
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:57,584
- After that episode.
- It wasn't an incident. It was an infraction.

284
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:00,844
Please stop interrupting me.

285
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:04,640
After that episode, Rasmus worked for
me and did exemplary work.

286
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,816
- Everybody deserves a second chance.
- So he should work with us now?

287
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:14,352
- No, he's helping me with something else.
- What?

288
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,300
- Do we still have nothing after that press conference?
- No, not yet.

289
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,772
And what about Kjell Söder?

290
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:25,872
No previous convictions,
no connection to the victims.

291
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,016
I had hoped that we would be
closer to solving this. Don't you agree?

292
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,976
I don't know how much
closer you were hoping for.

293
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:42,288
Let me say that I had
higher expectations.

294
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:57,800
I know something about the murders.

295
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,672
Can we meet? 6:45. Come alone or I'll
go. Reply when you're there.

296
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,352
Arrived

297
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:14,188
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- Saga, it's Lillian.

298
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:18,512
- Hans is on a respirator.
- Did he stop breathing?

299
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:23,568
Yes, all of a sudden. They've done
tests, but they don't know what it is.

300
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:29,280
- His autonomic nervous system isn't working.
- Yes, but they don't know why.

301
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:34,872
- I don't either.
- No, that's clear.

302
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:38,760
I thought you'd want to know.

303
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:44,184
Yes, I would. Thanks.

304
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:23,624
What's up, turtle doves? John,
did Saga say where she was going?

305
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:25,564
No.

306
00:31:26,064 --> 00:31:29,376
- I'm going to step out and call her.
- You do that.

307
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,332
Did you look up that hidden number
that I asked you about?

308
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:40,328
I don't normally do this, but
when you've received threats ...

309
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:43,636
Her name is Eva Rosenqvist.

310
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:48,384
She has three numbers.
Do you know her?

311
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:52,972
No, I'm just surprised.

312
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:56,360
It's usually guys
do these things.

313
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,600
Hey, you. I'm out with
John and Tina.

314
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,812
We're having a beer.
Do you want to come?

315
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:10,776
- No, I don't like beer.
- You and I could just do something else.

316
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:16,032
- No, I want to be alone.
- Not even a little sex?

317
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:20,520
- No.
- Okay.

318
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:21,992
See you tomorrow.

319
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:23,880
Yeah.

320
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:43,616
It was him. It was the boyfriend.
Benjamin.

321
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:48,032
The number I got a tip about Anna
from belongs to Benjamin's mother -

322
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:51,416
- but I've checked, and
it's his phone.

323
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:57,584
- Why would he give you a tip?
- To make Anna's husband jealous.

324
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,320
His plan backfired.

325
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,928
But he wanted the photos to be
published, and people must know.

326
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:10,108
You cannot blame a dead teenager.

327
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:15,224
Should everyone living with his suicide
know that he was responsible as well?

328
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:23,096
- Now everyone thinks it was my fault.
- You'd be giving a dead boy the blame.

329
00:33:24,748 --> 00:33:29,768
It won't make your situation better.
Just worse for everyone else.

330
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:54,108
- Hi. Eva Rosenqvist?
- Yes.

331
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,388
I want to talk ...

332
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:02,592
It wasn't my fault
that your son died.

333
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:07,760
What? Did you know Benjamin?

334
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,000
No, I'm ... I'm a photographer,
and he ...

335
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,452
He tipped me off about an address
that I should ...

336
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:21,840
What do you mean,
it wasn't your fault?

337
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,408
Nothing.

338
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:28,664
- I'm so sorry.
- Wait.

339
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:31,636
Who are you?

340
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,520
Wait! Who the fuck are you?

341
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,712
Hey there.

342
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:52,132
- Who found him?
- The cleaning woman over there.

343
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,472
Make sure she stays here.
I want to talk to her.

344
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:58,872
She's pretty shaken up,
but that's understandable.

345
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,736
- Hit the cat out of the barrel ...
- What is that?

346
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:24,792
Hit the cat out of the barrel is a game
played in Denmark for Shrovetide.

347
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:30,000
You have a barrel with a cat inside.
The children hit it with clubs until it breaks.

348
00:35:30,844 --> 00:35:34,400
- Out falls a bunch of candy.
- Like a piñata.

349
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,576
Yeah.

350
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,384
Why is there a cat inside?

351
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,716
In the old days, there was
a living cat in the barrel.

352
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:03,744
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

353
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,720
What happens when that hits zero?

354
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:28,780
We found this in his pants.

355
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:41,880
Håkan Ekdahl.

356
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:49,256
- When did you see him last?
- The night before last. He was at Anna's.

357
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:54,772
- We want to talk to your daughter.
- Is that really necessary?

358
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,240
Yes.

359
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:00,368
She's in the bedroom.
She's taken something to calm her.

360
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:04,856
Be careful. She's very
fragile right now.

361
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:11,212
- Then perhaps you should talk to her.
- Why is that?

362
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:15,676
Linn says that this sort of interaction
with other people isn't my strong side.

363
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:19,344
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

364
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,724
Why didn't your daughter report
him missing if he was gone?

365
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:27,824
He had written that he
went to the summer house.

366
00:37:28,824 --> 00:37:31,204
We thought that he
wanted a little time to himself.

367
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:34,272
Why did you think that?

368
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:40,376
Anna was unfaithful to Håkan.
He had just found out.

369
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,416
Who was she unfaithful with?

370
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,764
A young man. But he's also dead.

371
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:51,768
He committed suicide. There ...

372
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:54,224
A lot has happened.

373
00:37:55,224 --> 00:37:58,104
We need the address
to the summer house.

374
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,604
A gymnasium. A man
was killed with a wooden club.

375
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:06,704
A Danish game called
'Hit the Cat Out of the Barrel' -

376
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,612
- and a clock that counts down.
Does that mean anything to you?

377
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:14,576
No, I don't know ...
Yes, the clock that counts down.

378
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:20,212
There is a piece of Eduardo Paolazzi's
called 'Countdown to Disappointment'.

379
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:23,552
- That means ...
- I know English. Is it hanging in the museum?

380
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,860
No, it's hanging at Holst's house.

381
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,924
How do you know that?

382
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:33,216
We were there to pick
up the other artwork.

383
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:35,448
Thanks.

384
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,936
- That strengthens the connection to Holst.
- Yeah.

385
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,856
Thanks.

386
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:00,872
- Sorry, what are you doing here?
- We're going to paint.

387
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,616
- I don't think so. It was just painted.
- It was us who did it.

388
00:39:05,116 --> 00:39:08,548
- But now it will also be green.
- Green?

389
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:14,640
- Who said that?
- Freddie ... He called yesterday.

390
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:40,032
Hi!

391
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,400
Oh, I've missed you.

392
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,464
Are you okay?
Can you stand being here?

393
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:52,944
Freddie's fine. It's just his wife.
She doesn't like me.

394
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:56,256
But it's okay. What are you up to?

395
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:59,284
- Making some plans for the house.
- I'm so looking forward to it.

396
00:39:59,784 --> 00:40:00,840
Are you okay, Jeanette?

397
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,000
I don't want you here, Marc.
It makes Jeanette restless.

398
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:11,280
And she needs peace and quiet.

399
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:13,848
Do you think she seemed
restless and upset?

400
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:20,288
Jeanette is my girlfriend, so you
must live with my being here.

401
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:23,160
You'll get 30,000 if you keep away.

402
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:24,840
Are you taking the piss?

403
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,384
That's the maximum. A few weeks.

404
00:40:27,436 --> 00:40:31,752
Buy something that can numb the pain
or otherwise entertain you.

405
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:37,200
- 40,000.
- 30.

406
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:42,168
I subtract 1000 for every word you say.
So we're down to 28,000.

407
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:44,568
Nod if you agree.

408
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:53,472
Come on.

409
00:41:05,384 --> 00:41:06,984
Hi.

410
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:08,394
Police.

411
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:11,984
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

412
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:15,008
- What do you want?
- Have you seen this man?

413
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:19,516
- Yeah, that's Håkan. Isn't he here?
- No.

414
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:23,840
- His car is parked over there.
- I'll call the technicians.

415
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,084
He was here yesterday.
I saw that he had a visitor.

416
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:30,820
The car was in the driveway.

417
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,636
- What kind of car was it?
- No idea.

418
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:38,376
- It was yellow, anyway.
- Thanks.

419
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:41,520
- Kjell Söder's car is yellow.
- Yeah.

420
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,988
Kjell Söder. Do we know where he is?

421
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:49,664
He didn't leave anything behind.
He had a ticket to Singapore on the 8th.

422
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,452
- Do we know if he took the flight?
- Not yet.

423
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,956
- Connections to the victims?
- No.

424
00:41:57,388 --> 00:42:00,696
- Hi there.
- What are you doing here?

425
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:04,608
I was passing by and thought
that you would want to see this.

426
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,544
The brand mark on the
victim in the gymnasium.

427
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,076
- It's a four.
- So that's the whole code, then.

428
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:20,040
If he has a number or character for
each victim, we have three to go.

429
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:21,892
Maybe.

430
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:26,212
The cause of death was blunt
force to the head and body.

431
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:31,132
I can't say how many hits
he got, but it was many.

432
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,880
He had an extra penis in his underwear.

433
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,752
It will be DNA-examined, but I
think it's Lars-Ove Abrahamsson's.

434
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:43,660
What about Håkan?
Was he missing any body parts?

435
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,616
Two. Both eyes were taken.

436
00:42:47,908 --> 00:42:49,176
Was there anything else?

437
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:54,552
- Not unless you have questions.
- No.

438
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:04,108
Helle Anker, heart.
Hans, hand.

439
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:08,212
Lars-Ove Abrahamsson, penis.

440
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,532
Håkan Ekdahl, eyes.

441
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:16,668
The body parts seem to have another
function besides being trophies.

442
00:43:17,168 --> 00:43:20,280
We've touched on symbolism before.

443
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:24,672
So Helle Anker, she's heartless.

444
00:43:25,948 --> 00:43:28,348
What about Hans and the hand?

445
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:31,084
The long arm of the law.

446
00:43:31,584 --> 00:43:33,984
Yeah, if there's anyone who still
calls the police that today.

447
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:38,264
Lars-Ove Abrahamsson, abuse.

448
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:41,976
What about Håkan Ekdahl?

449
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:47,376
Something he saw.
Something he should have seen, perhaps.

450
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:51,312
What about the artwork?

451
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:03,820
- Do the victims have a connection to Holst?
- No.

452
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,488
It's there. We just haven't found it.

453
00:44:10,228 --> 00:44:13,252
- What were the workers doing here?
- You know why.

454
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:17,140
- I don't know why.
- I want another color.

455
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,844
- Right after she moved in?
- Yes, we've talked about it.

456
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:26,092
She shouldn't be in there.
What does she have to do with the color?

457
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:29,552
- I thought it was boring.
- So my choice was boring.

458
00:44:30,288 --> 00:44:33,460
Yeah, it was fucking boring, Åsa.
It was unimaginative.

459
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,120
Okay. Is there anything else she'll do?
Does she like the furniture?

460
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,976
- What about the car? Are my clothes okay?
- Shut up, Åsa.

461
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:47,712
- I will not shut up.
- Shut up now, I say.

462
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:50,328
It'll be okay.

463
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:59,648
- Hi. What's your name?
- Emelie.

464
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:02,888
Emelie. How are you?
Or wait. Now we'll see.

465
00:45:03,388 --> 00:45:06,420
Answer when I flip. Ready?

466
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,316
- One, two, three.
- Good.

467
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:11,788
'Good'!

468
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:16,468
Am I a mind reader? No.

469
00:45:16,968 --> 00:45:22,932
Or is it that people who come to
my talks actually have it good?

470
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:28,832
No. It's not like that.
The question is usually not sincere.

471
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:34,780
It's a kind of rhetorical agreement.
I want to hear 'good' -

472
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,468
- and that's what I get.

473
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,580
Hi. Welcome.

474
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,748
But try again to answer:

475
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:46,848
"I'm not doing so well today.

476
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:53,592
I'm not actually particularly
happy right now."

477
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:00,532
How would that feel?
Would it be hard? A little embarrassing?

478
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:07,320
People don't really want to
listen to my problems.

479
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:15,360
There's another alternative.
Say 'good' and mean it.

480
00:46:23,188 --> 00:46:26,648
- Did you not understand what I said?
- Do you want to hear something?

481
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:29,596
No, you should just go now.

482
00:46:30,096 --> 00:46:34,420
Blue marks and other signs of violence
can show up several hours after death.

483
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,580
If the victim isn't autopsied,
it might never be discovered.

484
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,424
Your dad had blue marks on the sides
of his nose. Bleeding on the upper lip.

485
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:49,204
It's damage that may occur
if you're being strangled.

486
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:52,088
I don't know what you're talking about.

487
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:57,120
I called the nursing home. You were
alone with him when he died.

488
00:46:57,152 --> 00:47:00,656
But don't worry. I painted over it.

489
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:05,068
You can even have an open
casket if you want.

490
00:47:05,568 --> 00:47:09,240
You can thank me by taking
me to dinner tonight.

491
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,696
Two minutes. Get rid of her.
I'll wait in the car.

492
00:47:21,196 --> 00:47:24,096
Annika ...

493
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,588
Hi. Nice of you to come.

494
00:47:32,088 --> 00:47:34,684
Thanks. It was interesting.

495
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:37,424
- A little vague for me ...
- Vague?

496
00:47:37,924 --> 00:47:41,336
A little unscientific, maybe.

497
00:47:41,836 --> 00:47:45,436
I'm the proof that it actually works.

498
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:48,100
I don't really know what you mean.

499
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,564
- Shall we go some place else?
- Yeah, no ...

500
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:54,484
I can't.

501
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:59,716
- Your girlfriend?
- No, she's nothing like that.

502
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:03,048
I actually came over to
Sweden for your sake.

503
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:07,496
I have some meetings.
I didn't think you'd come.

504
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:10,376
We'll do it another time. Okay?

505
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:13,584
Bye.

506
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:29,784
5000.

507
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:36,912
Are you in?

508
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:59,952
3200. And this.

509
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,984
I have bad news.

510
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:21,868
- Did something happen with Hans?
- No.

511
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:25,056
But they found your mother dead.

512
00:49:25,756 --> 00:49:28,848
It seems to be suicide.

513
00:49:29,668 --> 00:49:31,204
How?

514
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:35,664
She was found in her car in the
garage with the motor running.

515
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:43,520
I know that you've had
a strained relationship.

516
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,204
What did she say?

517
00:49:46,704 --> 00:49:52,224
You've lost both your parents in
a short period. It must affect you.

518
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:57,988
I don't know how yet.

519
00:49:58,488 --> 00:50:02,452
Tell me what you want to do.
If you want some downtime.

520
00:50:02,952 --> 00:50:06,580
- Take some time off.
- I don't want that.

521
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,264
Thanks.

522
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,928
I hope that you can hear this,
even if you've gotten worse.

523
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:49,800
Now my mom has killed herself, too.

524
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:55,464
Just like my sister, Jennifer.

525
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:07,104
I thought we were doing well,
Jennifer and I.

526
00:51:09,868 --> 00:51:12,216
But then ...

527
00:51:15,532 --> 00:51:21,624
She said that she was going to a friend's
house, but threw herself in front of a train.

528
00:51:25,468 --> 00:51:29,428
Yesterday we questioned a man
who defined happiness.

529
00:51:29,928 --> 00:51:34,704
I didn't recognize what he described
because I had never experienced it.

530
00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:39,560
Maybe that's why I
couldn't save Jennifer.

531
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,800
I couldn't see that
she wasn't happy.

532
00:51:46,084 --> 00:51:49,972
I'm sorry. You need to go. It's late.

533
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:54,724
I'm not disturbing him. It's good for him
if there's someone speaking to him.

534
00:51:55,224 --> 00:51:59,544
It's 11:00. Visiting hours are over.

535
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,828
- Saga?
- Can I come in?

536
00:52:26,328 --> 00:52:29,928
- You want to come in?
- Yes.

537
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:33,456
We can easily go somewhere
else that's open.

538
00:52:34,636 --> 00:52:37,516
Why can't I just come in?

539
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:39,048
It's really late.

540
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:43,464
It's just as late if
we go somewhere else.

541
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:51,000
Okay.

542
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:10,296
Why haven't you gotten rid
of their things?

543
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:17,308
It's six years ago that they disappeared.

544
00:53:17,836 --> 00:53:20,664
Yeah. It feels like giving up
if I throw them out.

545
00:53:21,124 --> 00:53:22,584
If their things are here -

546
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:26,976
- it's like they can
still come back again.

547
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:34,824
- That's irrational thinking.
- Yeah, I know that.

548
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:37,344
But I'm not particularly rational
when it comes to them.

549
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,984
Not at all, actually.

550
00:53:46,276 --> 00:53:50,452
Did something or other happen ...
Why did you come?

551
00:53:50,952 --> 00:53:54,772
My mom killed herself.
I was with Hans, but they kicked me out.

552
00:53:55,272 --> 00:53:57,364
Instead of going home I came here.

553
00:53:57,864 --> 00:53:59,904
Saga ...

554
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:11,160
You haven't thrown out anything.

555
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:17,836
If they came back, they will have
outgrown the clothes and toys.

556
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:21,384
They're not coming back. I know that.

557
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:24,312
Up there.

558
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:29,304
It's just ... It's the rest of me
that has trouble realizing it.

559
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,440
I need to find out what
happened to them.

560
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:38,784
That's why you got
the investigation.

561
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:52,632
So you're alone a lot.

562
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,408
At home, you mean?

563
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:57,696
Yeah. Or ...

564
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,800
I see them. Alice and the girls.

565
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:14,448
They're here in the house
with me. All the time.

566
00:55:16,516 --> 00:55:20,016
I talk to them,
and they talk to me.

567
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:26,400
- Are they here now?
- Only Alice.

568
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:30,216
The girls, they're sleeping.
In there.

569
00:55:31,432 --> 00:55:34,248
Where is she?

570
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,080
There.

571
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,756
- She talks to you?
- Yeah.

572
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:55,200
- But you already know what she'll say?
- Yeah.

573
00:55:58,924 --> 00:56:03,240
When we have sex, is it like
you're being unfaithful?

574
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,792
No.

575
00:56:08,884 --> 00:56:10,560
No, it's okay.

576
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,856
If we had sex here, would she see?

577
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:22,584
We're not going to have sex here. But
you're very welcome to stay and sleep.

578
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,344
Move over.

579
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:38,304
Do you want something to help you sleep?

580
00:56:38,908 --> 00:56:42,072
No. I can always sleep.

581
00:57:11,868 --> 00:57:14,736
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

582
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:29,952
Do you want a job?

583
00:57:35,884 --> 00:57:39,048
Documents. Good money.

584
00:57:43,324 --> 00:57:46,008
Tell me more.

585
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,168
