00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,772
Previously

2
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:07,348
The victim's name is Helle Anker.
Married and has a son with Natalie Anker -

3
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:10,728
- and from a previous marriage,
Morten Anker.

4
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:13,992
I didn't touch her!

5
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:18,912
What is your family life like?
Small talk.

6
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:20,644
The two of us are only going to
work together. Nothing else.

7
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:28,252
I know that you don't want to see me.
Saga, Dad is dying!

8
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,796
Jennifer is gone.
It's only us two left.

9
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:36,940
- The money is gone.
- Do you think I've taken it?

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,232
I'm going to run away.
They'll kill me if I stay here.

11
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:47,332
Helle Anker was a modern, lesbian woman
who would destroy the nuclear family -

12
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:50,496
- and I hope that her death also means -

13
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:54,480
- that her crazy ideas are buried with her.

14
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:56,160
Hope it's nice.

15
00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:01,876
- So let's go to your place.
- Okay.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,204
She lived in Valby. She's a store
manager, or works in an office.

17
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,340
See if you can get a little sleep.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,600
So now you need someone new over there.
So take me.

19
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:24,696
Read up on the case, get ready
and contact Saga Norén.

20
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:34,280
EPISODE 2

21
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,112
There were many reactions to your post
about Helle Anker's death.

22
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,152
- Yes, and many were positive.

23
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:46,800
So you maintain that you
are glad that she died?

24
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:52,272
I said I'm happy that we'll avoid
meaningless experiments with children

25
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:58,208
Can't it be that you're inspiring
people to 'solve' the problem?

26
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:04,152
Should we abolish free speech because
some can't interpret what we say?

27
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,652
- No, that isn't what I'm saying.
- Of course that's what you're saying.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,312
We're going to see a clip
that you put out during the week.

29
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:15,024
Do you think it's too much to ask
that our church have a clear message?

30
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,208
And that that message is based on God's word?
I don't think so.

31
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:24,072
I have nothing against homosexuals.
You know that.

32
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:28,752
Of course they should have the same
legal rights as the rest of us.

33
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,872
But why should they get
married in the church?

34
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,696
That question I ask you,
Fabian Christensen.

35
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:39,288
I now declare you
to be a married couple -

36
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:42,672
- to both God and man.

37
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:47,280
You are a priest and a prominent
advocate for gay marriage.

38
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,232
I don't understand how
you can be both.

39
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:53,304
And why the church hasn't thrown you out.

40
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:55,968
The Bible is unambiguous.

41
00:02:56,192 --> 00:03:00,720
If you had been Christian,
which I doubt that you are,

42
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,600
- and a priest when it was written -

43
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,832
- you would have been stoned to death.

44
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:10,032
And they say that it wasn't
better in the past.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,800
So you see no problem in that
it can be perceived as encouraging?

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,220
Do you see a problem
in that I am expressing an opinion -

47
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:22,204
- that may not be politically correct,
but that is in no way illegal?

48
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:26,908
You need to work a little on your
wording, because it sounds like it.

49
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:11,280
The Bridge

50
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:47,760
- Who are you?
- Henrik Saboe, Copenhagen Police. Who are you?

51
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:49,944
- Lars Andersen, Director.

52
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,296
I just wanted to examine how much
needed to be done before it can drive again.

53
00:05:57,896 --> 00:05:59,799
Your colleague said that
you were finished here.

54
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,176
So we had.

55
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:08,352
She asked who was here first
that morning, after it happened.

56
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:12,744
- Who asked about it?
- Your Swedish colleague.

57
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:20,572
I've found out who it was.
Kjell Söder was first on the site.

58
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:25,632
- Kjell Söder? Is he here now?
- Yes, he is.

59
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,652
I'm probably driving directly from here,
but we can talk about it later.

60
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,616
I have to run. Kisses.

61
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,880
Saga, come with me.

62
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:10,804
How are you?

63
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:16,548
I broke the rules when
I took my weapon home.

64
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:20,040
- Yes, but how are you?
- Good.

65
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:26,452
The thing with Hanne
was a traumatic experience.

66
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:29,836
When you were there, you felt
that you bore a part of the blame.

67
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:35,384
You were right in that I couldn't
know it. Morten is paranoid -

68
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:40,400
- that he would put a bomb in the
trailer was impossible to predict.

69
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,368
It can still affect you.

70
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:45,408
Not so much that I can't do my job.

71
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:50,520
No, but something is wrong.
I can see it.

72
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:56,760
If you don't want to say anything, I must
send you home, whether you like it or not.

73
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,700
My mother is here.

74
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:04,336
Your mother? I have never heard
you talk about your mother.

75
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't. We don't see each other.
I haven't seen her in 20 years.

76
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,336
So what does she want now?

77
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,336
My father is dying.
She wants me to visit him.

78
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,100
And you don't want to.

79
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:21,992
No, they aren't good for me.
It was I who broke contact.

80
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:29,116
Is there anything you want to talk about?
Anything that I can help with?

81
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:31,288
No.

82
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,208
If there is anything, you know
where you can find me.

83
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,096
Yeah. Here or in your new
apartment in Copenhagen.

84
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:39,936
Exactly.

85
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:46,132
You don't like it, but I think
you need a hug.

86
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:48,952
Ah.

87
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,868
Henrik Saboe, Copenhagen Police.
Lillian has sent me.

88
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:13,248
Hi. Welcome. Hans Pettersson.

89
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:16,488
I'm Lillian's husband
and the boss on the Swedish side.

90
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:20,872
This is Saga.
She's leading the investigation.

91
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,368
- May I work now?
- Yes.

92
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:33,888
Morten Anker, 27. Son of
Helle Anker and Villy Bartram.

93
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,716
The father died in 2003.

94
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:41,012
After basic training, goes to
Helmand Province in Afghanistan.

95
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:44,908
He's been there three times.
Got into trouble on the last.

96
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:46,248
How?

97
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,300
He was part of a group that was
accused of rape by a woman in town.

98
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,112
He and two others were
abducted and tortured.

99
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,184
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

100
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,736
He left the army and lives
off a modest pension.

101
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,472
One hasn't heard much from
him these last years.

102
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,720
- What about the surveillance cameras?
- I've gotten the videos.

103
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,760
If one watches the 15 minutes before
the perpetrator turns off the cameras -

104
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,672
- way too many cars go by.

105
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:21,532
- What's this about cameras?
- Between the murder scene
and where she was found.

106
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:25,488
- Do we know that was his route?
- No, but it's likely.

107
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:31,724
He had luggage. Start with vans
and station wagons and locate the owners.

108
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:36,820
The first who arrived at
Andersen TL was Kjell Söder.

109
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:41,836
He came at 5:20 A.M.
At the time it wasn't locked.

110
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:45,592
- How do you know that?
- I've just been there.

111
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:51,120
I met the director. The security company
was last there at 3:47 A.M.

112
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,856
- You know that already.
The killer must have come after that.

113
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,216
The cameras were shut off at 5:10 A.M.

114
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:05,740
Now they know how she was found.
Those who found her took pictures.

115
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,140
- 'The Clown Murder'.
- That's not correct.

116
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,260
The drawings on the faces are emoticons.

117
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,712
- Yes, but now they call it that.
- But it's wrong.

118
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,604
They're finished at Morten Anker's place.
There are no more bombs. Saga.

119
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:22,076
I can ask someone else
to go with Henrik if you want.

120
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:25,036
- Why?
- Because of what happened.

121
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,240
No, that's not necessary.

122
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,256
You just have to follow.
Don't wait for an invitation.

123
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,576
So you and your boss hug.

124
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:49,100
He thought that non-erotic
contact would comfort me.

125
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
- Do you need comforting?
- No.

126
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,100
- Great car.
- That's what people say.

127
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
You may not drive it.

128
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:06,408
- Have you read the case file?
- Yeah, I've done that at least.

129
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:11,152
- It's not so big yet.
- So you have no questions.

130
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,824
It was you who put Martin in,
wasn't it?

131
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:19,536
If you mean reported, that was me.

132
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,288
I had to ask.

133
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:25,128
I know that Martin suffered.
I thought you were friends.

134
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:28,656
We are. Or were, at least.

135
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:35,168
It must have been hard for you.
With Martin and colleagues after.

136
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:40,496
We have a legal system.
One cannot be above it.

137
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,624
What are you doing?

138
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,776
I'm making kind of a map of the area.

139
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:07,316
We've photographed it.

140
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:11,736
I know that.
Are you okay?

141
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,176
We don't have to both be inside.
You can wait here if it's difficult.

142
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,664
- I don't know how thorough you are.
- I'm very thorough.

143
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:23,116
That doesn't mean that your
self-image agrees with reality.

144
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:25,272
True, but I believe it.

145
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,644
Ah.

146
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:48,124
Didn't Helle get a typewritten,
threatening letter?

147
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,408
- Do you hunt?
- Why do you ask?

148
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:03,236
Can this be a deer heart?

149
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,928
I don't know.

150
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:14,204
- It looks like a human heart.
- It's a little large, no?

151
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,704
It must be from a fawn or something.

152
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:23,472
Come and see this.

153
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:28,952
Anti-depressants. Anxiolytic.

154
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:33,192
They're issued by the same doctor.
Marianne Givskov.

155
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:53,688
- Marianne!
- Morten?

156
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:55,492
- I need my medicine.
- I couldn't stop him.

157
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:01,176
- Sit down.
- I need my medicine.

158
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:07,560
- Yeah. Sit down. Sit down, Morten,
and we'll figure it out. What happened?

159
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,280
- I didn't touch her.
- Who are you talking about?

160
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:17,448
- Morten?
- My mother. I didn't touch her.

161
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:22,496
- Morten?
- I must have my pills right now.

162
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:30,024
I don't have them here, but we
can go out together and find them.

163
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:33,528
Lie down and rest a little while,
and then we can talk about it.

164
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,528
Sorry. Now look. Here they are.

165
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:16,656
Shall we go back together?
Morten. Morten!

166
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:40,780
Out of the way

167
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:05,960
Morten has no car.

168
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,636
Put up wanted posters of him on
all public transportation.

169
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:13,104
- Yeah. We'll put out a canine patrol.

170
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:16,752
Make sure. And put up wanted
posters in both countries.

171
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:19,636
- Are you always so bossy?
- I'm not bossy. I'm efficient.

172
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:23,716
I understand if you're not
used to that in Denmark.

173
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:29,264
- Who texts you all the time?
- That's private.

174
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:32,796
You're doing it during work hours.

175
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,984
Her name's Line.
I met her at a museum yesterday.

176
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:43,008
You were lucky. Only 2% of people meet
their future partners in public places.

177
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,656
I don't think I'd call her my future partner.

178
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,352
Anyway, I'm about to end it right ... now.

179
00:17:57,156 --> 00:18:01,900
Why do you know things like
percentages, and who meets where?

180
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,152
I read a lot.

181
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:09,360
But this doesn't really count.
It was arranged beforehand.

182
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:13,512
I'm in a singles club.

183
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:20,520
When they organize a museum visit,
you get a little sticker.

184
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,520
So you can see
who else is a member.

185
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:26,856
So you go over and talk
with the other members, and ...

186
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,756
Do you have sex?

187
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:34,292
Such a cumbersome arrangement
should at least result in sex.

188
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:38,044
Do you think I'm one
of your girlfriends?

189
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:41,284
I don't have any girlfriends.
Do you have sex?

190
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:45,120
- Yeah.

191
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,920
Just go up. I'll be there in a minute.

192
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,524
Stop following me, or I'll report you.

193
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,116
Saga, you lost a sister, and we
lost a daughter. We need to talk about it.

194
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:26,332
Jennifer never recovered -

195
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,788
- after she was psychologically
and physically abused for years.

196
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:34,508
So she committed suicide.
There, now we've talked about it.

197
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,400
So you still think it was my fault.

198
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,364
I know that it was your fault!

199
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:43,800
- What is that?
- Jennifer's journals. Read them.

200
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:50,160
- Why?
- So you can see that you were wrong.

201
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:56,804
and so you can visit Dad
and be reconciled.

202
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,676
Reconciliation requires that
both partners want it, and I don't!

203
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:08,216
In that case, your colleagues
might be interested.

204
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:11,396
In everything you've done to us.

205
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:16,496
No, sorry, Saga.
I didn't mean to threaten you.

206
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:20,240
It wasn't.
We're proud of you.

207
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,412
We read about you ... Can you look
at me when I'm speaking to you?

208
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:32,828
Read this. That's all I ask.

209
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:43,800
- Who was that?

210
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:48,592
It was my mom, and I don't want
to talk about it, if that's what you're thinking of doing.

211
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,060
Check this.
It's from Morten Anker's refrigerator.

212
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,340
- What is it?
- That's what I want to know.

213
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:04,728
The dogs lost the trail, but the
wanted posters are out.

214
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:06,844
Good.

215
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:10,312
It gives no hits on Google.

216
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:16,580
- What's that?
- Journals.

217
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,536
- Connected to the case?
- No.

218
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:25,532
Saga Norén, Malmo Police. I have
something for Forensics in Lund.

219
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:30,440
We've found a new body.

220
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,000
Do we know who it is?

221
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:25,444
His name is Fabian Christensen.
A 60-year-old priest from Copenhagen.

222
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:27,572
Was he reported missing?

223
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:31,636
No. He texted his wife that he would
be coming home at the usual time.

224
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:37,920
- Is there a connection to Helle Anker?
- Not as far as we know.

225
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:44,928
The heart is still there.

226
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:49,920
He might be missing something else.
That car there, is it his?

227
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:51,916
Yes, that's the victim's.

228
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:54,408
Why are they smiling like that?

229
00:22:54,964 --> 00:23:00,576
It's a smiley. On electronic communications,
it shows that something should be seen as a joke.

230
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,360
Thanks for that, Wikipedia, but do you think
the perpetrator sees the killings as a joke?

231
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,616
No, it's not likely.

232
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:11,448
So why are they smiling like that?

233
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,324
We were going out tonight ...
to the theatre and to eat afterwards.

234
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:28,368
Do you know who could have done it?

235
00:23:28,684 --> 00:23:31,204
We had our wedding 14 days ago -

236
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:34,584
- but we had no time to celebrate.

237
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,000
- So he hadn't received threats.
- I should cancel the table.

238
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,312
I can do that for you if you
tell me the name of the restaurant.

239
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:44,088
- Geranium.

240
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:50,040
I'll do that, and you just answer
my colleague's questions. Okay?

241
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,064
What do you want to know?

242
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,592
If your husband had received threats.

243
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:03,456
Yes. There were a couple of unpleasant -

244
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,008
- letters and emails.

245
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,072
He was the first priest in Denmark
who married same sex couples.

246
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:13,072
- Did he keep any of them?
- No, he deleted all of them.

247
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,464
This came this morning.

248
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,904
He never had a chance to see it.

249
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:30,280
A threatening letter. Typewritten.

250
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:36,360
I've cancelled the table at Geranium.
Elise ...

251
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,392
Did your husband know a Helle Anker
or Morten Anker?

252
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:47,184
The name seems familiar, but that's
because of that crazy woman ...

253
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:53,108
- Which crazy woman?
- On the internet.

254
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:08,808
- Lise Friise Andersen.

255
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:17,904
- Go ahead and sit down.
- Thanks.

256
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:23,592
Several students saw Karen
go up to Molly and hit her.

257
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:26,424
- Good. Then word spreads quickly.

258
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,664
- Where did you hit?

259
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:34,684
The nose first, and then
the side of her eye.

260
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:42,412
This is completely unacceptable. We have
zero tolerance for violence in this school.

261
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,464
And also for bullying.
How did that go last time?

262
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,336


263
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:51,460
Is this what you teach her?
That violence is a solution?

264
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,952
I teach her not to be afraid.

265
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:58,776
Now it's up to you whether this
will be repeated. Come, Sweetie.

266
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:23,924
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me.

267
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:27,532
- Where did you get my number?
- I asked Samira.

268
00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:33,072
Things went badly yesterday.
Also, I haven't taken the money.

269
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:39,312
I was a little angry, but mostly upset
that you could possibly believe that.

270
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,940
But I want to help you.

271
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,768
Can we not meet and talk about it?

272
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:49,712
We need to find a solution.
It's eating me up.

273
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:52,604
Where are you?

274
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,868
I can come out to you.

275
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:04,232
- It's better if we meet in the city.
- Okay. Where and when?

276
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,440
The subscriber cannot answer your
call. Leave a message after the tone.

277
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:35,736
The police have been here.
We need to meet.

278
00:29:42,796 --> 00:29:44,832
The Bible is unambiguous.

279
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:50,520
If you had been Christian, which
I doubt, and you were a priest

280
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:54,096
- at the time it was written,
you would have been stoned to death.

281
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,912
And they say it wasn't better
in the past.

282
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:00,312
Lise Friis Andersen.

283
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:04,348
She was also against Helle Anker.
She seemed happy after her death.

284
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:09,576
- How do you know that?
- She was on a Danish tv program.

285
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:12,608
- About freedom of expression.
- Could she have done it?

286
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:16,648
She could have also
just encouraged it.

287
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:22,516
- How is it going with Morten Anker?
- There isn't anyone who's seen him.

288
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:29,328
- What about the thing from the refrigerator?
- It could be a personal code.

289
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:31,828
What about the meat and the typewriter?

290
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:35,284
The heart was from a deer.
The blood was from animals.

291
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:39,168
- And the typewriter?
- There is nothing new yet.

292
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:42,240
The last ribbon they compared must
be 20 years old.

293
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:45,752
So we only have her.

294
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:51,888
I just don't understand
why you're here.

295
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,684
Two people you have spoken
negatively about have been killed.

296
00:30:57,184 --> 00:31:00,724
- Two? Who other than Helle Anker?
- Fabian Christensen.

297
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:07,424
- What? That's terrible. But
it doesn't explain why you're here.

298
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,980
I told you. Two people whom you
have spoken negatively about are dead.

299
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:16,056
There must be other people
who have spoken negatively about them.

300
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:17,668
They were public figures.

301
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:22,900
Is there anyone who has shown
excessive interest in your opinions?

302
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,888
- Excessive interest?
- Yeah.

303
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:28,520
No one has shown excessive interest.
There are many who have shown interest -

304
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,204
- but you can read that for yourself.

305
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:33,996
So you haven't gotten any
mail or phone calls.

306
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:39,384
- From people who murder in my name?
- Has anyone written by typewriter?

307
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,224
Most of my followers
live in the 21st century.

308
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:45,504
So you don't own
a typewriter yourself.

309
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:47,792
- No.

310
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:51,820
- Do you know Morten Anker?
- Is he related to Helle Anker?

311
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,140
He's her son.

312
00:31:55,064 --> 00:32:00,724
There is nothing that I put out
that calls for violence.

313
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:05,256
- That's debatable.
- I am a trained lawyer, so no, it can't be.

314
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,176
I express my opinions and I cannot
be responsible for what my followers do.

315
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:13,320
Should we warn the people
she's spoken badly of?

316
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,636
We can't do that without risking
being accused of defamation.

317
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,768
The killings happened directly after her posts.

318
00:32:22,268 --> 00:32:26,304
- That doesn't mean anything.
- And she's married to Lars Andersen.

319
00:32:26,804 --> 00:32:28,992
- How do you know that?
- The wedding photo up there.

320
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:35,176
- Let's take a closer look at the couple.
- Now.

321
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:39,128
- Or first thing in the morning.
- Why not now?

322
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:43,536
I thought that we should go
eat dinner together. At Geranium.

323
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:47,256
I never cancelled the
Christiansens' reservation.

324
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:51,480
- Why didn't you do that?
- It's impossible to get a table there.

325
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,480
- No, I don't want to.

326
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:58,344
- Okay. Is there a reason,
or should I just feel crushed?

327
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:01,280
I have a meeting in Lund,
and so I'm going to work.

328
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:07,200
- So we'll just do it another time.
- I don't care for that sort of activity.

329
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:19,536
She's very different. I think
she has some diagnosis or other.

330
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:23,424
- You wouldn't like her.
- Why not?

331
00:33:23,924 --> 00:33:28,416
I don't know. She's very ...
She's very honest.

332
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,200
Like totally without boundaries.

333
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:34,296
And so she doesn't have any walls.

334
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,208
I want to talk to her.

335
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,848
I want to see if I can get her to help me.

336
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:45,360
How?

337
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:48,456
I'll just get to know her better first.

338
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:53,692
I invited her to come with
me to Geranium tonight.

339
00:33:54,656 --> 00:34:00,336
I had gotten a table,
but she didn't want to. So I gave up.

340
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:09,048
So it's just you and me tonight. Quiet.

341
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,744
Nice.

342
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:46,824
Hi.

343
00:34:47,324 --> 00:34:51,912
- Have you found anything?
- On the bodies or the journal you sent me?

344
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:55,456
Both. Let's start with the bodies.

345
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,856
- Go ahead.
- No, tell me.

346
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:09,000
Helle Anker. Cause of death:
cardiac arrest following loss of blood.

347
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,168
Was she alive when he cut her up?

348
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:13,424
Unconscious.

349
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:19,080
I've found residues of chloroform
in the airways and lungs. Old school.

350
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:23,976
The sternum was opened by something
mechanical, not saw-toothed.

351
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:27,144
I'm guessing by a large angle grinder.

352
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:30,172
- Knowledge of anatomy?
- Not necessarily.

353
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:34,496
Open up and pull out. You don't need
to be a surgeon to do that.

354
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:38,236
Next man. Fabian Christensen.

355
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:44,264
Suffocated. No other damage to the body.
No missing parts or organs.

356
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:49,208
- Two murderers.
- Or someone who likes change.

357
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,276
The lipstick they have in common.

358
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,660
That came out in the press,
so it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

359
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,436
Shall we talk about the other thing now?

360
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,332
Okay.

361
00:36:10,904 --> 00:36:14,644
Jennifer Norén. Family?

362
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,328
What have you found out?

363
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:20,784
I wasn't sure what I should
be looking for.

364
00:36:21,284 --> 00:36:23,592
Anything abnormal.

365
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:27,608
- The girl was often sick.
- Unnaturally often.

366
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:33,696
If you mean more often
than average, I would say yes.

367
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:38,592
I mean that someone made her sick.
Someone with Münchausen-by-proxy.

368
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:46,468
It is, of course, possible, but there
is nothing to confirm it.

369
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:53,692
One cannot be so sick on her own.

370
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:57,928
It's unusual, but it's not impossible.

371
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:03,888
If you want my professional opinion,
from what I have read -

372
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,280
- there is nothing here
that points to a crime.

373
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,496
- But it could have been.
- Of course.

374
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:15,128
But that's not how we do things.
Neither you nor I.

375
00:37:15,628 --> 00:37:18,344
We believe in evidence.

376
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:35,592
- The police were here today.
- Oh, why?

377
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,696
They're looking for a connection
between my video blog and the murders.

378
00:38:40,472 --> 00:38:43,296
You've found it. Where was it?

379
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:44,212
What are you talking about?

380
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:46,992
- Have you laid it there?
- No.

381
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:49,752
Ah. So it must be Karen.

382
00:38:55,928 --> 00:39:00,072
- Do you think I could pull off leather pants?
- Yeah, I think so. Why?

383
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:02,512
Because ...

384
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:07,852
The officer who was here had
leather pants on, and it looks so good.

385
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:12,216
- Was it a Swedish officer?
- Yeah.

386
00:39:13,324 --> 00:39:17,568
- Who's investigating the Helle Anker murder?
- And Fabian Christensen, yeah.

387
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,816
She was over in the Malmo department.

388
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:28,632
Was it Helle Anker who
was killed in that truck?

389
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,560
It must have been, yeah.

390
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:52,248
Hans?

391
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:07,356
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- It's Lillian.

392
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,824
Is Hans nearby?
Do you know where he is?

393
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,928
We should have met at 7:30,
but he didn't come.

394
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:18,676
I thought that maybe something happened,
or he would have called.

395
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,776
- Have you called him?
- Yeah, but he's not answering.

396
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:28,348
Did you have a fight? That could explain
why he doesn't answer when you call.

397
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:30,360
Yes, but we haven't fought.

398
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:36,196
Would you please see
if his car is still there?

399
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:42,220
- His car is in the garage.
- Would you please do me that favor?

400
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,744
Okay.

401
00:43:09,148 --> 00:43:11,824
Some of you know me.
My name is Linn Björkman.

402
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:14,928
I'm taking over while Hans is away.

403
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:18,532
Until we know why
Hans Pettersson has disappeared -

404
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:21,700
- we assume that it is not voluntary.

405
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:26,328
We have added staff,
and all resources are available.

406
00:43:26,828 --> 00:43:29,788
No one may speak with the press.

407
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:35,388
Report to me every hour,
or when you have new information.

408
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:38,636
You know what we need to do. Thanks.

409
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,028
- Shall we get a cup of tea?
- Yeah, thanks.

410
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:53,356
- How's it going?
- We don't know why he disappeared.

411
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:56,324
He was abducted.

412
00:43:56,824 --> 00:44:01,104
The closest I can come is a
four-year-old email in his trash.

413
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:07,268
- Aleksander Dover.
- Released yesterday. Eight years for robbery.

414
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:10,008
He apparently threatened
Hans from prison.

415
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,712
- Do you know where he is?
- He got a temporary apartment.

416
00:44:14,712 --> 00:44:18,096
But according to the landlord,
he never moved in. I can dig further.

417
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:21,924
Good, do it, and print that there.

418
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:32,280
- Is that something new?
- Yeah.

419
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,640
- Stronger?
- Mm.

420
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:39,984
I need to get some sleep.

421
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:47,328
I know that it's very early.

422
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,216
- Lillian?

423
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,996
He knew that Dover would get out.
Why wasn't anything done?

424
00:45:34,496 --> 00:45:39,940
He didn't say anything. It's up to
the individual to ask for protection.

425
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,968
- And he didn't do that.
- I hadn't heard anything before now.

426
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:49,060
It's worth checking.
Do we know where Dover is now?

427
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,316
John's working on it.
What are you doing here?

428
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,760
Lillian called me.

429
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:05,188
I have an address.

430
00:46:46,396 --> 00:46:47,856
What is this place?

431
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:52,300
Dover has been here in connection
with two cases. The owner is unknown.

432
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,408
It seems like someone is
in there, at least.

433
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:14,072
Aleksander Dover!

434
00:47:15,072 --> 00:47:17,876
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
We want to talk to you.

435
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:27,920
Can you open up now?

436
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:34,168
Come in.

437
00:47:44,556 --> 00:47:47,492
Hans Pettersson.

438
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,736
- What about him?
- Where were you at 7 PM?

439
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:56,236
I was here.

440
00:47:56,884 --> 00:48:01,272
I was just released, so I'm just
trying to take it easy.

441
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:04,956
So you didn't find yourself
in central Malmo?

442
00:48:05,456 --> 00:48:06,956
No.

443
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:11,244
If I tell you that you were seen
in Malmo, what would you say?

444
00:48:11,744 --> 00:48:15,408
- That they're lying.
- It was right by the police station.

445
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,896
That's why we're here.

446
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:21,148
You threatened Hans Pettersson in prison.

447
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:29,712
Do you think it's totally random
that you come out and Hans disappears?

448
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,620
- Has he disappeared?
- Yeah.

449
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:45,112
He forced me to become
an informer in prison.

450
00:48:45,744 --> 00:48:50,636
Otherwise he would arrest my wife
and take the children from us.

451
00:48:51,604 --> 00:48:53,432
I threatened him, yeah.

452
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:59,148
He should be as afraid as I was.
As I still am.

453
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:02,324
I have nothing to do with
his disappearance.

454
00:49:02,812 --> 00:49:06,988
I've sat in prison for eight years.
I don't want to sit there for a lifetime.

455
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:24,716
Hans would never threaten Aleksander's
family to get him to inform.

456
00:49:25,216 --> 00:49:29,452
- So Dover has nothing to do with it?
- He's lying about Hans.

457
00:49:29,768 --> 00:49:33,336
I think he seemed surprised
when we asked about Hans.

458
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:35,084
And you believe that?

459
00:49:35,584 --> 00:49:38,956
- Maybe he got into drama in prison.
- I don't believe that.

460
00:49:40,784 --> 00:49:44,232
In any case, we'll put surveillance on him.

461
00:49:44,836 --> 00:49:48,796
- I want to concentrate on this.
- Okay. I'm on it.

462
00:49:49,296 --> 00:49:52,816
No, you'll take over the
Christensen and Anker killings.

463
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:21,028
There was too little blood by the car
for him to be dead.

464
00:50:23,212 --> 00:50:27,600
If he were going to die, there was no
reason to do it elsewhere.

465
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,956
So it's probably kidnapping.

466
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:35,720
When it's not custody cases or trafficking -

467
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,592
- there's usually a demand for ransom.

468
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:42,200
Statistically, very few ...

469
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:48,000
I know that you want to cheer me up,
but can you not be quiet?

470
00:50:48,652 --> 00:50:50,044
Okay.

471
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:57,244
Do you need a hug?

472
00:50:57,344 --> 00:51:00,240
No, thanks. It's fine.

473
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:47,268
Your colleagues were looking for you,
but they left.

474
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,948
I'll demand two million to release you.

475
00:51:54,844 --> 00:51:58,580
Apparently there are often
ransoms paid in secret.

476
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,252
So as to not encourage crime.

477
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:07,308
It's for my family.
Can you remember them?

478
00:52:07,808 --> 00:52:09,848
Samira and the girls.

479
00:53:37,112 --> 00:53:40,224
Samira. Samira, do you want a little wine?

480
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:26,716
Gather around. We've received a video.

481
00:54:27,216 --> 00:54:30,024
- What video?
- A demand came for two million.

482
00:54:30,524 --> 00:54:34,548
- How did we get it?
- Attachment from a Hotmail address.

483
00:54:35,644 --> 00:54:37,680
- Are you sure you want to see this?
- Yes.

484
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,292
Good, let's begin.

485
00:54:59,044 --> 00:55:01,224
John, try to go back to the newspaper.

486
00:55:04,252 --> 00:55:07,348
- I've seen that paper at Dover's place.
- What are you saying?

487
00:55:07,848 --> 00:55:12,600
I've seen it. I recognize that
coffee ring. It was at Dover's place.

488
00:55:21,124 --> 00:55:24,596
That swine has my family, my children.

489
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:30,652
Anyone but him.

490
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:47,976
Now she doesn't need money.
Johnny has money.

491
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:51,260
He has my money and my life.

492
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:55,876
I don't need to send more videos.

493
00:55:56,876 --> 00:55:59,188
I don't need to prove that you're alive.
