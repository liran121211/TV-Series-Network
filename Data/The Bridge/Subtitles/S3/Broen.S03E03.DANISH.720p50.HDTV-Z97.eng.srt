00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,576
Previously

2
00:00:03,268 --> 00:00:07,636
Helle Anker. I've found traces
of chloroform in the airways and lungs.

3
00:00:08,136 --> 00:00:10,820
Did someone take her heart?

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,272
Morten Anker. After basic training, went
to Helmand Province in Afghanistan.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,060
Everyone thinks it was me,
but I didn't do anything to her.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,956
I have nothing against homosexuals, but
why should they get married in church?

7
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:30,912
That question I ask you,
Fabian Christensen.

8
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:36,868
His heart is still there.

9
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:39,372
- Have you been in the bedroom?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:43,252
- Have you seen my necklace?
- No, sorry.

11
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:48,560
Stop following me or I will report you.

12
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:53,280
- You think that it was my fault.
- I know that it was your fault!

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,204
Hans Pettersson disappeared, and we're
assuming that it's not voluntary.

14
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:32,624
EPISODE 3

15
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:57,936
The subscriber cannot answer your call.
Leave a message after the tone.

16
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,944
Hi, it's me again. Morten.

17
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,844
I don't know if you're hearing this, but

18
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:11,688
I'll call back tomorrow at 10:00.
It would be nice if you'd pick up.

19
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,974
Who's there?

20
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,608
Hi, it's me again. Morten.
I don't know if you're hearing this -

21
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,508
- I'll call back tomorrow at 10:00.

22
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:51,960
Why the hell don't you answer?

23
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,080
How did you find me?

24
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:10,368
What happened? Fuck, man!

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,960
- What do I do?
- Listen ...

26
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,956
The Bridge

27
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,916
Welcome.

28
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:43,136
Last night Police Commissioner
Hans Pettersson was abducted.

29
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:47,452
We have received a video of Hans
and a demand for ransom money.

30
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:52,492
We want to hear from people who have
been in the garage by Vidungegatan 5 -

31
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:57,964
- last night around 7:00
and may have noticed something.

32
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,088
We'll keep you updated -

33
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:07,464
- but we ask that you show respect for
both us and Hans Pettersson's loved ones.

34
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:13,840
- How large is the ransom?
- We won't disclose that.

35
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,372
- Do you have any suspects?
- Have the police received threats?

36
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:24,776
He would give us money,
but it was gone.

37
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:28,876
Yes, quite a lot of money from
the robbery was never found.

38
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,900
I don't know where it was from,
but it was gone.

39
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,040
He wanted to fix it.
He had a plan.

40
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,628
To kidnap Hans. You think that
it could have been his plan.

41
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:42,624
- I'm sitting here, aren't I?
- Yes.

42
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,876
Do you know where he could be?

43
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:50,840
There's a place he usually stays.

44
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,688
Is this the place?

45
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:59,792
No, that's not it.
It's another place.

46
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:13,756
He was sitting here.

47
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,880
- But he was released.
- Three shots close to each other.

48
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:26,404
Chloroform.

49
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:31,328
- Are there other people after Hans?
- It looks like it.

50
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,340
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

51
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,800
Henrik, there's something for you
from the technicians.

52
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:53,808
Thanks. The toy and the toy food can be
bought at any toy store on the internet.

53
00:06:55,344 --> 00:07:01,128
The clothes come from the big chain stores,
and there's a brand on the dolls ...

54
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:05,856
No DNA found by Helle Anker.
No fingerprints, either.

55
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:09,672
There are, however, fingerprints
on the door of Fabian Christensen's car.

56
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:13,752
They come from neither him
nor his wife.

57
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,224
- Are you married?
- What's that?

58
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:21,288
No. Are you?

59
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:25,708
Yeah. Rather, we divorced in the spring.
She's moved home to Denmark -

60
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:30,168
- so it's been slightly difficult
with our daughter, Julia.

61
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:31,968
It sounds difficult.

62
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,944
The lipstick that was used comes
from a brand called FeliCity

63
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:00,120
Do you want to know why you're here?

64
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,416
Yes, thank you.

65
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,784
When people find large amounts of blood
in a truck at their work -

66
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:09,456
- they usually ask questions.
Do you know what they ask about?

67
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
No.

68
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:16,224
"What's happened?
Did someone get hurt?

69
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,864
Do you know whose blood that is?"

70
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,896
You only asked when you
could get your truck out again.

71
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:26,616
Yeah, I guess I'm not
the curious type.

72
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:28,392
No, maybe not.

73
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:31,896
FeliCity ...

74
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,024
- Yeah, what about it?
- We've done a background check on it.

75
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:39,048
You sit on the board for FeliCity.

76
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:40,368
That's correct, yeah.

77
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,832
Do you want to know
what this has to do with the case?

78
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,388
As I said, I'm not the curious type.

79
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,936
Fabian Christensen and Heller Anker
had smileys painted on their faces.

80
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,416
It was with lipstick from
the brand FeliCity.

81
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:01,032
So what are you saying?

82
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:04,272
That I would have killed Helle Anker
at my work?

83
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:08,784
And then used makeup from a business
that I'm a board member of?

84
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,280
- Wouldn't that be a little stupid?
- Yeah, maybe.

85
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,568
But occasionally killers feel safe.

86
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:17,040
They think they're superior to the police.

87
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:20,856
They're completely confident that
they will never be caught.

88
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,600
But what do I know?
I don't know you.

89
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,272
Maybe you're just stupid.

90
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,500
Danish police went there when
Emergency Services was called -

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,660
- but they couldn't identify him. Then we
found your business card in his pocket.

92
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,848
Yes, you said that on the phone.
Do you know who found him?

93
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:50,088
It was someone homeless. Emergency
Services might have a name. He's in here.

94
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,676
It's Morten Anker.

95
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,600
Did he say anything?

96
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,200
No, he was never conscious.
He died on the way here.

97
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:07,880
- How many shots was he hit by?
- Three. All three in the chest.

98
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,684
- What are you doing?
- I need to see the damage.

99
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,100
Three shots. Virtually the same pattern.

100
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,056
So you mean that the one who shot
Dover also shot Morten Anker.

101
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:28,804
It's possible.

102
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,032
And that person has Hans now.

103
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,560
The cases are connected. Helle also
had traces of chloroform in her airways.

104
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,504
It can't be a coincidence.

105
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:40,440
- I will take over the murder
cases from the Danes.
- Yes, of course.

106
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,008
Make sure that the technicians
prioritize the bullets from these two.

107
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:45,584
I want one hundred percent confirmation
that this was the same weapon.

108
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:50,308
We assume that it is linked to Hans.

109
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:53,160
Continue on that track.

110
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,304
Peter Krogh? Hello. My name is
Henrik Sabroe, Copenhagen Police.

111
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,940
- My partner, Saga Norén.
- Malmo Police.

112
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,084
How did it go with him?

113
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,584
He died. Did you see the perpetrator?

114
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:27,000
No. I heard someone who ran off.

115
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,656
- Did you know him well?
- Not at all.

116
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,184
I didn't even know his name.

117
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:39,440
- His name was Morten Anker.
- Okay.

118
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,808
So do you know who his
brother is, or what?

119
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,468
His brother?

120
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:45,624
It was his brother who shot him.

121
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:52,080
That was what he said.
"My brother shot me. My brother shot me."

122
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:58,708
He doesn't have any brothers.
Elias is four years old.

123
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:03,096
I don't think that he did it, but
Morten has a brother. That's what I mean.

124
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:06,936
- Elias is his half-brother.
- I know that, Wiki.

125
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,592
Sometimes people call their half-siblings
their siblings, do they not?

126
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:15,076
So maybe Morten has more half-siblings.

127
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:17,476
Why didn't you say that straight away?

128
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,752
I had to convince you -

129
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:25,704
- that I didn't believe a four-year-old
had shot two people in two countries.

130
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:30,032
- It sounded as if that was what you thought.
- Oh, did it, Saga?

131
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:52,992
I'm all in.

132
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,256
Full house.

133
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:39,048
Two pairs ... or better full house.

134
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:08,184
- Hi. Are you home?
- Yeah.

135
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:14,544
- He's kicking. Do you want to feel?
- No, that's okay.

136
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,312
I didn't hear that you were coming.
Where have you been?

137
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:24,000
I've just been all around.

138
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:27,000
- And doing what?
- Nothing in particular.

139
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,136
And doing what?

140
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,016
How much have you lost?

141
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:50,400
Dammit, Marc! We need to put
the down payment on that house today!

142
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,856
- Is it today?
- Yeah, it was today.

143
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:56,688
20,000 before 6:00. Dammit!

144
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:08,256
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,280
Did Morten have a brother?

146
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:25,736
- Only Elias. Why?
- Are you sure about that?

147
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:29,240
- How can you be?
- I am.

148
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:33,720
And Villy couldn't have had children
with others before or after Helle?

149
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,568
They were together until he died, so no.
Morten was his only child.

150
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,700
Was Helle a lesbian or bisexual?

151
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,944
If she was a lesbian, it may
have affected their sex life -

152
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:53,500
- and so Villy might have been unfaithful
and had a child outside of their marriage.

153
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,668
In that case, Helle didn't know.

154
00:15:57,168 --> 00:16:02,048
- Does Aleksander Dover
mean anything to you?
- No, sorry.

155
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:06,784
What about Hans Pettersson?
He's a Swedish policeman.

156
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,312
It's from John.

157
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:19,780
It doesn't look like Villy had
more children besides Morten.

158
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:25,488
Helle didn't know that. Morten
probably didn't know either.

159
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,904
There was that little box of
photos in Morten's trailer.

160
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:37,536
Can't you remember? Right under
the fridge, where the typewriter was.

161
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:48,408
Here it is.

162
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:53,664
Here he is together with his mother.

163
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:57,628
He has a family,
and then he isolates himself.

164
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:00,980
He might not have
liked his family.

165
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:05,856
You don't know if they liked each
other just because they look happy.

166
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:09,268
Look at this.

167
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:14,876
- It's from Afghanistan.
- Look at the back.

168
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:19,992
Killbrothers.

169
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:23,236
Morten, Kevin Larsen
and Lukas Stenstrup.

170
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:27,964
They were accused of rape and tortured.
Kevin is dead, Lukas is alive.

171
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:32,672
- How did Kevin die?
- He committed suicide two years ago.

172
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:37,208
- What about Lukas Stenstrup?
- It's going better for him.

173
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,164
He runs a program for kids
who need extra support.

174
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:45,480
This applies to work, studies and
contact with authorities.

175
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:02,596
Lukas Stenstrup?
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

176
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:06,628
This is my partner, Henrik Sabroe.
We want to talk to you about Morten Anker.

177
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:09,360
- Should I go in with this?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:13,248
- What's this about Morten?
- He's dead. Killed.

179
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,256
- When did you last meet Morten?
- It was a long time ago, man.

180
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:27,600
So ... It was last year, I think. He ...

181
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,696
- He was strange that last time.
- And where were you 8:00 this morning?

182
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:37,348
This morning I was back home eating
breakfast with my girlfriend -

183
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,696
- and then she drove me here.

184
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,920
- Can I get your girlfriend's number?
- Yeah.

185
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:51,816
Here you go.

186
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,424
Why do you want to know
where I was at 8:00 this morning?

187
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:07,176
Before Morten died, he said that it
was his brother who had killed him.

188
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:11,136
- Morten didn't have any brothers.
- He has killbrothers.

189
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:15,624
- Are you taking the piss?
- Who else would he mean?

190
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:19,632
I have no idea.

191
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:25,176
- Haven't I seen you before?
- I don't think so.

192
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:27,748
I'm really good with faces.

193
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,696
So am I, and I've never seen you.

194
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,860
She confirmed it.

195
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,312
Let us know if you plan to travel.

196
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:40,944
I'm not going anywhere.

197
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,792
Bye.

198
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:56,592
I'm finished, so I'm leaving now.

199
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:58,944
Okay, thanks for today.

200
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:04,340
There were clean clothes in the
bedroom, so I folded them.

201
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,876
- I had time for it.
- Okay, but in the future we'll do it ourselves.

202
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:14,048
- Okay. Good. See you later.
- Bye.

203
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,120
Sorry. This was under the door.

204
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:44,160
Thanks.

205
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:59,892
You know, our new director
must like to smile.

206
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:04,268
Better, but warmer
without losing power.

207
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:09,440
You've been photographed 1000 times.

208
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
- That was 20 years ago, Mom.
- Yes, but people can remember that.

209
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:17,624
We must take advantage of that now.
Yes, let me see ...

210
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:21,560
It was much better than I thought.

211
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,272
This could also be used.
The one where she's standing up.

212
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:27,988
That's enough.

213
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,232
- Then we'll take some with the family.
- Is that really necessary?

214
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:35,984
We are a family firm that
builds homes for other families.

215
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:40,300
- Don't you have what you need?
- Aren't you having guests tonight?

216
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,476
So it would be nice if you're home
when they come. Håkan!

217
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:49,432
- Are you coming?
- Yes, we're coming.

218
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,252
You can maybe stand here
to the side of Anna ...

219
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:13,376
- When will it be announced?
- That I'm taking over the firm?

220
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:17,936
Some time next week, I think.
Third generation of house builders.

221
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:22,996
- I was going to fetch a soda.
- In the cooler. Say congratulations to Anna.

222
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:27,128
- Why?
- She's the new director for EkdahlsHus.

223
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:34,680
Congrats. Can the workers in Russia
go form a union now?

224
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,144
We don't have an official policy
against unions.

225
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:45,032
That's hardly necessary when one
has unofficial threats and harassment.

226
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,864
I'll look into it.

227
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,976
- I'm sorry about that. He's ...
- 17 years old and committed.

228
00:22:56,476 --> 00:23:00,212
But maybe we can help each other by
talking about something else at dinner?

229
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,212
Cheers.

230
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:13,656
Hey, Marc. Did you get those on credit?

231
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:16,680
Or maybe you got money?

232
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:20,640
- I'm going to pay you back.
- Okay.

233
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,800
Then let's go for a ride.

234
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:27,192
- I can't pay you back now.
- You don't need to tell me that.

235
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:33,840
Shall I take that?

236
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:14,784
Hi, Marc. Sit down.

237
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,248
Well ...

238
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:26,760
You owe me 78 thousand.

239
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:32,280
- If I just get a week ...
- Shut up.

240
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,512
Try to listen, Marc.
In life you don't get shit.

241
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:39,816
You have to earn it.

242
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,576
Now we're going to play a little game.

243
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:50,280
Russian roulette.

244
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:56,856
For every time
this caliber 38 says click ...

245
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,760
... you get an extra day. Go ahead.

246
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,952
- I only need a week.
- Shut up.

247
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:15,000
Shut up and shoot!

248
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,772
Now put that pistol to your head
and pull the trigger.

249
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:20,160
Do you understand?

250
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:21,528
No ...

251
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,100
Do you think I'm a fucking joker?
Now take that pistol -

252
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,336
- and pull the trigger! Look me
in the eyes! Do I look like I'm kidding?

253
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,120
Come on! Take that pistol and shoot!

254
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,568
Shoot!

255
00:25:39,032 --> 00:25:41,400
Do you think I'm a fucking joker? Shoot!

256
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,160
Come on, Marc!

257
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,536
Exactly. That was one day.

258
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,080
Look at me. Dammit, Marc.
You play poker, man.

259
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:04,968
Before you had an 83.3% chance.
Now it's 69.4.

260
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:08,256
Those are damn good odds.
Can you do that?

261
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,248
Can you get the money in one day?

262
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,392
Thought so. Pull the trigger.

263
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:28,992
Come on. Come on, Marc!

264
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,824
That was two days.
Can you do that?

265
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:43,632
That's 39,000 a day.
Can you do that?

266
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:49,372
Can you do that? Good advice, eh?

267
00:26:49,872 --> 00:26:52,896
Buy as many fucking days as you can.
There won't be a second time.

268
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:55,992
Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger now!

269
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:01,344
Shoot! Shoot now!

270
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,000
Holy shit.

271
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,024
What, Marc?

272
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,768
Look here, you little idiot.

273
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,360
They're blanks. As if I would use
money to off you, man.

274
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,384
You have two days. Fuck off.

275
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,648
We're not finding anything that
links the murders. Nothing.

276
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:05,112
We haven't even found Anker's
car yet. What are you doing?

277
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:10,732
I'm reading the reports on Larsen's death.
Nothing suggests anything but suicide.

278
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,664
- Are you thinking about Hans?
- No, I'm thinking about Kevin Larsen.

279
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,896
Saga?

280
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,796
- How did you get in here?
- I said who I was.

281
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:36,824
- That shouldn't be enough.
- Most people want to see their mother.

282
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,628
Come.

283
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,968
Give me a cup of coffee.

284
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:03,600
This policeman who disappeared.
Do you know him?

285
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:06,680
He's my boss and friend.

286
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,064
You have a friend? How nice.

287
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,136
Thanks.

288
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,732
Did you get a doctor to look at
the journals I gave you?

289
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,520
Yes.

290
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,268
Was there evidence that
I did your sister harm?

291
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,648
No, but it couldn't be ruled out.

292
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:33,748
So I still have to prove my innocence -

293
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:37,748
- instead of you proving I was guilty?

294
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:41,192
You were wrong, Saga. Sit down.

295
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:49,948
It had terrible consequences.
Jennifer might have been alive today -

296
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:54,524
- if we hadn't lost custody.
Look at me.

297
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:57,408
Look at me.

298
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,624
I won't accuse you of anything
or demand an apology -

299
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:08,072
But you have to admit what you
did so we can move on.

300
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:12,788
A lot is already too late.

301
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:17,360
Dad died this morning.

302
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:26,672
Now it's only you and me, Saga.

303
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:39,416
We're having a memorial service.
I hope you'll at least come to that.

304
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:48,336
You haven't always hated him.

305
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,592
Sorry to interrupt.
Helle Anker's car has been found.

306
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:56,568
Shut up, man.

307
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:00,944
It's a heart.

308
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:04,352
- Do you think it's Helle Anker's?
- Maybe.

309
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:10,944
It's a ticket for the ghost train.

310
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:14,376
What the hell does he want?

311
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,116
Come.

312
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:42,052
It's Hans!

313
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,768
Call an ambulance!
He has a pulse!

314
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:50,544
Henrik Sabroe. We have an injured partner.
We need an ambulance in Dyrehavsbakken.

315
00:33:54,196 --> 00:33:56,160
Hurry up, dammit!

316
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:04,780
- Where are you going?
- I must go in.

317
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,036
No. We're driving back.

318
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:10,420
- I have to work.
- It's full of technicians.

319
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,460
- They might miss something.
- They miss nothing.

320
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,192
Saga, they have it under control. There's
nothing you more you can do right now.

321
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:24,024
Come. I'll drive you back.

322
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:28,648
No, I'll drive myself.

323
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:38,360
Saga. Can you come with me?

324
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:54,552
Marc?

325
00:35:58,108 --> 00:35:59,640
Where have you been?

326
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,136
What have you done?

327
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:15,480
That's why I played today.
I had to get money.

328
00:36:16,852 --> 00:36:18,888
- I'm sorry. I love you.
- I know that!

329
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:22,920
And I love you too, but you're
just so fucking stupid sometimes!

330
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,232
I've got two days.

331
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,896
Two days? To get 78,000?

332
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:38,816
How are we going to do that?
We can't just get an SMS loan, right?

333
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:44,280
- No. I'll find something else.
- No, you won't.

334
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:47,400
Not this time.

335
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:02,812
- How are you now?
- Good.

336
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:04,920
I'll pay for what I broke.

337
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,352
Think nothing of it.

338
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:13,352
- Can you participate in the investigation?
- Yes, why wouldn't I?

339
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:17,980
- You seem a little off balance.
- Now?

340
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,364
No, not now, but before.

341
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:26,928
That was a reaction to finding Hans
combined with a death today.

342
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:31,320
- What do you mean? Who died?
- My dad.

343
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:37,076
- I'm so sorry.
- We weren't close.

344
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:42,172
Even so. Those kind of feelings can
affect one's police work.

345
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:45,244
My feelings never affect my work.

346
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:50,040
Hans expects that I'll find the culprit.

347
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:55,060
- Because you're friends.
- No, because I'm the best he has.

348
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,984
- What's that?
- It came today.

349
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:22,800
Madman.

350
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:25,440
We knew that already.

351
00:38:26,328 --> 00:38:28,032
Fabian Christensen.

352
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,776
- Have you gone to the police with it?
- Not yet.

353
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,136
What are you waiting for?

354
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:48,480
So they're right. I'm not
responsible, but I'm involved.

355
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,368
You're neither responsible
nor involved. You're a victim.

356
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,488
- It's sick.
- It won't be perceived like that.

357
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,476
The whole discussion on the network
will just start all over.

358
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:02,160
I don't fucking care
how it's perceived.

359
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:07,656
- I was at the police station today.
- Why?

360
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,108
Because they think I'm involved.

361
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:13,852
If they find out that
you've had this -

362
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,472
- then we will really look bad.

363
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:23,304
Lise.

364
00:39:24,052 --> 00:39:26,376
It's my reputation, so
it's my decision.

365
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:33,024
Hi.

366
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:44,952
He's lost a hand and a lot of blood,
and he's in a coma.

367
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:58,416
I just wanted to know
how he was doing.

368
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:03,016
Saga, it's not easy
being alone right now.

369
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:06,768
- So call someone.
- Won't you stay?

370
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,016
You're his friend. You like him.

371
00:42:35,116 --> 00:42:36,504
How long have you been sitting here?

372
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:39,816
A few hours.

373
00:42:41,296 --> 00:42:46,180
I woke up. I don't know why.
The pills usually work -

374
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,736
- so I thought it might be my
subconscious telling me something.

375
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,256
- So I got up.
- Henrik.

376
00:42:54,244 --> 00:42:58,344
I know you want me to
drop it, but I can't.

377
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,784
One time.
They questioned him only one time.

378
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,456
I thought you were going
to ask your new partner for help.

379
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,312
Yeah.

380
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:19,704
Henrik, you're late for work.

381
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:27,048
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.
That's true.

382
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,416
Lukas.

383
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:03,456
If you kill him, you'll
never get your money.

384
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:17,328
or we can find another solution.

385
00:44:18,124 --> 00:44:20,808
One that both of you
benefit from.

386
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:24,408
He doesn't need to benefit from it,
but you let him go free.

387
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:29,784
A kind of installment plan.

388
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:40,488
Say something! Say what we need
to do to pay that debt off!

389
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:46,344
You have big balls, eh?

390
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:51,024
Bigger than your boyfriend's.

391
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:54,024
I don't have any choice.

392
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:11,064
There is something
you can help me with.

393
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:20,736
The technical investigation on
Hans hasn't produced anything yet.

394
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:25,828
But it was staged and lighted like
with Christensen and Anker.

395
00:45:26,236 --> 00:45:31,968
The bullets that killed Morten Anker
and Dover came from the same weapon.

396
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:38,312
The theory is that the targets were Helle
Anker, Fabian Christensen, and Hans.

397
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:43,352
Dover got in the way when he kidnapped
Hans. Morten was also a threat.

398
00:45:44,352 --> 00:45:49,516
There must be a connection
between Helle, Fabian, and Hans.

399
00:45:51,192 --> 00:45:52,516
There is one.

400
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,552
Yes, I've named Hans Pettersson
in a post -

401
00:46:07,052 --> 00:46:11,112
- because he had spoken highly critically
of me and my opinions.

402
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:16,848
But you've already been here,
and there's nothing that has changed.

403
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,020
Two connections can be coincidence.
Now there are three. That's a pattern.

404
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,352
What do you know about this, Lars?

405
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,864
I know nothing. Or ...

406
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:39,648
I know what Lise knows.

407
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,880
And Lise and you both
know more than us, or what?

408
00:46:58,756 --> 00:46:59,976
I've gotten a letter.

409
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,016
"I've gone from words to action
to show my appreciation.

410
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:13,968
No one understands
what you understand.

411
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:15,940
I do it without demanding
anything back -

412
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:22,536
- but it would mean a lot if you
could show me that I'm doing right.

413
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:25,440
Guide me.
Who should I take next time?"

414
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:29,616
Typewritten with a picture of
Fabian Christensen from the scene.

415
00:47:29,736 --> 00:47:31,616
It was under her door.

416
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,316
And she has no idea
who it's from?

417
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:37,316
I think there's a way to find out.

418
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,160
Five Danish soldiers.

419
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,584
Five young men are dead in Afghanistan
under Bente Knudsen's command.

420
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:55,200
It's not her fault that we send young
men to their deaths in foreign countries.

421
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,448
For me, it's completely incomprehensible
when Afghanistan's troubles became ours.

422
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:02,760
But if they are to defend
freedom and democracy -

423
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,352
- they should not be under
Knudsen's command.

424
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:11,232
Early tomorrow she takes off for yet
another assignment with new young men.

425
00:48:12,484 --> 00:48:17,256
Their greatest chance for survival
is if Knudsen is stopped.

426
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:23,256
I got a letter. A real letter.

427
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:26,400
That I was very happy
about and grateful for.

428
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:32,328
In the letter there was also a question.
I think that I've answered that now.

429
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:38,572
Post it at exactly 5:00 PM.

430
00:48:38,956 --> 00:48:41,568
Is that enough that
he'll go after Bente Knudsen?

431
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:46,648
The sender wants an objective. Now we've
given him an objective and a time frame.

432
00:48:47,428 --> 00:48:52,728
At 5:00 everyone should be invisible.
I repeat, 5:00, everyone invisible.

433
00:48:57,388 --> 00:49:01,992
All set. She indicated that he
only has tonight to do it.

434
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,968
- Where do you want us?
- Across the road.

435
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:07,588
Saga.

436
00:49:08,088 --> 00:49:09,556
Not you.

437
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:14,688
- I won't have you here.
- Why not?

438
00:49:15,188 --> 00:49:19,992
Hopefully the one who hurt Hans
is coming. You shouldn't be here.

439
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:24,024
- Do you think I'll do something?
- I think there's a risk of that.

440
00:49:26,524 --> 00:49:31,340
- I have good impulse control.
- This isn't negotiable, Saga.

441
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:42,988
The department at the hospital
is closing indefinitely.

442
00:49:43,988 --> 00:49:49,448
Helle Anker's death made the future
uncertain for the gender-neutral kindergarten -

443
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:53,376
- but the business is continuing.

444
00:49:54,028 --> 00:49:57,052
Natalie Anker spoke
earlier today.

445
00:49:57,552 --> 00:50:01,872
I'm taking over responsibility
for the kindergarten Helle started.

446
00:50:02,372 --> 00:50:04,972
I'm still in shock over what
happened to my wife -

447
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:09,436
- but violence or threats of violence
will never silence me.

448
00:50:09,936 --> 00:50:11,548
At the same time ...

449
00:50:12,048 --> 00:50:13,592
Hi. Are you ready?

450
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,092
- Did you win?
- Of course.

451
00:50:17,592 --> 00:50:19,732
Come on, let's grab sushi.

452
00:50:20,232 --> 00:50:23,696
- Honey, I'm far from finished.
- You can't delegate your work?

453
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:28,328
To whom? Just go.
I'll come in an hour.

454
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,852
- Okay. Then I'll see you later.
- Bye.

455
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:21,200
Are we even for yesterday now?

456
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,492
Listen ...

457
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,972
I will definitely look into
what you talked about.

458
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:35,264
For your sake.

459
00:51:44,716 --> 00:51:50,956
- How many have seen it now?
- 1,823 people.

460
00:52:00,124 --> 00:52:02,480
How many have seen it now?

461
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,540
Three more. 1,826.

462
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,840
No activity here.
He still hasn't shown.

463
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:36,408
Saga, I think I've found something.

464
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,188
I compared Lise's letter with
comments from her blog.

465
00:52:41,688 --> 00:52:46,728
There are 98 comments
from 'Knightrider'.

466
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:51,952
In 21 of them he uses
the word 'guide'.

467
00:52:52,452 --> 00:52:55,448
That was in the letters to
Helle and Lise. Check 'illuminate'.

468
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,296
- 19 times.
- That was in Helle's and Fabian's letters.

469
00:53:00,796 --> 00:53:04,760
- They're not common words.
- Do you know who Knightrider is?

470
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,732
Let me see ...

471
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:21,484
John has found something in the
comments section on Lise's blog.

472
00:53:21,984 --> 00:53:25,180
A Rikard Jonsson,
Ringstedgade 21 in Copenhagen.

473
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,856
- That's ten minutes from here.
- I'm on my way now.

474
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:31,756
- I'll be right there. See you in a bit.
- Good.

475
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:28,708
Yes, I'm taking over the
kindergarten that Helle started.

476
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,664
I'm still in shock over what
happened to my wife -

477
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:36,632
- but violence or threats of violence
will never silence me.

478
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:42,536
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
I'll be there soon.

479
00:55:43,036 --> 00:55:45,960
Drive to Natalie Anker's instead.
She's the next victim.

480
00:56:42,848 --> 00:56:44,244
No, don't ...

481
00:56:48,124 --> 00:56:51,220
Let me go! No!

482
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:10,272
Drop the knife!

483
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:22,064
Stop! Stop!

484
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,260
- Elias!
- He's sleeping.

485
