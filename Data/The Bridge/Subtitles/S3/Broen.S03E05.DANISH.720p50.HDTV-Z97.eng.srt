00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,500
Helle Anker. Fabian Christensen.
Hans Pettersson.

3
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:08,880
It's dramatic, staged, and lit.

4
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:13,080
Come on, man.

5
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:16,156
- What are you doing here?
- Visiting my girlfriend.

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,724
- How did it go in Copenhagen?
- Good, thanks.

7
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:29,232
We need to put the down payment
on that house today!

8
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:31,036
Is that today?

9
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,220
You're going to Sweden
to pick up a bag.

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,248
- Just make sure you fix it.
- Will do, Freddie.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,828
Dad died this morning.
Now it's only you and me, Saga.

12
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,636
Stop following me
or I'll report you.

13
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,492
Goodbye, Dad.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,624
I hope that I've been
able to show you -

15
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:02,480
- that happiness is actually a choice.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,080
- May I come in for a bit?
- Yeah. Come in.

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,636
- What is it?
- An investigation. A cold case.

18
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:19,448
Missing persons.

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,940
Just get in.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,220
Haven't I seen you before?
I'm really good with faces.

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,180
EPISODE 5

22
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:49,872
- Are you okay or what?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:53,808
- You're not saying much.
- What do they think I did?

24
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:56,232
What do they think
the car was involved in?

25
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,240
I have no idea.

26
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:00,576
You shouldn't be so worried.
They've dropped it now.

27
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:13,344
- How did the interview go?
- Good. I've got another one on Tuesday.

28
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:16,896
I'm crossing my fingers for you. Tell
me if there's anything we should look at.

29
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:23,568
- Hey, Lukas, you've got a call.
- Who is it?

30
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:26,328
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

31
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,224
This is Lukas.

32
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:35,448
Hello?

33
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:50,688
THE BRIDGE

34
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:58,008
I have no idea who shot me.

35
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,840
It's probably some lunatic,
I assume.

36
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,788
- They don't shoot with telescopic sights.
- I thought that was what they did.

37
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,536
That's with random victims.
You got a call, so you were chosen.

38
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:15,216
- Do you have any other suggestions?
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

39
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:19,368
I'm thinking sharpshooter,
military, 'Killbrothers'.

40
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:22,516
Yes, we can. About 45 minutes.

41
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,520
Come on.

42
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,072
Does she know about it?
Your little habit.

43
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:35,952
I found out where I knew you from.
Have you told her about it?

44
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:45,456
- What do you want?
- Just to let you know what I know.

45
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:50,808
I might need a favor one day.

46
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,760
- I think you can forget that.
- So you say.

47
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:01,740
Lars-Ove Abrahamsson's sister is
back. We must go to Sweden.

48
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:03,864
Good trip.

49
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,696
We're coming back again.

50
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:14,696
That investigation you gave me.

51
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:20,580
It's about a woman and two children
named Sabroe. Is it family?

52
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:25,440
It's my wife and my two daughters.

53
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,432
I went to work one morning
a little over six years ago.

54
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,624
I said, "Bye, see you tonight."

55
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:38,016
When I came home, they were gone.
Vanished.

56
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,160
- Was your wife depressed?
- No.

57
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,112
Did they have any reason
to escape from you?

58
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:46,584
Do you mean if I hit them?

59
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,320
- I didn't mean anything. I asked.
- No, there wasn't any reason.

60
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,000
Nothing that suggested a crime.

61
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:57,960
No, they were just gone.

62
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,720
Does it change anything?
That it's my family?

63
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:08,072
- Or will you still help me?
- Yes, but not now.

64
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,560
Margaretha Abrahamsson.

65
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:31,684
Saga Norén, Malmo Police. That's my
partner from Copenhagen, Henrik Sabroe.

66
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,176
We want to talk about your brother.

67
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,904
- She's deaf.
- Yes, thank you, I understood that too.

68
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:54,532
- You know sign language too?
- Yes, but not enough for interrogation.

69
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,692
The translator is on the way,
so we must wait.

70
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:11,000
My brother and I didn't
see one another.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,028
When did you see him last?

72
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,280
A long time ago. The 80s ...
In 81, maybe.

73
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:26,328
You haven't seen your
brother in 35 years?

74
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,688
- No.
- Why? What happened?

75
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,976
I had children.

76
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,184
You know nothing at all about him?

77
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:47,572
That he had to change jobs
all the time -

78
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:52,252
- and moved from school to school?

79
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,528
It was the students
who complained.

80
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,184
It was reported to the police.

81
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:05,336
But it never led to anything.

82
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:08,256
Sexual abuse?

83
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,616
Yes, among other things.
He was sick.

84
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:19,896
Do the names Hans Pettersson
and Helle Anker mean anything to you?

85
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:23,504
No.

86
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,184
and otherwise you know nothing
about your brother?

87
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,740
We had no contact.

88
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,108
It ... I cannot help you.

89
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,440
Karin. Hi.

90
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:57,172
- I'm visiting.
- I see that.

91
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,080
We were married 25 years.
He's the father of my children.

92
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,960
I have a right to visit him.

93
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,896
Of course you have.

94
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:20,112
But you're no longer married, and I'm
not the reason that you were divorced.

95
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:27,056
- That's what I want to believe.
- I thought so.

96
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:31,084
But it will be like this.
When I'm here, you're not here.

97
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,880
And I'm here now.

98
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,752
There.

99
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:26,524
- What is it?
- It looks like a burn mark.

100
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,888
Saga, it's me.

101
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:48,008
Hi. You're here now?

102
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:52,968
Yes. You may have missed something.
In the mouths of the victims.

103
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,152
- Henrik Sabroe, Copenhagen Police.
- Hi.

104
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,712
- I'm working on the last victim.
- Latest.

105
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:02,024
The latest victim.
We don't know if it's the last.

106
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:06,224
Anyway. He died of blood loss after
damage to the external genitalia.

107
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:09,552
Was he alive when they
were cut off?

108
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:12,412
They weren't cut off.
Rather, ripped off.

109
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,948
How?

110
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:18,896
It suggests a slowly increasing force
rather than a violent jerk.

111
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:21,940
- It took time.
- Yes.

112
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,148
- What is it that I missed?
- Between teeth, right side of the mouth.

113
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:35,856
- No, for god's sake ...
- Sorry.

114
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:54,312
- You can just see it.
- You're kidding me.

115
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,672
The other victims?

116
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,760
There's nothing here.

117
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:14,712
That confirms our suspicions that
he was killed by a copycat.

118
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,088
- What about Helle Anker?
- We handed her over.

119
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,684
She's going to be buried today.

120
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:45,820
Saga Norén, Malmo Police. We must
open the coffin and examine the body.

121
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
- We need to examine the body.
- No, you may not.

122
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,376
- You can't prevent us.
- You're not touching her.

123
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:58,592
- I know it's difficult.
- Then don't do it!

124
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,712
We need to do it.
It will only take a moment.

125
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:06,240
Unless we need to take her
for the investigation.

126
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:09,800
- But that's highly unlikely.
- We don't know that yet.

127
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
You may not do it.

128
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,560
Can you just close the doors?

129
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:26,160
Good. I'll wait out here.

130
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,224
She has it too. Come. Hold this.

131
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,388
Thanks.

132
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:04,660
There. Now they can continue
with the funeral.

133
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:07,592
Unless there's more
you've missed on the body.

134
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:13,336
- I haven't missed anything else.
- You missed the mark in the mouth.

135
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:17,936
- How long have you known me?
- Since February 22, 2001.

136
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:22,232
- Do you trust me?
- Yes. You're very professional.

137
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:27,192
- Well then.
- But you missed the mark in the mouth.

138
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:36,920
- We're taking her with us.
- No, you must not do it.

139
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,528
Yes, we do.
Otherwise we wouldn't do it.

140
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:46,400
I'll die if I have to go through this again.
Haven't you ever lost someone?

141
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,352
Yes, but it didn't involve the police.

142
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,052
We'll handle the transport.

143
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:00,700
So there was a mark?
Why a branding mark?

144
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,284
In the past it was used
to show ownership or as punishment.

145
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:12,168
- Ownership would be visible.
- So it's probably punishment.

146
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,072
Did your father leave any wishes?
Written or verbally?

147
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:30,392
No. At first, he thought he would live
forever, and when he became sick ...

148
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,208
Then it felt weird to bring it up.

149
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:39,128
What do you think he wanted?
Did he want a burial or cremation?

150
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:43,232
How can you be around
death every day?

151
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,472
One gets used to it.

152
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:51,556
Promise me you won't laugh.

153
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:56,072
I'm not as good at expressing
myself as you -

154
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:59,596
- but it makes me appreciate life.

155
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:03,844
One is never more alive than
when everything around is dead.

156
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:08,408
- That sounded stupid.
- No.

157
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:12,968
Not at all. It sounds like something
I could have written.

158
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:16,696
- You can use it if you want.
- Thanks.

159
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:19,444
Also me.

160
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,480
- What, here?
- If you want.

161
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:38,076
No, you ... No, no, no.

162
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:46,136
- I'm sorry.
- You decide. Tonight, perhaps?

163
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:51,936
- I have theatre tickets.
- I have other plans.

164
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:55,272
Clearly.

165
00:16:56,404 --> 00:17:01,136
So what did we say?
A burial or a cremation?

166
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:04,368
I'm home.

167
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,408
Hi.

168
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:17,400
You took the damn money.
My money.

169
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:20,740
After all the shit we went through,
you're playing again.

170
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,704
Yeah. But ... But I won.

171
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:30,912
24,600. That's for the house
and for the down payment.

172
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,048
Aren't you happy?

173
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:36,672
- You don't understand a damn thing.
- No, I obviously don't.

174
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:42,192
So it's a good thing you're here.
So beautiful and nice -

175
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:45,408
- and smart and clever and fantastic -

176
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:48,000
- and that you love stupid little me.

177
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,896
- You're completely hopeless.
- I know that, too.

178
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:02,232
Saga.

179
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:14,356
- You took the body from the funeral.
- They'd be given it too early.

180
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:19,300
Possibly, but those kind of actions
require a lot of empathy.

181
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,692
You should have informed me.
Then I would have sent someone else.

182
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,808
Why? The result would
have been the same.

183
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:29,384
But the process would
have been different.

184
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,120
You must do what you're good at, Saga.

185
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,724
That kind of interaction with other
people is not one of your strengths.

186
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:40,928
When I lead an investigation,
I take part in everything.

187
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:44,740
You did that with Hans,
but not anymore.

188
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:50,692
I want more information, and then
we will make an action plan together.

189
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:55,464
- Okay?
- Yes.

190
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,364
Zoom in and see if there
are more people in the car.

191
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:07,184
- I can get a little closer.
- You, what did Linn want?

192
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,780
To limit my responsibilities.

193
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,156
Who is that?

194
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:16,612
- It's Julia, my daughter.
- What is she doing here?

195
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:20,788
Mia has a night shift,
and the babysitter couldn't.

196
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:26,664
John found the photos from the bridge.
It's the youth center's van.

197
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:31,064
- Should she see this? She's an outsider.
- She's seven years old.

198
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:34,300
- We don't know who she talks to.
- No one, I promise.

199
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,692
This is the best
I have of the driver.

200
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:44,736
Oh my. Whoever it is,
he doesn't want to be recognized.

201
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:49,184
Why would Mehmet conceal his
identity to meet his girlfriend?

202
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:51,888
Exactly.

203
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:02,616
- Hi, Mehmet. How's it going?
- What is it now?

204
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:04,464
We have another little question.

205
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:08,064
The night you were in Sweden,
how were you dressed?

206
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,456
How was I dressed?

207
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:13,588
- Yes, what did you have on?
- I understand, but I can't remember.

208
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,292
- Try. Concentrate.
- Had you taken your hat off?

209
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,840
- Yeah, maybe.
- You'd maybe taken your hat off.

210
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:26,136
- I said I can't remember.
- You can't remember. Okay.

211
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,116
- Then you'll just have to come with us.
- What? Now?

212
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,080
Just a few hours in a little room.
So you can remember. Come on.

213
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,960
Okay, but I need to grab
my backpack.

214
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,284
- Then we'll follow you.
- That we will.

215
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:49,808
- I just need to go to the toilet.
- Give me your phone.

216
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:53,328
Where's the toilet?

217
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,464
Okay.

218
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,528
Yeah ...

219
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,224
What should I say?

220
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,344
Mehmet? Come on.

221
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,264
- What? What is it? Come on.
- I can remember what I had on.

222
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:52,344
I had grey training pants on,
a white t-shirt, a blue hoodie -

223
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,336
- a hat and sunglasses.

224
00:21:56,064 --> 00:22:00,408
- You just remembered now?
- I was stressed out when you asked.

225
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:04,424
It's unusual to suddenly remember
something so clearly.

226
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,808
She's saying that she doesn't
believe you. Lift your hand.

227
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:11,960
You were told what to say.

228
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,664
Well?

229
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:19,496
There. And the call list
is deleted, of course.

230
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:21,748
We can recover that.

231
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,488
We sure can.
We are investigating four murders.

232
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,952
Also, we have a police chief in a coma.
Is there anything you want to be mounted on?

233
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:33,536
- What do you mean?
- That can't really be interpreted.

234
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:36,552
That's her way of saying
that you're an idiot.

235
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:42,000
- No, it's not.
- Don't be an idiot. Look at me.

236
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:45,648
Tell me who you
have spoken to.

237
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:49,080
Who is it that told you
what you should say?

238
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:51,312
Come on.

239
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,496
Lukas. It was Lukas.

240
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,088
This is Henrik Sabroe
from Copenhagen Police.

241
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:07,440
You have a Lukas Stenstrup who may not
leave the hospital under any circumstances.

242
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:11,640
No, he isn't here.

243
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:31,368
- Where is Viola?
- Your mom's. She doesn't know anything.

244
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,812
- Should I start?
- No. Sorry.

245
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:43,056
I just don't know what to say.
You saw the photos.

246
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:47,800
- Was it the first time?
- No.

247
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,816
For god's sake, Anna.
With Benjamin?

248
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,988
You and me are one thing, but how
could you do that to Eva?

249
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:59,600
- What were you thinking?
- It didn't seem real.

250
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,344
It was undemanding.
Easy. An escape.

251
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:08,764
But now it's over.

252
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:13,512
Now I'm here with us and Eva
and Mom and the press.

253
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:16,056
And that's the reality.

254
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:20,548
Anna ...

255
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,728
It was a mistake.

256
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:29,360
I'll back you up publicly.
I will support you.

257
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,712
Publicly? Have you talked with Mom?

258
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:37,664
Yeah. We're eager to put this
behind us as quickly as possible.

259
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:41,264
So the business, Viola, and we take
as little damage as possible.

260
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:46,568
The company, Viola, and us?
In that order?

261
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:51,392
I think I'm more understanding than
most men would be in this situation.

262
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:12,420
It's me again. Call me. Please.

263
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,468
Benjamin?

264
00:25:19,204 --> 00:25:23,336
- Why aren't you picking up when I call?
- Because I don't want to talk to you.

265
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:29,212
- How are you doing?
- Good.

266
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:32,740
It doesn't bother me that it's out.
I'm thinking about Anna.

267
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:35,792
All of this is her fault.

268
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,916
What? There's nothing
that's her fault.

269
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,536
We love each other.

270
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,028
I know what you're thinking,
but she loves me too.

271
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:50,240
We're going to be together.

272
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:55,064
What is she saying about all of this?
Hasn't she called?

273
00:25:55,564 --> 00:26:00,152
- She was just using you.
- No. She loves me.

274
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:03,992
Do you understand why
I don't want to talk to you?

275
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:07,680
[Southern Realtors]

276
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:15,456
We own a house. It's ours.

277
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:19,776
- Come on.
- House and home. It needs a lot of work.

278
00:26:20,276 --> 00:26:23,208
We'll be doing so much, it will seem fun.
We'll get the rest later.

279
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:28,248
Wow ...

280
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:34,384
- Come on. Aren't you happy?
- Yes, and you are. It's just ...

281
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:37,536
It's a long way from everything.

282
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,360
You need to be away.
Copenhagen isn't good for you.

283
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:50,376
Now we'll start over.
Just you and me, no?

284
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,164
Come. You should see the terrace and
the swings. Don't you think it could be nice?

285
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,792
Just look at this garden.

286
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,480
- We can put a swimming pool there.
- Swimming pool?

287
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:07,320
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Sure.

288
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:13,200
Great.

289
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,184
I think we need to put 'absolute'.

290
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:32,472
- "The absolute biggest mistake."
- I won't say that, Mom.

291
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,864
A public apology just makes it
bigger than it is.

292
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,608
We don't just sell houses.
We sell values.

293
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,916
I need to think of Benjamin, too.

294
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:46,300
No, you must not do that.

295
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:51,512
Seriously, Anna. How could you
go to bed with a 17-year-old?

296
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:54,584
Does age matter?

297
00:27:55,584 --> 00:28:00,440
If it had been someone your own age,
you would have just been unfaithful.

298
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,156
Now you're unfaithful and pathetic.

299
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:09,924
I love him. Truly.

300
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:26,120
So we continue.
'The absolute biggest mistake' ...

301
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:40,876
He's wanted in both countries, and we
have people outside of the youth center -

302
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:43,688
- his home, and other places
Lukas might go.

303
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:48,744
- Why did you let Mehmet call?
- I didn't let him call.

304
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:57,384
It was my fault. I didn't think that
he'd have another phone.

305
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:03,888
- Is there anything else?
- We have a report from the technicians.

306
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:09,752
There were traces of DNA in the van.
They're checking if it matches Helle Anker.

307
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:12,080
But no traces of blood.

308
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:18,224
How can someone drive with a body
that's cut up without leaving blood?

309
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,408
You don't think it was him.

310
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:24,344
The car was in Sweden.
That's the only thing we have.

311
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:28,008
He escaped from the hospital
and he's gone into hiding.

312
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:31,680
- Do you know why else he would do that?
- No.

313
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,172
Anything else?

314
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:40,136
I found some child pornography
on Lars-Ove Abrahamsson's computer.

315
00:29:40,844 --> 00:29:42,704
That explains the missing genitals.

316
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:46,928
I've passed it on. So we'll see if we
can identify the victims.

317
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:49,472
Check all of his former students.

318
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:53,672
- There must be thousands.
- Ask for help.

319
00:29:56,548 --> 00:30:01,492
Start with the reports and see if
they match anything in our notes.

320
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:06,440
- Was that it? Then see you tomorrow.
- I'm going too. Julia. Come.

321
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:11,144
- I'm going on a date.
- You're not really taking her?

322
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,472
Sure. Tina knows I have a child.

323
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:17,324
That doesn't mean that
she wants to meet her.

324
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:20,496
- Here.
- Is that for me?

325
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:24,560
- What's this?
- It's you, him, and Dad.

326
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,772
I don't see it.

327
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,448
Don't worry about her.

328
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:37,056
It's really great.
And you are, too.

329
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:49,992
You, what's going on with you and Linn?

330
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,484
She's questioning me and my work.

331
00:30:55,804 --> 00:31:00,240
So say something.
You don't need to take that.

332
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:03,552
You are the very best she has,
and she knows it.

333
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:10,348
What if that's not true.
What if Hans covered up my mistakes.

334
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,736
No. Hans made sure you could
focus on your job.

335
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:21,264
- Should I talk to her?
- About what?

336
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:25,440
We're a team. Her job is to
build us up, not tear us down.

337
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:31,032
You are simply too good to
stand there and doubt yourself.

338
00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:37,872
Thanks.

339
00:31:59,212 --> 00:32:01,608
I wasn't born with a
silver spoon in my mouth.

340
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:06,024
You who know me know
that my parents have fought.

341
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:09,600
We didn't go the movies often,
or go out and eat.

342
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,736
But we went to the museum.

343
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:18,456
"One can't see too many beautiful things,"
my father said. And it was free for kids.

344
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:24,792
But not everything was beautiful.
The art could be disturbing -

345
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:30,096
- demanding and daunting.
It made me think about life.

346
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,968
It gave me a direction.
I guess that's what art does.

347
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:38,184
Now we have a shitload of money.

348
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:45,624
Me and my beautiful, talented wife, Åsa.
Come here, Åsa.

349
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,864
We can buy the art we want -

350
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:53,952
- and the art we can't buy, we
can travel around the world to see.

351
00:32:55,152 --> 00:32:57,720
But not everyone is so fortunate.

352
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:02,040
And that's why we've donated money -

353
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,712
- so the museum can build a
completely new wing.

354
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:12,456
But while we wait -

355
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:18,556
- I'm sharing art from my private collection,
so it can create more joy -

356
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:21,720
- and maybe get them to continue
in the world of art

357
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:26,784
- and therefore life. Thank you.

358
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:30,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Freddie Holst.

359
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,608
- Jeanette, do you regret doing this?
- Definitely not.

360
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:49,488
- Do you?
- No. Not if you don't.

361
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,544
Ha, look at this.

362
00:33:55,588 --> 00:33:58,344
What's that? Isn't it nice?

363
00:33:59,064 --> 00:33:59,856
Marc!

364
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:26,160
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

365
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,980
Okay.

366
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:29,784
Roll your window down.

367
00:34:31,684 --> 00:34:32,928
You stay right here.

368
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:34,896
- What?
- You stay right here.

369
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:37,588
Marc!

370
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:43,032
Look at me. You were alone in the car.
Repeat: "I was alone in the car."

371
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:45,984
- I was alone in the car.
- Good. Music to my ears.

372
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:50,160
Jeanette! Who are you? Jeanette!

373
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,696
You stay here.

374
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,580
It's not possible,
but even this ...

375
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:36,604
Nice speech.

376
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,592
- Hi, Claes.
- Freddie.

377
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,820
- It's been a long time.
- Truly. Truly.

378
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,528
I didn't expect to see you here.

379
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:52,724
I didn't expect to be invited,
but here we are.

380
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,216
May I take a photo?

381
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:00,248
You've put a little weight on, eh?

382
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:04,636
Claes. So it was you.

383
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:06,816
Sorry. I have to take this.

384
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:13,040
I was just congratulating Freddie
on all of it. The belly and the exhibition ...

385
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,148
Thanks.

386
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:18,152
It's very beautiful.

387
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:23,908
But I knew that already,
since I owned a lot of the works.

388
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:28,224
Colbert. Colbert.
Just do what we've agreed.

389
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:32,968
- You seem to have it good.
- I do.

390
00:36:35,212 --> 00:36:38,140
Are you Claes Sandberg?
Can you come with me?

391
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,952
Yeah. Did something happen?

392
00:36:41,596 --> 00:36:42,360
No.

393
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,380
Hi, Claes.

394
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,980
- Do you know her?
- Yes, I do.

395
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:56,956
- What are you doing here?
- I'm your plus one. Sorry I'm late.

396
00:36:57,456 --> 00:37:02,060
- How did you know that I was here?
- I saw the invitation at your place.

397
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,476
Do you think you can let me in?

398
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,720
We have sex, so we can
certainly be seen together.

399
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,744
Yeah ... She's my plus one.

400
00:37:18,744 --> 00:37:21,992
Annika Melander,
if you need to write it down or something.

401
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:28,948
- Shouldn't you be at the theatre?
- This seemed much more fun.

402
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:42,628
I know that my behavior has hurt
not just my family, but our business.

403
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:47,068
Which you'll soon be director of,
it is said.

404
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:49,900
What now?

405
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,848
My husband has been understanding,
and we will work on our relationship -

406
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:57,584
- which we both want to work.

407
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,968
And the young man?

408
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:04,708
Yeah. What can I say?

409
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:08,240
It was a conscious decision.
I don't blame anyone else.

410
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,068
But it was a mistake.

411
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,224
How was your day?

412
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,240
We have this guy named Lukas -

413
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:20,184
- that we were looking for today.

414
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,496
And I think he was in Sweden when Helle
Anker was killed because he sold drugs.

415
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,032
- How the hell do I explain that?
- Did you buy from him?

416
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:35,880
I have no ... I don't think
I've bought from him -

417
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,224
- but he recognized me, so
I don't know how he saw me.

418
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,672
I don't know ... Fuck.
I'm just going to go for a ride.

419
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:50,496
- Is it getting late?
- What?

420
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:54,024
I hope it is.

421
00:40:32,352 --> 00:40:34,132
Hey. What are you doing?

422
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,292
Reading.

423
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,724
- Do you want company?
- No.

424
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:43,972
- Do you want to have sex?
- That wasn't why I came.

425
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:46,924
If you do, you can come in.
Otherwise I want to be alone.

426
00:40:48,676 --> 00:40:51,992
- Don't you just want to watch a film?
- A porno film?

427
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:56,384
- No, a normal film.
- No. Sex or alone.

428
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:02,984
- Well, I guess it's sex then.
- Good. Come in, get ready.

429
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,860
- Åsa?
- Yes?

430
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,324
- What was Claes doing at the exhibition?
- I don't know.

431
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,272
- Was it you who invited him?
- No.

432
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,832
So it was a coincidence
that your ex-husband was there?

433
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,596
But he's so famous.

434
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:35,048
He's successful with his books,
so the organizers must have invited him.

435
00:41:37,012 --> 00:41:41,648
He seemed to have it good,
don't you think?

436
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:52,056
Oh, for god's sake. Wait here.
I'm just going to talk to him.

437
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:20,064
- Who was that?
- That was no one. Business.

438
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,420
- Can you help me with the zipper?
- Yeah.

439
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:48,840
Thanks.

440
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:52,732
Now there's only a week left.

441
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:56,572
Do you know how hot this is?

442
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:09,272
Now I'll have a glass of champagne.
Do you want one too?

443
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:13,152
Jeanette moved in.
She's living in the guest house.

444
00:43:13,684 --> 00:43:16,272
I need to have control
of her and the baby these last weeks.

445
00:43:17,452 --> 00:43:20,072
I shouldn't meet her.

446
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:23,880
Nothing must happen to the child,
and she's not thinking about it.

447
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:29,048
Does that surprise you? You chose her.
You have to take care of it elsewhere.

448
00:43:29,548 --> 00:43:32,476
- She can't be here.
- It's for the child's sake.

449
00:43:32,976 --> 00:43:35,716
She cannot live here.
There's nothing to discuss.

450
00:43:36,216 --> 00:43:38,528
- There are excellent hotels.
- Exactly.

451
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:40,848
That you can live at.

452
00:43:41,644 --> 00:43:45,648
Jeanette stays here until the child
is born, and that's not up for discussion.

453
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:11,088
Why do I need to be here?
It's not fucking okay!

454
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,600
I had to do it for the child.
You must be more careful.

455
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,576
What are you doing?

456
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:28,080
Not smuggling bags.
Not racing on the forest roads.

457
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:30,096
It's my son that
you have in your belly.

458
00:44:37,852 --> 00:44:42,432
The doctor says everything looks fine.
You just need calm and rest.

459
00:44:42,652 --> 00:44:45,888
If you need anything, just ask
me or the help.

460
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,664
But you stay here.

461
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,504
What about Marc?
I need to call him.

462
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:55,252
I've talked to him,
so that can wait a little.

463
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:58,536
- No, it can't.
- It needs to.

464
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,360
You can't get a cell phone right now.

465
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:07,248
- Is he kicking?
- No, he's just moving a little.

466
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:32,864
Anna. Anna?

467
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:38,408
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- I must talk to her.

468
00:45:38,908 --> 00:45:42,076
She's seen that you've
been calling all day.

469
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:46,780
If she had wanted to speak to you,
she would have taken the call.

470
00:45:48,388 --> 00:45:53,856
Did you really think she would leave
Viola and the rest to be with you?

471
00:45:54,356 --> 00:45:56,956
Well? Now listen.

472
00:45:57,456 --> 00:46:01,588
She had her fun, she was caught,
and now it's over.

473
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:08,212
You've seen the interview, haven't you?
No one forced her to do it.

474
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,544
It was a conscious decision.
I don't blame anyone else.

475
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:22,852
But it was a mistake.

476
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:28,068
It was the biggest mistake
I have ever made in my life.

477
00:46:31,804 --> 00:46:33,912
... mistake.

478
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:38,360
It was the biggest mistake
I have ever made in my life.

479
00:46:40,516 --> 00:46:42,196
It was a mistake.

480
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:46,828
It was the biggest mistake
I have ever made in my life.

481
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:19,952
You have a message.

482
00:47:24,588 --> 00:47:27,120
You got a message on your phone.

483
00:47:33,044 --> 00:47:36,156
[COME HOME]

484
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:22,968
Hi, Henrik. I think it's
time for that favor.

485
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,224
Are we alone? What about
your wife? The kids?

486
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:36,072
They're not home.

487
00:48:37,468 --> 00:48:40,080
You know that I don't have shit
to do with the murders, right?

488
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,824
You know what I was doing in Sweden.
You're a customer, man.

489
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:53,544
- Who was it that shot you?
- I've expanded too strongly.

490
00:48:54,316 --> 00:48:56,136
I need to travel a while.

491
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,792
I wont stop you.

492
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,392
I can take a ferry from Trelleborg.
I have friends in Germany.

493
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,096
I said I won't stop you.

494
00:49:03,436 --> 00:49:08,880
I'm wanted in Denmark and Sweden.
I need you to wave your ID card -

495
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,880
- so we can just move on. Okay?

496
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:16,368
- I can't.
- You fucking need to.

497
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,008
Or should I send them to your boss?

498
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:35,088
- How long have you been using drugs?
- I'm driving you. We're not friends.

499
00:49:40,996 --> 00:49:42,048
Lukas!

500
00:50:40,852 --> 00:50:43,536
We have searched the area ...
We just need ...

501
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:49,488
Hi.

502
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,512
- What happened to him?
- He wanted to talk to me.

503
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,744
About what?

504
00:50:54,868 --> 00:51:00,216
We thought that he was involved
in the Anker and Abrahamsson murders.

505
00:51:01,348 --> 00:51:05,256
He said that he had nothing to do
with it. It was about drugs.

506
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,120
That was why he got
Mehmet to lie.

507
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:13,256
He admitted that? And then?

508
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,240
He wanted to turn himself in.

509
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:20,184
So he wanted to drive over to you.
We were about to leave in the car.

510
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,308
He confessed to some drug offenses
and wanted to turn himself in to us.

511
00:51:26,236 --> 00:51:29,688
He was scared shitless. He felt
guilty and feared for his life.

512
00:51:31,084 --> 00:51:32,664
Oh, god.

513
00:51:32,908 --> 00:51:35,280
He had crossed the wrong guys.

514
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,412
- Did you see who was shooting?
- I saw the car very clearly.

515
00:51:39,912 --> 00:51:41,376
It was a Mercedes C200.

516
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:46,296
FL 44 559.

517
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:53,832
- Are you okay?
- I'll be okay. Of course I'll be okay.

518
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,864
I was disappointed when you didn't come
to the memorial service.

519
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:49,252
But not so surprised.
You've always been a disappointment.

520
00:52:49,752 --> 00:52:53,068
- What were you talking to Linn about?
- You, of course.

521
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:57,556
How you drove your little
sister to suicide, among other things.

522
00:52:58,056 --> 00:53:00,772
- I did not.
- No?

523
00:53:01,272 --> 00:53:04,856
14 is a difficult age. Dad and I were
in prison. She was sick.

524
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:09,460
Left only to her cold, deranged big sister.

525
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,480
Do you want to hit me? You can't hurt me
any more than you already have.

526
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,508
Look at me. Look at me.

527
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:28,616
Poor, poor girl.

528
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:41,236
- What did my mom want?
- I can't tell you that.

529
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:45,260
Lukas Stenstrup was shot
outside of Henrik's house.

530
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,952
- What was he doing there?
- Confessing to drug crimes.

531
00:53:53,572 --> 00:53:58,544
Why were you talking to my mom?
You don't talk to my colleagues' parents.

532
00:53:59,044 --> 00:54:02,140
She asked for a meeting.
Should I have said no?

533
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:04,400
She's lying.

534
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,928
I can't discuss what we
talked about. Sorry.

535
00:54:08,428 --> 00:54:10,876
She's lying.

536
00:54:17,476 --> 00:54:20,148
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

537
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:49,088
What was it you wanted to show me?

538
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:54,820
The brand marks. I cleaned them
and examined them more thoroughly.

539
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,560
It looks like a kind of character.

540
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,272
The same applies to Hans
and Lars-Ove Abrahamsson -

541
00:55:03,772 --> 00:55:06,296
- but different characters.

542
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:17,164
It's the Babylonian number system.

543
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,508
It's Linn.

544
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:55,688
I need help with an old case.
I need someone I can trust.

545
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:05,448
- It's good that you can help me.
- Of course.

546
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:14,984
Hi.

547
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:18,176
- Where have you been?
- Forensics.

548
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:19,680
Did you hear about Lukas?

549
00:56:20,908 --> 00:56:24,792
He was shot right in front of me.
Died in my arms.

550
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,932
Was it he who texted'd
you this morning?

551
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:35,112
No. This morning. It wasn't him.
Or do you mean last night? Yeah.

552
00:56:35,572 --> 00:56:36,408
Mmhmm.

553
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:53,264
Went to the summer house.
I'll get Viola.

554
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:27,748
Benjamin. Leave a message
or send a text.

555
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:34,228
Hi. It's me. Sorry I didn't
pick up yesterday.

556
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:38,940
It was the damn interview.
I'm sorry. I had to do it.

557
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,744
But ... I've thought about
where I'm happy.

558
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:48,700
It's with you. I don't
care what people say.

559
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,260
I must do what feels right,
and that is to be together with you.

560
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:56,740
I love you.

561
00:58:06,624 --> 00:58:18,024
