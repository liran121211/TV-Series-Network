00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:10,712
- Did the Johanssons have any children?
- No, but they've had foster children.

3
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,452
We have three new killings,
two new works of art.

4
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:19,560
- We think there is one victim left.
- And you think that's me.

5
00:00:20,116 --> 00:00:24,288
He gambled it away yesterday.
I've bought it.

6
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:26,572
It is a gift. Only for you.

7
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:30,024
- So it happened?
- Yeah, but listen, I've gotten...

8
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:39,048
- Who gave you this assignment?
- Look at the address.

9
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:41,184
For fuck's sake.

10
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:45,468
He's braindead. I'll ask you to think
about the future, eventual organ donation -

11
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:48,776
- and what we should do
regarding the respirator.

12
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:52,904
This is regarding the murder of
your mother, Marie-Louise Norén.

13
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,912
- She said that I had threatened her.
- And you did that?

14
00:00:57,412 --> 00:01:01,224
No. It seems like she wanted
to set me up for it.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,844
Don't look so sad, like I'm
leaving you for them.

16
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:07,344
Can you pick me up tonight?

17
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:11,548
- You've got a little stalker.
- It's actually not amusing.

18
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:14,760
It's all the employees and firings
from Andersen TL.

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,824
Emil Larsson?

20
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:20,664
Do any of you have photos of
Emil Larsson on your phone?

21
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:24,920
We've gotten the list of foster
children from Social Services.

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,900
Emil Larsson. He was on the list
of foster children, too.

23
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:37,640
EPISODE 8

24
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:34,584
THE BRIDGE

25
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:42,964
Emil Larsson, born 1989. Father unknown.
Mother died when he was five.

26
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:46,760
Foster placement after that at the
Johansson's from '96 to '05.

27
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:50,788
So we finally have a connection
to some of the victims.

28
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,640
Start with Hans.

29
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:56,072
When Emil was eight, he
ran away from the foster home.

30
00:03:56,572 --> 00:04:00,272
He was found in Malmo and said that
he was on his way to his father in Paris.

31
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:05,816
- What does that have to do with Hans?
- He was the officer who drove him back.

32
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,600
Lars-Ove Abrahamsson was a teacher
at that middle school.

33
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:18,576
Helle Anker?

34
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:22,776
- We have no connection there.
- Håkan Ekdahl?

35
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:27,100
Nothing yet. But he has a connection
to Holst through the museum.

36
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,568
- Are there more connections?
- Not that we've found.

37
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:37,248
Håkan Ekdahl was a social worker until
2001. He was a supervisor.

38
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,568
- Could he have placed Emil in foster care?
- There's nothing here on that.

39
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:46,684
We'll find out.

40
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:51,100
We concentrate on Emil Larsson.

41
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:54,268
Henrik, you take the museum
and Freddie Holst.

42
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:57,556
Saga, take his apartment in Lomma.

43
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,736
Good morning.

44
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:11,592
- Kjell Grankvist, Internal Affairs.
- Henrik.

45
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:16,520
- How's it going with the investigation?
- Good.

46
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,104
How's it going with you?

47
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,328
This is my floor.

48
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:27,200
Hi. This way.

49
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:33,080
- Who was the other guy?
- Rasmus Larsson.

50
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,028
- An incompetent colleague.
- Okay.

51
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,128
Freddie?

52
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,192
Okay.

53
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,480
- Have you found anything?
- Nothing.

54
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:42,436
Nothing here either. He didn't come to
work this morning, and no one knows why.

55
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,664
You, did he leave a message or anything?

56
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,632
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

57
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,932
There's nothing in his locker
to help us, either.

58
00:07:57,432 --> 00:08:01,012
The apartment is furnished, but
it doesn't look like anyone lives here.

59
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,792
<i>I'm going out to Holst, so I'll
see you later in Malmo.</i>

60
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,120
Okay.

61
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,512
The threats that Marie-Louise Norén
reported Saga had made ...

62
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:22,104
- It was to you that she reported them.
- Yes.

63
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:26,956
- What do you think about them?
- Well, they were threats.

64
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:29,696
Marie-Louise sensed that
Saga wanted to get rid of her.

65
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:35,696
She had made contact after many years.
Saga wanted to end the contact.

66
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,196
Permanently.

67
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:41,592
You've worked with Saga.
What's your opinion of her?

68
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:46,636
She's focused, efficient. Stubborn.

69
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,512
But she didn't seem completely stable.

70
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:55,220
And your opinion isn't affected by her
getting you reassigned after you'd made a mistake?

71
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,580
No.

72
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,184
No?

73
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:05,328
No. She was right. I was wrong.

74
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,184
- Ah, there you are again.
- Don't you have people to do that for you?

75
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,112
Why? Do you need a new job?

76
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,600
Do you recognize him here?

77
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:23,956
Yeah. I do, actually, but I can't
remember in what context.

78
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:26,116
He was at the museum
where your art hangs.

79
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,672
Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

80
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:31,824
He's been here in the house. He
picked up pictures for the exhibition.

81
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:34,420
Then that's where I know him from.

82
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,792
- But you don't know him otherwise?
- No. He seems friendly.

83
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:41,452
Looks can be deceiving.

84
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:46,416
Take the picture and show it to your people.
Your wife, is she home?

85
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,952
No, she isn't.

86
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,528
She's out a lot, eh?
We've never met her.

87
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:55,392
Call next time. I'll make
sure that she's home.

88
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,856
Hey. Are you here?

89
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:24,608
- Yeah. What are you doing with that?
- I was just sorting out some things.

90
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,672
Will you come in?

91
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:36,240
- Do you want anything? Coffee, or?
- No, thanks.

92
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,040
- Tell.
- What do you mean?

93
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,256
Why are you here?
Shall I take your coat?

94
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:46,324
Yes, thanks.

95
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,456
I'm jealous.

96
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm jealous of a 20-year-old little whore.

97
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:03,368
- Okay. Why?
- Not jealous. Rather, envious.

98
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:07,108
Okay. How is that?

99
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:10,112
Because he'd rather be together
with her than with me.

100
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:14,836
- Freddie? Is he unfaithful?
- No.

101
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,496
Not really. It was going well until -

102
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:25,804
- until she moved in, but now she's
there every day with her big belly ...

103
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:29,768
I can't compete with that.
It won't be long before -

104
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:34,228
- she gives him what he wants.
Then he'll forget about me.

105
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:38,840
- How can I compete with that?
- Sorry, I don't really understand.

106
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,016
- What is it that she can give him?
- A son.

107
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,320
Our son.

108
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:06,652
According to the neighbors, he kept to
himself. He didn't have any visitors.

109
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:12,432
It was the same with the museum.
He didn't see any colleagues privately.

110
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:15,604
Alternative addresses?

111
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,752
No friends or family
who can help us?

112
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:22,856
The technicians didn't find anything
connected to the murders.

113
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:27,100
Social Services has confirmed
that it was Håkan Ekdahl -

114
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,624
- who placed Emil at the Johansson's.

115
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,688
We arrest him in absentia.

116
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,568
- Have you been in your mom's car?
- No.

117
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:29,648
A dark green Skoda Felicia.

118
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:33,344
I know that. I have seen it,
but I've never been in it.

119
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:37,304
So you don't know how a fingernail
with your DNA end up in it?

120
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,800
No.

121
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:46,948
Hey. We've found Emil.

122
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:51,556
- I must go.
- Of course. Do your job.

123
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:55,632
We can continue later.

124
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,168
I wake up ...

125
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:06,440
... and then I have a kind of
sack over my head.

126
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm tied to the chair.

127
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,808
Sometimes someone comes in and hits me.

128
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:21,600
Man or woman?

129
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,520
I don't know.
Hard. 'Hen' hit hard.

130
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,392
- How did you get free?
- I didn't.

131
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,428
I must have been drugged.

132
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:41,808
When I woke up, I was in that field.

133
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,244
Why do you think you were let free?

134
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,544
'The One That Got Away'.
It's one of the pictures from the list.

135
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:52,588
Ed Booker.

136
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:56,360
Ed Booker, for god's sake.
American artist. Critical of civilization.

137
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:01,276
And it's owned by Freddie Holst?

138
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:06,072
The woman who found him has identified
the place. I've sent photos. And this.

139
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,064
This is for you.

140
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:09,748
What is it?

141
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:13,660
The wound in your mouth. It's a six.
The code is finished.

142
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,984
Emil. L369G42, does that mean
anything to you?

143
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:19,712
No.

144
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,172
Do you remember anything that
could help us? Sounds, smells, anything.

145
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:31,060
- I could hear things outside.
- Good. Wait a minute.

146
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:33,408
<i>John?</i>

147
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:37,304
- Are we getting through?
- Yes, we hear and see you.

148
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,352
I remember it because it
was so normal.

149
00:15:54,676 --> 00:16:00,648
It was an ice cream truck.
You know the melody ...

150
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:05,392
Also ... but that was much later.

151
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,172
Sirens.

152
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,940
There must have been several cars.

153
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,680
I think I fainted when he
did that in my mouth.

154
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,536
When I woke up again,
I heard children.

155
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,616
I think they sang.

156
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:39,484
Do you remember any planes or anything
else we can use for identification?

157
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,504
No, that was everything.
I think that was everything.

158
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,928
- Are you on it?
- Yes, thanks. I'll get started immediately.

159
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:54,768
Why me?

160
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,432
- Where have you been?
- So you noticed I was gone after all.

161
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,544
- Okay. What's this about?
- Your little morning walks, for example.

162
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,796
Oh, for fuck's sake.

163
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:17,236
I've said how I feel about that, but still
you run around with her all the time.

164
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:20,576
- Love, she lives here.
- Yeah, and why does she?

165
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:23,812
I've explained this.
It's for the sake of the child.

166
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:29,380
No, it's so you can have her here
and see and feel her belly grow.

167
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:33,612
Give her a suite somewhere and
let Colbert keep an eye on her.

168
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,092
- Just get her out of here.
- I can't kick her out.

169
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,480
Because she's the mother
of your child, isn't she?

170
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,672
Oh, fuck.

171
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,540
<i>- Hi, Honey.
- Say we really did it.</i>

172
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,536
- Did what?
- The child.

173
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,329
Of course we did it.

174
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,792
I don't know if they're going
to be good parents for my child.

175
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,168
It's not your child, Jeanette.

176
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:09,120
- It's more mine than hers.
- Yeah, okay, but we can't keep it.

177
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:12,384
They fight all the time, and she hates me.

178
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:16,584
The child is half mine.
Do you think she can she love it?

179
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:21,648
Of course, Jeanette. There's only one
week left. Stop with the good ideas.

180
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:25,176
You shouldn't even begin to think
about keeping your child.

181
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:30,168
- No. Of course.
- Good.

182
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:36,360
Do you want to hear some good news?
I've almost got all the money for the house.

183
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:40,104
- I only need 1800.
- That's great.

184
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:42,744
Super, super cool, Marc.

185
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:52,876
- Has something happened with Hans?
- Yeah.

186
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,320
Is there some place we can talk?

187
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:03,504
Good, you're here. Come.

188
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:12,216
I think Emil was held in this area.

189
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:15,728
- Why do you think that?
- The ice cream truck didn't help. Too many.

190
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:19,372
So I checked emergency calls. Here.

191
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:22,776
Container fire. Two fire trucks
and a police car.

192
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,612
So I checked the ice cream truck again,
and it stops in this area.

193
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:32,312
Now I had two out of three,
and I checked schools and kindergartens.

194
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:36,772
Clover Kindergarten is here.

195
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:41,664
So somewhere in this area.

196
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:43,516
So we need to find out who lives there.

197
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,392
I've already done that.

198
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,216
I've underlined a name.

199
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:55,664
Annika Melander.

200
00:19:56,164 --> 00:20:00,216
- She was a foster child.
- At the Johansson's, the same time as Emil.

201
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:05,112
There's nothing to be done.
He won't survive this.

202
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:11,304
We've found an Annika Melander.
She was in the same foster home as Emil.

203
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:13,584
I'm going to speak with him or her.

204
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:18,240
Go. I'm coming.

205
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,736
Is that Annika? We were
in the same foster family.

206
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,472
For a few years.

207
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,656
And it wasn't especially fun.

208
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:35,400
No, it wasn't good.
But it was worse for her.

209
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:36,888
Why is that?

210
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,572
She was like ...

211
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:44,472
At the bottom of the hierarchy.

212
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:48,704
- And where were you?
- Far down.

213
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:54,080
Over her. None of us escaped
Filip, our foster father -

214
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,064
- but one just kicked down.

215
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,472
Fuck. It's nothing I'm proud of.

216
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,032
- Are you still in contact with her?
- No, nothing.

217
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:10,896
I haven't seen her since she moved.

218
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:13,536
Okay.

219
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:17,040
Let's take a look at the victims again.

220
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:21,192
You can just skip the Johanssons.

221
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:24,704
Lars-Ove. Gym teacher
at my middle school.

222
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:30,900
He certainly couldn't control himself
in the girls' locker room. I don't know.

223
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,976
Håkan was our social worker.

224
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:39,104
- Ekdahl. His name wasn't Ekdahl.
- He was Skogsberg before the marriage.

225
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:42,864
Uhhuh. Well, it's him.

226
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:56,280
No.

227
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,900
Him here, his name is Hans Petterson.

228
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,680
When you were eight,
you ran away from home.

229
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,084
It was Hans who drove you
back to the Johanssons.

230
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,480
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

231
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:14,216
Annika didn't like that I came back.

232
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:17,784
Poor Annika.

233
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,944
- What did Emil say?
- He confirmed what we already knew.

234
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:37,872
How can you let Saga be
investigated by Internal Affairs?

235
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:41,216
- I can't interfere with their work.
- Have you tried?

236
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,856
That would be misconduct.

237
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:48,464
<i>- Green light. You can come in.</i>
- Understood.

238
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,640
Henrik.

239
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,836
Åsa Holst's ex-husband.

240
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:39,456
Yeah, he's also on a dvd
and book in the living room.

241
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,584
He definitely has a connection to Holst,
and reason not to like him.

242
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:46,680
I never bought that "it's the best thing
that ever happened to me" shit.

243
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:51,792
Let's see.

244
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:58,576
Oh, come on.

245
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:05,208
Annika Melander doesn't think
badly of Claes, in any case.

246
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,704
We have all of it.

247
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:16,272
Except Annika Melander.

248
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,696
Did Hans get worse?

249
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,344
He's braindead. It's a clinical criterion
for being declared dead.

250
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:33,155
They're going to shut off the respirator.

251
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:36,820
Tell me if there's anything I can do.

252
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,235
Yeah, we should question
Claes Sandberg again.

253
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,288
Could they have done it together?

254
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:57,124
- Sandberg and Melander?
- He shoots, and she makes the artwork.

255
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:00,220
Why do you think that?

256
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,356
Morten Anker said he was killed
by his brother.

257
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:07,296
Annika Melander has many talents,
but his brother she is not.

258
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:11,044
It was dark, so Morten Anker
isn't completely reliable.

259
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:14,712
So it didn't need to have been
his brother or a man, or what?

260
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:25,776
It's not for lack of interest that I'm
talking about the case and not about Hans.

261
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:30,936
That's what you want, right?

262
00:27:32,504 --> 00:27:34,200
Yeah.

263
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:32,040
She's crazy. She's raving mad.
She follows me. She's a stalker.

264
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,400
- Do you have a relationship?
- Absolutely not.

265
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:44,592
We checked the guest list to
Freddie Holst's opening.

266
00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:47,400
You took your stalker to the party.

267
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,744
Okay ...

268
00:28:54,652 --> 00:29:01,464
I initiated a sexual ...
One can't really call that a relationship.

269
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,552
You had sex with her.

270
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,260
- Yeah.
- With your crazy stalker.

271
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,820
My father had just died,
and I found myself a little crazy.

272
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,756
I was flattered by her attention -

273
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,824
- but we're no couple.

274
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:25,424
- Do you know where she is?
- No, no idea.

275
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:28,832
I was going to pick her up yesterday
at Central Station in the evening ...

276
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:32,120
- You were picking her up at Malmo station?
- Yeah.

277
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:36,384
The crazy woman with whom you
have no sort of relationship?

278
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:41,932
I'm afraid of her.

279
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:47,720
I do what she says.
It's simply easier.

280
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,336
Right now, anyway.

281
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:54,856
- Where had she been?
- To a funeral trade show in Göteborg.

282
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:57,604
She's a funeral entrepreneur.

283
00:29:58,104 --> 00:30:01,776
But she never came.

284
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:11,476
Annika Melander, born 1985.

285
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,264
Co-owner of Kulladahl's funeral business.

286
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:16,928
Came to the foster home as a nine-year-old.

287
00:30:17,428 --> 00:30:20,428
Was married at 18, and
divorced three years later.

288
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,028
The ex-husband was convicted
of murder in 1999.

289
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:29,112
Registered for a trade show in Göteborg,
but the organizer said never came.

290
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:32,496
Where is she then?

291
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,012
Okay. So we let Sandberg go again.

292
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:39,512
- Can't we keep him a while?
- Not according to the prosecutor.

293
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:44,812
- Sandberg and Melander are connected.
- That's not enough to keep him.

294
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:48,628
We haven't found traces of Claes
in Annika's home, either.

295
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:52,736
The technicians haven't found anything
where Emil was found, either.

296
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,736
What about Holst, then?

297
00:30:57,004 --> 00:30:59,428
The guards have gotten
a photo of Annika.

298
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:02,380
The code is finished.

299
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:09,056
And there's no clear connection
between Melander and Freddie Holst.

300
00:31:09,556 --> 00:31:12,272
Okay. I'll check if Freddie Holst
knows something.

301
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:17,792
I can call up the other foster children.
They might be in contact with her.

302
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,936
Do it, and I'll make sure to
put her on the wanted list.

303
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,824
- See you later?
- Maybe.

304
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:45,264
Is now a better time?

305
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:48,024
Yes.

306
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:54,080
I've had burglaries. There was a mess
in the waste basket in my bathroom.

307
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,484
Maybe that's how the fingernail
ended up in the car.

308
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,056
Did you report the burglary?

309
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:05,064
No, I wasn't sure if that was what
happened, but I am now.

310
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:12,168
We have traced your email that you
got about the meeting in the cemetery.

311
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:18,100
It was sent from your computer
with a timer several days earlier.

312
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:21,240
What do you think about that?

313
00:32:22,804 --> 00:32:24,752
She must have done it
when she was at my place.

314
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:29,740
Let me see if I understand this correctly.
Your mother broke in and stole fingernails -

315
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,508
- programs your computer to send an email
so you are alone when she kills herself -

316
00:32:37,008 --> 00:32:40,516
- but makes it look like she was murdered?

317
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:43,996
Yes.

318
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:48,600
The obvious question is: why?

319
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:53,788
For revenge.

320
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:55,672
For what?

321
00:32:56,172 --> 00:33:00,224
What could you have done
to drive her to this extreme?

322
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,140
Your mother has been murdered.

323
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,552
There's an investigation underway.
You're police.

324
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:14,720
I don't think this is a good time
for you to be silent, Saga.

325
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:24,488
I falsely reported my parents
for sexual abuse -

326
00:33:25,108 --> 00:33:26,608
- to save my sister.

327
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:29,840
- From what?
- From her.

328
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,292
My mom.
She had Münchausen-by-proxy.

329
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:38,380
- Has that diagnosis been confirmed?
- No.

330
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:47,000
The case is over ten years old.

331
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,812
So your crime is outdated.

332
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:53,832
What luck.

333
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,088
So you could tell us and inform
us of your mother's motive.

334
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,352
- You don't believe me.
- Your mother said you threatened her life.

335
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:10,424
Some of your colleagues
describe you as special.

336
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,784
You have talked about me
with my colleagues?

337
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:17,696
- One of them said you're unstable.
- I am not unstable.

338
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:20,352
I am different.

339
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:24,244
But Hans Pettersson understood you.

340
00:34:24,744 --> 00:34:25,712
Yes.

341
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:29,064
Tell me a little about your relationship.

342
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:35,764
He was my boss and friend.

343
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:41,064
He helped me with things that I thought
were difficult. I miss him.

344
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,688
How has this affected you,
all this with Hans?

345
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:54,056
I find myself between the first
and next stages of grieving.

346
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:56,648
Shock and denial.

347
00:34:57,648 --> 00:35:01,392
So I assume it will get worse.

348
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:26,112
- Her name is Annika Melander.
- No, that means nothing to me.

349
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:30,772
What happened with him,
the one you showed me ...Emil?

350
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:34,104
Yeah, he's been cleared.

351
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,360
Ah, there you are, Honey.

352
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,572
This is Henrik something-or-other.
He doesn't believe that you exist.

353
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:46,104
- I do. Åsa Holst.
- Henrik Sabroe, from Copenhagen Police.

354
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,892
- Do you want coffee?
- No, thanks.

355
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:53,028
- Do you recognize this person?
- Yes, she's stalking my ex-husband.

356
00:35:54,892 --> 00:35:56,472
How do you know that?

357
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,164
He told me.

358
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:03,432
- When did he say that?
- When we met.

359
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:07,296
But you don't have a personal
relationship to her?

360
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,840
No.

361
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,336
- Do you think she's the murderer?
- She's a part of the investigation.

362
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:22,780
Ah. Isn't it unusual for women
to be serial killers?

363
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,364
- Exciting.
- Yeah.

364
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:29,208
You don't seem especially
bothered by what's happening.

365
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:32,024
Nothing's happened to us directly.

366
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:37,392
We don't know any of the victims and
obviously not the suspect.

367
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:40,280
If you remember anything,
please contact me.

368
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,248
Of course.

369
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:43,440
How did you know I was here?

370
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:47,352
You weren't at your place or mine,
and you weren't at work, either.

371
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:52,608
Would you prefer to be alone?

372
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,360
No.

373
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,448
Yes, this is Åsa ... Holst.

374
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:48,384
I don't know what you're talking about.

375
00:38:50,184 --> 00:38:53,760
No, I have no comments about that.

376
00:38:57,028 --> 00:39:01,344
No, and you should stop
calling with all your shit.

377
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,776
How the fuck could they know that?

378
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,088
How the fuck did they found that out?
Åsa, what have you done?

379
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:37,380
Gustav? Henrik Sabroe.
Thanks for speaking with us.

380
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,072
Of course. Has something
happened to Annika?

381
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,552
Gustav, you were foster children at
the same time at Inger and Filip Johannson's house.

382
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:51,292
Yes, unfortunately.

383
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:55,032
But that was some time ago.

384
00:39:55,348 --> 00:39:57,336
Was it hard for Annika?

385
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,984
We lived at the Johansson's.

386
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,920
Was it harder for Annika than the others?

387
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,404
No ... say what you want about Filip -

388
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:11,620
- but he made no distinctions between us.

389
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:14,304
Can you tell us about Annika?

390
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:22,256
We stayed in touch when I moved.

391
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:25,632
Wrote letters ...

392
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:32,280
I don't know.
She saw me a little like a big brother.

393
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:34,608
Do you still write to each other?

394
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:37,856
No. We lost touch after the wedding.

395
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:41,292
- She was married at 18.
- To Torbjörn Alm, yeah.

396
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,968
How did those two meet each other?

397
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:47,620
He was in prison, and she
began to write to him.

398
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,276
- How did she get in touch with him?
- I don't know.

399
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:56,816
She was married and no longer forced
to be at Filip and Inger's.

400
00:40:57,316 --> 00:41:00,728
And you have no contact at all now?

401
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:05,284
No. I try not to think about
that part of my life.

402
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:08,976
Thanks for coming.

403
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:17,424
- Shall we check up on the ex-husband?
- Yes.

404
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:21,632
- Hi, Julia. What are you doing here?
- I'm sick, and Mom has to work.

405
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:26,592
- Your father needs to, too.
- I know. That's why I'm here.

406
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:43,896
Say it wasn't you.

407
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:48,824
Why did you do that?

408
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,376
To hurt Freddie.

409
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:57,728
You fucking pig! So you wanted to
meet me to get to Freddie.

410
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,772
No, that wasn't it, actually.

411
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:04,760
But you gave me the opportunity when
you said that you faked the pregnancy.

412
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:08,268
I can't hit him financially, after all.

413
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:10,400
So it must be personally.

414
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,996
What have you really
gotten out of this?

415
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:17,020
You've made us look a
little foolish in public.

416
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,944
Not so little.

417
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:26,528
- Was it worth it?
- Was it worth it when you paid for that child?

418
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:30,312
- You can never prove I said that.
- I don't need to.

419
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:35,452
But you must prove the opposite, or else
people will never stop talking.

420
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:40,080
Was there anything else you wanted?

421
00:42:41,648 --> 00:42:43,859
No.

422
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,188
Good, now we can begin.

423
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:58,184
First we need to know if
they have anything on you.

424
00:42:58,684 --> 00:42:59,568
No, they don't.

425
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,944
- So you haven't bought a child.
- Of course not.

426
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:02,932
We have to ask.

427
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:05,668
We have a fully legal surrogate mother.

428
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,568
The best thing would be if she were
to come forward and explain that.

429
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:10,452
She can't.

430
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:11,632
She doesn't wish to be
known publicly.

431
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:15,048
So it's not an option.
What do we do, then?

432
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:19,876
- Can we sue the newspapers?
- I would certainly recommend it.

433
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:23,232
But it will be hard to squash the
rumors with your head in the sand.

434
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:25,544
The best would clearly be if you
could persuade the surrogate ...

435
00:43:26,044 --> 00:43:28,656
That's not going to happen.
Plan B. Now.

436
00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:32,016
Do you have a plan B?

437
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,776
- What do I pay you per hour?
- We'll come up with something, Freddie.

438
00:43:35,276 --> 00:43:35,776
When?

439
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:39,360
- Tomorrow?
- Tonight. Thanks for meeting. Come.

440
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,480
- Are you writing something about it?
- I don't think so.

441
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,228
Holst is suing every other paper
that's writing about it.

442
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:53,264
Without the surrogate, we have nothing.

443
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:59,164
- Does anyone who know she is?
- No, and Holst is keeping her away.

444
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:04,304
So a photo or an idea about her
would be worth a good deal.

445
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:07,392
Are you joking?

446
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:13,848
You have a photo.
You know who she is.

447
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:17,088
I didn't say that.

448
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,836
With a picture like that you wouldn't
have to work for a while.

449
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:25,828
Would you buy it?

450
00:44:26,328 --> 00:44:29,424
Yeah. I'd buy it.

451
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:14,764
Torbjörn Alm!

452
00:45:15,264 --> 00:45:17,808
We're from the police.

453
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:29,856
Torbjörn Alm!

454
00:46:04,132 --> 00:46:07,080
Saga! He's here.

455
00:46:07,924 --> 00:46:09,744
Stop! Saga!

456
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:13,032
Stop! Stop! I will shoot!

457
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:16,800
Down! Hands on your head!

458
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,896
Hands on your head!

459
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,008
Saga, are you OK?

460
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,088
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

461
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:48,532
Holst bought a child from
an unknown surrogate mother.

462
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:56,256
I thought you might want to know,
since Holst is part of your investigation.

463
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,276
Okay.

464
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:00,704
Good. I'll tell my colleagues. Thanks.

465
00:47:02,332 --> 00:47:05,816
A photo revealing her identity
would be worth a lot of money.

466
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:09,888
I have several of those photos.

467
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:15,076
I haven't sold them, and I
don't think I'm going to, either.

468
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,808
Good, but we need to see the photos.

469
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:30,984
I'm not a bad person.

470
00:47:34,372 --> 00:47:36,552
Thanks.

471
00:47:40,472 --> 00:47:43,752
- Hey!
- Hey.

472
00:48:06,868 --> 00:48:11,736
- What's happened?
- It's all a little messy right now.

473
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:15,456
But you shouldn't be uneasy.
We'll figure it out.

474
00:48:15,868 --> 00:48:21,268
- But you need to move over here.
- How did they found out?

475
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:25,824
It's a long story. But you shouldn't
worry. We'll keep you out of it.

476
00:48:26,324 --> 00:48:29,400
They will make us into fools,
and they will think we're ridiculous.

477
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:33,720
And they will do everything to expose
us, but that's not going to happen.

478
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:39,504
And so ... so it goes.

479
00:48:39,988 --> 00:48:41,568
I'm sorry.

480
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:46,344
You shouldn't be.
You, or you two ...

481
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,976
You are the only thing that
is really good in my life right now.

482
00:49:01,324 --> 00:49:04,752
- May I?
- You don't need to ask permission.

483
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:22,992
What the fuck are you doing?

484
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,936
Jeanette ... That wasn't my intention.

485
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:30,840
Jeanette. Jeanette!

486
00:49:39,388 --> 00:49:43,296
You need to come get me now.
Just come.

487
00:50:04,232 --> 00:50:06,329
Hi.

488
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,224
Let's go to the right here.
Stand still.

489
00:50:26,044 --> 00:50:27,968
- Down on the ground, dammit!
- Weapon!

490
00:50:28,468 --> 00:50:31,344
Down on the ground, everyone!

491
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:35,664
Torbjörn Alm, throw down that weapon!

492
00:50:36,388 --> 00:50:39,004
Down on the ground! Shut up!

493
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:41,216
Drop the weapon!

494
00:50:42,216 --> 00:50:43,664
Shut up!

495
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:47,336
- You're surrounded! Drop the weapon!
- Throw down the weapon!

496
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:52,728
This is the last time I'm telling you.
Throw down the weapon now!

497
00:50:57,364 --> 00:51:00,552
Turn around! On your knees.

498
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,920
Come. Saga? Okay?

499
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,680
Hello! Call an ambulance!

500
00:52:02,404 --> 00:52:03,888
- Hej.
- Hej.

501
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:11,256
- Where should we go?
- Up to the house.

502
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:13,296
We'll stay there tonight, and
then we'll see from there.

503
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,968
I haven't really gotten it back yet.

504
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:26,832
- Where did you get that?
- From Freddie.

505
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:29,284
Why didn't you say anything?
I've been working hard to get them back.

506
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:35,424
Why do you think? You'd just gambled the
money away. We need it now.

507
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:42,744
- Do you mean we're going to keep it?
- I don't know. We'll see how it goes.

508
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:50,668
I must report this.

509
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:55,108
And I need an answer as to why
you forgot to search him.

510
00:52:57,028 --> 00:52:59,216
- I didn't.
- Do you know what I think?

511
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:03,440
Your father's death, the murder of your
mother, Internal Affairs and then Hans.

512
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,156
- It's too much.
- Not for me.

513
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:11,144
It's not just your fault.
I should have acted earlier.

514
00:53:11,644 --> 00:53:14,480
The last two weeks you've worked
over 50 hours of overtime.

515
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,008
- You must take time off.
- No, I must solve the case.

516
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:22,712
- I promised Hans.
- You have time off now. Then we'll see.

517
00:53:24,656 --> 00:53:27,076
You said that everyone
deserves another chance.

518
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:30,624
This is your other chance.

519
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:54,984
John called.

520
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:57,960
Julia is going to survive.

521
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:03,364
They've taken the bullet from her arm,
and her condition is stable.

522
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:05,476
I'll call him and apologize.

523
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:09,840
- I don't think he blames you for anything.
- He should. I made a big mistake.

524
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,460
- I didn't follow the police procedures.
- Laws are open to interpretation.

525
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,880
No, they're not.

526
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,792
What did Torbjörn Alm say?

527
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:21,552
He has nothing to do with our case.

528
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:25,828
They found a weapons cache
during the house search.

529
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,264
He's involved with a biker gang.

530
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,904
Saga. Saga, where are you going?

531
00:54:36,484 --> 00:54:40,664
It was too much for Saga last time.
She needs some time off.

532
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:43,760
- Sorry, what did you say?
- She needs some time off.

533
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,208
No, she doesn't fucking need time off.
She needs to work.

534
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,948
I will arrange a replacement.

535
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,184
Saga!

536
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,376
Jeanette? May I come in?

537
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:24,432
Colbert! Colbert, dammit!

538
00:55:27,676 --> 00:55:30,024
Away with you! Away!

539
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:55,320
Are you okay?

540
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:03,048
- Promise me that we'll never be like Holst.
- You can be sure of that.

541
00:56:03,548 --> 00:56:06,484
I mean it. We must never be like them.

542
00:56:06,984 --> 00:56:12,192
No, no. I promise. Come.

543
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:22,488
- It's our house.
- It's our house.

544
00:57:09,748 --> 00:57:11,304
Jeanette?

545
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:15,984
Freddie! Freddie!

546
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:23,112
Jesus ...

547
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:29,904
Jeanette! Jeanette!

548
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:19,934
