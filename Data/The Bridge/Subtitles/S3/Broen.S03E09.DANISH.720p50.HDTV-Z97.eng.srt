PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:18,552
- Where are we going?
- Up to the house.

3
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,668
We stay there tonight, and
then we'll see.

4
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:27,940
We have it all, except Annika Melander.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,384
Annika Melander, born 1985. Came to
the foster home as a nine-year-old.

6
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:36,128
Don't look so sad, like I'm
leaving you for them.

7
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:49,684
Your mother breaks in and programs
your computer to send an email to you

8
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,140
- so that you are alone at the
time she takes her life -

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,288
- but makes it look like
she's been murdered.

10
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:03,968
- Down on the ground!
- Drop the weapon!

11
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,920
Call an ambulance!

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,312
- I should have acted earlier.
- I must solve the case. I promised Hans.

13
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:15,776
- Now you have time off.
- You said that everyone deserves another chance.

14
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:22,272
This is your other chance.

15
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:27,888
- Jeanette!
- Freddie!

16
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,336
Jesus ...

17
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:32,325
Jeanette!

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,968
EPISODE 9

19
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:15,984
Where are you taking him?

20
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:21,528
Where are you taking him?

21
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:38,448
THE BRIDGE

22
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:13,512
Hey. How are you doing?

23
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:19,632
I'm not so good with the time off,
but your case is keeping me busy.

24
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,508
- Do you have any ideas?
- I've only just started.

25
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,712
- Thanks.
- I have nothing else to do.

26
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,248
- Where did you go earlier?
- Why do you ask?

27
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:38,192
- Because I'm a little worried about you.
- I was by the railroad crossing at Arrievägen.

28
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:43,512
- Why?
- My sister killed herself there.

29
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:49,320
- You had a sister who killed herself?
- Yes. Jennifer.

30
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:54,480
- And you went there?
- Yes.

31
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:55,920
Why?

32
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:03,192
It felt good to be there.

33
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:09,320
- Should I stay here?
- No.

34
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,768
I want you to find the one who killed Hans.

35
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:17,448
Okay.

36
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,176
Hi.

37
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,208
Henrik. This is Rasmus Larsson.
He'll be working with you until further notice.

38
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,592
Rasmus, Henrik Sabroe,
Copenhagen Police.

39
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,432
Introduce him to the case,
focusing on the primary suspect.

40
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:05,976
Rasmus Larsson ... Yeah.

41
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,600
I don't know what Saga's said
about me, but I'm damn good police.

42
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,064
- Are you?
- Mm.

43
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:21,168
I didn't think that damn good police
needed to say that they were damn good.

44
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:27,240
Here's Annika Melander.
She's our primary suspect.

45
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,080
She's in there.

46
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,696
Here.

47
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:43,568
Jeanette! Jeanette! Hello! Hello?

48
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:45,984
- Freddie!
- Jeanette, can you hear me?

49
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:46,512
Freddie!

50
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:48,820
- She's given birth.
- Stop the bleeding, dammit!

51
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:55,320
Jeanette! Hello? Hello? Jeanette.

52
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,020
What happened here?
What are you doing here?

53
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,688
That's our surrogate. She was
kidnapped, and we tracked her here.

54
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:15,192
He took the child. He took my son.

55
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:25,176
- You need to follow us.
- We'll drive behind you.

56
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:29,376
No, you should stay here and tell me
everything the technicians discover.

57
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,936
Okay.

58
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,688
Wait a sec.

59
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:48,576
Linn. Annika Melander has Freddie's child.

60
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:53,280
She kidnapped the surrogate--who
gave birth--and now the boy is gone.

61
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:58,776
- What's the mother's condition?
- Critical. She lost a lot of blood.

62
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,496
Linn, it's a little newborn boy.

63
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:12,792
- We bring in all the resources we have.
- All?

64
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,848
Yes. All.

65
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,176
Good.

66
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:25,492
- Jeanette what?
- Jeanette Nielsen.

67
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:29,616
- How did you find her?
- I put a transmitter in her phone.

68
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,308
It couldn't be detected.

69
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,480
- Did you not trust her?
- I don't trust many people.

70
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:39,072
So what are you doing now?
How are we going to find him?

71
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,484
- Was that how you found her? The tracker?
- Yeah. No, not right away.

72
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:49,416
- They have a house together in Sweden.
- Who are 'they'?

73
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,236
Her and her boyfriend, Marc.
But he was dead, and she was gone ...

74
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:57,120
- Stop. What? He was dead?
- Shot.

75
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,696
Who's Marc? Marc what?

76
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,800
- Skouv.
- Marc Skouv.

77
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:08,428
- Did you call the police?
- We needed to find Jeanette.

78
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,824
Oh, come on, man.

79
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,048
Here. Give me the address to the house.
Come on.

80
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:24,676
Annika Melander.
Have you thought of anything?

81
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:26,664
No.

82
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,592
You know that I know
what you're going through, eh?

83
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:42,744
And we will do everything we can
to find your son for you.

84
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:51,912
He's coming now.

85
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:57,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

86
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:01,824
- It's good to see you again.
- Yeah.

87
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:06,336
- We can go now.
- Wait. Just a minute.

88
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,376
I think it's Claes who has our baby.

89
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,336
Claes Sandberg?

90
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:25,684
- He said he wanted to destroy Freddie.
- When did he say that?

91
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:30,152
When they met some days ago. And
when he revealed that I wasn't pregnant.

92
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:35,332
- How did he find out about that?
- I told him.

93
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:39,608
I thought that he ...

94
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:43,088
What I mean is, Claes can be
very manipulative and -

95
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:48,820
- all that with the surrogate was so hard
on us. I needed someone to talk to.

96
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,592
- And so you chose your ex-husband.
- I didn't know that he hated us.

97
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,056
Did he say that?

98
00:11:55,332 --> 00:12:00,288
He said that he wanted to hurt
us as much as he could.

99
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,968
Did we let Sandberg go too soon?

100
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,076
He has no connection to the victims, and
he has alibis for several of the murders.

101
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,488
Yeah, but he'd like to hurt Holst.

102
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:30,336
She was obsessed with Sandberg, and he
wasn't exactly sweet on Holst.

103
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:34,200
If Claes Sandberg is as manipulative as
Åsa Holst said, he could have gotten -

104
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,376
- Annika Melander to help with the murders
and have them point to Freddie Holst's art.

105
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:45,192
- Especially if she was obsessed with him.
- Art that was once his own.

106
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:55,080
Two killers. He shoots.
She makes the art installations.

107
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:03,552
Okay. Claes Sandberg must
be questioned again.

108
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,984
Understood. We'll wait.

109
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:20,400
- Have you ever wanted children?
- Why do you ask?

110
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:21,744
Just asking.

111
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:24,984
There are many things I don't have.
Why are you asking about children?

112
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,204
I just thought of it.
You don't have to answer.

113
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:31,524
I'm not interested in childbirth,
it would interfere with my work too much -

114
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,440
- and I doubt that I could handle it.

115
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,764
What couldn't you handle?

116
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:38,984
That kind of interaction with other
people isn't my strong side.

117
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:42,168
Yeah, it's clear.

118
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:53,304
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

119
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:58,732
Yes, we're here now.
Claes Sandberg isn't here.

120
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,072
Saga?

121
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,656
Yeah. Now we know.

122
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:14,596
Jeanette Nielsen woke up. The police found
the boyfriend with three shots in the chest.

123
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:21,312
Why didn't they find that
when they searched the house?

124
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:24,408
Maybe it wasn't there.

125
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:27,792
The caliber fits.

126
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,192
We put out an APB on Claes Sandberg.

127
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:37,280
Have you seen this person?

128
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,800
I heard shots, but no one
is telling me anything.

129
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:44,188
Do you recognize him?

130
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,096
I don't know.

131
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,968
- Look at the photo.
- What happened to Marc?

132
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:57,156
- What about her?
- I can't remember anything.

133
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:01,204
- Someone delivered the baby. Tell me ...
- What happened to Marc?

134
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:03,204
He's dead.

135
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:19,800
- What about the baby?
- We don't know.

136
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:22,224
We don't know yet.

137
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:31,256
Yeah. We're both very sorry for
what you've been subjected to.

138
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:35,280
Yes, we are.

139
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,624
What the hell ...

140
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,400
Åsa.

141
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,608
What happened?

142
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:27,824
You're not thinking of meeting him?

143
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:32,356
Love, he's killed everyone.
He'll kill you, too. He's crazy.

144
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:35,096
- He has our son.
- You can't go. You have to call the police.

145
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,272
Then he'll kill him.

146
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:43,176
- No! You can't go. You can't go there.
- Move.

147
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,940
- Hey.
- Hi.

148
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,120
What are you doing here?

149
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,680
I jumped in for you.
I'm part of the investigation now.

150
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,920
- Until we find the child.
- You replaced me?

151
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,676
Yeah.

152
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:12,992
Come. The investigation of the
basement is finished.

153
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:20,096
This was found in the room where
Holst found Jeanette.

154
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,176
Seven rooms are furnished.
You can surely recognize them.

155
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:29,928
One murder for each room.

156
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:47,360
There was also blood found in the
basement. It will be analyzed, of course -

157
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,520
- but it was in various places, so it's
probably from different people.

158
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:01,056
This one is new.

159
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:06,272
The next murder. Freddie and the child.

160
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:11,736
- Who is the third, then?
- Åsa Holst, maybe.

161
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:16,992
Or someone completely
different who's already dead.

162
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:19,896
We just haven't found them yet.

163
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:22,848
Henrik Sabroe.

164
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:26,856
- Anything else?
- My report.

165
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,960
What? Where are they going to meet?

166
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:35,400
Okay. Thanks.

167
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,072
Hello? I'm here!

168
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,712
POLICE. STUPID.

169
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:33,952
No! No!

170
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:38,520
No!

171
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:46,080
Get away!

172
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,736
- My son!
- It's empty.

173
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:54,336
- My son!
- It's empty! The stroller is empty!

174
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:56,376
It's empty!

175
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:03,976
He saw that we came.

176
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,980
- He wrote that I should come alone.
- Yeah, but it was stupid to do that.

177
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,208
- Otherwise he would have killed my son.
- This was in the tower up there.

178
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:38,328
So the stroller caught fire when we came.
Freddie would only have gotten closer.

179
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,312
Why? So he could shoot me?

180
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:44,296
No, you wouldn't have died.
He would have abducted you.

181
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,164
Where? Why?

182
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:51,652
Because it seems like he thought of
another way to kill you. At another place.

183
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:54,360
What? I ...

184
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,096
How would I die?

185
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,912
He's going to try again.
Now we'll take over surveillance.

186
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:08,116
And my son? If he gets a hold of me,
will he let my son go?

187
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:11,384
- Probably not.
- But it's possible?

188
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:16,612
Experience shows that in these situations
the killer would probably kill you both.

189
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:25,752
Yeah. She says things
directly, but she's right.

190
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:30,364
We'll drive you home. Stay there
and call us if he contacts you again.

191
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,040
Freddie. This is the best chance
you have to save your son.

192
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:47,108
What happened there?

193
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:51,076
The killer used the child to get closer
to Freddie Holst.

194
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,052
We need to increase surveillance.
Can you bring it up with Lillian?

195
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:59,112
I want one of us over there.
Can you go assist the Danish police?

196
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,380
Claes Sandberg's agent doesn't
know where he is.

197
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,408
He canceled a talk with
one day's notice.

198
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:09,368
- Did he say why? Claes.
- Personal reasons.

199
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:15,172
- Anything new with Annika Melander?
- I have no idea where any of them are.

200
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:25,112
- Hi, John. Welcome back.
- Thanks.

201
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,496
- How is it going with Julia?
- Much better.

202
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:32,980
She needs to stay another couple of days
at the hospital before she comes home.

203
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:36,920
I can't find any connection between
Claes Sandberg and Morten Anker.

204
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,460
Ah. Did we think there was one?

205
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,720
No, I thought there might be
a reason why he called him his brother.

206
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,988
We think the reason was that it
was dark, and Morten was a little ...

207
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,724
I'm sorry about what happened
to your daughter.

208
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:53,888
- It wasn't your fault.
- It was. It was a serious error.

209
00:23:57,388 --> 00:24:02,452
- She's okay, Saga. That's what's important.
- Good. Here you go. For Julia.

210
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:10,616
'Crisis Counseling for Handling Disasters.
To Strengthen Human Resilience.'

211
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,888
Thanks, but this might be a little heavy.

212
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:18,000
She's still struggling with My Little Pony.

213
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:23,408
- You can read it aloud to her.
- Yeah, maybe I can. Thanks.

214
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:26,304
You're welcome.

215
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:30,768
We think that it was Annika Melander and
Claes Sandberg who took Freddie's child.

216
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,900
To hurt Freddie.

217
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:35,816
But why the child? She could
have sent a photo of Jeanette -

218
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:39,536
- but she waited until the child
was born to make contact.

219
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:43,632
Kidnapping of children is usually
about inheritance or envy.

220
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:47,020
Inheritance? What do we know
about their parents?

221
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,468
- Both of Sandberg's parents are dead.
- The father died recently in hospice here in Malmo.

222
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:56,928
What do we know about
Annika Melander's father?

223
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:03,316
Bror Holmberg. But he gave up
custody when she was five.

224
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:07,920
- Why?
- It wasn't in there. But he gave up custody.

225
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:12,408
- Find his number.
- Okay.

226
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:36,072
- You called the police.
- Yeah.

227
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,272
It could have cost our son's life.

228
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,940
But otherwise you might have died.
That's what the police said.

229
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,432
You can't be angry with me
for not wanting to lose you.

230
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:51,384
Why do you show so little
interest in our son?

231
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:57,484
I care. I yearn. I truly hope nothing's
happened to him and that he comes home to us -

232
00:25:57,984 --> 00:26:00,584
- but if I have to choose
between him or you -

233
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:05,116
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

234
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,152
Come.

235
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:38,576
What if we hadn't set all this in motion.

236
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:42,432
It wouldn't have made any difference.

237
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:48,072
The threat has nothing to do with our son.

238
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:50,856
Someone wants to hurt us.

239
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:04,376
- Annika wasn't my daughter.
- How did you find that out?

240
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:11,516
Renate, her mother, told me
during a doctor's visit ...

241
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:18,264
... where it became clear that
Annika couldn't be mine.

242
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:21,288
Did she say who her biological father was?

243
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:22,896
- No.
- Never?

244
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:25,056
No.

245
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:33,168
- And when Renate died?
- We had been divorced for three years.

246
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:38,072
- But Annika didn't end up with you.
- I had a new family.

247
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:40,712
My own children.

248
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:45,432
I saw no reason to take
a girl who wasn't mine.

249
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,608
Would she have wanted
you to take care of her?

250
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:56,216
- Do you need to know that?
- Yes.

251
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:02,384
We think that Annika is taking revenge
on people whom she thinks failed her.

252
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:05,280
So would she have wanted
you to take care of her?

253
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,992
Yes.

254
00:28:11,764 --> 00:28:13,728
But ...

255
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:17,928
I said no.

256
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:22,544
Bror Holmberg and his family should
have personal protection.

257
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:27,144
It could be Holmberg who's hanging
in the doll house with Freddie Holst.

258
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:30,584
We must ask Holst if he
can remember Renate Melander.

259
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,280
- Why would he remember her?
- He could've had sex with her.

260
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,032
Yeah, but this was in the 80s.

261
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,048
You don't remember everyone
you've had sex with?

262
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:40,372
I don't remember.

263
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:42,680
- Do you?
- Yes.

264
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,932
Are you wondering if you were the best?

265
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:49,368
- The best what?
- That I've had sex with.

266
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:50,408
No.

267
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:54,944
Men usually like to confirm that they
are the best sex partner a woman had.

268
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:57,768
That's not anything I think about.

269
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,992
- But if I had thought about it?
- You're not the best.

270
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,672
- So who is that?
- Her name is Renate Melander. Annika Melander's mother.

271
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,768
- Do you recognize her?
- No.

272
00:29:15,268 --> 00:29:17,476
- Did you sleep with her in 1984?
- What?

273
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:22,064
- Did you have sex with her in 1984?
- I was only 17 years old.

274
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:25,376
One can be sexually active as a
17-year-old. I was at 15.

275
00:29:26,092 --> 00:29:30,096
I can't remember who I was
in bed with 30 years ago.

276
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:33,120
We're considering the possibility
that you are Annika Melander's father.

277
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,232
I'm not her father.

278
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:37,544
Did you have sex with
Renate Melander in 1984 or not?

279
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:41,496
You're asking a bunch of idiotic
questions instead of finding my son.

280
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:45,652
Do you have a piece of art with
the title 'Father', 'Son', or anything like that?

281
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,752
- No!
- Anything with a couple being hanged?

282
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,600
- Is that how he wants to kill me?
- Just answer the question.

283
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,376
Is there anything in your art
that could tell us where they are?

284
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,648
No.

285
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,188
- Yeah, this is Claes.
- Det er Suss. Why weren't you answering?

286
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,756
I've been a little bit busy.

287
00:30:44,116 --> 00:30:47,360
Claes, the police have been
looking for you all day.

288
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:52,080
Hello? Claes?

289
00:30:52,664 --> 00:30:56,336
- Hello?
- Suss, I can't hear you.

290
00:30:56,836 --> 00:30:59,144
The police have been looking
for you all day.

291
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:05,380
Suss, if you can hear me,
I'll call you back later. Bye.

292
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:20,476
Claes Sandberg's agent called.

293
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:24,656
She spoke to Claes, but he hung up when
she said the police were looking for him.

294
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:29,332
Oh, fuck. If he hadn't already gone
to ground, he'll certainly do that now.

295
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:35,336
Sorry. I know you're busy, but may
I borrow Saga for a couple minutes?

296
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:39,444
- Not really.
- I won't take long.

297
00:31:54,796 --> 00:32:00,312
My investigation is complete. I'll
deliver the material to the prosecutor.

298
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,560
I'll ask you to read through your
testimony and sign.

299
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,888
I heard there were shots on your floor.

300
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:37,896
It's not me you'll talk to about that.
A colleague is coming to look at it.

301
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:48,032
You can take that with you.

302
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:33,720
- Wait here.
- Yeah.

303
00:33:46,564 --> 00:33:50,064
Are you sleeping? It's me.

304
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:57,754
- Have you found him?
- No.

305
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:06,864
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

306
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:12,648
Marc is dead and my baby is gone,
and it's my fault for running away.

307
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,368
No, you mustn't think like that.

308
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,152
Nothing happens because of a single thing.

309
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,672
Do you have anyone who can take
care of you when you come out of here?

310
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:38,952
I can stay at my mother's a while.

311
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:43,200
You're welcome to stay at our place
for as long as you want.

312
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:47,088
You should see him.

313
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:54,336
Here he is. Jan Frederik Holst.

314
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,640
- Jan?
- Yeah.

315
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:12,016
You don't like it?

316
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:17,688
Sure. He could be a Jan.

317
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:26,624
Why did you turn on the tv?

318
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:38,160
I did it because my girls are back again.

319
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:46,968
- And Alice?
- No. Only the girls.

320
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:52,876
I think it's all this with Holst and his child -

321
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:57,768
- that's raking up all sorts of
old shit inside me.

322
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,912
That's the way it is.

323
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:05,304
- Can I do anything?
- What would you like to do?

324
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:52,056
Saga, come on. Wake up.

325
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:57,216
Come on. Wake up. They got Claes
Sandberg last night. He's in Malmo.

326
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,328
Come on. We need to go.

327
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:24,272
- Hi, good morning.
- Good morning.

328
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:27,024
Have you found her?

329
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:30,624
- Who?
- Annika.

330
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:36,552
- What did she say, exactly?
- What do you think she said?

331
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,684
So you haven't found her, then.

332
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:46,496
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

333
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:50,040
Why am I here again?

334
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:52,888
Why do you have a gun?

335
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:59,048
After I was here, I purchased it.

336
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:04,832
You said that she's a murderer,
and she is totally obsessed with me.

337
00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:08,072
- Where exactly have you been?
- In Växjö.

338
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:11,096
- Why?
- I had to bury my father.

339
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:14,688
- Alone?
- Yes.

340
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:23,476
All that that happened with Freddie Holst.
He sold your business.

341
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:26,356
He stole your art and married your wife.

342
00:39:26,856 --> 00:39:29,400
You told us that it was the best thing
that could have happened to you.

343
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:31,336
But that wasn't completely true, was it?

344
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,088
- I had to put my life back together.
- So you could destroy his empire and hurt him as much as possible.

345
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:39,488
- Who said that?
- Isn't that correct?

346
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:45,576
I wanted to destroy things for Freddie,
but I would never hurt him physically.

347
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:50,416
It was me who revealed -

348
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:54,728
- that they used a surrogate mother, and
that Åsa wasn't pregnant. But that's all.

349
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:58,592
- Where is Annika?
- I don't know. I don't know.

350
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:03,488
She went to Göteborg, and she didn't
come back. I don't know where Annika is.

351
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,696
- Can I go now?
- What do you think?

352
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:16,420
Claes has an alibi for the murder of
Marc Skouv and for Jeanette's abduction.

353
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,956
Fuck, man.

354
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:20,888
I've ruled out texts and the like from his
phone. Nothing to Annika Melander.

355
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,284
He could have an extra phone.

356
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:26,812
I checked the master lists in the area.
He had no contact with Annika Melander from them.

357
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,960
So we think Claes Sandberg
may not have been involved?

358
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,500
- Are we letting him go?
- Not yet.

359
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:34,656
- But Annika Melander ...
- She could be Holst's daughter.

360
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:36,340
That would explain everything with Holst.

361
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,660
We've talked to him and his wife. None of
them know anything about anyone in the investigation.

362
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:45,432
Ask everyone. Think big.
We must find her and the child.

363
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:18,024
Him there.

364
00:41:19,684 --> 00:41:21,888
He was here a few months ago.

365
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,488
He seemed confused, almost
under the influence -

366
00:41:29,164 --> 00:41:30,888
- so I sent him away.

367
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,576
- Yeah?
- Yeah ...

368
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:40,512
- Is that you?
- Who are you looking for?

369
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:45,936
I need to see my father.
Or not my father, but the real one.

370
00:41:46,276 --> 00:41:48,648
We should have both been here.

371
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:51,960
You need to leave the grounds.

372
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,992
I thought he was someone else.

373
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:00,288
I'm not the only one.

374
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:09,384
Is he in there? My father?

375
00:42:09,884 --> 00:42:13,128
No, he's not. You need to get
away from here now.

376
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:19,104
- He stayed a little, and then he left.
- Who is that?

377
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:23,836
Morten Anker.
"We should have both been here," he said.

378
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,912
Another, who? His brother?

379
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:45,056
- Do you remember us?
- Yeah, you stopped my wife's funeral. What do you want?

380
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,768
- We want to talk to you about Morten.
- I have to pick up Elias, so hurry up.

381
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:55,156
That night Morten was at your house,
did he talk about his father?

382
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,796
- Yes.
- What did he say?

383
00:42:58,296 --> 00:43:01,324
He asked if Villy knew that
Helle was dead.

384
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:03,440
He was talking like Villy was still alive.

385
00:43:04,204 --> 00:43:06,800
- He was confused.
- Did he say 'Villy' or 'father'?

386
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,200
I think he said 'father'.

387
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,192
How long did Villy and Helle
try to have children before Morten?

388
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,880
I don't know how long. A few years.

389
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,760
But when she first started the
insemination clinic, she was pregnant.

390
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:25,056
- What do you mean?
- That Morten maybe wasn't Villy's.

391
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:29,568
He was. Helle kept no secrets from me.

392
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:33,128
Only four percent of people are 100%
honest with their partners.

393
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:38,496
- Was that all?
- That was good. Thanks.

394
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:56,480
- Good day.
- Jørgen Drachmann, clinic manager.

395
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,364
- Henrik Sabroe.
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

396
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:05,760
So this concerns an insemination that
may have been done here. In the 80s.

397
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:06,744
Yeah.

398
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,488
It's a bit of a tricky situation. We can't open
our register to just anyone. Not even the police.

399
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:13,992
- It's a murder investigation.
- I know that, and we would like to help.

400
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:17,904
But we work with sensitive information,
and we cannot risk a summons.

401
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,244
- What if we have a warrant?
- That's another story.

402
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,244
So we'll do that. We'll be back.

403
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,800
Yeah. That's super. That's good. Bye.

404
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:33,672
Good. Lillian's getting us a warrant.
What should we do while we wait?

405
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,256
- We go to the place Jeanette was found.
- Rasmus already examined it.

406
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:43,176
- Uhhuh.
- Yeah, okay. We'll go there.

407
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,976
What do we have here?

408
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,200
Lars-Ove Abrahamsson
probably died here.

409
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:45,320
He was buckled. The loop was pulled
over the genitalia and tightened by a winch.

410
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,352
Thanks, I understood that.

411
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:00,648
But Annika Melander ... There's nothing
here that tells us where she is.

412
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:03,256
No.

413
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:09,684
According to John, the business area
has been closed since 2007.

414
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,816
Okay.

415
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,064
Saga.

416
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:31,080
Tire tracks.

417
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:35,048
Goodyear Vector 4, 195/65 R15.

418
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:38,000
- Worn out on the inside there.
- How can you see that?

419
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:40,588
I can't. I'm just kidding.

420
00:46:41,476 --> 00:46:46,924
But one thing is certain. Something came
from there or was driven to there.

421
00:46:47,424 --> 00:46:48,924
Shall we take a look?

422
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:20,024
- That looks new.
- The padlock?

423
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:22,704
Yes.

424
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,200
Looks like drag marks.

425
00:48:23,172 --> 00:48:25,992
It's Annika Melander!

426
00:48:26,648 --> 00:48:29,040
Is she alive?

427
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:33,144
Yes. Annika!

428
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:36,512
Annika! Annika Melander,
do you hear me?

429
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:41,328
John, it's Henrik. We need an ambulance.
We're where Jeanette Nielsen was found.

430
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,144
- Exactly.
- Annika!

431
00:48:44,644 --> 00:48:47,256
Annika!

432
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,032
- Do you hear me?
- Saga ...

433
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:59,232
Look at this room.

434
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,968
- The basement at the Johanssons'.
- Yeah.

435
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:21,528
What do you think?

436
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:26,024
Claes Sandberg was the last to see her.
Maybe he didn't need her anymore.

437
00:49:26,524 --> 00:49:30,772
- Sandberg hasn't been to the foster home.
- That we know of.

438
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:38,136
We need to contact all the foster children
and find out what they know about that room.

439
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:40,896
I'll start with Emil Larsson.

440
00:49:44,288 --> 00:49:46,540
- This is Emil.
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

441
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,144
There was a room in the basement of
your foster parents' home. Did anyone live there?

442
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:52,616
What?

443
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:56,936
A room in the basement with a bed
and a bucket. Who lived there?

444
00:49:57,436 --> 00:50:02,340
No idea. We weren't allowed down there.
It was forbidden. Filip forbid us.

445
00:50:03,512 --> 00:50:07,256
Do you know who Claes Sandberg is?
You've never heard that name?

446
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:10,784
- He was never at your house?
- Not as far as I know.

447
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,584
Thanks.

448
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:17,336
I don't know anything about the room in
the basement. We couldn't go there.

449
00:50:17,836 --> 00:50:20,072
- Never?
- When I was there, the basement was locked.

450
00:50:20,572 --> 00:50:24,176
- Did Annika Melander talk about her dad?
- Yeah.

451
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:28,928
- What did she say?
- She didn't like him. She felt betrayed.

452
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:31,032
Did she say why?

453
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,048
When her father died, her Dad
wouldn't take care of her.

454
00:50:35,548 --> 00:50:40,228
Bror Holmberg? He wasn't her real dad.
Did she talk about her biological dad?

455
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:45,792
- Was he not her dad?
- No, I said that. Did she talk about anyone else?

456
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:50,096
- No. Never.
- This is Henrik. Yeah.

457
00:50:50,596 --> 00:50:54,704
- What were you doing the night before last?
- I was working.

458
00:50:55,324 --> 00:50:57,416
- Can anyone confirm that?
- Yes, my colleagues.

459
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,568
What are their names?
We want to talk to them.

460
00:51:00,068 --> 00:51:01,568
Saga.

461
00:51:03,028 --> 00:51:07,728
That was John. We've contacted all five
of the foster children. They don't know anything about the room.

462
00:51:44,212 --> 00:51:45,712
LAST CHANCE.

463
00:51:54,436 --> 00:51:58,176
Can you get there? 10-15 minutes, maybe.

464
00:51:59,044 --> 00:52:01,512
Good. Don't turn it off.

465
00:52:02,216 --> 00:52:06,176
- It must be quick.
- Sorry, where are you going? Hello?

466
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:08,176
Freddie? Fr -

467
00:52:12,872 --> 00:52:15,408
We stay on him.

468
00:52:51,828 --> 00:52:55,568
Wait! Freddie! I just want to talk to you.

469
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:02,712
Find out where it's going.

470
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:22,588
It's Linn.

471
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:26,552
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- Holst slipped away from the guards.

472
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:29,504
- Oh, for fuck's sake, man.
- How could he do that?

473
00:53:30,004 --> 00:53:32,528
- He took a helicopter.
- Why didn't they stop him?

474
00:53:33,028 --> 00:53:35,976
They had no reason to.
He's not a suspect.

475
00:53:36,476 --> 00:53:39,824
If the transponder is on, Kastrup
should be able to track it.

476
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:45,896
- John has just made contact with them.
- The transponder is on.

477
00:53:46,396 --> 00:53:48,752
Good. Do the Danes have a helicopter nearby?

478
00:53:49,252 --> 00:53:51,704
We don't have one.
We usually use yours, from Göteborg.

479
00:53:52,204 --> 00:53:56,112
It's on the way there. Rasmus is following
as best as he can. He's in contact with John.

480
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,488
Just drive. I'll take care of this.

481
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:07,228
- Rasmus, where are you now?
- Strandlodsvej.

482
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:11,836
Good. Head to the left, going north.

483
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:22,616
- Where is the helicopter now?
- It's going southeast towards an industrial area.

484
00:54:23,116 --> 00:54:26,136
Wait.

485
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:32,236
- John, where should I go?
- I don't know. Kastrup's not seeing anything.

486
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,624
They must have landed. I don't
know where exactly. Where are you?

487
00:54:36,124 --> 00:54:40,084
In an industrial area. Yderlandsvej.

488
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:44,616
Good. Continue north. Reinforcements
are on the way. They should be there soon.

489
00:55:05,212 --> 00:55:07,104
Hello!

490
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:15,024
I'm here now!

491
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:19,584
I came alone, just like you said!

492
00:55:32,548 --> 00:55:35,256
Yeah. It seems to be in order.

493
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:38,952
Well.

494
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,588
- So what do you want to know?
- We might have a name of a donor.

495
00:55:44,088 --> 00:55:46,824
This piece of junk. Everything is archived
in the mothers' names.

496
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:50,928
Good. Renate Melander.

497
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:02,616
Hello! Show yourself, dammit!

498
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:12,528
No, there's no match for her.

499
00:56:15,364 --> 00:56:18,264
- There's really no match?
- No.

500
00:56:19,372 --> 00:56:25,152
Okay. If we don't know the mother,
how can we find what we're looking for?

501
00:56:25,324 --> 00:56:28,968
You can't, unfortunately.
Unless you have a code, of course.

502
00:56:29,468 --> 00:56:30,196
A code?

503
00:56:30,696 --> 00:56:34,344
All the mothers get a personal code
connected to their file. But it's possible ...

504
00:56:34,844 --> 00:56:37,944
L369G42.

505
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,328
Hello!

506
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:53,496
What do you want to know?

507
00:56:55,948 --> 00:56:57,672
I need to know everything.

508
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:02,832
Donor was a Freddie Holst.

509
00:57:03,316 --> 00:57:06,768
There's a confirmed fertilization and pregnancy.

510
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:10,656
- And the mother?
- The mother ...

511
00:57:12,268 --> 00:57:16,488
An Anna Maria Larsson.

512
00:57:47,476 --> 00:57:51,072
Hi, Dad.
