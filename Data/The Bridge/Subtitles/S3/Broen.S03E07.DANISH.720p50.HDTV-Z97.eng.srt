PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:09,320
The point is, the work is
called 'The Perfect Family'.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,608
There's also another piece
called 'The Nightmare'.

4
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:16,276
- Do the pieces have anything in common?
- They belong to Freddie Holst.

5
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:19,396
I invest in unprofitable companies
and make them profitable.

6
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:23,432
No one will give me work.
You can buy my photos.

7
00:00:23,932 --> 00:00:27,384
Do you want a job?

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,040
Mail me at
L369G42@russmail.com

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,072
If there's a number or character
for every victim, we have three left now.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,448
That's Håkan. He was here yesterday.
There was a car in the driveway over there.

11
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,896
- What kind of car was it?
- A yellow car.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,272
Your dad had blue marks on the sides of his
nose. Damage that can occur from strangling.

13
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:54,216
I don't know what you're talking about.

14
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:57,216
We own a house. It's ours.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,704
- Are you in?
- Three thousand and this here.

16
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,472
- It's about the threats, I suppose.
- Which threats?

17
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:13,008
Saga was at my place last night,
and it was extremely unpleasant.

18
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,112
- I have bad news.
- Did something happen with Hans?

19
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:24,480
No. Your mother was found dead.

20
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,336
EPISODE 7

21
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,616
THE BRIDGE

22
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:01,008
Do you have a pair of
underwear I can borrow?

23
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,008
- I have my period.
- Okay. You don't want a pair of panties?

24
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:11,712
- You mean Alice's?
- They're in the bedroom, in the
other dresser drawer.

25
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:14,616
Then I'll borrow a pair.

26
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,112
I don't need to get them back.

27
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:23,616
That's okay with you, isn't it?

28
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:26,640
Alice?

29
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:57,744
You, breakfast is ready.
It's finished.

30
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:02,160
Linn called. They've found
more bodies in Sweden.

31
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,104
Who found them?

32
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:53,716
An anonymous tip was called in. When the
police came, the cellar door was broken.

33
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:57,096
- A break-in, then?
- It looks like it.

34
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:02,232
- Do we know who the victims are?
- Likely the owners, but that's unconfirmed.

35
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:07,828
Hi.

36
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:11,428
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- I'll be right there.

37
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:16,564
These are the house's owners,
Filip and Inger Johansson.

38
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:19,520
- Were any body parts missing?
- Not as far as we know.

39
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,192
But we found these.

40
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:29,784
- Håkan Ekdahl's.
- Mmhmm. Merry Christmas.

41
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,180
- How long have they been sitting like this?
- At least a day.

42
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,988
The batteries are dead, and
they last at least 24 hours.

43
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:48,084
- Do they have brand marks in their mouths?
- Let's see.

44
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:52,900
It's important that they be sent
quickly to Forensics in Lund.

45
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,096
We usually do that.

46
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:13,944
What the hell ...

47
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:24,052
What can a disembodied brain symbolize?

48
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,056
Braindead. An idiot. Mastermind.

49
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:33,508
- The brain behind something.
- What about the apple in the mouth?

50
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:36,748
Do pigs also have that
for Christmas in Denmark?

51
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,048
Yeah. Maybe he was a pig.

52
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:42,144
In any case, this points to Holst.

53
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:47,544
On the list Emil gave us,
there was 'Canceling Christmas'.

54
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:17,928
- Was someone living down here?
- Maybe.

55
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:36,888
If they also have symbols in their mouths,
there's only one symbol left in the code.

56
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,692
It could suggest that there's
only one victim left.

57
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:43,584
I'm thinking Freddie Holst.

58
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:47,976
Why point to Holst
if he's the next victim?

59
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,376
I don't know.
To scare him, maybe.

60
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,332
I didn't see Alice and
the girls this morning.

61
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,364
- Should you have?
- I usually do.

62
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:04,780
You decide when you want to see them,
so you probably didn't want to see them.

63
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:11,208
Yeah, maybe. But I missed them.

64
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,008
Well?

65
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:27,936
- We need an advance.
- Who is 'we'?

66
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:31,396
- Jeanette and I.
- What would Jeanette need money for?

67
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:37,008
- Okay. I need an advance.
- You got 28,000 yesterday.

68
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,456
You've gambled it away.

69
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,608
- We have an old house in Skåne.
- Yeah. Jeanette told me about it.

70
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:49,272
That's why I need an advance.

71
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:56,428
You've gambled the house away.
To whom?

72
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,208
- It doesn't matter.
- To whom?

73
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,144
His name is Simon Mortensen.

74
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:13,704
We have an agreement. You get the
money when I get the child.

75
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:17,112
It's not ...

76
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,248
... legal to buy a child.

77
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:25,296
To sell a baby is certainly not legal.

78
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,336
We're not selling the child.

79
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,712
- Jeanette is a surrogate mother.
- A surrogate mother only gets her expenses paid.

80
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:36,336
But perhaps you'd rather have
that than half a million?

81
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,376
No. Fine.

82
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,344
I thought so.

83
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:49,152
Colbert will drive you back.
Hopefully for the last time.

84
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:51,144
Come on.

85
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,952
Come on.

86
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:18,244
Before the show, we talked a lot
about involving the relatives.

87
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:25,200
And there were new casket models,
new color combinations ...

88
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:30,744
It will be fun. Don't look so sad,
like I'm leaving you for them.

89
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,896
Pick me up tonight?

90
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:39,632
The train from Göteborg
arrives at half past nine.

91
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,332
Good. Then maybe we can stop
by my place on the way home.

92
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:47,428
So I can pack a few things.

93
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:53,308
- What things?
- Underwear, some clothes, toothbrush.

94
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:57,436
It will be easier, now that I'm
staying with you sometimes.

95
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:00,960
Chin up.

96
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:05,124
- Happiness is a choice, no?
- Go now, so you don't miss the train.

97
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,112
See you tonight.

98
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,096
Do you have time to meet today?

99
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:35,184
Hi, Claes! Of course.
When and where?

100
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:38,040
You don't know me. You don't know
what's best for me.

101
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,736
I don't need to know you
to know that you should leave Marc.

102
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,704
Me and Marc, we love each other.

103
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:49,392
Sometimes we love the wrong people.

104
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:55,156
Yeah, you know all about that.
Do you think I can't hear you?

105
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:58,104
That we fight?
That doesn't mean anything.

106
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:00,936
We're good for each other.
It's different than you and Marc.

107
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:04,296
What's it to you, when
I'll soon be leaving?

108
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:10,152
- I think about you.
- Yeah, of course you do now.

109
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,048
No, not just now.

110
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:17,064
I'm going to be a father, thanks to you.

111
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,680
That is the biggest favor I can get.

112
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,208
It's not a favor. It's business.

113
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,128
It doesn't matter.

114
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:28,728
I want you to have it good
when you've left us.

115
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:31,032
And Marc.

116
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:32,952
Jeanette ...

117
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,536
You will always come in second place,
and you are worth more than that.

118
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:43,848
I haven't thought of leaving Marc.
I'm not coming in second place.

119
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,968
- Your house in Skåne.
- What about it?

120
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:48,768
He gambled it away yesterday.

121
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,600
Second place, Jeanette.
The sooner you realize it, the better.

122
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,792
Hi.

123
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:26,016
- It's been a while.
- Do you have time?

124
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:28,296
What does it look like?

125
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:33,576
- I could use an appraisal.
- Okay.

126
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:42,360
This.

127
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:55,464
- It's a knock-off.
- No, I don't think so.

128
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:58,944
- He wouldn't have a knock-off.
- You can get 1500.

129
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:02,520
- It's worth ten times that.
- So sell it elsewhere for ten times that.

130
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:08,184
No, okay, fine. Then give me 15.

131
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:15,264
Five, ten ... one, two,
three, four, five. 15.

132
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,400
Just a minute!

133
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:23,760
Thanks for the deal.

134
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:32,592
'Canceling Christmas'?
Have you seen it?

135
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:38,952
It's in the museum. Video art.
Edwina Collin, American painter.

136
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,564
Imagine a traditional Christmas -

137
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:44,592
- meets a hand grenade in slow motion.

138
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:51,552
- Do you like Christmas?
- No, not especially.

139
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,200
It's a holiday for children.
Do you have children?

140
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,808
No.

141
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:01,848
Are they officially declared dead?

142
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:09,576
- Have you checked up on me?
- Yes.

143
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:12,600
Don't do that.

144
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:17,832
You shouldn't take it personally. The
right information is the key to the future.

145
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:28,896
We have three new killings, two new
pieces. Why does all this point to you?

146
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:31,224
You think it does. Not me.

147
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,612
- We believe there's one victim left.
- And you think it's me.

148
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:38,400
In any case, we'd like to offer
you and your wife personal protection.

149
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,352
Thanks, but no thanks. I have cameras,
alarms, and my own security guards.

150
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:46,680
So if there's nothing more ...

151
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:50,520
Now you've been offered, anyway.

152
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:48,464
- You wanted to show me something.
- Yeah, I just need to finish.

153
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,148
No, now. I'm busy.

154
00:17:51,648 --> 00:17:54,576
- What is it?
- Look for yourself.

155
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,872
Woman, medium height.
No visible fractures.

156
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:08,616
- What has she been buried in?
- Clay.

157
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:13,544
- Weren't you busy?
- Yes.

158
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:16,776
Take the pen there.

159
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,528
It doesn't seem to be the
same type of character as before.

160
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,480
These are rounder.

161
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,376
Do you know what it is?

162
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:30,456
- It looks like an 'A' and a percent sign.
- No, it's not.

163
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,912
You didn't know what it was.

164
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,804
It's probably an 'L' or a 'G'. I just
don't know from which alphabet.

165
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:40,688
- How many alphabets are there?
- Around 40.

166
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:45,432
Many of them are no longer in use.

167
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:52,852
You can take the photos with you.

168
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:56,160
Yes, I've already done that.

169
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:11,548
Åsa Holst's pregnancy is a fake.
Worth a little more?

170
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:04,232
Don't worry! You'll get it.

171
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:26,616
L and G. From the Glagolitic alphabet.

172
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,560
Which is?

173
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:32,376
The oldest Slavic alphabet.
Created in 800AD in Macedonia.

174
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:33,844
So now we know.

175
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,800
Now we're only missing the 6.

176
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:41,236
So we have one victim left, and
Freddie Holst refuses protection.

177
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:46,060
The murderer wants to point to Holst,
but we don't know if he's the next victim.

178
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:51,480
What do we know about
the ones we found this morning?

179
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,368
Filip and Inger Johansson.

180
00:20:55,996 --> 00:21:00,196
They've lived in the house in Ystad
since the early 80s. Pensioners.

181
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:04,084
He worked in insurance,
and she was a schoolteacher.

182
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:07,928
- Have we knocked on doors?
- Yes. The neighbors thought well of them.

183
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:13,448
Nice and quiet.
They kept mostly to themselves.

184
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:16,544
A yellow car was seen in the
area some days ago.

185
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,408
- We haven't found Söder's car.
- Nor Söder.

186
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:25,368
The airline confirms that he was on board
the flight to Singapore on the 8th.

187
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,144
- Could he have sold the car?
- Not according to the Transport Agency.

188
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:33,728
- Did the Johanssons have children?
- No, but they were foster parents.

189
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,984
Since '85.

190
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:40,440
Do we have a list of the children?

191
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,400
- Not yet, but I've contacted Social Services.
- It's urgent that we get it.

192
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,928
I know, Saga. That's why I contacted them.

193
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,568
There's no connection to any of the
other victims so far.

194
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:59,960
What about the list of employees
at Anderson TL?

195
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,696
- It's coming soon.
- When?

196
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,696
Soon. In the morning. I promise.

197
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:08,760
- Good. Can we continue?
- Yes.

198
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:13,920
- Do you have a moment?
- Yes.

199
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,680
Close the door.

200
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:23,232
- Sit down.
- It's fine. I can stand.

201
00:22:23,364 --> 00:22:27,968
- How are you doing now?
- Good. You ask a little too often.

202
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:30,556
It's important to follow up.

203
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:35,168
If I stop feeling good, I can tell you,
so you won't have to ask me all the time.

204
00:22:35,884 --> 00:22:42,104
I don't know if I should say this,
but there's something you should know.

205
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:48,552
The preliminary investigation shows your
mother may not have killed herself.

206
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,232
It looks like she was murdered.

207
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,816
Do you have any idea
who could have done it?

208
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,624
I had no contact with her for 20 years -

209
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:06,912
- but there were a lot of people
who might not have liked her.

210
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,536
Can I go now?

211
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:15,936
Yeah, do that.

212
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:19,280
Tell me if you need time off.

213
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,240
I never need time off.

214
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:27,720
Hey.

215
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:33,032
- Have you waited long?
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

216
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:37,492
I thought you'd be working
around the clock in Denmark.

217
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:42,244
- I got upset and left.
- Without notice?

218
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:45,984
You don't work with Saga, I see.

219
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:50,712
- They didn't appreciate me, so ...
- What do you do, actually?

220
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:56,288
I'm watching a Danish family.

221
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,400
Okay.

222
00:24:58,828 --> 00:25:02,208
- Who are you watching?
- Does it matter?

223
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,248
No, I'm just curious.

224
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:06,104
You're so sweet.
You probably don't know them.

225
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:05,344


226
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:10,632
- What do you want?
- Two cappuccinos, please.

227
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:13,708
They're well-known in Denmark.

228
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,304
- Soy milk in mine.
- I'll fix it up.

229
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:22,224
- Holst is their name.
- Freddie Holst?

230
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:25,276
- Who gave you this assignment?
- I don't know.

231
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,584
- How did you get in contact?
- Email.

232
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:30,104
Look at the address.

233
00:25:33,944 --> 00:25:36,120
Oh, for fuck's sake.

234
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:41,568
Exactly what was the assignment?

235
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:45,848
I watch the house and send
photos of them as they come and go.

236
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:49,352
I report what happens.
You were there this morning.

237
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:53,016
What kind of work is that?
Is that even legal?

238
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:58,216
I don't have so many clients now.
I need to have a roof over my head.

239
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:02,088
- Can you stay still?
- Me? Am I bothering you?

240
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,328
- How do you get the money?
- In my account, when I deliver the photos.

241
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,280
- Can you track money from an email address?
- There's a faster way, maybe.

242
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:18,824
We can send a file with a virus,
so I can track the computer.

243
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:23,808
- That can take time before it's opened.
- He usually responds right away.

244
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:27,752
- You're doing it again.
- Am I? Shall we do that?

245
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:30,632
I need a photo.

246
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:36,624
Take this.

247
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:04,872
What, do you owe money or something?

248
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:08,664
No, I'm just buying something.
Or buying it back.

249
00:27:08,908 --> 00:27:12,936
- How much can I get for it?
- What do you want for the lot?

250
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:17,688
Ah, we've gotten a fucking email.

251
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:20,712
Exciting.

252
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:28,396
- Whose is this?
- I have no idea.

253
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,368
Okay, but this guy is a cop.

254
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:36,288
Now. I have it. I'm in.

255
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:44,016
Do you have a price or what?

256
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,664
- 6000.
- 6000?

257
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:50,784
Okay.

258
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:55,296
I was going to offer you 7500,
but that's fine.

259
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:58,920
The signal is coming from Copenhagen.

260
00:28:00,964 --> 00:28:02,144
Vestmannagade.

261
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:04,756
I'll contact Lillian.

262
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:08,640
- Keep us updated.
- Of course.

263
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,728
I'm coming!

264
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:53,072
- John, what's happening? Anything new?
- The signal isn't moving.

265
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:57,144
The Danish police are on the way.

266
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:20,256
Fuck.

267
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,536
- We came too late.
- I understood that.

268
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:46,272
- It turned onto Njalsgade.
- What are we looking for?

269
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:50,592
A computer, ipad, or cell phone.
We don't know which, but it's moving.

270
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,096
- Coming up on Ørestads Boulevard.
- Got it. We'll be there soon.

271
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:26,520
It's turning.

272
00:30:37,204 --> 00:30:39,600
It's stopped.

273
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,576
- In a parking lot by the concert house.
- Do you have an exact location?

274
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,000
It's completely stopped there.

275
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:01,784
There's a yellow car.

276
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:06,528
John, can you check registration
number UUF 294?

277
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,232
It belongs to Kjell Söder.

278
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:25,084
It's empty.

279
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,328
- Where is it?
- Wait. Now it's moving again.

280
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:31,440
The train!

281
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:44,544
Send reinforcements to all stations!
Where is the blue light?

282
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,888
What? No, it's not there!
It's on the back seat.

283
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:04,848
For fuck's sake, man!

284
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:25,348
The train stopped. He's getting off.

285
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,880
He's moving to...

286
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,704
A shopping mall. The mall!

287
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:38,692
Go in the building. He's inside.

288
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:42,504
- John! John, where should we go?
- Farther into the building.

289
00:32:50,308 --> 00:32:54,264
If you're on the same floor, you
should be passing him.

290
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:58,112
Wait.

291
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:01,184
He's going out again.

292
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:05,844
- Where should we go?
- To the other side of the metro.

293
00:33:11,092 --> 00:33:13,304
- Where are you now?
- On the other side.

294
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:17,304
It's right there.

295
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:21,248
Fuck! We lost the signal.

296
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:24,460
They lost the signal.

297
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,032
Do you know how dumb it feels
to wait for someone who doesn't come?

298
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:05,456
My agent wanted to meet with me.
They were going cuckoo with the bookings.

299
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:08,240
And a text took too long to send?

300
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:14,088
I thought I could make it,
but that didn't happen.

301
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,256
Sorry.

302
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:21,360
Can I come in?

303
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,576
Åsa?

304
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,160
- You're sending mixed signals.
- What do you mean?

305
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:40,544
You invite me to your talk, but you don't
want to meet, and now you come here.

306
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:45,224
- There's an explanation for that.
- I'd like to have it.

307
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:49,036
Annika, whom you met
at the opening ...

308
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:51,392
Yeah, I saw her in Malmo.

309
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:58,416
She comes to all of my talks.
She's pursuing me.

310
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:03,168
- Do you have a little stalker?
- It's actually not funny.

311
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:08,864
I don't know how to get rid
of her. She's crazy and jealous.

312
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:11,264
Report her to the police.

313
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:17,136
Her funeral business is
handling Dad's burial.

314
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:21,200
But you're doing well for yourself.
You can just switch undertakers.

315
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:26,400
Yeah, I probably can.

316
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,656
Who is that?

317
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,256
Ah, that's our cleaning lady.

318
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:43,008
- Is Freddie home?
- No, he isn't.

319
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:52,248
It would mean a lot to me
if you'd come to Dad's burial.

320
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:55,584
As you know, you were his favorite.

321
00:35:55,924 --> 00:36:00,528
- If you can.
- If I can? Because of Freddie?

322
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,648
What does your stalker say about it?

323
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:07,992
I'll fix it before then.

324
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:20,264
- What are you doing here?
- I was visiting Åsa.

325
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,272
Why?

326
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,744
Because she wanted to meet me. She
decides for herself who she meets.

327
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:29,544
Sure, but not you.

328
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,480
You think you can control
everyone and everything.

329
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,496
But just like all empires fall, and one
day your little empire will fall.

330
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:40,464
In your dreams.

331
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:04,256
- Yeah.
- Are you coming?

332
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,232
No, I'm going home.
I'm completely soaked.

333
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:13,032
You're behaving weirdly today. You
seem irritated and out of balance.

334
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:18,096
I've had a really shitty day, okay?

335
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:21,436
Because you didn't see your family?

336
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:26,808
No, that's not why.

337
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,744
We tried to send a new email,
but it came back.

338
00:37:42,244 --> 00:37:45,848
It was rejected. The email address
is no longer in use, so we can't track it.

339
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:50,188
In that case, he must have figured
out how we were tracking him or her.

340
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:53,400
So we don't need you anymore.
You can go.

341
00:37:54,196 --> 00:37:57,156
Okay. See you later, no?

342
00:37:57,656 --> 00:38:00,816
- Good.
- Bye.

343
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:06,056
- Thanks for the help.
- Is that her job, spying on people?

344
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:11,688
No, she's a photographer, but she's
had a hard time finding work.

345
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,448
We've talked to Holst. He'll get
police protection outside the grounds.

346
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:20,552
- He agreed to that?
- We told them about the surveillance.

347
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:23,504
We need the videos from the
metro station and the mall.

348
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:28,592
- Lillian is going through the material.
- I want John to look at that.

349
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:32,736
I trust that the Danes can
analyze surveillance footage.

350
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,728
I don't.

351
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,560
- What about the list of foster children?
- Social Services is mulling it over.

352
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,664
It's classified, but I'm working on it.

353
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,252
- Hi. Are you Saga?
- Yes.

354
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:53,568
- Kjell Grankvist.
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

355
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:02,400
This is regarding the murder of
your mother, Marie-Louise Norén.

356
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,716
- Why do you want to talk about her?
- I'm from Internal Affairs.

357
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:13,952
You're only called if an employee
has committed a crime -

358
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,592
- or has made other mistakes.

359
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:23,914
We can also help if a family member
is a victim of a crime.

360
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:29,888
So where were you when
your mother was murdered?

361
00:39:30,888 --> 00:39:33,512
I don't know the time of death.

362
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:38,424
There.

363
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:47,592
I was in the cemetery.

364
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:52,568
- Why?
- I'd gotten an email telling me to come.

365
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,664
There was someone who claimed
to have information about the case -

366
00:39:56,164 --> 00:39:58,304
- but no one came.

367
00:39:58,804 --> 00:40:03,008
- And you went alone?
- Yes. It was a demand from the sender.

368
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:09,648
But you said something.
To your supervisor, for example.

369
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,352
No.

370
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:18,408
Why not?

371
00:40:22,324 --> 00:40:26,472
She had criticized my performance,
and I wanted ...

372
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:30,336
... to get back at her.

373
00:40:31,204 --> 00:40:34,160
So there's no one who can
confirm that you were there.

374
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,152
No.

375
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:41,256
- But I still have the email.
- Excellent. I want to see that.

376
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:45,656
Your mother said that
you had threatened her.

377
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:49,544
- She lied.
- Why would she do that?

378
00:40:50,544 --> 00:40:53,280
She didn't like me.

379
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,984
How did you feel when
she showed up again?

380
00:41:02,148 --> 00:41:05,040
I don't know.

381
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:09,968
Try to put words to your
strongest feeling.

382
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,348
You hadn't seen each other
for how many years?

383
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:16,228
20.

384
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:20,408
So she's standing there after 20 years.
You don't like each other ..

385
00:41:20,908 --> 00:41:24,268
How did you know that
I didn't like her?

386
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:27,584
I'm sorry. I assumed it was mutual.

387
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,752
- Did you like her?
- No.

388
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:34,136
But I never said that
I didn't like her.

389
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:38,308
Yes, you have, actually.

390
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:46,128
While questioning Morten Anker.
Your partner Hanne Thomsen heard it.

391
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,752
So how did you feel?

392
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:01,728
I ...

393
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:04,272
I was afraid.

394
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,824
I want to take a
DNA test from you.

395
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:14,268
It's routine. It's just to
completely exclude you -

396
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:19,512
- if we find unknown DNA
at the crime scene.

397
00:42:32,068 --> 00:42:34,032
Open your mouth, please.

398
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:44,456
Thanks. We're finished for today.

399
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:48,748
I can maybe get that
email on the way out?

400
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:51,648
Yes.

401
00:42:58,948 --> 00:43:04,128
- Thanks for your help. You'll hear from me.
- Are you okay, Saga?

402
00:43:11,076 --> 00:43:14,856
Committed suicide because of
incredible affair with Anna Ekdahl

403
00:46:09,896 --> 00:46:12,072
Hey.

404
00:46:14,548 --> 00:46:15,872
You're late.

405
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:22,032
I was reading an article about Anna
Ekdahl and her 17-year-old lover.

406
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:26,620
Why didn't you tell me that
you're Paparazzi?

407
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,408
I'm not. I'm a photographer.

408
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:33,292
As a photographer you sneak around
and take photos of people's private lives.

409
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:37,036
Sometimes, yes. But you know what?

410
00:46:37,536 --> 00:46:39,704
Without me they're nothing.

411
00:46:40,204 --> 00:46:45,600
How can you defend your work
when he killed himself?

412
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,728
It wasn't my fault.

413
00:46:50,228 --> 00:46:53,760
He gave me the tip. He wanted
the photos to be published.

414
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:59,664
So you hadn't received threats when
you asked me to check that number.

415
00:47:02,092 --> 00:47:05,040
No, I hadn't.

416
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:11,712
I broke the law to help you.
You know that, right?

417
00:47:14,452 --> 00:47:17,192
It's only wrong if you're caught.

418
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:21,080
Is that how you see things?

419
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:25,824
Everything is alright,
so long as you don't get caught?

420
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:32,716
You're leaving now?

421
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:36,168
I think we shouldn't see
each other for a while.

422
00:47:57,676 --> 00:48:00,416
It must not come out, that you're here.

423
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:04,536
Yet you walk around
outside the house.

424
00:48:05,044 --> 00:48:07,824
I don't walk around. I was only
going to the kitchen to get food.

425
00:48:12,628 --> 00:48:16,036
I don't think you understand
how much is at stake here.

426
00:48:16,536 --> 00:48:19,352
We are not just anyone, Freddie and I.
It isn't about money -

427
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:22,616
- and it isn't about whether
it's legal or illegal.

428
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:28,036
I have pretended to be pregnant,
and if that were to come out ...

429
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:31,992
Then why are you doing it? Why didn't
you just get a proper surrogate?

430
00:48:33,892 --> 00:48:36,776
Because it should be my child,
and no one must believe otherwise.

431
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:38,776
No, do you think I'm senile?

432
00:48:38,424 --> 00:48:40,372
So keep away from the house!

433
00:48:40,872 --> 00:48:46,036
And Freddie. Keep away from him, too.

434
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,712
- Hello?
- I've been trying to get you all frigging day.

435
00:49:00,144 --> 00:49:05,112
- I've been busy all day.
- With gambling away our house again?

436
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,488
Is it Holst who said that?

437
00:49:08,332 --> 00:49:09,912
So you did?

438
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,240
Yes, but listen. I got
7500 today alone.

439
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:18,144
I have enough to get
the house back. I promise.

440
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:48,364
You've removed their
clothes and things.

441
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:52,008
Yeah. They're in the utility room.
I haven't thrown them out.

442
00:49:54,196 --> 00:49:55,952
I was questioned by someone
from Internal Affairs today.

443
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,628
Why?

444
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,876
They think I have something
to do with my mom's death.

445
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:04,464
She took her own life.

446
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,944
No. It's a murder investigation now.

447
00:50:10,492 --> 00:50:12,384
Are you saying she was murdered?

448
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:19,872
Yeah. It looks like it.

449
00:50:20,236 --> 00:50:21,776
And they suspect you did it?

450
00:50:22,276 --> 00:50:25,012
Yes. He's lying.

451
00:50:25,512 --> 00:50:30,840
Internal Affairs has nothing to do with
crimes against family members.

452
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:32,504
That is out there.

453
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:36,100
Unless she wanted it
to appear that way.

454
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,772
She said that I threatened her.

455
00:50:40,272 --> 00:50:43,084
- Did you?
- No.

456
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:45,536
But she wanted to set me up for it.

457
00:50:46,036 --> 00:50:48,984
To frame you for murder?

458
00:50:50,836 --> 00:50:55,176
- Why would she do that?
- As revenge.

459
00:50:58,636 --> 00:51:03,096
- As revenge for what?
- You can't ask about that.

460
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,616
Okay. Okay.

461
00:51:09,988 --> 00:51:11,928
Saga, where are you going?

462
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:15,552
The toilet.

463
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,384
I just thought you would leave.

464
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:26,016
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

465
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:50,976
- Åsa says you're here too often.
- I won't be here long.

466
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:58,684
- What's that?
- Don't you recognize them?

467
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:02,856
- Sure, but where did you get them?
- I bought it.

468
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:07,344
It's a gift. Only for you.
Not Marc.

469
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,816
Why did you do this?

470
00:52:13,316 --> 00:52:16,128
Jeanette, I said that I'm
thinking about you.

471
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:20,016
Thank you.

472
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,944
Remember what I said. Drop that loser.

473
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:31,272
Goodnight, Freddie.

474
00:52:43,612 --> 00:52:47,428
- Have you been at her place again?
- Her name is Jeanette.

475
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,756
Do you need to be there so often?

476
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:51,528
She lives here now.

477
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:56,280
I see her two or three
times a day.

478
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:57,968
Please.

479
00:53:00,988 --> 00:53:05,088
Åsa. She's pregnant with our son.

480
00:53:05,404 --> 00:53:10,008
It doesn't feel like that.
It doesn't feel like it's mine.

481
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:15,456
We wanted to have a child, no?

482
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,696
But we can't have children.

483
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:23,716
I can't have children.

484
00:53:24,964 --> 00:53:30,000
That child is yours and hers.
I have nothing to do with it.

485
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:36,940
That's why I don't want her
to live here, or to have to see her.

486
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,208
If the child just showed up, then ...

487
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:45,864
But when I see you two together ...

488
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,176
Åsa. Can't you see it like this?

489
00:53:55,276 --> 00:54:00,096
We're renting her body for nine
months, so the child is yours.

490
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,048
And then we'll never see her again.

491
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:18,264
Lillian. I want to talk to you.

492
00:54:18,764 --> 00:54:21,024
Yeah. What happened?

493
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:27,604
As you know, Hans' autonomic
nervous system isn't working.

494
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:33,844
Now we've found out that
his brain function isn't good either.

495
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,924
He is braindead.

496
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:42,480
It's the respirator that's
keeping him alive.

497
00:54:42,892 --> 00:54:45,272
Sometimes people wake up again.

498
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:48,720
After being in a coma, yes.

499
00:54:48,844 --> 00:54:50,960
But braindead ...

500
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:56,624
I'll ask you to think about the
future and eventual donations -

501
00:54:57,124 --> 00:55:00,912
- and what we will do
regarding the respirator.

502
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:06,048
- May I see him now?
- Of course.

503
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,776
Oh, hi, John.
Damn, you're here already?

504
00:55:58,276 --> 00:56:02,504
Yeah. I put some reports
on Saga's desk.

505
00:56:02,884 --> 00:56:06,344
It's all the employees and firings
from Andersen TL.

506
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:12,296
Two have previous convictions. One for
abuse, and one for drunk driving.

507
00:56:12,988 --> 00:56:17,668
- What about the list of foster children?
- That's Linn's job. Ask her.

508
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:21,552
- Emil Larsson ...
- What?

509
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:26,016
There's an Emil Larsson who was fired.
Is it that Emil Larsson?

510
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:28,500
- Who?
- The museum guard.

511
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The one who tipped us off about the
connection between Holst and the pictures.

512
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,312
I don't know. Does he
work at Andersen TL?

513
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:38,616
There is, in any case, someone
with that name who does.

514
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,856
Did. He was fired.

515
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,100
- Do you have photos of the employees?
- No.

516
00:56:47,596 --> 00:56:51,192
- Sorry. No photos.
- You have no photos of your employees.

517
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:56,504
- Why was Emil Larsson fired?
- Last in, first out.

518
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:58,832
Did he know Kjell Söder?

519
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:04,012
- We all know each other here.
- Could he have borrowed his car?

520
00:57:04,512 --> 00:57:05,788
I don't know.

521
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:09,888
Did Emil mention that he worked at
another place? A museum?

522
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:10,896
No.

523
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:13,588
And you have no photos
of your employees.

524
00:57:14,088 --> 00:57:17,928
- Do you have any parties here?
- Yes, we do. Why?

525
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,272
Come.

526
00:57:19,948 --> 00:57:21,264
Come.

527
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:24,624
We need to identify a
former employee.

528
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,640
An Emil Larsson.

529
00:57:27,388 --> 00:57:30,744
Do any of you have photos
of Emil Larsson on your phones?

530
00:57:31,352 --> 00:57:35,096
- It could be from a party.
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

531
00:57:35,596 --> 00:57:39,344
We've gotten the list of foster
children from Social Services.

532
00:57:39,844 --> 00:57:42,624
One name is familiar.

533
00:57:44,356 --> 00:57:47,520
- Okay. Thanks.
- Saga.

534
00:57:50,836 --> 00:57:55,008
Emil Larsson was also on the
list of foster children.
