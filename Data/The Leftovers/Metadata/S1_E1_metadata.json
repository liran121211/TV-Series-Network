Also of concern is a silent, white-clad group of chain-smoking men and women called the Guilty Remnant, who team up in pairs to stake out people and places around town. As tension in Mapleton escalates, the lives of Laurie, an unexpected member of the Guilty Remnant, and Meg, a recently engaged young woman, converge.\u2014Jiilo_Kim", "Three years ago on October 14, 2% of the world's population - some 160 million people - simply vanished into thin air. No one knows exactly what happened. Some think it's the rapture others just have no explanation. Those left behind all feel a sense of loss. In the small town of Mapleton, pretty well everyone knows someone who disappeared. As the third anniversary of the disappearances approaches, Chief of Police Kevin Garvey disagrees with Mayor Lucy Warberton's plan to hold a parade and a memorial service. He is particularly concerned that a local cult, the Guilty Remnant who dress in white and have taken a vow silence, may disrupt the proceedings. He also has to deal with his own emotions as do his two children.\u2014garykmcd", "3 years after the sudden departure, Kevin prepares for disaster as the first Heroes Day is celebrated in Mapleton, New York; Jill acts out at school and goes to a classmate's party with Aimee; Laurie and Gladys watch Meg; Tom drives a congressman to see Wayne, who tasks him with protecting Christine; Kevin tries to do his job when a runaway dog is murdered in front of him.\u2014chingeeflingee"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3203968", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 7670, "number_of_episodes": 28}
