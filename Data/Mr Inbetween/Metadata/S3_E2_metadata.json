He has called his daughter and been evasive about why he's away. He then helps orient his newbie cellmate, a na\u00efve soul (Adam) who blunders into insulting a hulking inmate by accidentally calling him gay (or properly \"champ\"). Adam instructs Ray on how to meditate before he is ambushed crapping in the shared hallway toilet and beaten badly. In the meantime, Ray has arranged to have a friend outside visit the young punk pressing charges. He is driven out to the woods at night and thrown handcuffed into a grave but is let go after weeping and agreeing to drop the charges. Ray is then promptly released but, has a bigger jury waiting at home in the guise of his sullen daughter, who is angry about his lying to her. Though he tries cleaning up his neighborhood reputation by speaking with his daughter's best friend's mother, he still can't \"fix\" things with his daughter. And sadly, even in his amended version, he is not completely truthful with her about the incident."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "13795344", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 785, "number_of_episodes": 26}
