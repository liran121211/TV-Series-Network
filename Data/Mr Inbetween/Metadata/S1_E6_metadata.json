As is looking in the trunk before stealing a car. People say they do but does anybody really like surprises?", "We meet potheads Scon and Lefty and discover they are the reason for the disappearance of Ray and his car. Scon and Lefty drop off Ray's car to auto mechanic Bernie to be chopped for parts. Bernie is surprised to find Ray in the boot and has to dump Ray's car in a nearby forest with him still tied-up inside. Ray kicks his way out of the trunk, and shortly afterwards encounters Scon and Lefty with his phone and his strongbox. Trailing them back to Bernie's auto shop, Ray confronts the trio just as they're about to torch open his strongbox, which Ray reclaims intact. Dave and Bobby intercept Ray, and finally deliver him to Davros. As Ray prepares to be dispatched to his final resting place, Davros decides he wants in on the contents of the strongbox. Only when it's finally opened do Davros, Dave, and Bobby discover that it doesn't exactly contain what they were expecting, and are reminded that greed isn't necessarily good."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "7493678", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 1243, "number_of_episodes": 26}
