Brittany asks tough questions, while Ray hands out trouble to those that seek it.", "Gary takes Ray for a drive to give him a surprise as a thank you for saving him. Ray and Ally's relationship has developed. Freddy takes Ray to meet Davros. Ray doesn't like Davros and although Davros seems placated by the end of the conference, Freddy knows better. A road-rage incident forces Ally to confront Ray about his quick access to violence, rather than attempting to diffuse a situation. When court-ordered anger management therapist Peter confronts Ray about the same impulse, Ray explains that it's justifiable to let people clearly know that there are ramifications for being an asshole. For Ray, it's all about respect. Ray brings Ally home to meet Brittany. Ray can't sleep and gets up to notice a van parked outside surveilling his house. He goes for a drive and leads the van out to a safe place to do some permanent damage to it's occupants - Davros' guys - using the surprise gift Gary gave him."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "7493672", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 1048, "number_of_episodes": 26}
