Freddy owes Ray money which he doesn't have, as usual so he sends Ray off with newly hired heavy, Nick, to collect and keep a 10k debt. Nick hasn't collected before and proves ineffective, so Ray has to step in and do it his way to get results. Ray meets Ally at the dog park and there is immediate chemistry - but he doesn't act on it, feeling that she's out of his league. Gary is in trouble with his Russian wife, Tatiana, over the discovery of a porn DVD and asks Ray to take the blame. While out with Brittany having ice-cream they bump into some young men who knock her ice-cream to the ground and disrespect Ray. Ray assaults one of the young men responsible and while escaping the scene he runs into Ally and takes the opportunity to make his feelings a little clearer. Ally gives Ray her number."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "7493662", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1270, "number_of_episodes": 26}
