It's also important to lock your car when you leave it.", "Ray and Gary are planning to relieve a guy of his drugs and cash, and bring Nick in on the job, but a sudden turn of events scuppers their plans. After informing Freddy about his and Gary's plans going astray, Ray is picked up by Davros' slow-witted bodyguard, Bobby, and the wily hitman, Dave, who abduct Ray in his own car. Ray tells his captors about a hidden strongbox containing a great deal more cash than they're being paid to do the job. Dave devises a plan: tell Davros they ran out of gas, tell Ray that they'll let him go once the strongbox is retrieved, retrieve it, deliver Ray to Davros, and get paid twice. What could possibly go wrong? Dave and Bobby uncover the strongbox, but when they momentarily leave Ray's car unattended with Ray safely locked in the trunk, the car disappears. Dave and Bobby hot wire another car and go looking for Ray, the car, and the strongbox."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "7493674", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1008, "number_of_episodes": 26}
