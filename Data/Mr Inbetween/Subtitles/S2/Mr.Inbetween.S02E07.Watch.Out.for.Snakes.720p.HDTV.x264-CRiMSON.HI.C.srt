The giant was just trying
to get back the hen,

353
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,930
and he murdered him.

354
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,790
[SIGHS]

355
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,060
Ah, I missed a page.

356
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,770
So, the police visited Jack the next day

357
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,760
and they arrested him
for theft and murder

358
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,420
and he went to jail for
the rest of his life.

359
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,040
- The end.
- I don't like that story at all.

360
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,460
Yeah, well, I'm not a
big fan of it, either.

361
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,800
It's terrible. The poor giant.

362
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,630
Well, I guess the moral of the story is,

363
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,200
you know, don't, uh,
steal, don't murder,

364
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,800
or you'll go to jail for the
rest of your life, okay?

365
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,970
So don't do it.

366
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,420
That story sucks.

367
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,660
Mm. It does.

368
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,170
All right.

369
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
- Night.
- Good night.

370
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,400
Mwah.

371
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,110
[GRUNTS SOFTLY]

372
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,860
Mm.

373
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,410
You ever read "Jack and the Beanstalk"?

374
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,710
It was a long time ago. Why?

375
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,080
Jack was a piece of shit.

376
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,379
Why do you say that?

377
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,469
Well, he climbs the beanstalk, right?

378
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,980
- Yeah.
- He goes into the giant's castle...

379
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,040
- ... steals a bloody harp...
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

380
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,000
... steals the goose
that lays a golden egg.

381
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,660
- Yeah.
- Steals it.

382
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,790
Runs off.

383
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,300
So the giant goes after him,

384
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,840
trying to get back all the
shit that Jack stole.

385
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,560
Uh-huh.

386
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,680
And while he's climbing
down the beanstalk...

387
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,619
- [LAUGHS]
- [CHUCKLES]: Jack chops it down

388
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,030
- and fucking murders him.
- [LAUGHS]

389
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,400
- What a cunt.
