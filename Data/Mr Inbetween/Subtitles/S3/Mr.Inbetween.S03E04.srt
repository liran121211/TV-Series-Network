1
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,260
<i>Mate.</i>

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>I just had the best idea
for a new business.</i>

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>You know how people
like to make sex tapes?</i>

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>Right. Fuck. What's this shit?</i>

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,210
<i>‐Turn that shit off.</i>

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,710
<i>We go into business together,
right,</i>

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,550
<i>making home porn.</i>

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,790
<i>We go round to people's houses</i>

9
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,150
<i>with a camera, lights
and all the gear</i>

10
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,390
<i>and shoot sex tapes.</i>

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,560
<i>Why would anybody
want to do that?</i>

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,730
<i>Mate, people will love it.</i>

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,040
<i>‐I wouldn't.
‐Yeah, but you're a prude.</i>

14
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,140
<i>Mate, this is a great idea.</i>

15
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,710
<i>You sure you don't want to
get in on this?</i>

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,380
<i>I came up with a name
for the business.</i>

17
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,610
<i>‐Mm‐hm?
‐You ready?</i>

18
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,790
<i>‐Mm.
‐'Home‐o Erotic'. Right?</i>

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,520
<i>But the 'homo' is spelt</i>

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,030
<i>H‐O‐M‐E‐O.</i>

21
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,430
<i>Home‐o Erotic. Get it?</i>

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,270
<i>Do you know
what 'homoerotic' means?</i>

23
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,510
<i>Yeah.</i>

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,080
<i>It means 'gay'.</i>

25
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,350
<i>Like, gay sex.</i>

26
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,750
<i>‐Really?
‐Mm.</i>

27
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,690
<i>Oh, fuck. It took me, like,
an hour to come up with that.</i>

28
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,670
<i>..Gary's...</i>

29
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,680
<i>'Gary's Glitter Productions'.</i>

30
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,080
<i>Hmm?</i>

31
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
<i>He was a pedo.</i>

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,790
<i>Oh. Yeah.</i>

33
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,060
<i>Mm‐hm.</i>

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,730
<i>Yeah.</i>

35
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,700
<i>Yeah, that wouldn't work.</i>

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,670
<i>‐Here we are.
‐Thanks a lot.</i>

37
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,870
<i>‐Have a great day.
‐See you.</i>

38
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,270
<i>'Bye.</i>

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,080
<i>Buy a new bag,
you cheap bastard.</i>

40
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,020
<i>‐Wow, look at you, eh?</i>

41
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,750
<i>How you going, mate? Alright?</i>

42
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,990
<i>What's this? When are you due?</i>

43
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,360
<i>‐Piss off.</i>

44
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,590
<i>‐You good?
‐Oh, really good. Look at me.</i>

45
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,730
<i>So, when are you gonna
come back and train?</i>

46
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>Eh, I've been training at home.</i>

47
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,540
<i>So, how's Brucey?</i>

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,140
<i>He passed, mate,
about a year ago.</i>

49
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,980
<i>‐Oh, shit.
‐Yeah.</i>

50
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,540
<i>Sorry, mate.</i>

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,880
<i>Oh, I heard he wasn't too good.</i>

52
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>‐Yeah, yeah, so...
‐Ah, that's fucked.</i>

53
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,950
<i>Yeah, what are you gonna do,
mate? You know...</i>

54
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,320
<i>‐You holding up alright?
‐Not too bad, you know.</i>

55
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,020
<i>COACH: Come on.
Hands up, hands up.</i>

56
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,390
<i>‐This place hasn't changed.
‐Just how I like it.</i>

57
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,360
<i>‐How's Killy going? Alright?
‐He's good. Really good.</i>

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,570
<i>‐Yeah?
‐Yeah. So, what about you?</i>

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,070
<i>You still cracking heads?</i>

60
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,140
<i>‐Every now and then.
‐You're not getting any younger.</i>

61
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,570
<i>What else am I gonna do?</i>

62
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,810
<i>Start a gym?</i>

63
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,110
<i>Yeah, but I gotta
make some money.</i>

64
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,150
<i>There's more important things
than money.</i>

65
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,650
<i>‐Is there?
‐Yeah.</i>

66
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,590
<i>This place hasn't made me rich,
but I love what I do.</i>

67
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,520
<i>I love coming in here every day.</i>

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,660
<i>‐It's my life.
‐Mm.</i>

69
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,030
<i>Do you love what you do,
aside from money?</i>

70
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,730
<i>COACH: Come on!</i>

71
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,270
<i>Not particularly.</i>

72
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,740
<i>You've got to ask yourself,
"Why am I doing it?"</i>

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,750
<i>Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!</i>

74
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,040
<i>Piu‐piu! Piu‐piu!</i>

75
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,670
<i>Piu!</i>

76
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,650
<i>Piu.</i>

77
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,400
<i>Thought you were pretty smart,
didn't you?</i>

78
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,860
<i>Well, time to die.</i>

79
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,710
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

80
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,020
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

81
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,040
<i>‐What's going on?
‐Nothing.</i>

82
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,440
<i>Couldn't get the passionfruit
yoghurt, alright.</i>

83
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,970
<i>So...</i>

84
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,750
<i>Hey.</i>

85
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,350
<i>Come inside.</i>

86
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,230
<i>‐'Sup?</i>

87
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,160
<i>You tell me.</i>

88
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,960
<i>What?</i>

89
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,010
<i>It's not mine.</i>

90
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,710
<i>Cut the crap, princess.</i>

91
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,240
<i>It's yours, not mine.</i>

92
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,180
<i>Why are you such a smart‐arse
all of a sudden?</i>

93
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,080
<i>Why do you have a gun?</i>

94
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,950
<i>Doesn't matter why I got a gun.</i>

95
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,820
<i>What matters is you shouldn't be
playing with it.</i>

96
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,250
<i>If you didn't have a gun,</i>

97
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,620
<i>then I wouldn't be playing
with it, now, would I?</i>

98
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,200
<i>‐So, where's the hole?
‐What hole?</i>

99
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,430
<i>The hole you made
when you fired the pistol.</i>

100
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,430
<i>How do you know I fired it?</i>

101
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,730
<i>Smell the gunpowder.</i>

102
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,060
<i>So, why have you got a gun?</i>

103
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,970
<i>‐Burglars.
‐Burglars?</i>

104
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,940
<i>Yeah, you know what
burglars are, don't you?</i>

105
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,040
<i>Can we go shooting?</i>

106
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,380
<i>‐Nup.
‐Why not?</i>

107
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,080
<i>'Cause I said.</i>

108
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,180
<i>Please!</i>

109
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,650
<i>Nup.</i>

110
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,300
<i>If you took me shooting,</i>

111
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,700
<i>then, you know,
you can teach me and stuff.</i>

112
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,610
<i>Don't go in my room again,
alright?</i>

113
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,810
<i>Huh? Don't eye‐roll me.</i>

114
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,850
<i>‐Cut it out, I said.
‐My eyes are closed.</i>

115
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,550
<i>How can I eye‐roll
when my eyes are closed?</i>

116
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,820
<i>I don't know,
but I know you're doing it.</i>

117
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,850
<i>‐What a jerk.
‐'Scuse me?</i>

118
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,320
<i>Nothing.</i>

119
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,740
<i>How do I know your medicine
is true medicine?</i>

120
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,670
<i>Very easy.</i>

121
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,510
<i>Get some 20 hunters with me.</i>

122
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,110
<i>When all is ready,
I will rob the base...</i>

123
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,840
<i>oss‐breeze</i>

124
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,000
<i>here at the ground...</i>

125
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,310
<i>Mm, Superman, right?</i>

126
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,040
<i>He's flying around,
cruising around Metropolis,</i>

127
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,010
<i>looking for bad guys, right?</i>

128
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,480
<i>He's flying around,
flying around.</i>

129
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,980
<i>And all of a sudden,
he looks down.</i>

130
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,720
<i>‐He sees Wonder Woman, right.
‐Mm, mm.</i>

131
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,950
<i>She's starkers.</i>

132
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,260
<i>Buck naked, all oiled up,</i>

133
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,030
<i>sunbaking on top of
this building.</i>

134
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,830
<i>‐Right?
‐Mm‐hm. Mm.</i>

135
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,330
<i>Straightaway, instant boner.</i>

136
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,570
<i>Cracks a fat. Super fat, right?</i>

137
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,940
<i>He thinks to himself,
"With my super speed,</i>

138
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,440
<i>"I could fly down there,
root her,</i>

139
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,910
<i>"give her
a quick couple of pumps</i>

140
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,810
<i>"and then be out of there before
she even knows what hit her."</i>

141
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,250
<i>‐Huh?
‐Mm.</i>

142
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,920
<i>So, he zooms down,
10,000 miles an hour,</i>

143
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,950
<i>gives her a quick couple
of pumps, blows his load</i>

144
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,790
<i>and he's gone in, like,
half a second, right?</i>

145
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,850
<i>Yeah.</i>

146
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,560
<i>Wonder Woman jumps to her feet
and goes,</i>

147
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,020
<i>"What the fuck was that?!"</i>

148
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,420
<i>The Invisible Man goes,</i>

149
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,360
<i>"I don't know, but my arsehole's
fucking killing me."</i>

150
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,530
<i>‐Fucked him up the arse.</i>

151
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,340
<i>COMMENTATOR: ..beautifully,
right off the meat of the bat.</i>

152
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,540
<i>Superman would be able
to see him, though.</i>

153
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,880
<i>No, he wouldn't. He's invisible.</i>

154
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,620
<i>Yeah, but, like, in real life,</i>

155
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,090
<i>'cause he's got that fuckin',
um, X‐ray vision.</i>

156
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,220
<i>Yeah, but X‐ray vision
helps you to see through shit.</i>

157
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,660
<i>It doesn't help you to see stuff
that's invisible.</i>

158
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,430
<i>What about that heat vision
thing he's got?</i>

159
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,130
<i>He sees infrared
and all that kind of crap.</i>

160
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,700
<i>Oh, mate, it's a joke.
It's a joke.</i>

161
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,780
<i>What does the Starship
'Enterprise' and toilet paper</i>

162
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,940
<i>have in common?</i>

163
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>Don't know. What?</i>

164
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,750
<i>They both search Uranus
for Klingons.</i>

165
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,750
<i>‐Eh.
‐Don't like it?</i>

166
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,220
<i>Eh, it's not bad.</i>

167
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,460
<i>Superman joke's better.</i>

168
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,130
<i>Mm.</i>

169
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,300
<i>Oh, mate...</i>

170
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,370
<i>..I know you just got out,</i>
