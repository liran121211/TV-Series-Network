seeing this dude</i>

347
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,010
<i>and she took off with him,</i>

348
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,180

give a shit about that.</i>

349
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,010
<i>Uh, well, like, I did.</i>

350

wanted to see my daughter</i>

353
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,690
<i>and make sure she was ok
'cause, yeah, she's only 9.</i>

354
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,530

<i>she took an avo out on me</i>

356
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,080
<i>and I didn't realise, like,
you can't even text somebody</i>

357
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>when they've taken
an avo out on ya.</i>

358

<i>I texted her a few times
just saying, you know,</i>

359
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,340
<i>I want to see my daughter
and all that,</i>

360
