<i>-What's that?
-Nothing.</i>

255

<i>u know tarot cards?</i>

<i>Ray: Mmm.</i>

<i>It's like tarots,

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,630
<i>Hmm.</i>

259
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,330
<i>Anyway, I was reading this
introduction to the 'I ching'.</i>

260
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,350
<i>There was this guy and he was,
like, this taoist master.</i>

261
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,520
<i>Hmm.</i>

262
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,410
<i>And he said
that everything that happens</i>

263
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,890
<i>is for a good reason.</i>

264
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,060
<i>Hmm.</i>

265
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,350
<i>So, like, even if
something bad happens,</i>

266
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,040
<i>there's, like, a good reason
for it.</i>

267
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,570
<i>Yeah, I think...</i>

268
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,740
<i>..One of the good
things about getting older,</i>

269
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,960
<i>like when I was younger
and something bad had happened,</i>

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,300
<i>I'd always get
really upset about it.</i>

271
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,870
<i>But then you get older</i>

272
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,040
<i>and you realise that
when something bad happens,</i>

273
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,540
<i>you know, something good</i>

274
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,980
<i>is just around the corner,
you know?</i>

275
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,710
<i>It all evens out.</i>

276
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,430
<i>Yeah, so...</i>

277
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
<i>So, an example is, like,
you know penicillin?</i>

278
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,350
<i>Do you know how
they discovered penicillin?</i>

279
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,900
<i>Nuh.</i>

280
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,400
<i>So, they were in a lab</i>

281
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,070
<i>and, like, they didn't clean
the equipment properly.</i>

282
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,030
<i>And mould grew on it.</i>

283
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,530
<i>And that's how
they discovered penicillin.</i>

284
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,230
<i>Like, that was where
they got penicillin from.</i>

285
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,400
<i>Shit.</i>

286
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,370
<i>There you go.</i>

287
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,750
<i>Zoe: Hmm.</i>

288
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,290
<i>So, how long were you
together for?</i>

289
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,540
<i>Just over a year.</i>

290
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,930
<i>Are you still friends?</i>

291
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,550
<i>Nope.</i>

292
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,430
<i>How about you?</i>

293
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,190
<i>My last proper relationship
was about three years ago.</i>

294
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,860
<i>Mmm.</i>

295
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,030
<i>And I was seeing this guy
a few weeks ago.</i>

296
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,530
<i>It was, like, a casual thing,</i>

297
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,610
<i>but I had to give him the flick</i>

298
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,240
<i>'cause he wasn't real good
in the old sack.</i>

299
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,790
<i>And, you know,
if I was more into him</i>

300
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,780
<i>it probably wouldn't have been,
like, a big deal, but...</i>

301
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,880
<i>..There's only so many orgasms
you can fake.</i>

302
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,420
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

303
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,790
<i>-Do you fake a lot of orgasms?
-Oh, heaps.</i>

304
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,620
<i>That must be quite hard
as a guy.</i>

305
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,980
<i>It's next level.</i>

306
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,640
<i>-Poor thing.
-Hmm. Thanks.</i>

307
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,760
<i>When was the last time
you had a real orgasm?</i>

308
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,350
<i>Oh...</i>

309
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,350
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

310
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,990
<i>Yeah.</i>

311
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,610
<i>Why do you fake it?</i>

312
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,860
<i>Because sometimes you know that
you're just not gonna get there</i>

313
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,160
<i>and you don't want to make
the guy feel bad.</i>

314
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,150
<i>So why don't you just say,
"hey, buddy,</i>

315
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,750
<i>"you're not doing it for me"?</i>

316
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,420
<i>'cause I don't want
to hurt someone's feelings.</i>

317
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,350
<i>what?</i>

318
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,720
<i>-I'm a nice person.
-That's your problem.</i>

319
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,720
<i>-You're not a nice person?
-Pfffft! Fuck that.</i>

320
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,770
<i>What's wrong with being nice?</i>

321
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,310
<i>It's weak.</i>

322
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,140
<i>How is it weak?</i>

323
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,850
<i>You're worrying about
what people are gonna feel.</i>

324
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,650
<i>You shouldn't. You should
just tell them the truth.</i>

325
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,030
<i>I mean, this guy,
you could've told him</i>

326
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,200
<i>what the problem was,
you could've sorted it out.</i>

327
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,690
<i>But now, I mean, he's gonna go</i>

328
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,830
<i>and sleep with somebody else</i>

329
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,990
<i>and then he's gonna
sleep with somebody else,</i>

330
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,500
<i>then somebody else,</i>

331
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,250
<i>and then you've got
all these women</i>

332
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,870
<i>who are gonna
have to fake orgasms</i>

333
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,720
<i>because nobody wants to tell him
the fuckin' truth, you know?</i>

334
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,590
<i>I mean, you're not really
helping out</i>

335
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,870
<i>your sisters, are you?</i>

336
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,380
<i>Well, it's not my fault
he was shit.</i>

337
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,910
<i>No. Of course not.</i>

338
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,930
<i>But, you know, you could've done
something about it, though.</i>

339
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,240
<i>-That's not my responsibility.
-No, it's not. Definitely not.</i>

340
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,610
<i>But you can't really complain,
can you?</i>

341
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,270
