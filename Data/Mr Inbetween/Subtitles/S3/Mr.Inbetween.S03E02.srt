<i>-Adam: Don't get an audi.
-Ray: Why not?</i>

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,670
<i>Mate, audi drivers.</i>

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,820
<i>No good?</i>

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,710
<i>The worst fucking drivers
on the road.</i>

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,210
<i>I thought mercedes drivers
were the worst drivers.</i>

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,490
<i>Nah, mercedes drivers
number two.</i>

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,330
<i>-Yeah?
-Audi, number one worst.</i>

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,270
<i>Ray: Oh.</i>

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,170
<i>I reckon the thing is
with audis,</i>

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>like, don't get me wrong,</i>

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,840
<i>they're great cars,
they're luxury cars,</i>

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,840
<i>but they're actually
not that expensive.</i>

13
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,270
<i>So I think the people
who buy them,</i>

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,510
<i>they actually want a beemer
or a mercedes</i>

15
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,340
<i>but they can't afford them.</i>

16
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,340
<i>Yeah.</i>

17
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>But they still want people
to think they've got money</i>

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
<i>'cause, you know, they're
arseholes, so they get the audi.</i>

19
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,480
<i>Ah, I got you.</i>

20
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,020
<i>So if I buy one,</i>

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,070
<i>does that mean I'm an arsehole?</i>

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,360
<i>-Hey.
-What's going on?</i>

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,250
<i>Same old shit. You good?</i>

-You heard.</i>

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,010
<i>Uh, you can't say that word,
mate.</i>

33
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,150
<i>-Why?
-It's just not a good word.</i>

34
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,940
<i>Yeah, ok. Sorry.</i>

35

No offence.</i>

<i>Nuh.</i>

101

<i>So if you don't stand up
and do something about it,</i>

111

<i>Mate, doesn't matter
how big he is,</i>

<i>doesn't matter how big you are,
right?</i>

<i>Meditating.</i>

<i>Why do you do that?</i>

138
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,420
<i>Helps me relax.</i>

139

<i>-Fair enough.
-Yeah.</i>

140
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,600
<i>I used to have, um,</i>

<i>really bad anxiety and shit,</i>

142
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,270
<i>so I've been doing it
for a couple of years now.</i>

143

<i>-Yeah?
-Yeah.</i>

<i>(lights clang)</i>

148

<i>well, you don't need to have
anxiety to do it.</i>

149
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,950
<i>So how do you do it?</i>

150
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,540
<i>Uh... (clears throat)</i>

151
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,040
<i>ok, so you focus on
your breathing...</i>

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,040
<i>Yeah.</i>

153
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,800
<i>..And you count your breaths.</i>

154
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,460
<i>And so, basically
it's every time you breathe out,</i>

155

<i>you count.</i>

156
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,970

yeah, then back to one again.</i>

157

-Alright.</i>

<i>Ahh.</i>

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,680
<i>So, how long do I do it for?</i>

160
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,940
<i>Well, as long as you want.</i>

161
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,760
<i>It's a bit boring.</i>

162
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,230
<i>(chuckles) that's ok.</i>

163
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,330
<i>When you first start out, so it
takes a while to relax into it.</i>

164

<i>But, um...</i>

165
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,420

<i>(ray clears his throat)</i>

<i>well,
I was driving down the road</i>

312

<i>and these two guys just decided</i>

313
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,850
<i>that they were gonna cross
in front of the car</i>

314
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,020
<i>while I was driving.</i>

315
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,660
<i>So, I...You know, I have to veer
to get around them, right,</i>

316
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,330
<i>otherwise I'm gonna
run 'em over.</i>

317
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,000
<i>As I go past them,</i>

318
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
<i>one of the guys slapped
the side mirror on the car,</i>

319
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,000
<i>so I pulled over and I'm like,
"mate, what's the problem?"</i>

320
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,590
<i>I'm trying to figure out
what this guy's so angry about.</i>

321
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,010
<i>You know, before I know it,
the guy's swinging at me,</i>

322
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,890
<i>trying to, you know,
punch me in the face.</i>

323
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,430
<i>I'm like, you know...
I gotta defend myself.</i>

324
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,930
<i>Like, I'm not gonna get
my head punched in,</i>

325
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,100
<i>so I hit him and, you know,</i>

326
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,770
<i>the cops were there,
unfortunately, pretty close</i>

327
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,520
<i>and they saw me hit him
and so they put me in remand.</i>

328
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,410
<i>What's remand?</i>

329
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,610
<i>Remand is, um...</i>

330
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,620
<i>That's the place
where they put you</i>

331
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,400
<i>when they're trying to
figure out</i>

332
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,120
<i>whether you've done
the wrong thing or not, right?</i>

333
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,120
<i>So, I didn't go to court,
I wasn't convicted,</i>

334
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,460
<i>I wasn't found guilty.</i>

335
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,580
<i>They just put me in there
so they could investigate</i>

336
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,630
<i>and found out what happened,
alright?</i>

337
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,880
<i>So, police investigated,</i>

338
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,220
<i>they found out that
I didn't start the fight,</i>

339
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,100
<i>it was the other guy
trying to hit me</i>

340
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,110
<i>and that I was just trying to
defend myself,</i>

341
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,060
<i>so they released me out of jail.</i>

342
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,950
<i>Why did you lie?</i>

343
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,120
<i>'cause I didn't wanna
worry you.</i>

344
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,070
<i>Yeah, but you shouldn't lie.</i>

345
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,740
<i>Ray: I know.</i>

346
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,570
<i>I should have told you.</i>

347
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,540
<i>And I'm sorry that I didn't,
you know.</i>

348
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,750
<i>-Ok?
-Whatever.</i>

349
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,090
<i>I am actually really sorry
that I...</i>

350
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,310
<i>You're just sorry
that I found out.</i>

351
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,480
<i>(sighs)</i>

352
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,320
<i>you wouldn't like it
if I lied to you.</i>

353
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,410
<i>Fair enough.</i>

354
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,620
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

355
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,270
<i>-how you going?
-Good, thanks.</i>

356
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,520
<i>-I'm brittany's dad.
-Oh.</i>

357
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,940
<i>Um, brit said that,
um, you know, uh,</i>

358
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,780
<i>romy didn't wanna...You didn't
want her to come and stay</i>

359
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,980
<i>'cause you'd heard
I'd been in jail.</i>

360
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,530
<i>Oh, yeah. Well, look, we just...</i>

361
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,700
<i>You know, that was just
something that I'd heard, so...</i>

362
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,490
<i>Yeah. Look, no, I mean, I'm not
upset about it or anything.</i>

363
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,360
<i>But it's just I wanted to come
round and explain to you</i>

364
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,030
<i>'cause it's kinda like
everybody's kind of talking</i>

365
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,410
<i>and...And, um...</i>

366
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,170
<i>So, basically
what happened was, um,</i>

367
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,200
<i>it was kind of like
a road rage sort of incident.</i>

368
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,250
<i>Um, I defended myself, um,</i>

369
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,390
<i>and, unfortunately, the other
guy came off worse for wear,</i>

370
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,730
<i>you know what I mean, so he
pressed charges against me.</i>

371
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,730
<i>Oh.</i>

372
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,730
<i>Yeah. So...</i>

373
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,230
<i>Um, but, you know,
the cops investigated</i>

374
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,020
<i>and they found out
that I wasn't at fault,</i>

375
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,570
<i>and, um, yeah, so they dismissed
all the charges</i>

376
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,740
<i>and, you know...</i>

377
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,910
<i>Well, I'm sorry.</i>

378
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,690
<i>And...And you're right about
everyone talking.</i>

379
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,860
<i>Yeah.</i>

380
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,360
<i>-So...
-Ok, great.</i>

381
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,860
<i>Well, thank you for explaining.</i>

382
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,700
<i>Yeah, look, so, you know,</i>

383
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,920
<i>brit's still keen to,
you know, have romy stay over.</i>

384
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,420
<i>-So if you wanna...
-She'd love to come and stay.</i>

385
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,380
<i>Awesome.</i>

386
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,880
<i>But we've, um...We've gotta go
and see her grandmother,</i>

387
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,380
<i>who's really not very well
at the moment, so...</i>

388
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,300
<i>-Oh. Now?
-Yeah.</i>

389
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,640
<i>-That's no good.
-Yeah. Thank you.</i>

390
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
<i>-Alright.
-But, mmm, another time maybe.</i>

391
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,970
<i>Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.</i>

392
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,140
<i>Great.</i>

393
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,280
<i>-Ok.
-Ok.</i>

394
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,020
<i>So...</i>

395
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,940
<i>Uh, she's gotta go see
her grandma.</i>

396
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,570
<i>Uh...Because she's sick,
apparently.</i>

397
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,610
<i>So...</i>

398
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,120
