<i>‐There's gotta be.
‐Why?</i>

45
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,670
<i>Big Bang.</i>

46

<i>Yeah?</i>

47
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,380
<i>‐Trillions of years ago, right?
‐Yeah.</i>

48
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,320
<i>OK? What they're saying is,
there's nothing.</i>

49
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,660
<i>All of a sudden,
Big Bang, right?</i>

50
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,590
<i>Mm‐hm.</i>

51
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,900
<i>And then you've got a universe,
right?</i>

52
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,370
<i>You've got billions of planets,
right?</i>

53
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,710

‐Where'd they come from?</i>

54
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,780
<i>‐Fuck knows.
‐Exactly, right.</i>

55
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,160
<i>Something had to be there,
right, to make the universe.</i>

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,670
<i>Right, but if there was nothing
before the Big Bang,</i>

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,080
<i>then how can nothing
make something?</i>

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,280
<i>It can't, right?</i>

59
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,350

<i>What...</i>

63

‐God.</i>

67
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,960
<i>‐Right. OK.
‐Right?</i>

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,370
<i>You can't get something

<i>‐Right.
‐Right?</i>

70
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,110
<i>You can't get a bang
and a universe out of nothing.</i>

71
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,110
<i>Right.</i>

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,380

‐..to get something.</i>

<i>She said no.
Good girl, Brit. Good girl!</i>

84
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,080
<i>Is he making a move?
He's making a move.</i>

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,990
<i>RAY: If he starts
feeling her up,</i>

86
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,260
<i>I'm gonna go down there

<i>Don't know what to say, mate.</i>

<i>that started training at the gym
a couple of years ago</i>

124
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,770
<i>and Dad took him under his wing,
as he does...</i>

125
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,640
<i>..and he, um...</i>

126
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,010
<i>He got the old man to invest
in this business,</i>

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,890
<i>this tea, this Chinese tea,
a weight‐loss tea.</i>

128
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,420
<i>Mm.</i>

129
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,700
<i>So, he got him
to take out a loan,</i>

130
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,400
<i>put the gym up as collateral.</i>

131
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,780
<i>Anyway, turns out the tea
wasn't a weight‐loss tea.</i>

132
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,650
<i>It was a scam.</i>

133
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,320
<i>‐And he wants the gym?
‐Yeah.</i>

134
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,360
<i>Anything I can do?</i>

135
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,470
<i>Nah, mate. It's fine.
I'm taking care of it.</i>

136
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,150
<i>You gonna whack him?</i>

137
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,220
<i>Not me,
but the wheels are in motion.</i>

138
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,890
<i>‐You gonna pay somebody?
‐Already have.</i>

139
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,930
<i>‐How much?
‐30 K.</i>

140
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,040
<i>You gonna waste 30 grand

141
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,010
<i>Fuckin' oath.</i>

142
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,480
<i>Why should he get off scot‐free?
He should suffer.</i>

143
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,860
<i>‐Dead men don't suffer, mate.
‐Yeah, well...</i>

144
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,360
<i>I'll look into it, alright?</i>

145
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800

<i>Yeah, and, like, kiss and stuff
and then, um,</i>

332
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,900
<i>maybe we can sort of
rumble our way in to the couch,</i>

333
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,910
<i>into, like,
this sort of a position?</i>

334
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,550
<i>That.</i>

335
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,790
<i>Well,
at Naughty Boy Productions,</i>

336
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,690
<i>we like to customise the shoot
to your needs,</i>

337
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,730
<i>so it just depends on
what it is that you're after.</i>

338
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,070
<i>I mean, what kind of feel
are you after?</i>

339
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,410
<i>Do you want more of
a handheld doco style</i>

340
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,420
<i>or a bit more of
a Hollywood movie style feel?</i>

341
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,720
<i>Oh, God,
I hadn't thought about it.</i>

342
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,630
<i>Yeah, look, I mean, I...</i>

343
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,600
<i>I don't want anything that's
too sort of, you know, raw.</i>

344
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,770
<i>You know, something
a little bit more polished,</i>

345
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,940
<i>I think, would be good.</i>

346
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,750
<i>It's not like
your mum's seeing it.</i>

347
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,320
<i>A little bit raw's fine.</i>

348
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,060
<i>‐Polished?
‐Well, polished.</i>

349
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,400
<i>Polished it is.</i>

350
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,300
<i>Alright, well, um,
I'll work off the tripod.</i>

351
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,250
<i>Come on.</i>

352
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,860
<i>‐OK, come on.
‐Get this off.</i>

353
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,300
<i>Let's get this off, silly.</i>

354
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,480
<i>‐Hey, Gary.
‐Yeah.</i>

355
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,380
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

356
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,920
<i>Yeah, it's gonna be fun.</i>

357
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,990
<i>‐Yeah.
‐OK.</i>

358
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,960
<i>WOMAN: How are you today?
Nice to see you again.</i>

359
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,420
<i>Son?</i>

360
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,460
<i>‐Having a snooze?
‐Yes, I nodded off.</i>

361
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,530
<i>Just dropping your, uh...</i>

362
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,040
<i>..your clothes off
from your apartment.</i>

363
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,380
<i>Oh, yeah.
Thanks very much for that.</i>

364
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,280
<i>No worries, mate. Alright.
I'll catch you later, alright?</i>

365
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,250
<i>Son?</i>

366
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,300
<i>Can...can you stay for a bit?
Just a minute.</i>

367
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,570
<i>I've got a heap of stuff
I've got to do...</i>

368
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,010
<i>Please, just...</i>

369
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,220
<i>Please can you stay
for a minute?</i>

370
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,990
<i>Please.</i>

371
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,930
<i>Sit down. Please sit down.</i>

372
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,820
<i>So, you remember me today, huh?</i>

373
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,590
<i>Yeah, I'm having
a good day today.</i>

374
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,460
<i>That's good.</i>

375
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,610
<i>Look, there's something
I want to say,</i>

376
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,780
<i>and if I don't say it now,</i>

377
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,180
<i>I may not get another chance.</i>

378
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,460
<i>I just want to say I'm sorry.</i>

379
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,770
<i>I know...
it won't mean a whole lot...</i>

380
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,140
<i>..and I know
it won't change the past,</i>

381
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,250
<i>but when I came back
from Vietnam...</i>

382
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,390
<i>..I was messed up.</i>

383
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,030
<i>I came back here and people
were calling me a baby‐killer</i>

384
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,070
<i>and a murderer
and all that shit.</i>

385
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,610
<i>I came back to you proud, son.</i>

386
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,550
<i>I served my country</i>

387
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,360
<i>and I saw some things
over there...</i>

388
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,400
<i>I did some things,</i>

389
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,270
<i>things that I'm not proud of,</i>

390
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,610
<i>but you've got do what
you've got to do to survive.</i>

391
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,390
<i>I came back here
and I was just messed up.</i>

392
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
<i>They put me on medication</i>

393
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,270
<i>because I was suicidal
and I was angry.</i>

394
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,510
<i>I started drinking
while I was on the meds and...</i>

395
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,020
<i>..that just made me worse.</i>

396
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,830
<i>So, why'd you drink, then?</i>

397
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,840
<i>'Cause I couldn't cope.</i>

398
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,420
<i>Even with the meds,
I just could not cope.</i>

399
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,020
<i>Look, I'm not trying to
make excuses for what I did.</i>

400
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,060
<i>I'm just trying to explain
what happened.</i>

401
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,810
<i>I'm not dodging responsibility.</i>

402
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,980
<i>I just wish...</i>

403
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,400
<i>I just wish you had've
known me before I went to war.</i>

404
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,150
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

405
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,490
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
