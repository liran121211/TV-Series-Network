187
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,350

tried to talk to the guy,

188
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,670

191
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,470
Yeah.

192
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,820

193

194
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,810

220

were, like, in their 20s.

223
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,930
I was walking down the street
with me daughter and...

224
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,110
these two guys come
along, bumped into her,

225
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,790
and she had an ice cream, and...

226
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,849
you know, dropped her ice cream and...

227
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,390
So you assaulted him?

228
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,550
Well...

229
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,060
no, they started... then
they started swearing...

230
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,570
and she's only eight, so...

231
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,710
So you bashed him...

232
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,430
while your daughter was
just standing there?

233
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,340
No, not while she was standing there.

234
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,230

239

241
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,090

244

So can you remind me again
what that reason was?

245
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,210
