1
00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:10,475
CAITLYN: Okay. It's,
like, 4:32 in the morning.

2
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:14,067
And I can't sleep.

3
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:18,143
God, I look in the
monitor, I look like crap.

4
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:21,360
I, anyway... I... I feel bad that

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,576
these... especially young people...

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,600
are going through such a
difficult time in their life.

7
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:30,047
We don't want people dying over this.

8
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:32,983
We don't want people
murdered over this stuff.

9
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:35,448
What a responsibility I have...

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,909
towards this community. Am I
going to do everything right?

11
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:40,429
Am I gonna say the right things?

12
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:42,678
Do I project the right image?

13
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:46,183
My mind's just spinning with thoughts.

14
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,480
I just hope I get it right.

15
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,791
I hope I get it right.

16
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:52,676
Yeah.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,048
- CAITLYN: <i>Vanity Fair</i> is out!
- (People cheering, applauding)

18
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:08,015
Look at that cover, baby!

19
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:10,829
REPORTER: We begin with the world's
introduction to Caitlyn Jenner.

20
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,463
- COURTNEY: Yeah! (Whoops)
- CAITLYN: Shh, shh!

21
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,963
REPORTER: Former Olympian Bruce Jenner

22
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:18,154
confirmed her transition to a woman
on the cover of <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,158
<i>Jenner first talked about her transition
in an interview with Diane Sawyer,</i>

24
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,328
<i>saying we can meet her</i> soon.

25
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:30,607
CAITLYN: I don't think I have
ever been more excited about life

26
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,797
than I am right now.

27
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:36,090
Living my true identity.

28
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,203
Um, and hopefully, going to
make a difference in the world.

29
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,455
That's my mission.

30
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,586
REPORTER: Khloe Kardashian
tweeted this morning:

31
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,839
"We were given this life because
you were strong enough to live it.

32
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,483
I couldn't be prouder.
Caitlyn, you are beautiful."

33
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,138
ROB: Your cover looks amazing.

34
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:58,508
- CAITLYN: Isn't that rockin'?
- ROB: So good, yeah, you look

35
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:01,156
- amazing and everything.
- CAITLYN: It's so good to hear from you.

36
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:02,537
Kim?

37
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:04,953
KIM: You didn't tell
me you were on Twitter.

38
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,196
CAITLYN: I've been on Twitter for an hour.

39
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:10,410
KIM: Well, the head of Twitter just said,

40
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:15,383
"We think Caitlyn could
break President Obama's gained

41
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:19,206
follower record one million
within the first five hours."

42
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:22,590
CAITLYN: Well, let's go.
Okay! Let's go for the record!

43
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:24,488
I love records!

44
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,765
At this point, what's the total amount?

45
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:29,672
- KIM: 720,000.
- CAITLYN: No!

46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,617
RONDA: In two hours.

47
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,259
CAITLYN: In two hours.
We're going for the record.

48
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:37,213
KIM: Just wanted you to
know I'm on the bandwagon.

49
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:41,011
CAITLYN: Yay! Thank
you for all the support.

50
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:43,128
- KIM: Of course, of course.
- CAITLYN: All right.

51
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:46,294
KIM: All eyes on you now.
You cannot disappoint.

52
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:48,944
CAITLYN: I know. No, it's got to be good.

53
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:52,602
The tremendous amount of
support that I've gotten

54
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,666
has been overwhelming.

55
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:57,341
But you also have to realize that,

56
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,783
uh, it's not this way for everybody.

57
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:03,959
There are so many people

58
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,081
that have struggled with family;

59
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,812
who struggle with friends;
who struggle with ridicule;

60
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,316
who are not having financial resources.

61
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:19,114
The suicide rate nine times higher

62
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,205
in the trans community
than in the general public.

63
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,728
Murder rate's higher.

64
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,256
This is a really important issue.

65
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:28,401
People are dying over this issue.

66
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:33,450
I feel a tremendous responsibility here.

67
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,163
Because I have a voice and there's so

68
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,585
many trans people out there

69
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:41,909
who do not have a voice.

70
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,581
I can't speak for them, because
everybody has their own experience,

71
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,559
but I am an expert

72
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,497
on my story.

73
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:53,849
- WOMAN: Cheers to Caitlyn.
- CAITLYN: Out two weeks, yeah!

74
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:55,809
There's so much to learn,

75
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:57,562
so many people to meet.

76
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:01,604
WOMAN: Your transformation has
helped me to understand my father.

77
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,888
CAITLYN: I've lived a great life.

78
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,045
And I realize, in this transition,

79
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,337
- that I have that privileged status.
- (Crowd clamoring)

80
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:13,578
But I hope that I'm in a
position to turn around...

81
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:15,755
Yay! ... And help this community.

82
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,821
Hi, everybody. I want to
spotlight those organizations

83
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,197
that are out there doing
some really good things.

84
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:24,508
BOY: Being around friends is
really nice when you haven't

85
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,539
- been around friends for most of your life.
- CAITLYN: Well, you got friends here.

86
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,019
But also I have to
figure out my own journey.

87
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,548
Now I know why girls need a sports bra.

88
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,619
There's a lot of firsts out there for me.

89
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:39,287
My entire family have not met Caitlyn.

90
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,491
- KIM: Hi.
- CAITLYN: Hi, babe.

91
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:44,186
I want to be able to make
friends in the trans community.

92
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,754
- WOMAN: Everybody on Jenner.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah.

93
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:50,564
And I have to figure out how I'm
going to live the rest of my life.

94
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,051
KYLIE: I love you.

95
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,430
CAITLYN (crying): I want them
to be proud of their daddy.

96
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:02,433
ANNOUNCER: Bruce Jenner has a
commanding lead in the home stretch.

97
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:06,900
Bruce Jenner has the world
record in the decathlon.

98
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:16,922
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

99
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,985
CAITLYN: My mother's coming today.

100
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,784
Um...

101
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,210
I don't know what it is.

102
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,304
I was able to tell
everybody in my family first,

103
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:39,547
before I ever got to my mom.

104
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,515
It's so important, during this transition,

105
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:46,524
that you surround yourself
with positive people.

106
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,732
How you doing in there, Ronda?

107
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:50,036
RONDA: I'm good, I got
three outfits for you.

108
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:51,918
- CAITLYN: All right.
- RONDA: That you can pick from.

109
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:55,704
CAITLYN: Years ago, I confided in Ronda.

110
00:05:55,728 --> 00:06:00,170
And she really has been a
friend that has supported me.

111
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,806
Combined with Courtney,

112
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:04,112
I've really got a great support group.

113
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,938
It... it, from that standpoint, it's...

114
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,587
I'm... I'm blessed.

115
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:08,995
RONDA: They just landed. So...

116
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,853
do you want me to start
looking in the clotet

117
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,399
- for things that you can wear?
- CAITLYN: Uh, I don't know.

118
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,482
I don't think I can be too...

119
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,174
you know,

120
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,258
in "la femme" mode.

121
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,109
- It's got to be kind of, yeah, right.
- RONDA: No dressy dress.

122
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,609
CAITLYN: No, I... I already told them:

123
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,159
you're coming down to meet Caitlyn.

124
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:26,193
COURTNEY: I've never
seen you actually nervous.

125
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:28,874
CAITLYN: Well, it's my mother... God.

126
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,487
PAM: Mom hasn't had her children together

127
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,623
- since her birthday party, four years ago.
- ESTHER: That's right.

128
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,735
PAM: So this is, this is very special.

129
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,465
- ESTHER: And I think... (Esther laughs)
- PAM: In many ways.

130
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,981
CAITLYN: Sleeves up or down?

131
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,444
- Let's me see.
- RONDA: Slightly up.

132
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,375
- CAITLYN: What about a necklace?
- COURTNEY: Do you...

133
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,810
I mean, should we button it one more up

134
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,122
- just 'cause it's Mom?
- RONDA: Yeah, it's Mom.

135
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,922
LISA: When everything first broke,

136
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:06,286
it was difficult because I had known

137
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:11,402
my brother as, you know, Bruce,
this amazing athlete, for,

138
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:15,221
you know, all of my life...
and, I guess the whole family

139
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:18,196
has to change along with... with her.

140
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,878
ESTHER: When you're in the
grocery store, to see these

141
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:24,953
tabloid magazines and all the things
that they come out with, with...

142
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,436
you know...

143
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,088
PRODUCER: So, what was your
reaction when you found out?

144
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,769
ESTHER: I think I was silent.

145
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,879
PAM: He confided in me over 30 years ago.

146
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:40,060
ESTHER: You thought maybe he
was... uh, getting over it?

147
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,791
PAM: Because the subject
never came up again.

148
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:44,697
- ESTHER: Yeah.
- PAM: I thought

149
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:48,237
it was something that maybe
counseling would help him with.

150
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:52,364
Then, about two years ago,
he started talking to me about

151
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,579
wanting to live an authentic life.

152
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,365
CAITLYN: Now, here's the question.

153
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,497
- RONDA: What?
- CAITLYN: I'm signing the birthday card for Mother...

154
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:03,886
RONDA: I bought you two!

155
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,290
- CAITLYN: How do I sign it?
- COURTNEY: In case you mess up.

156
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:06,756
RONDA: You got two. (Laughs)

157
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:10,366
COURTNEY: You're Caitlyn.
This is the life you're living.

158
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:13,076
CAITLYN (sing-songy): Scary.

159
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:16,094
PAM: He... he felt like
he needed to follow through

160
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:20,435
on his desires and to go, actually, public,

161
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:23,264
um, and discuss the issue.

162
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:26,566
I initially discouraged him.

163
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:30,187
I... I didn't understand
how that could work.

164
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,462
(Esther sighs)

165
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,748
CAITLYN: It's kind of tough to
tell your mother all these secrets.

166
00:08:41,944 --> 00:08:44,097
You always have doubts in your mind

167
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:47,111
of how that first impression
is going to work out.

168
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:49,084
You want it to be so good.

PAM: I was quite apprehensive.

187
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:56,854
I knew she would be d... different looking.

188
00:09:57,383 --> 00:10:01,982
Uh, and I was hoping that she
would have the same personality,

189
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,678
uh, as Bruce. And she does.

190
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:08,950
And she's so relaxed and so happy.

191
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,972
That makes me very happy.

after, what has it been,

194
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,695
- 35 years we've talked about this?
- PAM: Yes, about that long.

195
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,324
- CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah, I know.
- PAM: About that long.

196

CAITLYN: Back that long. I know.

could sit down and talk about that.

201

ESTHER: You hid it very well.

202
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,305
CAITLYN: I did. I was a
professional at hiding it.

203
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,334
- PAM: I guess so.
- ESTHER: It is

204
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,980
overwhelming. I guess
I've been preparing myself.

205
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,653
Uh...

206
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,487
I knew he was going to be...

207
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,572
dressed...

208
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,608
as a woman.

00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,147
Uh...

210
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:59,848
I think he's a very good-looking woman.

211
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:03,686

- ESTHER: And yes.

It's... it's...

217
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:24,690
- a lot to get used to.
- PRODUCER: Mm-hmm. Of course.

218
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,811
- It's a surprise.
- ESTHER: But I will.

219
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,491
- PRODUCER: Yes.
- ESTHER: I will.

220
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:39,001
PAM: I was asking Bruce how did
he come up with the name Caitlyn.

221
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,710
CAITLYN: I kind of narrowed it down

222
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:43,077
to a few of them,
Caitlyn being one of them.

223
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:45,230
And I actually was with Ronda.

224
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,951
When I was talking to her

225
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:48,587
about this whole thing about two years ago,

226
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:51,278
she goes, "Well, you know, I always
liked the name Caitlyn." And I went...

227
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:53,767
at some point, you just have
to kind of bite the bullet...

228
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:57,270
and say, "Okay, boom. It's done."

229
00:11:57,294 --> 00:12:01,510
But talking to other trans
people, they said a good way

230
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,596
to get your female name...

231
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:05,755
is to...

232
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:08,151
ask your mother.

233
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:09,358
I'm sure

234
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,691
when you didn't know

235
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:12,241
- there was a boy or a girl...
- ESTHER: Mm-hmm.

236
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,747
CAITLYN: ... you had names for

237
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:15,972
a boy name, and you had a girl name.

238
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,072
- I don't know if you remember.
- PAM: Do you remember?

239
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,951
- ESTHER: I don't remember.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

240
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:22,509
ESTHER: And I'm sure I did
have two different names picked.

241
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:23,901
- (Cell phone rings)
- PAM: Did you have a boy's name

242
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,195
picked out for me?

243
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,590
- CAITLYN: Hi, baby.
- KYLIE: Hey, Daddy.

244
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,444
CAITLYN: Am I on FaceTime with you?

245
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:34,796
Kylie has not met Caitlyn
yet. And she FaceTimes me.

And there I am. I didn't
know it was coming on.

Um, don't want to scare you.

248
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:39,808
You just woke up? Where are you?

249
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,456
KYLIE: The dentist.

250
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:44,161
CAITLYN: Oh, you just
woke up at the dentist.

251
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:46,071
Are you feeling okay?

252
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:48,250
KYLIE: I'm a little loopy.

never...

had my first experience
with somebody on FaceTime.

256
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:57,718
To be honest with you,
I didn't know what to do.

257
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:00,157
Like, do I turn it away? Or, you know...

258
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,222
I... I... uh... I don't know... I
was kind of shocked, when I thought...

There's an expert in
town named Susan Landon.

267

She's coming up...

questions that you might have.

270
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,405
CAITLYN: Yeah, okay, we'll
have a great conversation.

271
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,174

272
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:38,761
- CAITLYN: Susan, baby, how you doing? Hello.

00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,846
- CAITLYN: I am great.
- SUSAN: Good.

274
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:41,869
- CAITLYN: So good to see you.
- SUSAN: You too.

275
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,372
- CAITLYN: Thanks for coming out.
- SUSAN: Thank you for asking me.

276
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:47,442
CAITLYN: I know. Susan works with families.

277
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:52,111
Uh, Mom has said, on numerous
occasions, "I need to know more."

278
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,863
SUSAN: Well, you can
ask me whatever you want.

279
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,414
CAITLYN: Let's take... Let's go in here
and sit down, so we can relax and...

280
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:57,899
SUSAN and ESTHER: Okay.

281
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:02,055
SUSAN: There's nothing more
important than acceptance, support.

282
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,545
This takes time in some families.

283
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:07,917
But the other thing to remember
is that it's a process over time.

284
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:11,574
ESTHER: I hate to brag, but I
have some beautiful children.

285
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,127
- Where's Pam? There she is.
- CAITLYN: Some getting prettier.

286
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,628
ESTHER: Yes, I... I know.

287
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:17,901
CAITLYN: Yeah, I know. I know.

288
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,194
Yeah, some getting... a little prettier.

289
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,275
All right, just stay on point.
Since we have Susan here,

290
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:26,952
the big question is: have
you ever seen anybody...

291
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,740
like, get over it and get cured of this?

292
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,876
SUSAN: Uh, me personally, no, I have not.

293
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:36,231
CAITLYN: Yeah, I know. It's
just kind of the way you're born.

294
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,503
- ESTHER: You know how little boys outgrow their clothes?
- SUSAN: Yes.

295
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,650
ESTHER: I took you to a store, and

296
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:46,167
- you did not want those clothes on you.
- (Caitlyn laughs)

297
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,056
You were trying to pull them off of you.

298
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:50,839
And I was trying to get them on you.

299
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,966
And you didn't want them. And I thought,

300
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,285
"He just doesn't want new clothes."

301
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,765
Would that have been in his person,

302
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,753
then, that he would
rather have had a dress?

303
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,730
SUSAN: Oh, absolutely.
Let's say for a minute that

304
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,752
that's what he would
have preferred to wear...

305
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:08,393
- sorry. She.
- CAITLYN: It's quite all right.

306
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:09,633
SUSAN: I meant "he" then.

307
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:12,088
- CAITLYN: You got it.
- SUSAN: <i>... she</i> would have preferred to wear.

308
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,498
'Cause pronouns are really
important, everybody.

309
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:18,583
So if that, at that point,

310
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:21,259
is what she had wanted to have,

311
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:23,296
she probably wasn't able to pick it,

312
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:26,075
okay? And then, when children get older,

313
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:29,302
they notice the reactions of other people.

314
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:31,534
- ESTHER: But they, the...
- SUSAN: They start taking in information...

315
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:34,155
like, "This probably isn't gonna be okay",

316
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:36,703
- "so I better fit in."
- ESTHER: Yeah.

317
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:40,653
SUSAN: And if anybody tried
to fit in more than you,

318
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,093
- I don't know who it was.
- CAITLYN: I did a good job, yeah.

319
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:43,866
(Laughter)

320
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,324
ESTHER: But the child
has no idea <i>why</i>

321
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,954
their reaction is that way.
For instance, the clothes.

322
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,123
SUSAN: But by the time they're about five,

323
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,865
they start figuring it out.

324
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,920
ESTHER: Now, I'm sure you've
read the passage in the Bible

325
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,445
about if you dress...

326
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,461
if you're a man and you dress
like a woman, you know...

327
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:05,222
SUSAN: Yeah.

328
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,878
ESTHER: Do you have any,
uh, interpretation of that?

329
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:14,419
SUSAN: Um... I'm not a biblical
scholar, so I don't know exactly

330
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,085
what that verse represented
to people at the time,

331
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:20,548
obviously, but for me, personally,

332
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,136
Caitlyn <i>is</i> a woman,
and really always has been.

333
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,699
- PAM: Be gentle, please.
- CAITLYN: What?

334
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,928
- PAM: I said, be gentle.
- CAITLYN: Oh, my God, I'm gonna be gentle.

335
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:41,993
You know I've always been gentle with you.

336
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,175
This one's a little...
higher strike. You don't care.

337
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:46,359
(Pam laughs)

338
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,221
- Let's do it.
- PAM: Okay.

339
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,803
CAITLYN: What do you do with the balls?

340
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,408
- Guys, we got pockets.
- (Pam laughs)

341
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:53,317
Ready?

342
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:58,917
- Bad start.
- PAM: One point.

343
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:00,617
CAITLYN: Take it easy on me, Sis.

344
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:01,656
Here it comes.

345
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:02,659
PAM: Ooh!

346
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,366
- (Pam laughs)
- CAITLYN: God, come on.

347
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,073
It's great... to be able
to base with your family

348
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,326
a relationship

349
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:15,210
on honesty. I mean, I am... so happy,

350
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,853
uh, the way this whole process has begun.

351
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:21,533
PAM: I know we talked about

352
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:23,493
you and your straight guy friends...

353
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:25,512
you haven't really met yet.

354
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,983
CAITLYN: Honestly, I've come out
to all the girls, you're right.

355
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,011
- PAM: And everybody's...
- CAITLYN: I think it's just harder

356
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:33,971
for... I don't know. My guy
friends... what do you think?

357
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:35,392
PAM: I think they're gonna be

358
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,482
much more supportive than you think.

359
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,944
They're gonna meet Caitlyn
and they're gonna say,

360
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:43,570
"Same personality."

361
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:46,674
CAITLYN: But I don't know if they
get it, I don't know if guys get that.

362
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:48,302
PAM: Hold on, I'm getting warm.

363
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,106
CAITLYN: I don't know, girls
just seem to be easier, you know?

364
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,970
- PAM: Yes, we are.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

365
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:55,285
Oh, we are... don't start bragging on me.

366
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:57,360
Let's go, get over there, I'll show you.

367
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,567
PAM: See how I hit 'em
right to you, to be nice?

368
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:02,156
- Oops.
- CAITLYN: Hup, I got it!

369
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,642
PAM: Oh, it's legal, it's legal.

370
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,600
Uh-oh. I... aah!

371
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,606
(Pam laughs)

372
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:08,694
I love it.

373
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:11,380
CAITLYN: Now I know why
girls need a sports bra.

374
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,274
- (Pam laughs)
- When you start running,

375
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,276
- it gets a little tougher, doesn't it?
- PAM: Yeah.

376
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:16,309
Get in.

377
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,464
- CAITLYN: The hair got in my eyes again.
- (Pam laughing)

378
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,644
Bruce was a lot better
tennis player than Caitlyn is.

379
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:24,381
- PAM: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Okay?

380
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,447
- PAM: It was fun.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, it was fun.

381
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,498
It was fun.

382
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:38,554
(indistinct chatter)
(footsteps approaching)

383
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:41,659
- KYLIE: Hello?!
- PAM: Oh, my goodness.

384
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:45,845
- I haven't seen you in so long.
- KYLIE: Hey, Aunt Lisa.

385
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,256
- LISA: How are you?
- KYLIE: Good.

386
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,003
- LISA: You look so pretty.
- KYLIE: Oh, thank you.

387
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:52,180
MADDIE: Aah! I've missed you.

388
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,217
KYLIE: I missed you. Where's my dad?

389
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:56,009
MADDIE: He's in there.

390
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:59,944
KYLIE: I do want to meet her.

391
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:04,123
It'll be a little
uncomfortable in the beginning.

392
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:07,025
But I think we're both ready.

393
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:11,364
- Hey, pretty.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, I know, I know... Hey, baby!

394
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,179
I didn't know you were here.

395
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,019
- KYLIE: You look so pretty.
- CAITLYN: Where did you just sneak in?

396
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:15,890
KYLIE: Hey, Grandma.

397
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:18,619
- CAITLYN: Little Kylie made it.
- ESTHER: Oh, my... (kisses)

398
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,636
- CAITLYN: Mom's in the chair.
- KYLIE: How are you?

399
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,055
- Are you getting pretty?
- ESTHER: I'm having fun.

400
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,913
- KYLIE: Oh, yay.
- ESTHER: I have a little present for you.

401
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,178
KYLIE: I'm excited.

402
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:29,313
CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay, you want to do it?

403
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,167
- ESTHER: Okay.
- CAITLYN: Okay, come on.

404
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:32,992
(Esther chuckles) CAITLYN: Okay...

405
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:34,572
ESTHER: I thought... I
thought you should have this.

406
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,677
It's me when I was 17.

407
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:40,259
- KYLIE: Oh, my God.
- CAITLYN: When she was your age.

408
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,712
KYLIE: Wait, we kind of look alike.

409
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,762
- ESTHER: We do kind of look alike, don't we?
- CAITLYN: I know, you do.

410
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:45,430
KYLIE: I definitely take the Jenner side,

411
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,384
- 'cause...
- CAITLYN: And here's the kicker:

412
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:48,785
she was 17 years old in this picture...

413
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:50,936
- ESTHER: Married to...
- CAITLYN: ... and she was married.

414
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,236
- ESTHER: And...
- KYLIE: Kind of like... kind of like me.

415
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,973
CAITLYN: Uh, uh, but, you...
I better not hear that from you.

416
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,093
Yes, yes, yes. My big concern,
obviously, from the beginning...

417
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:01,661
besides all the rest of the kids...

418
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:03,763
is Kendall and Kylie. Isn't that cool?

419
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:06,494
KYLIE: I love it. So pretty.

420
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:08,877
CAITLYN: Once it was
out there, they saw the

421
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:12,876
support that I was getting,
especially in the celebrity world.

422
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,518
From the Lady Gagas of the world
to Miley Cyrus to Elton John.

423
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:21,331
To see their support, I think
it really made my kids feel...

424
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,129
especially Kylie...
that it's gonna be okay.

425
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:26,057
SPENCER: How's Kenny?

426
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,968
- KYLIE: She's good, I don't know, she's so busy.
- CAITLYN: She's in Cannes right now.

427
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,958
- KYLIE: Let me see your hair.
- CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

428
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:34,443
- KYLIE: You should get extensions.
- CAITLYN: Oh, we would never use extensions, would we?

429
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:35,032
KYLIE: No.

430
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,649
CAITLYN: No, not in a
million years, would we?

431
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,802
KYLIE: Where are the ones that I gave you?

432
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:38,936
CAITLYN: Uh, in the other room.

433
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,128
- KYLIE: I want to put them in.
- CAITLYN: Okay.

434
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:43,482
I got no problem with Kylie.

435
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:45,701
After the first five minutes,
it's like, "All right... "

436
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,019
it's Caitlyn... big deal."

437
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,899
KYLIE: I was, like, looking
at Google pictures of you

438
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,733
when I was trying to pick the hair
color, and then you dyed it on me.

439
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,028
(All laugh)

440
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:55,327
- ESTHER: Does it match your eyes?
- COURTNEY: Don't look, don't look!

441
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:56,662
- CAITLYN: Sorry.
- (All laugh)

442
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:59,127
- I almost peeked, I'm sorry.
- COURTNEY: Don't ruin it.

443
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,454
CAITLYN: Isn't this more fun than
sitting around talking about sports?

444
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:04,947
- KYLIE: Mm-hmm.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, that's what I thought.

445
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,613
- SPENCER: Or watching golf.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, or watching golf.

446
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,270
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

447
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:11,252
- KYLIE: Or playing golf?
- CAITLYN: Or playing golf.

448
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,944
Well, I don't know if
I can go quite that far.

449
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,801
- COURTNEY: Look at yourself, look.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, wait, wait...

450
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:15,955
Kylie.

451
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,951
- SPENCER: I know, right?
- Look how long it is.

452
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,169
- KYLIE: Lean back.
- ESTHER: Wow.

453
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,741
- KYLIE: Look.
- CAITLYN: Could be Caitlyn's first post.

454
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:25,584
And they would never know who it is.

455
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:27,462
- SPENCER: They'd be, like, "Oh!"
- KYLIE: What do you want to say?

456
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,378
CAITLYN: A good friend

457
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:30,341
modeling my new extensions,
or something like that.

458
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:31,828
KYLIE: I don't want to say "a good friend."

459
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:33,422
- CAITLYN: Okay, uh...
- RONDA: My dad?

460
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:35,256
- CAITLYN: My dad?
- (Everyone laughs)

461
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:38,487
CAITLYN: Having that opportunity to
just be honest with your family...

462
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,333
it's like somebody taking

463
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,493
a thousand pounds off my shoulders.

464
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:46,857
Besides, most people, once they
meet Caitlyn, they go, "Oh, my God,

465
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:48,758
she's more fun than Bruce " ever was."

466
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:51,596
- KYLIE: I love you.
- CAITLYN: Okay, I love you, too.

467
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:54,373
And everything's gonna be good.

468
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:57,075
- KYLIE: I'll see you tomorrow.
- CAITLYN: I appreciate you coming out and being understanding.

469
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:58,424
- KYLIE: Of course, I love you.
- CAITLYN: Good.

470
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:00,243
- Bye, buddy.
- KYLIE: Bye!

471
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,008
CAITLYN: All these pants
I'll never use again.

472
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,503
PAM: Yeah, where'd you
put the other hangers?

473
00:22:15,623 --> 00:22:16,757
- Are they underneath?
- CAITLYN: I don't know.

474
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,713
Here's the question...
I hate to say it, but...

475
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:23,698
- what the hell was Bruce thinking?
- PAM: (laughs)

476
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,678
You prob... it was probably
a Christmas present.

477
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:28,262
CAITLYN: That is one ugly shirt.

478
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,803
Considering I've had all these
clothes down here for six months,

479
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,292
I guess I really don't need
anything that's here, right?

480
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:36,108
- PAM: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Yeah. Anyway,

481
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,843
how's Mom doing?

482
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,126
PAM: She hasn't said a
word to me, privately.

483
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:45,729
- CAITLYN: Really?
- PAM: Yeah, no, I think she's... she's...

484
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:49,935
- CAITLYN: I just, you know, sit here and...
- PAM: Wonder.

485
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:52,838
CAITLYN: Yeah, I wonder.
Everybody's very positive

486
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,558
and everybody feels really
good about all this stuff,

487
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:58,922
but, you know, I'm kind of waiting.

488
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,452
PAM: And you're waiting for?

489
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:03,463
CAITLYN: Well, I'm waiting
for, you know, Mom to go...

490
00:23:03,478 --> 00:23:06,321
in a quiet time... "Oh,
my God, what's happening?"

491
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,962
Even Kylie coming over
today... you never know,

492
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,500
you know, when they get away from
here and they go home, they go,

493
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,352
"Oh, my God, that was so
strange." I mean, she has not

494
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,600
- met Caitlyn. She was kind of shocked.
- PAM: Kylie hadn't?

495
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,946
CAITLYN: No, no. She would never come over.

496
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,840
- PAM: I didn't know that.
- CAITLYN: I would invite her over

497
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,291
and this and that, she would never come.

498
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:23,817
Khloe hasn't been here.

499
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,522
Kourtney hasn't been here,
hasn't met Caitlyn. Um...

500
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:29,932
- Rob.
- PAM: No?

501
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,732
CAITLYN: You know? Maybe...

502
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,056
them not being around is, you know,

503
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:40,282
kind of their way of saying, "I don't know
if I really agree with this" or what or...

504
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:42,170
You know, they keep
saying to me, openly, that,

505
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:44,610
"Everybody's great, it's great,
we want you to live your life."

506
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:46,215
And then they never show up.

507
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,410
So you know something else
is going on in their head.

508
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:51,657
You know, for most people,

509
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:55,411
dealing with something like this,
there's a lot of families that just are...

510
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,743
- PAM: Torn apart, I'm sure.
- CAITLYN: Torn apart by it, you know?

511
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:01,635
Um, I don't want to tear my family apart.

512
00:24:10,697 --> 00:24:13,854
Now that Pam and Lisa have
gone, we can actually talk.

513
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:14,752
ESTHER: I know.

514
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,074
CAITLYN: I know, that's kind of nice.

515
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,086
ESTHER: I really didn't
want to go to the beach.

516
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,761
CAITLYN: This beach down here... it's a...
a lo... tough walk to get down to the beach,

517
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:23,276
'cause you got to walk down that... Yeah.

518
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:25,584
ESTHER: As you are right
now, as I look at you...

519
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:26,129
CAITLYN: Right.

520
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,721
ESTHER: You look so much like someone

521
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:32,003
in my family, and I was
trying to figure it out.

522
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:32,959
CAITLYN: Um,

523
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:35,572
I think I look like myself, Mom.

524
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:36,170
ESTHER: Huh.

525
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:38,053
CAITLYN: Because the most
important thing in life

526
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,347
is that you're true to
yourself, and I'm doing

527
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,341
better now than I've ever
done before in my life,

528
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:43,142
you know?

529
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,202
ESTHER: It's going to
be so difficult for me...

530
00:24:47,495 --> 00:24:51,206
to c... to think of you as "she"

531
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,261
and to say "Caitlyn"

532
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:56,657
when I want to speak with you

533
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,885
or call your attention or... you know...

534
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,327
"Hey, Caitlyn" instead of "Hey, Bruce."

535
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:11,773
I don't think... It's not easy.

536
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:16,031
- It's not easy.
- CAITLYN: No, it's not easy.

537
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,229
What aspect is it not easy?

538
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,491
Losing a son?

539
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,422
ESTHER: I don't think... it's not easy.

540
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:44,929
- It's not easy.
- CAITLYN: No, it's not easy.

541
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:50,424
What aspect is it not easy?

542
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,613
Losing a son?

543
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:57,754
ESTHER: The problem before with you and I,

544
00:25:58,294 --> 00:26:01,228
I... I'm guessing this...

545
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:04,942
you felt uncomfortable with me.

546
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:08,275
We would see each other, and it
was like you wanted to get away.

547
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:10,452
CAITLYN: At that point in my life,

548
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:13,581
I was very much an isolationist.

549
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:16,164
I would isolate myself from the world

550
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:18,611
on many, many, many, many occasions.

551
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:21,387
'Cause I never felt like I fit in anywhere.

552
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:23,295
I didn't fit in with the male side,

553
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:25,234
I didn't fit in with the female side.

554
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:26,714
You're kind of stuck in the middle.

555
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:30,975
I feel like Caitlyn fits in
a lot better into society,

556
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:33,114
uh, than Bruce ever did, 'cause Bruce,

557
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:35,257
uh, had to lie about
all that sort of stuff,

558
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,681
where Caitlyn's kind of got a place.

559
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:39,063
ESTHER: But Bruce will always be in there.

560
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,699
Your values are always gonna be the same.

561
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:42,951
CAITLYN: Oh, same.

562
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,882
- I'm still the same person.
- ESTHER: That's not changing.

563
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:46,036
That's your soul.

564
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:48,042
CAITLYN: Yeah, that's your
soul... that's exactly right.

565
00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:51,078
ESTHER: You... you have the
same soul you were born with.

566
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:52,031
CAITLYN: Yeah.

567
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,181
ESTHER: I love Bruce.

568
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:58,807
It'll never change.

569
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,412
That'll never change.

570
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,619
It's going to take some getting used to.

571
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:10,873
But I want... I want to do what he wants.

572
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:14,685
CAITLYN: And the response has been very
good, so that even makes it better, you know?

573
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,481
If the response was,

574
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,455
"Oh, my God, what a weirdo,"

575
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,128
uh, it would be a lot more difficult. But

576
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:24,605
people have really been behind my honesty,

577
00:27:24,655 --> 00:27:26,568
and I really appreciate that.

578
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:28,899
I'm very optimistic about the future,

579
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,798
and I'm dragging you along with me.

580
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:32,771
ESTHER: (chuckles) Okay.

581
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,410
- CAITLYN: Okay, good, good.
- ESTHER: Okay.

582
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,053
CAITLYN: Here's my attitude,

583
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:37,766
when you go through what I'm going through,

584
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,202
it affects a lot of people.

585
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:43,113
My entire family kind of
has to go through this...

586
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,398
called "transition."

587
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:47,438
And all those things will
be worked out in time.

588
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:48,505
All right.

589
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,042
Maybe I should get this
wild color hair out.

590
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,377
Right now, what I want to
do is just be able to create

591
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:59,101
understanding so the next person
doesn't have to be like me.

592
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,959
We have to be able to reach out,

593
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:04,320
one soul at a time,

594
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:06,602
and figure this problem out.

595
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,369
REPORTER: Kyler Prescott,
a local transgender teen,

596
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:14,030
- has taken his own life...
- CAITLYN: Another suicide.

597
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:17,576
REPORTER: ... making this the third
suicide of a transgender youth this year.

598
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:21,129
His mother spoke out in
an emotional interview.

599
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,522
KATHARINE: I think the world was kind of
too hard a place for such a gentle soul.

600
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:27,430
He didn't understand cruelty.

601
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,408
He didn't understand

602
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:31,513
people that didn't understand him.

603
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:34,081
(Sighs) It's tough.

604
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:37,175
He would fill the house
with his piano music,

605
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,587
and the house has just been silent,

606
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:43,724
um, since he left. The music stopped.

607
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:46,341
LISA: Wow.

608
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:47,805
CAITLYN: That's the problem.

609
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,579
That's... that's the
problem that we have here

610
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,370
is it happens all the time.

611
00:28:56,795 --> 00:29:01,026
Suicide is a permanent solution
for a very temporary problem,

612
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,529
and most of the ones that are at
risk are these young kids, okay?

613
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,205
- ESTHER: They're... they're still children.
- CAITLYN: Got their whole life ahead of 'em.

614
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:10,673
It just doesn't need to
happen. That kind of hit home.

615
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:14,747
I know how these kids can feel.

616
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:19,422
I've had some very dark moments in my life.

617
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,847
I have been in my house...

618
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:25,797
with a gun and said...

619
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,270
Let's just end it right here.

620
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:32,380
"Um, no more pain, no more suffering."

621
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:36,325
That struggle...

622
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:39,188
it's real.

623
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:41,066
And I've been there.

624
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,704
- Hello!
- Hey.

625
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:53,669
- Look who's here!
- KIM: You look beautiful.

626
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:55,100
CAITLYN: Well, thank you very much...

627
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,245
- not as good as you. Good to see you.
- KANYE: What up?

628
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:58,907
CAITLYN: Good to see
you. Thanks. Come on in.

629
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,383
- Welcome to my home.
- KIM: Hi.

630
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,626
- PAM: Long time no see.
- CAITLYN: Sister Pam.

631
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,879
- PAM: We know each other.
- CAITLYN: My older sister.

632
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:06,935
- PAM: We haven't met. Nice to meet you.
- KANYE: Hey, how are you?

633
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:09,929
CAITLYN: Kanye and I have
never really been very close,

634
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:12,434
but, um, I love his open-mindedness,

635
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:14,977
and I love how he's helped Kim

636
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:17,125
come to grips with what's going on. K

637
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:18,749
IM: You look beautiful.

638
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:20,549
You know, the one thing
I'm really shocked about

639
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,735
is how skinny...

640
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,740
you are. You literally look like Kendall.

641
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:27,287
- Like Kendall's mom.
- (Laughter)

642
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:29,280
KANYE: I mean, I think
this is one of the strongest

643
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,128
things that have happened in our,

644
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,337
you know, existence as human beings

645
00:30:33,342 --> 00:30:35,384
that are so controlled by perception.

646
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:38,292
'Cause you couldn't have
been up against more.

647
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:39,867
Like, your daughter's a supermodel.

648
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:42,572
You're a celebrity. You
have every type of thing,

649
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:45,115
and it was still like, "(bleep) everybody.

650
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:46,414
his is who I am."

651
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,977
- CAITLYN: This is all good.
- KIM: This is just the beginning.

652
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:50,791
- CAITLYN: This is all good.
- KIM: Just the beginning.

653
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,385
ESTHER: Are you gonna take your coat off?

654
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,021
I want to see what you're wearing.

655
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:55,981
KIM: Oh, nothing hardly fits anymore,

656
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:58,428
so it's, like, a half-zipped-up skirt.

657
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,786
- ESTHER: I read that you're expecting.
- PAM: That's right.

658
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:03,448
- KIM: Yes. Yes, yes.
- PAM: Congratulations.

659
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:06,020
KIM: Thank you. We've
wanted this for a long time.

660
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,298
PAM: That's wonderful.

661
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:10,742
- KIM: Yeah.
- PAM: So, tell me about the untied shoelaces.

662
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:12,409
KANYE: These are sock shoes,

663
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:13,669
so they, like...

664
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,647
PAM: Oh, yeah.

665
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,228
Oh, look at how light they are.

666
00:31:17,237 --> 00:31:20,153
- KANYE: Yeah. But the laces are sort of after the fact.
- PAM: Yeah.

667
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:22,860
- Not necessary to keep 'em on your feet.
- KANYE: Yeah.

668
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:26,343
PAM: Yeah. Okay. I just
wanted to be cool, so...

669
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:28,311
(laughter)

670
00:31:28,478 --> 00:31:31,126
- KIM: All right, can I see these new things in your closet?
- CAITLYN: Okay.

671
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,965
They gave me a ton of
stuff. Tom Ford stuff.

672
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:37,824
Diane von Furstenberg sent me this...

673
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:41,013
- three, three outfits.
- KIM: Ooh. I like that. That's so nice.

674
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:42,276
I like the plain black.

675
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:45,016
CAITLYN: Yeah... this is all kind of
a little bit more casual stuff here.

676
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,509
This is all vanity... KIM:
These color tones are <i>so</i>

677
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:49,083
<i>much better than
what you had before.</i>

678
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:52,789
<i>- Like, I was secretly dying in your last closet.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, secretly dying?</i>

679
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:56,227
<i>Yeah, this is all just kind
of very casual, good stuff.</i>

680
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:58,506
- <i>KIM: But this has got to go. Like...
- CAITLYN: Yeah. Oh, I agree. </i>

681
00:31:58,545 --> 00:32:00,292
- this... ? <i>
- And that's the one they caught me in. </i>

682
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:01,349
- <i>KIM: I know.</i>
- CAITLYN: I said, "Oh, my God,

683
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:02,756
- Kim's gonna shoot me."<i>
- </i>KIM: Oh, it looks black and white...

684
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:04,193
<i>no, this has got to go.</i>

685
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:05,660
<i>I said that last time I saw it.</i>

686
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:06,943
CAITLYN: I love

687
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:09,840
- this Tom Ford dress. <i>
- KIM: Mom has that.</i>

688
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,736
- <i>CAITLYN: What's that?
- KIM: Mom has that.</i>

689
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,396
- KIM: So it'll be like a <i>"Who Wore It Better?"
- CAITLYN: Actually, no, no,</i>

690
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:17,652
- <i>"Who Wore It Best?"
- KIM: She has it in chocolate brown. </i>

691
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:18,839
<i>CAITLYN: We got to do
that. Isn't that... </i>

692
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:21,591
- <i>Wouldn't that be the funniest thing ever?
- KIM: Yes... </i>

693
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:23,044
No, you should just come over,

694
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,716
- like, at a time where, you know, I know she's there. <i>
- CAITLYN: Right.</i>

695
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,989
<i>KIM: And I'll just pick out
an outfit for her to wear, </i>

696
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,534
<i>and "I'll say, " Oh, my God,
I'm gonna take you to dinner.</i>

697
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:31,452
- <i>You should wear this."
- CAITLYN: Yes.</i>

698
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:32,706
<i>KIM: And then you should stop by... </i>

699
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:33,842
<i>CAITLYN: And we'll both
have the same outfit.</i>

700
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:35,761
- <i>That is...
- KIM: Yes... (laughs)</i>

701
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,926
<i>CAITLYN: That is funny.</i>

702
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:39,130
I better wear it before she does.

703
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:40,832
<i>KIM: Very cool.</i>

704
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:41,652
<i>CAITLYN: Yeah.</i>

705
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,058
- PAM: Oh, there they are.<i>
- </i>CAITLYN: They're leaving.

706
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:45,698
<i>And so are you guys.</i>

707
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,266
<i>ESTHER: Good to see you again.</i>

708
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,858
<i>KIM: Of course. Bye, everyone.</i>

709
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:50,803
<i>CAITLYN: Bye, babe! </i>

710
00:32:51,364 --> 00:32:54,406
- I know. All right, good-bye, <i>Mom. You're out of here, too.</i>
- PAM: We'll see you soon.

711
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:56,067
- ESTHER: Bye, Bruce.
- <i>CAITLYN: All right, have a good trip back.</i>

712
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:57,621
- <i>ESTHER: I love you.
- CAITLYN: Love you, too.</i>

713
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:59,348
<i>ESTHER: I always did
and I always will.</i>

714
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:00,450
<i>CAITLYN: I know, I know.</i>

715
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:03,071
It's 'cause I got this
adorable personality.

716
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,648
That's what it is. It's
the adorable personality.

717
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:06,972
<i>ESTHER: I like it better.</i>

718
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:08,595
<i>CAITLYN: Oh, good, good. Okay, good.</i>

719
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,699
<i>ESTHER: I was so proud of Bruce</i>

720
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:14,307
<i>when he stood on that podium,</i>

721
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:16,860
<i>receiving that gold
medal in Montreal.</i>

722
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,861
<i>And I had tears and the American
flag was going up in the middle,</i>

723
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:26,948
<i>and I thought I could
never be more proud of him.</i>

724
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:29,183
<i>And, you know, I was wrong.</i>

725
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:33,846
<i>Because I am more proud of him</i>

726
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:38,918
<i>for the courage that he has shown.</i>

727
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,923
<i>I loved him with all my heart,</i>

728
00:33:42,076 --> 00:33:45,228
<i>and I certainly love
her with all my heart.</i>

729
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,368
<i>(crickets chirping)</i>

730
00:33:57,939 --> 00:34:00,001
(water running)

731
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:03,233
<i>CAITLYN: For me, the most
important thing is to learn</i>

732
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:04,743
<i>about other people. </i>

733
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:10,347
So far, down in San Diego,
there has been three suicides

734
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,000
<i>of trans teens.</i>

735
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:15,114
<i>It's devastating. Kyler Prescott, </i>

736
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:17,249
14 years old,

737
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,110
<i>had his whole life ahead of him.</i>

738
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:22,987
<i>14... years... old.</i>

739
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:26,539
<i>I reached out to
Katharine, his mother, and </i>

740
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:30,085
<i>I want to spend a little bit of time
with her and find out what we can do </i>

741
00:34:30,144 --> 00:34:32,963
<i>to make a difference. Under
the cover of darkness.</i>

742
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:35,108
<i>So, heading for San Diego.</i>

743
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,130
<i>I'd say we go up the hill.</i>

744
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,670
<i>They'll never see us.</i>

745
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:40,824
<i>DRIVER: Uh, they're
waiting up there, too.</i>

746
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:44,637
<i>CAITLYN: The key to this trip is
a clean break from the paparazzi.</i>

747
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,993
<i>Actually, we've only got
one guy following us.</i>

748
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:48,856
<i>DRIVER: They're posted all
through the hill, so... </i>

749
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,368
<i>CAITLYN: Oh, yeah.</i>

750
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,552
We just, uh...

751
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:56,707
changed cars. Now I'm in this...

752
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:01,151
- luxury van.
- DRIVER: There's a silver Lexus up here parked.

753
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:02,268
<i>There he is.</i>

754
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,391
<i>CAITLYN: I heard the price
tag just for a picture of me</i>

755
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,875
<i>is $250,000.</i>

756
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,008
They are extraordinarily aggressive.

757
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:14,618
I don't want to bring that kind</i> of
tabloid attention to Kyler's family.</i>

758
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,527
<i>Damn.</i>

759
00:35:18,662 --> 00:35:21,628
Now, we're going to get a third car.

760
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:26,803
It seems like we've lost the paparazzi.

761
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,988
Every journey is different,

762
00:35:33,037 --> 00:35:35,312
and to learn those stories,

763
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:37,267
it just kind of educates me.

764
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:40,376
I can't even imagine what
Kyler's family's going through.

765
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:43,174
Uh, I don't know what
I can do, at this point,

766
00:35:43,294 --> 00:35:45,043
but just be a friend.

767
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:01,945
Hello. How are you?

768
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,516
- KATHARINE: Hi. I'm Katharine.
- CAITLYN: Thank you for inviting me down.

769
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:06,220
- KATHARINE: Thank you.
- CAITLYN: How are you doing?

770
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,507
- KATHARINE: Hanging in there.
- CAITLYN: Hello.

771
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:10,727
- KATHARINE: This is Chloe.
- CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

772
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,430
- CARL: I'm Carl.
- CAITLYN: Hi. Nice to meet you, Carl.

773
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,398
Thanks for inviting me down.

774
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:17,134
- What a cute kid.
- KATHARINE: I know.

775
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,874
- He is, huh?
- CAITLYN: Look at that. Love the hair.

776
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:22,921
KATHARINE: Yeah. He was a
beautiful kid with a beautiful soul.

777
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:27,286
Kyler was truly an
amazing... an amazing kid.

778
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:31,609
I was proud of him for working
so hard to be his authentic self.

779
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:33,730
CAITLYN: From a parent's perspective,

780
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:36,704
when... you know, this
kind of probably came out

781
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,062
- of left field...
- KATHARINE: Absolutely.

782
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:40,585
Um, I knew nothing
about it when we started.

783
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:42,739
I just luckily had an open mind

784
00:36:42,763 --> 00:36:44,823
and an open heart from the beginning.

785
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,680
From the very first day, I
said, "Sweetheart, I love you.

786
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:50,189
No matter what, I love you."

787
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:53,164
And, unfortunately, not all
transgender teens get that.

788
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,808
- Um...
- CAITLYN: That's for sure.

789
00:36:54,828 --> 00:36:56,825
KATHARINE: Yeah, I guess
that's an understatement.

790
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:59,593
That's something else I want
people to understand is that

791
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:03,352
even with this full support of your family,

792
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:04,646
it's still a hard journey.

793
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,670
People always assume when
they talk to me that Kyler was

794
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:12,447
bullied by other kids or
something like that, and

795
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,818
that's actually not really the case.

796
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,084
Really where he had the
most problems was with

797
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,023
adults not understanding,

798
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,309
people out in society that really

799
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:27,372
didn't understand that he needed
them to use a male pronoun.

800
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:29,482
And he had a legal name and gender change.

801
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:31,062
- CAITLYN: Oh, he did?
- KATHARINE: He did. And

802
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:33,954
the new birth certificate
arrived, unfortunately,

803
00:37:33,993 --> 00:37:36,625
- just a few days after he passed away.
- CAITLYN: No way.

804
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,195
KATHARINE: Yeah. And that was heartbreaking

805
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:40,399
because he would have loved to have seen

806
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:42,671
- the new birth certificate.
- CAITLYN: Loved it.

807
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,651
KATHARINE: But I don't think any suicide is

808
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,364
a sim... has a simple
cause. It's always a complex

809
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:53,175
set of things that are
challenging that kid.

810
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:58,689
CAITLYN: We need more tolerance
and empathy towards other people.

811
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,889
It's so hard for young people

812
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:03,215
because they just don't... th

813
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:06,113
ey... they can't see the future.

814
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:09,591
And because of that, they
become extraordinarily desperate,

815
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:12,925
and suicide becomes an option.

816
00:38:13,614 --> 00:38:16,059
We have to do something about that.

817
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:24,308
- He was gonna get there, and he was gonna be...
- He just needed to turn that corner.

818
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,410
- KATHARINE: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

819
00:38:25,444 --> 00:38:27,756
KATHARINE: He was young, you
know? He was still just 14,

820
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:30,358
and at that age, they just don't realize

821
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:32,473
they're gonna get through
it, they can get through it,

822
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:35,483
they can get to these wonderful
things on the other side.

823
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:36,535
CAITLYN: Yeah.

824
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,809
KATHARINE: Today some students are going to
be doing a balloon release in Kyler's honor,

825
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:43,939
which is so sweet. So I would love it

826
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,469
- if you want to come and see.
- CAITLYN: That is nice.

827
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,658
CAITLYN: I would be honored.
I would love to meet everybody.

828
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,192
KATHARINE: It will be a beautiful moment.

829
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:52,026
- CAITLYN: It will be.
- KATHARINE: This is a song that was written

830
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:53,349
by a friend of ours.

831
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,019
It's a beautiful song,
and it was written...

832
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:57,712
for Kyler.

833
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:02,419

and it got better for me.

(Caitlyn chuckles)

880
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:17,279
CAITLYN: But because of my
status, everybody is looking at me

881
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:20,281
as the spokesperson for
the transgender community.

882
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:21,804
- WOMAN 4: Nervous?
- CAITLYN: Off the charts.

883
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:24,205
WOMAN 4: I'm afraid people will
think it's all about makeup and hair.

884
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:26,090
And yet there are all
these trans women out there

885
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:27,944
who are in real danger.

886
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:29,479

I'm thinking about all this kind of stuff,

890
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:40,229
and I'm struggling with it.

891
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,208
Khloe's upset.

892
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:44,189
She didn't like the Vanity Fair article...

your armor on, and your helmets,

895

CAITLYN: I don't want to hurt my kids.

897
00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:56,864
The guys are tougher. They want me

898
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:58,533
to be the old Bruce.

my great curse to be trans.

901
00:42:03,893 --> 00:42:05,762
Now I think of it as my great gift.

902
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,056
CAITLYN: What I'm hoping for
is that the world is gonna

903
00:42:09,072 --> 00:42:11,391
follow along with me and
we can learn together.

904
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,488
WOMAN 7: Stop looking on the outside
and start looking on the inside.

905
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:17,136
We want to be just normal people.

906

MAN 2: If you have a transgender
kid, you are living with a unicorn,

- CAITLYN: We're all beautiful!
