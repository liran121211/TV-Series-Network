1
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:09,556
RONDA: You know, you
look really good today.

2
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:12,391
Can I take a picture? (Chuckles)

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,983
- CAITLYN: Let's see it.
- RONDA: Stop.

4
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:16,246
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- RONDA: Oh. Oh, I video'd you

5
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:17,411
by accident... you want to see?

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,363
(over phone): Hold on.

7
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,258
- I'm not really good with this phone.
- COURTNEY: Do your favorite pose.

8
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,141
RONDA: I hate my voice.

9
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:23,353
COURTNEY: Oh, I hate mine. I just hate it.

10
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,397
- RONDA: I want to show you how pretty you are.
- CAITLYN: I don't look good in pictures.

11
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:27,088
- RONDA: Yes, you do.
- CAITLYN: Unless it's Annie Leibovitz.

12
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:28,863
The only thing that bothers me about that,

13
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:32,119
I really haven't heard my voice, you know?

14
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,343
And any trans person,

15
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:36,342
the voice is always, like...

16
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,744
- RONDA: What do you mean?
- CAITLYN: ... you know, scary.

17
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:40,507
- What do you mean you haven't heard your voice?
- Well, you... you obviously don't have

18
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:42,519
the feminine voice, and
that kind of bothers you.

19
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,734
COURTNEY: There's a voice coach app.

20
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,900
CAITLYN: Oh, okay.

21
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,806
COURTNEY: And it tests your
pitch and you can practice.

22
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,281
So you're gonna say the
word "he" over and over.

23
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:51,741
- CAITLYN: What is it?
- COURTNEY: "He."

24
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,271
- H-E.
- CAITLYN: Oh, "he." Eh...

25
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:57,825
- Just normally? Sorry. Just...
- COURTNEY: Yeah.

26
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,533
- just say it normally?
- Yeah, however you want to say it.

27
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:00,483
- RONDA: You need a lesson.
- Okay.

28
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:01,937
CAITLYN (cracking): He.

29
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:05,278
- (laughing)
- RONDA: Cracking the voice.

30
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,952
CAITLYN: I got to do
it again. Wait a second.

31
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,781
(high-pitched): He, he, he, he.

32
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:15,551
One thing that's always a
challenge for anybody is your voice.

33
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,876
That can out you every time.

34
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:20,545
You know? You look great,
you look fabulous, and...

35
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:23,557
(deeply): then you open
up your voice, you know?

36
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:26,540
And everybody goes... (gasps) "Oh, my God."

37
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,005
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

38
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,446
COURTNEY: 70%.

39
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:33,312
CAITLYN: My voice has
never been terribly bad,

40
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:35,922
but it's... it's certainly not quite right.

41
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,910
- He...
- ALL: He...

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,054
(laughing)

- CAITLYN: My Kimmy's here.

48
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:02,013
KIM: Look at you. Are
we wearing the same tank?

49
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,989
Hmm.

50
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:05,073
CAITLYN: I think so. Hello, baby,

51
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:08,312
- I haven't seen little Malika in a while.
- MALIKA: A while.

52
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,004
- CAITLYN: How are you doing?
- MALIKA: Good. How are you?

53
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,643
- I love your eyes.
- CAITLYN: Have a seat.

54
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,974
Um, talking about looks, honestly,

55
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,290
this girl thing is a lot of work.

56
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,803
- MALIKA: Yeah, it is.
- CAITLYN: Yes, it is.

57
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,527
Do you have any feminine tips?

58
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,971
Here we have two very feminine women.

59
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,831
MALIKA: Men and women eat very different.

60
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,966
As a woman, you have to
be very mindful. Like,

61
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:31,030
I'm not saying you can never
touch a rib again, but, like,

62
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,903
- the way you eat...
- CAITLYN: Touch the rib

63
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:34,100
in the privacy of your...

64
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:36,721
- your own room or anything, yeah.
- MALIKA: Just some things, you know?

65
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,528
- Exactly.
- CAITLYN: But, actually,

66
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:40,469
- that's a good tip.
- MALIKA: How are you clearing the... You...

67
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:41,897
Okay, you don't have on heels.

68
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,615
I was gonna say, if you're
gonna clear this doorway,

69
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,621
- you know...
- CAITLYN: Oh, just because you're...

70
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,897
you're so short

71
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,526
and you got to wear massive heels...

72
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,892
MALIKA: No, but it's just like you can't

73
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,464
- bend all the way to the side.
- CAITLYN: Oh, please, look,

74
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:55,504
plenty of clearance, girl.

75
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,626
- Look at this. Look at this.
- MALIKA: I was just telling her, she can't do that. Like, it's not...

76
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,380
- That's fi... But when you have heels on...
- CAITLYN: Not even close.

77
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,424
- Not even close.
- MALIKA: When she wears heels

78
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:03,329
and they're, like,

79
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:05,186
- four or five inches...
- CAITLYN: Don't be jealous of my height

80
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,001
- and start to put me down.
- MALIKA: I'm completely jealous of your height.

81
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:09,127
CAITLYN: Yes.

82
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:10,906
Being feminine,

83
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,055
you got to kind of learn everything.

84
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,525
Jenny Boylan did a book

85
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,752
on her transition,

86
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:18,931
and she had a statement in
there and I... just I loved it.

87
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,009
And she says,

88
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:22,742
"I never felt feminine,

89
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,720
but I always felt female."

90
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,047
And I'm, "Ah."

91
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,890
That kind of hits the
nail on the head for me.

92
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,626
KIM: Like, you never felt feminine

93
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,736
'cause you're a tomboy.

94
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:36,257
CAITLYN: Yeah, but I always felt female.

95
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:36,957
KIM: Mm-hmm.

96
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,629
CAITLYN: But for so many years,

97
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,744
um, you depress all of that.

98
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:44,065
All I want to do is just
kind of slip into society.

99
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,662
One thing that

100
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:49,587
I really need to work
on is kind of that voice.

101
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,591
KIM: Well, at least your
voice isn't that deep,

102
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:53,139
so it's not like you're...
(deeply): "Hello."

103
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:56,004
CAITLYN: No, it's not that
deep, and I... it's okay.

104
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:57,590
- KIM: What about vocal lessons?
- CAITLYN: Yeah,

105
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,328
you may be able to, I
think, with some training,

106
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,991
'cause a lot of people go
through training. In fact, um,

107
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:04,190
I want to show you.

108
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,315
Here we go.

109
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:08,197
WOMAN (deeply): When the sunlight
strikes raindrops in the air,

110
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,372
they act as a prism...

111
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,524
CAITLYN: That's before.

112
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:14,353
WOMAN: The rainbow is a division of
white light into many beautiful colors.

113
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:15,691
(high-pitched): Rainbow passage.

114
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,835
When the sunlight strikes
raindrops in the air,

115
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,788
they act as a prism and form a rainbow.

116
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,601
- KIM: Wow.
- WOMAN: The rainbow is a division of

117
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,647
white light into many beautiful colors.

118
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,175
MALIKA: That's a big difference.

119
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,857
CAITLYN: That is a huge difference.

120
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,479
KIM: Just, like, try out some
voices, like, that are just

121
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,192
a little lighter. Have you ever tried, or

122
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,759
is it gonna be too much
work if you're like...

123
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,734
- (high-pitched): "Hi."
- CAITLYN: I used to,

124
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:35,736
for years,

125
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:38,591
like, if you called down
for room service, okay,

126
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,031
okay, I'd be sitting there in my
room, all by my little lonesome,

127
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,413
and I'd think, "Okay, now, I'm
gonna try to get my best feminine

128
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:48,468
voice and call down so
they say, 'Yes, ma'am.'"

129
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:49,590
I could never do it.

130
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,048
- KIM: Like, go... Okay, try. Let's hear.
- CAITLYN: What?

131
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,539
KIM: Let's hear... Yeah. I'll
tell you if you get a "yes, ma'am."

132
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:57,220
CAITLYN: Well... (chuckles)

133
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:58,496
KIM: Front desk.

134
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,329
Hey, this is room service.
How can I help you?

135
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:02,390
CAITLYN: Okay.

136
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:03,816
Um...

137
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,794
- KIM: Order bacon and eggs.
- CAITLYN: Yes.

138
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:10,356
- KIM: And an orange juice. And toast.
- CAITLYN: Okay.

139
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:13,604
Um... Yes, actually, you can help me.

140
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:15,572
- Um...
- KIM: You sound no different!

141
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,820
- CAITLYN: I didn't think so.
- KIM: No. Sir, sir, what would you like, sir?

142
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,826
CAITLYN: Sir, yeah, what
would you like? Yeah.

143
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,986
See, that's the problem.

144
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,813
Women cannot relate to
the whole voice thing.

145
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,581
They don't see it as being that important

146
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,906
when it is that important,

147
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:34,019
not only for you just to speak and order

148
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,639
and do all that kind of stuff but

149
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,290
very important for your soul that
you're feeling good about that.

150
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:43,630
There are things that you
can do to change your pitch.

151
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,205
KIM: Really? Like what?

152
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,323
CAITLYN: Surgery.

153
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:54,357
- MALIKA: Why surgery?
- CAITLYN: Well, I was thinking

154
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,256
- about starting there...
- KIM: Surgery would scare the

155
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,383
- (bleep) out of me.
- MALIKA: What if you had no voice at all?

156
00:05:58,387 --> 00:05:59,407
KIM: What if they made a mistake

157
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:01,375
and you, like, came out with no voice?

158
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:11,879
(gulls crying)

159
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,683
PRODUCER: What's different
about tonight's girls' night?

160
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:15,882
'Cause you've been doing girls' nights

161
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:16,970
- for a while, right?
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

162
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,229
You know, for a long time, I've been
doing... having all the girls over.

163
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:21,259
But tonight

164
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,724
- we have all trans girls.
- JENNY: Hello.

165
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,561
- COURTNEY: Hi.
- JENNY: I'm looking for the lady of the house.

166
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,417
- RONDA: Jennifer's here.
- CAITLYN: Right here.

167
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:29,094
- COURTNEY: There she is.
- JENNY: Hi, darling.

168
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,531
CAITLYN: Hey, baby. Are you ready for this?

169
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:34,074
JENNY: I am so ready. I'm
Jennifer Finney Boylan.

170
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:37,027
Caitlyn and I met when she was
doing the Diane Sawyer special.

171
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,119
I'm an author and I'm a professor

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,672
at Barnard College in New York City.

173
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:42,881
I'm also the co-chair of GLAAD,

174
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:45,190
the LGBT advocacy organization.

175
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,061
I'm a transgender woman,

176
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:50,469
and I've been married
to my wife for 27 years,

177
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:51,755
12 as

178
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:54,384
husband and wife and 15 as wife and wife.

179
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:55,636
CAITLYN: We're gonna do a little glam.

180
00:06:55,684 --> 00:06:56,704
COURTNEY: What are you thinking?

181
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:59,682
Like, what's your favorite way
to wear your hair that you love?

182
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,853
JENNY: Kind of like... kind of like this.

183
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:04,192
As befits the dignity of my station.

184
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,141
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,728
CAITLYN: I would be scared
to death to take your class.

186
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:10,730
- JENNY: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- CAITLYN: I would be.

187
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,944
JENNY: We couldn't come
from more different worlds,

188
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:15,626
you know? I am this New England academic,

189
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,131
and, you know, she lives here in Malibu.

190
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,243
It's kind of freaky
that we got to be friends

191
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:21,965
at all, but here we are.

192
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,554
CAITLYN: Jenny, this is looking so good.

193
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,348
JENNY: I can feel my IQ plummeting.

194
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:28,108
- (laughter)
- CAITLYN: Oh, no!

195
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:30,134
- COURTNEY: No!
- CAITLYN: You didn't just say that!

196
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,889
JENNY: It's just a joke.

197
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:34,007
- Everyone relax.
- CAITLYN: What size are you?

198
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,004
I have something in the
closet I want you to wear.

199
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,680
It's just a wraparound.

200
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:39,649
- JENNY: Oh, I think it's too formal.
- CAITLYN: Try it on.

201
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,665
We'll leave you in here. Try it on.

202
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:42,579
JENNY: Wait, what was that look?

203
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,224
My paws and whiskers. Did
you just give me a look?

204
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,418
You just gave me a freaking look.

205
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,048
CAITLYN: If you want to
go with a great skirt...

206
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:51,300
JENNY: (sighs) Well, I could try it on.

207
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,486
For Caitlyn, being pretty, being
beautiful, caring about clothes

208
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,569
and makeup is really important.
But there are more important

209
00:07:58,598 --> 00:07:59,870
things than what you look like.

210
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,234
- CAITLYN: Oh, you even got the purse!
- JENNY: I got your purse.

211
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,283
CAITLYN: Look how cute
and adorable you look.

212
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:07,407
JENNY: She has the problem of not knowing

213
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,708
the community really well.

214
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:11,720
She's a stranger in some
ways to the community.

215
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,034
Now, let me ask you this.

216
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:14,229
Nervous?

217
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:16,268
CAITLYN: Off the charts. But

218
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,010
pressure's good, something
that's very positive to me.

219
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,799
Pressure makes me think.

220
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:24,449
JENNY: I invited a diverse group of
transgender women for Cait to meet

221
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:26,068
and get a sense of our community.

222
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:30,612
However, Caitlyn is a person of
tremendous privilege and power.

223
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:32,488
I'm a little afraid about
what's going to happen

224
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,673
when she meets a lot of transgender people

225
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:36,529
who... who don't have the privilege

226
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,139
- that... that she has had.
- (Doorbell rings)

227
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,782
CAITLYN: And here they come.

228
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:41,875
CAITLYN: We're gonna do this.

229
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:47,158
CAITLYN: And here they come.

230
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,575
- JENNY: All right, let's go get 'em.
- CAITLYN: We're gonna do this.

231
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,146
<i>Hello.</i>

232
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:56,024
<i>- The first to arrive, baby, how are you doing?
- CANDIS: Hello.</i>

233
00:08:56,053 --> 00:09:00,129
- <i>You look incredible.
- CAITLYN: And so do you!</i>

234
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:02,034
- <i>CANDIS: Yay.
- CAITLYN: How are you doing, babe?</i>

235
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:03,199
<i>CANDIS: I'm doing great.</i>

236
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:05,467
<i>My name is Candis Cayne,</i>

237
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:09,914
<i>and I'm an actress, showgirl, performer,</i>

238
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:11,732
<i>high-kicker, high-stepper.</i>

239
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:15,067
JENNY: I've never been with
so many tall women in my life.

240
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:15,938
<i>CAITLYN: Isn't it great?</i>

241
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,432
<i>You're the shortest one in the room.</i>

242
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:20,506
- <i>JENNY: I know! One second...
- CANDIS: When I started my transition</i>

243
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:22,693
<i>in '95,</i>

244
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:25,100
there was no manual,
there was no way of, like,

245
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:28,401
<i>figuring out how to do it. It
was all kind of black market.</i>

246
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:32,061
<i>Get your shots from the corner
store that had a, you know,</i>

247
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,067
<i>a secret knock to get your hormones,
you know, that kind of thing.</i>

248
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,433
<i>- RONDA: I'm Ronda.
- CHANDI: Hi, Ronda, I'm Chandi.</i>

249
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:38,881
- <i>RONDA: Nice to meet you.
- CAITLYN: Hello.</i>

250
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:42,016
<i>DRIAN: Hi, oh, my God, I
didn't recognize you...</i>

251
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,403
- <i>you look incredible.
- CAITLYN: Well, I know.</i>

252
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:44,684
<i>I know.</i>

253
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:47,548
- Come on, let's go in the living <i>room, we'll sit down.
- CHANDI: All righty.</i>

254
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,595
<i>CAITLYN: This is so much fun.</i>

255
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,775
COURTNEY: They have a lot to talk about.

256
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:55,995
- CAITLYN: It's pronounced "Shardee"? Or...
- CHANDI: Chandi.

257
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,735
- <i>CAITLYN: Chandi, okay, with an "N."</i>
- CHANDI: Like "Candy."

258
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:00,307
<i>CAITLYN: Okay... I got
to get 'em all right.</i>

259
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,816
<i>CHANDI: The transition period for me...</i>

260
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:03,860
<i> it was rough.</i>

261
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:07,050
Uh, totally a different journey
than what Caitlyn experienced.

262
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,714
<i>It was hard enough for my family</i>

263
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,073
<i>to accept me being gay,</i>

264
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:15,520
<i>but to want to be considered a woman...</i>

265
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,420
<i>that was, like, taking
it to the next level.</i>

266
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,146
- <i>CAITLYN: You made it!
- JEN: Yes, I did, hi, how are you?</i>

267
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,430
<i>CAITLYN: Good, good to see you,</i>

268
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:22,989
<i>thank you for coming. Thanks for coming.</i>

269
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,857
<i>JEN: My pleasure. My name is Jen Richards.</i>

270
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:27,246
<i>I came out and transitioned about</i>

271
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,715
<i>three and a half years ago.</i>

272
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:33,294
<i>At the time, I was the managing director of
a contemporary classical chamber ensemble.</i>

273
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,804
<i>About that time, I also
started engaging in activism.</i>

274
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:38,196
<i>I launched a Web site
called We Happy Trans,</i>

275
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:41,125
<i>which was designed to highlight
positive trans experiences.</i>

276
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:43,352
<i>I was kind of tired of only
hearing about trans people</i>

277
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,238
<i>all in their death.</i>

278
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:45,846
I really wanted a chance
to shine a spotlight

279
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,916
on the people who are alive
and doing great work today.

280
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:49,447
- ZACKARY: You look incredible.
- CAITLYN: Thank you.

281
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,933
- DRIAN: I didn't recognize her.
- ZACKARY: You look really, truly incredible.

282
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:53,063
<i>CAITLYN: I appreciate that.</i>

283
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,697
<i>CANDIS: It's difficult
for somebody that has</i>

284
00:10:55,751 --> 00:11:00,155
<i>been so sheltered to understand
the life of-of some trans women,</i>

285
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,721
<i>but I think by asking us all
to share our experiences,</i>

286
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:04,788
<i>Cait's doing the right thing:</i>

287
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:07,078
she's learning from people
who've lived the life.

288
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,984
CAITLYN: I am so excited
about this evening.

289
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:09,990
Um,

290
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:12,507
I got a lot to learn, you know?

291
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,220
- I've been out for two weeks.
- CANDIS: Yay, welcome!

292
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,511
<i>CAITLYN: I'm a baby, okay, yay! Okay.</i>

293
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:23,073
<i>Yeah, I'm talking all of
your fantasies in life</i>

294
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,703
coming true when Vanity
Fair was here, shooting.

295
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,249
- Annie Leibovitz started crying.
- JEN: Wow, amazing.

296
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:30,923
COURTNEY: She's loving this.

297
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:33,763
- She's never had a girls' night like this.
- RONDA: I know.

298
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,924
I feel kind of jealous.

299
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:39,876
DRIAN: This is really just
a monumental event, you know?

300
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,981
I remember growing up with
no trans people anywhere.

301
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:44,625
- CHANDI: Right.
- DRIAN: And so, to see somebody

302
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:46,284
on the cover of Vanity Fair,

303
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,393
on the Diane Sawyer
interview... that is changing

304
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:51,414
- for the children, especially.
- JEN: So inspirational.

305
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:56,005
DRIAN: I love being a trans
person. It's a true gift.

306
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,024
And I always think about
the youth who are suffering

307
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:01,177
and who are in states
where they can't transition,

308
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,679
they can't live free lives.

309
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,752
You know, for them to see that

310
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:08,008
you may be struggling right
now, but that's not forever.

311
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,805
And there's definitely a
light at the end of the tunnel,

312
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,686
and you just have to be true
to yourself and love yourself.

313
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:16,486
CHANDI: I love having
conversations with people

314
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:19,567
who try to tell me that
I'm going to hell for

315
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:22,892
being secure in who I
am, when God knew who...

316
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:24,562
who I was before I did.

317
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,121
We bleed the same, so why not use love?

318
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:30,181
- Just love.
- JEN: Right.

319
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:31,152
CHANDI: It's not that hard.

320
00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:34,907
It's not that hard for us
to be able to embrace things

321
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,883
that we may not understand.

322
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,294
COURTNEY: In the community,

323
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:42,054
do you think people are going to embrace

324
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:45,770
Caitlyn and what she's done?
Or do you think they're going to

325
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:46,876
be envious?

326
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:49,382
JENNY: What you should expect people to say

327
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:52,649
is, "Caitlyn is a sweet, smart, good soul

328
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:55,638
who wants to do good in the world, but has

329
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:57,912
every advantage, every
privilege in the world."

330
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,253
And that the world is full of people

331
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:01,745
that no one wants to take their picture.

332
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:04,762
JEN: We can support an individual
trans person and celebrate

333
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,705
their authenticity and
their... their place for dignity

334
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:10,848
and what they do with their privilege
while still calling into question a system

335
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,093
that makes this particular story
the one that we finally listen to

336
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:16,485
while we've been ignoring

337
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:19,487
the stories of black and Latina
trans women, poor trans women.

338
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:22,503
Cait's experience of
coming out is singular.

339
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,379
I... I don't think in
history anyone has ever

340
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,139
been so publicly welcomed.

341
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,171
For most of us, coming out is
a really kind of terrifying,

342
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,455
horrifying experience.

343
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,547
And it's a little discomforting that

344
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:35,933
everything Cait says is gonna
receive far more attention

345
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,018
than anything anyone else
in the community will say,

346
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:41,204
and she has relatively little
experience in the community.

347
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,895
So I think everyone is
a little bit cautious.

348
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:48,055
CANDIS: You know, the trans
community was invisible ten years ago.

349
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:49,734
- CHANDI: Yes.
- CANDIS: So the fact...

350
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:50,647
JEN: Except for Jerry Springer.

351
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,043
CANDIS: Except for Jerry Springer.

352
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:54,251
JEN: Maury Povich and Donahue and...

353
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:57,362
CANDIS: Exactly, and so to actually...

354
00:13:57,408 --> 00:14:03,302
to... to be, as an actress, to be doing
roles and, like, going to auditions...

355
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:06,120
- that's, like, a huge thing.
- JEN: Right.

356
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:08,727
CANDIS: But, like, then you
have other stuff, like life and

357
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:10,993
trying to pay rent and
trying to get medical care.

358
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:14,767
I mean, you know, just last year
I was trying to find a doctor

359
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:16,967
to get hormones from. You know what I mean?

360
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:20,253
And I tried to go into
the... to the LBG center,

361
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:21,842
and they were like, "We're booked up."

362
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:24,019
My girlfriend was like,
"Come to my doctor."

363
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:26,095
And I went in and the doctor said to her,

364
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:28,453
"Oh, you're not bringing any
more of those people in, are you?"

365
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:29,440
CAITLYN: Really?

366
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,597
- JENNY: "Those people."
- CHANDI: "Those people."

367
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:32,962
CANDIS: And I was like,

368
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:37,157
- "Wow," like, it's still happening, you know?
- CHANDI: Still, today.

369
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,343
CAITLYN: Really, that happened to you?

370
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:39,527
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- CHANDI: Yes, Cait,

371
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,810
that happens all the time... a
day in the life of being trans.

372
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,307
CAITLYN: Wow.

373
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:49,286
Hearing Candis' story is shocking to me.

374
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:51,831
Um, I can't believe

375
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:53,963
some people would act that way.

376
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:56,898
Honestly,

377
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,872
this is really scaring me.

378
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:00,865
I have been catapulted into the spotlight,

379
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:03,851
becoming a spokesperson for
the transgender community,

380
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,592
but, oh, my God,

381
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,907
what if people turn on <i>me</i> like that?

382
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:09,998
RONDA: Dinner is served!

383
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:12,102
CAITLYN: Okay, let's go, come
on, let's go get something to eat.

384
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,907
DRIAN: Let's do it.

385
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:17,530
JENNY: I... I will tell you that my...
that my last name is Boylan... Jenny Boylan.

386
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,978
There are... my students

387
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,368
have not... have called me "J. Bo."

388
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:22,811
CAITLYN: Really?

389
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,932
JENNY: Which I think is very funny.

390
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:28,832
CHANDI: Well, I came
from the world of drag.

391
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:32,446
And I needed to come up
with a name really quick,

392
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:35,566
so I became Miss Chandelier, and

393
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:39,193
then, as I decided to
transition and become full-time,

394
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,472
I felt like Chandelier was
too dramatic for the daytime.

395
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:47,115
So I chopped it off to
Chandi and it has stuck.

396
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:49,817
- So that's kind of, like, how I got my name.
- JENNY: Wow, that's a great story.

397
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,053
JEN: I don't think any
of us can top that...

398
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:53,048
we should have gone with
you last. That's too good.

399
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,332
JENNY: I cannot top that.

400
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:58,168
The first night you were ever in a
room with with... with more than one

401
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:00,121
transgender woman was...

402
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,031
CAITLYN: Oh, about an hour
ago, couple hours ago, yeah.

403
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,388
CANDIS: Oh, my God, that's amazing.

404
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,152
- CAITLYN: Yeah. I... I couldn't.
- CANDIS: That's amazing.

405
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,082
CAITLYN: I was isolated from
the world, I couldn't do that.

406
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,606
'Cause I moved in here and then

407
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:11,714
kind of had one little, uh,
procedure after another, here.

408
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,420
- CANDIS: Well, it's worked, honey.
- CAITLYN: I know.

409
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,754
(Laughs) CANDIS: Whatever
they did, it worked.

410
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,699
- CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, yeah.
- CANDIS: You look... you look amazing.

411
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:18,009
CAITLYN: But, um,

412
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,353
actually, one of the things
I've wondered about...

413
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:23,447
everybody seems to have
pretty good vocal cords.

414
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:25,788
That's always been a concern
for me, from the beginning.

415
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:27,276
JEN: Ah, interesting.

416
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:28,736
CAITLYN: What have you guys done?

417
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,966
CHANDI: I haven't done one thing.

418
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,750
CAITLYN: Thank God,
girl, I like that, okay?

419
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,445
CHANDI: When people say, "Oh,
you need to talk like this."

420
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:40,729
Child, cheese, I don't have time
to be trying to maintain that.

421
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,701
I feel like if you're gonna accept me,

422
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,610
you're gonna accept me, so...

423
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:47,237
- JEN: I worked really hard on changing my voice.
- DRIAN: Really?

424
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:49,909
JEN: Oh, God, yeah. My
voice was lower than yours,

425
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:51,548
much lower than yours.

426
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,389
Um, I did see a vocal therapist in
Chicago... God, I've never talked about this.

427
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,881
Um, but, yeah, I did see
a vocal therapist and just

428
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,625
learned some basic techniques to
raise the pitch a... a little bit.

429
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,686
I just hated being
called "sir" on the phone.

430
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,006
I hated being outed by my voice.

431
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,408
CANDIS: I was walking in a New York
subway and I was feeling grand prize

432
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,963
and I was in my skirt
and I was flipping my hair

433
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,343
and this, like,

434
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:17,357
woman walks by me, she's, like,
limping... she has, like, a cane.

435
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:21,182
So I hear a clunk, clunk. "That's a man."

436
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,994
- JENNY: Yeah.
- CANDIS: And I hear it louder.

437
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:25,698
- "That's a man."
- CAITLYN: And just...

438
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:29,613
CANDIS: And then starting
going, "That's a man!"

439
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,087
- (laughter)
- And I...

440
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:34,911
ZACKARY: And once you've survived that,

441
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,458
you realize that it's okay.

442
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,192
- (laughter, overlapping chatter)
- CANDIS: Yeah, you can survive anything.

443
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,489
- ZACKARY: Confidence is contagious.
- DRIAN: Yes. Yes.

444
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,069
- CAITLYN: Totally. Yeah.
- CHANDI: Right.

445
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,077
JEN: Guys, what we need is one straight

446
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,522
male celebrity to stand
up in public and say,

447
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:49,285
"Yeah, my girlfriend's
trans. She's a woman."

448
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:49,858
CHANDI: Right.

449
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,115
CAITLYN: Does anybody...
does anybody know one?

450
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:52,152
- JEN: No. Never.
- CHANDI: No.

451
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,646
JENNY: And the narrative is,
it's so much more shameful

452
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:57,133
than some other woman, you know?

453
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:58,114
JEN: Yup. Exactly.

454
00:17:58,323 --> 00:17:59,704
DRIAN: Oh, yeah.

455
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:03,674
I was an immigrant, so I came to this
country not speaking the language, not,

456
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,392
- you know, being familiar with anything.
- CAITLYN: Where did you come from?

457
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:06,076
DRIAN: Mexico,

458
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:10,225
and so, acclimating to culture
and being gender variant,

459
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:14,370
um, you know, it was always
really tough. And, um,

460
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:18,238
I had gone to college, I
had a degree, I was working,

461
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:21,648
and my insurance didn't cover any
of my transitional-related care.

462
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:24,833
And at that point, I was doing sex work.

463
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,903
That was the only way I could transition.

464
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,391
If I couldn't transition,

465
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,956
I didn't want to live anymore.
I just didn't want to live a lie.

466
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,746
I wanted to be myself.

467
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:35,466
And I was asking the universe.

468
00:18:35,473 --> 00:18:38,578
I was saying, "Change
the way I see the world

469
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:40,902
- so I can see my way out of doing sex work."
- CAITLYN: Hmm.

470
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,485
DRIAN: So I felt really
horrible about that,

471
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,077
- that I really...
- CAITLYN: Have you ever

472
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,200
- talked to Janet Mock about it?
- DRIAN: No.

473
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,014
CAITLYN: You should read her book.

474
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:49,724
- DRIAN: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: That's how she paid for it.

475
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:55,353
CHANDI: Cait thinks that because
she read a couple of pages in a book

476
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:57,685
that she's in the know,
but she doesn't get it.

477
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,720
She doesn't realize how
common sex work stories are.

478
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:04,228
She could never understand how it
would feel to walk in those shoes.

479
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:06,319
If she's going to become
our representative,

480
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:09,115
Cait needs to learn the
struggle we all face.

481
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,530
CAITLYN: I say we go to San Francisco.

482
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,292
- We could rent a bus. Like Priscilla.
- Seriously?

483
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,689
- JENNY: How do we sneak you out of here?
- <i>CAITLYN: In a trunk.</i>

484
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:24,232
Uh, could this be the paparazzi right here?

485
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,033
- Are we moving?
- RONDA: All right. Yes.

486
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:29,199
- RONDA: Jump in behind...
- CAITLYN: Hello, girls!

487
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,061
I still haven't been able to access

488
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,502
what you've been able to access so quickly.

489
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:42,499
Let's just be real, it had something
to do with your socio-economical status.

490
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:43,877
CHANDI: It's not your problem,

491
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,282
but it would be great if you
would just step up and let

492
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,931
the people who are doing wrong

493
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:50,101
- know that they're wrong.
- ALISON: Uh-huh.

494
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:56,508
I have a bunch of friends in San Francisco,

495
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,345
that I would love to introduce
you to and hear some stories.

496
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,526
- CAITLYN: Oh.
- JEN: Oh, well, there's also an HRC office there,

497
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,595
so I could introduce you to
some of those people, too,

498
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,738
- and we can start talking about...
- CAITLYN: Explain HRC.

499
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:07,009
JEN: Oh, HRC is the Human Rights Campaign,

500
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:10,881
which is one of the world's
biggest LGBT advocacy organizations.

501
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,012
What you should really do

502
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,666
is hear some of their stories
about what they've been through.

503
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:16,016
CAITLYN: Oh, we should go there.

504
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,755
- JEN: Really?
- CAITLYN: Why not?

505
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,344
I say we go to San Francisco.

506
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:20,925
- (Jen laughs and claps)
- JENNY: All right.

507
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,611
- JEN: Well, are you serious?
- CAITLYN: Why not? What's holding us back?

508
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,688
We could rent a bus.

509
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:25,977
A big camper.

510
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:27,522
- JEN: Are you serious?
- JENNY: Yeah,

511
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:28,880
- a bus.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, like Priscilla.

512
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,507
- JENNY: Seriously?
- JEN: Like <i>Priscilla?</i>

513
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,949
<i>JENNY: Right, that's...</i>

514
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:34,269
CAITLYN: All we got to do
is sneak me out of here.

515
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:35,823
JENNY: How do we sneak you out of here?

516
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,857
<i>CAITLYN: In a trunk.</i>

517
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:38,895
<i>JENNY: This could be fun.</i>

518
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:39,745
<i>CAITLYN: Road trip!</i>

519
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,258
- <i>JENNY: Road trip!
- JEN: Road trip! Yes!</i>

520
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:41,806
<i>JENNY: Yeah.</i>

521
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,243
<i>CAITLYN: San Francisco,
here we come! (Laughter)</i>

522
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:53,332
- CAITLYN: Hey, babe.
- MADDIE: We brought Starbucks.

523
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,972
<i>CAITLYN: Oh, my God.</i>

524
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:58,485
- <i>RONDA: What are you wearing, you little... ?</i>
- MADDIE: A romper.

525
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,607
- SPENCER: You're wearing a romper.
- RONDA: <i>I'm wearing a romper.</i>

526
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:02,947
- <i>MADDIE: It's promper, proper romper.
- RONDA: Thank you, honey bunny.</i>

527
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,455
<i>We need to start packing.</i>

528
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:07,458
Five days.</i> So you need four night outfits,</i>

529
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:09,579
- <i>bathing suits...
- CAITLYN: Okay, wait.</i>

530
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:11,141
- <i>SPENCER: Yeah, bathing suits.
- MADDIE: Bathing suits.</i>

531
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,210
<i>CAITLYN: Are we actually
doing bathing suits?</i>

532
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,934
<i>RONDA: Yes. There's a swimming pool.</i>

533
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,704
- <i>Which drawer is your... bathing suits in?</i>
- CAITLYN: That's like...

534
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,459
- MADDIE: Are they in here?
- <i>CAITLYN: ... the scariest thing I've ever heard.</i>

535
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:22,620
<i>RONDA: You want to bet? I've
seen you in your bathing suits.</i>

536
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,023
<i>CAITLYN: Having the opportunity
to go out with these girls,

537
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:26,285
<i>go on the road,</i>

538
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:29,514
<i>pack all of Caitlyn's
stuff is to me so freeing.</i>

539
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:32,559
<i>I've never gone on the road with
just Caitlyn clothes. I mean,</i>

540
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:35,301
<i> it's just never happened, couldn't happen.</i>

541
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,505
- <i>RONDA: Well, this is cute just for fun.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, that's... that's fun.</i>

542
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,569
<i>RONDA: But you need a sexy one for Candis.</i>

543
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:41,131
<i>MADDIE AND SPENCER: Who is Candis?</i>

544
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:43,003
<i>CAITLYN: We're not going there.</i>

545
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:45,942
- <i>RONDA: Who's Candis?
- CAITLYN: A girl that's going on the trip with us.</i>

546
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,524
<i>SPENCER: That's it?</i>
Do you find her attractive?

547
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,458
<i> CAITLYN: No, no. No, no, no.</i>

548
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,341
<i>Well, she's a very attractive lady, yeah.</i>

549
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:53,701
<i>SPENCER: Which one's Candis?</i>

550
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:55,871
<i>SPENCER AND MADDIE: Oh!</i>

551
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:57,631
<i>RONDA: And look how close
she is next... Look.</i>

552
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,874
- <i>Oh, yeah.
- SPENCER: Oh!</i>

553
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:01,909
<i>RONDA: Oh! Hot mama.</i>

554
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,281
CAITLYN: These girls won't
give up, and I get it.

555
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:06,912
<i>Candis is a beautiful woman,</i>

556
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,072
<i>but as far as dating in the future...</i>

557
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:14,027
<i>I have absolutely no idea.</i>

558
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,729
<i>SPENCER: Mom, are you
going on the road trip?</i>

559
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:16,580
<i>CAITLYN: You should go.</i>

560
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:18,316
SPENCER: Mom, you really
need to have some fun.

561
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,988
<i>MADDIE: Yeah.</i>

562
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,000
<i>CAITLYN: That's exactly right.</i>

563
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:21,604
<i>You got all this work ahead
of you, you got to move.</i>

564
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,822
- <i>SPENCER: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: You get a few days.</i>

565
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:24,434
<i>I'll keep her out of you guys' hair</i>

566
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:25,962
- for a couple of days, yeah.
- MADDIE: Yeah. Thank God.

567
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:27,920
- RONDA: No. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait.
- MADDIE: Get out of here.

568
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:30,237
<i>CAITLYN: Yeah, not to work.
You're coming for fun.</i>

569
00:22:30,492 --> 00:22:32,966
<i>RONDA: Okay. I've known Bruce</i>

570
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,900
for about 15 years.

571
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,278
Throughout those years, we've been friends.

572
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,421
We became quite close
probably about three years ago

573
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:43,269
<i>when I first found out she was Caitlyn.</i>

574
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:45,035
<i>I started working for her,</i>

575
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:48,542
and she didn't have anyone
really that she confided in.

576
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,364
It was for two years pretty
much just the two of us,

577
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,026
<i>because it's been hidden and private.</i>

578
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:57,309
<i>I look forward to just
having fun and relaxing.</i>

579
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,299
RONDA: Well, now that I'm
going, I have to pack, too.

580
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,222
- CAITLYN: Oh.
- <i>SPENCER: Yeah, you need to pack.</i>

581
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,556
<i>CAITLYN: Look at all these bags.</i>

582
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:04,986
<i>My first trip.</i>

583
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:07,643
All those bags, and I still
don't know if I have everything.

584
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:10,686
- RONDA: Why am I carrying all the bags?
- CAITLYN: They're out here. They'll know.

585
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:12,008
- RONDA: Whatever.
- COURTNEY: Peanut?

586
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,559
- Oh!
- Peanut?

587
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:17,359
<i>RONDA: So where are we
going now? What's the plan?</i>

588
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,230
<i>CAITLYN: Oh, we're gonna
rendezvous with the other girls.</i>

589
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,550
- COURTNEY: Uh-huh.
- <i>CAITLYN: And we're going to get the bus.</i>

590
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:23,253
<i>I mean, this is like a big camper,</i>

591
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,611
- you know, really cool.
- RONDA: Oh.

592
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:27,099
<i>Is that weird for the other girls that we</i>

593
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:28,671
- <i> are not trans?
- RONDA: That's true.</i>

594
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,370
<i>CAITLYN: You're the only
cis girls on the trip.</i>

595
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,185
- RONDA: What does "cis" mean?
- COURTNEY: What does "cis" mean?

596
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:32,970
<i>RONDA: Like sissy?</i>

597
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,345
<i>CAITLYN (laughing): What does "cis... "?</i>

598
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,044
- <i>It means, um...
- COURTNEY: Sissy?</i>

599
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:39,096
<i>CAITLYN: ... men or women
who are not transgender.</i>

600
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,759
- <i>You know those types.
- COURTNEY: Okay.</i>

601
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:41,683
<i>CAITLYN: Yeah.</i>

602
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,192
- Uh, could this be the paparazzi right here?
- RONDA: Is this paparazzi?

603
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,107
<i>COURTNEY: Everybody, look the other way.</i>

604
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:47,832
<i>CAITLYN: Everybody's gonna split up.</i>

605
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,610
- <i>RONDA: Oh, my goodness.
- CAITLYN: Ever since the Vanity Fair</i> article came out,

606
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:55,091
the paparazzi have been
following me everywhere.

607
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,326
Some of my kids haven't even met Caitlyn.

608
00:23:57,446 --> 00:24:00,217
So I really want to stay
away from the paparazzi.

609
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:04,485
I don't want the crazy tabloid
media to write stupid stories.

610
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:06,711
- RONDA: Okay.
- COURTNEY: The neighbors are gonna come out.

611
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:08,891
CAITLYN: Let's go, guys. Let's just do it.

612
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:11,653
If I can just get out of town,

613
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:12,970
I'll have so much more freedom,

614
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:15,609
'cause they'll never figure out
where I am and what I'm doing.

615
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,509
- Are we moving?
- RONDA: All right. Yes.

616
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:20,036
- JOE: All right. Finally.
- RONDA: Jump in behind...

617
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:22,338
Well, there is people. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

618
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:24,557
CAITLYN: Okay, are we ready?
Is everything moved around?

619
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:25,780
RONDA: Get in there.

620
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:29,996
- Are we moving?
- JOE: All right. Finally.

621
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:31,208
RONDA: Jump in behind...

622
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,603
Well, there is people. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

623
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:35,564
CAITLYN: Okay, are we ready?
Is everything moved around?

624
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:38,405
- RONDA: Get in there!
- CAITLYN: Hello, girls!

625
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:40,700
- CANDIS: You're so kind.
- CAITLYN: Hello, babe.

626
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,242
How you doing? I'm excited.

627
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:43,256
- We'll have a good time.
- CHANDI: I'm excited, too.

628
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:46,016
- Okay.
- CAITLYN: Candis, are you ready to go?

629
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,960
- CANDIS: I am so ready to go.
- CAITLYN: Okay, good.

630
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:50,109
I apologize for the slow start.

631
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:51,659
- JEN: It's all exciting.
- JENNY: It's not your fault.

632
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:53,531
CAITLYN: It's not...
Well, it is. (Muttering)

633
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,248
JENNY: Well, okay. Maybe it's your fault.

634
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,352
JEN: What are you
talking about? Completely.

635
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:59,091
- CAITLYN: You're wrong.
- JENNY: It's because you're so gorgeous, that's it.

636
00:24:59,113 --> 00:24:59,903
CAITLYN: Yeah, that's ex...

637
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:00,988
- Is that what it is? Okay.
- JENNY: Yeah.

638
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:02,014
CAITLYN: There it is.

639
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,996
JENNY: Oh, my freaking God.

640
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:06,164
CAITLYN: Oh, yay! We have our camper!

641
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,301
JEN: That's like... That's like a tour bus.

642
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:09,638
CAITLYN: The fun part about a road trip

643
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:13,505
is that everybody's kind of forced
to all be together, you know?

644
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:16,889
Nobody's going anywhere. And all the girls,

645
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:19,012
I've noticed, are so
excited about the trip,

646
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:20,740
'cause they've all
transitioned a long time ago.

647
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:22,941
They're very rarely ever
in a group with nothing but,

648
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:24,037
you know, trans women.

649
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:25,408
- Are we ready?!
- JENNY: We're ready!

650
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:26,792
RONDA: We're about to start moving.

651
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:28,706
CAITLYN: Fire this big... (cheering)

652
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:32,682
- COURTNEY: Viva la road trip.
- CAITLYN: We're officially in a paparazzi-free zone.

653
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,423
CHANDI: Yeah.

654
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:34,807
CAITLYN: Nobody's following us.

655
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:36,948
JENNY: â™ª 100 transgender women on the wall â™ª

656
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,919
â™ª 100 transgender women on the wall â™ª

657
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:41,368
- â™ª Take one down... â™ª
- (laughter, Ronda whoops)

658
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:42,505
RONDA: This is fun.

659
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:46,545
JEN: Had you ever met any
trans women before Caitlyn?

660
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,294
RONDA: Nope, and

661
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:51,140
it was so great when I found out.

662
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,184
One time, you called me and said,

663
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:55,052
"Hey, well, what are you
doing?" I'm like, "Nothing."

664
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,191
And you're like, "Well,

665
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,976
do you want to come over
for a glass of wine? "

666
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:02,068
And I was like, " Yeah, of
course." And I'm thinking, oh, no.

667
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,778
- He's not gonna... hit on me?
- (Laughing)

668
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,233
Literally changed my life.

669
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,660
Caitlyn told me her story that night,

670
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:13,336
after a couple glasses of wine.

671
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,784
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- RONDA: Because we all have our

672
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:17,652
issues and our problems. And I'm like,
"No, no, you don't even want to hear mine.

673
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,484
Like, mine are... No. Mine are just, like,

674
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:21,645
way too much for anyone to listen to."

675
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:22,854
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- RONDA: And...

676
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:26,373
she kind of trumped
mine. I'm like, "Really?"

677
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:30,244
CAITLYN: And the reason
I came out to Ronda, um...

678
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:33,578
- good shopper.
- (Laughter)

679
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,850
- (Courtney speaks indistinctly)
- CAITLYN: I needed help.

680
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,718
- I couldn't... I can't shop.
- RONDA: Who wants vino?

681
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:41,026
- Raise your hand.
- (Whoops)

682
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,165
- CAITLYN: Oh, there you go.
- RONDA: Okay, I'll get you a glass.

683
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:44,817
CHANDI: Thanks, Ronda.

684
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:48,085
RONDA: I'm a party starter. Cheers.

685
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:51,226
- Here's to the road trip.
- CHANDI: Road trip.

686
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:53,060
CAITLYN: Hey! â™ª

687
00:26:57,962 --> 00:27:00,472
COURTNEY: Look at all her
color variations in her hair.

688
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,014
Unbelievable.

689
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,901
- JEN: Is that all natural?
- CANDIS: It's all natural, yeah.

690
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:05,819
JEN: You want to keep it,
lock your door at night.

691
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:08,010
- Lock your door at night.
- COURTNEY: I will come in and just...

692
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:10,453
I will buzz off the bottom chunk.

693
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:12,322
CAITLYN: Oh...

694
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,770
CANDIS: Let's show... I'll show my butt.

695
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:18,156
RONDA: Why don't you
put 'em out the window?

696
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,846
- I'm just gonna spank your ass.
- CANDIS: I'm gonna do it. Ready?

697
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,338
Ow!

698
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,618
- (glass shattering)
- (screams)

699
00:27:24,738 --> 00:27:27,635
- CANDIS: Oh, my God.
- RONDA: No.

700
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:31,264
CANDIS: Oh, you spanked
the window out of the car.

701
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,577
CAITLYN: What the hell have you done?

702
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:35,871
CANDIS: I don't know! The
emergency exit fell out.

703
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:37,628
We have fresh air now, Cait.

704
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:39,326
That's why we did it.

705
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:41,008
- CAITLYN: Oh, you did it for my benefit?
- CANDIS: Yeah.

706
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,028
(whooping)

707
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:50,634
RONDA: Are we a third of the way?

708
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:53,781
CAITLYN: Nah... maybe about
a third of the way, yeah.

709
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:55,595
Jenny, where the hell are you going?

710
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:57,890
(Ronda laughs) RONDA:
This is like a '70s ad.

711
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,450
CAITLYN: Look at you. Look what you found.

712
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:00,082
CANDIS: Poppy.

713
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,668
- JENNY: A California poppy.
- CAITLYN: This is a poppy?

714
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,366
RONDA: I didn't get a rose.

715
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:05,531
JENNY: Yeah, that's right. Oh,
it's just for us trans girls.

716
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:06,790
- You get that one.
- RONDA (laughing): Oh...

717
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:08,507
CANDIS: You get the cis rose.

718
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,679
- RONDA: What, 'cause I'm a cis?
- CANDIS: I know.

719
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:13,032
RONDA: So here you go. Here, take
advantage of it while you can.

720
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:13,851
- CANDIS: Trying to yuk it up while we can.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

721
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:15,954
All right, everybody
just pile back on the bus.

722
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,339
Let's get this

723
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:19,521
- show on the road.
- JEN: Let's get this party started.

724
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:23,940
CAITLYN: I'm sure you've
heard a lot of stories.

725
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:25,885
- CHANDI: I've heard plenty of stories.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

726
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,176
CHANDI: Plenty of stories.

727
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:30,385
Working with young people has
really given me a lot of drive,

728
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:33,297
- because their lives are just...
- CAITLYN: Now, is this just trans youth or gay...

729
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:35,686
CHANDI: This is trans and
gender nonconforming youth.

730
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,515
CAITLYN: Gotcha.

731
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:37,912
What's the big issue?

732
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,858
CHANDI: They're homeless
and they're unemployed,

733
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,547
so it's just gonna take a lot more.

734
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:44,806
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- JEN: I think if I was to focus on one area,

735
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:46,506
it would be, like, entry-level jobs.

736
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:48,019
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- JEN: Just have... so that these girls have

737
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:49,646
some alternative if they want it.

738
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:50,948
- CHANDI: Right.
- CAITLYN: Don't... a lot of times,

739
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:54,606
they can make more not working...

740
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,830
with social programs

741
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:59,479
than they actually can
with an entry-level job.

742
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,096
JENNY: I'd say the great majority
of people who are getting help

743
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:03,615
are getting help 'cause they need help.

744
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:05,667
CAITLYN: But you don't want people to get

745
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,235
totally dependent on it.

746
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:09,656
That's when they get in
trouble. "Why should I work?

747
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:12,094
You know, I got a few bucks. I got my...

748
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,917
my room paid for."

749
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:16,848
JENNY: Now I'm worried.

750
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:20,311
Caitlyn has every right to be just
as conservative as she chooses.

751
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:22,018
But many transgender men and women

752
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,993
need social programs to survive,

753
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,821
and that's nothing to be ashamed of.

754
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:31,898
Living in the bubble is an impediment
to understanding other people.

755
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:34,741
If Cait's gonna be a
spokesperson for our community,

756
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:37,179
this is something she's
gonna have to understand.

757
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:44,811
_

758
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,993
_

759
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,379
_

760
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,390
<i>RONDA: No, but she gave her
a big hug when they came.</i>

761
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:55,716
<i>When I talked to her about it, she...</i>

762
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,928
<i>it's not like she blushes, but
she's like, "Oh, stop! Stop!</i>

763
00:29:58,936 --> 00:30:02,536
- Let's stop talking about it."
- COURTNEY: I know, but she's probably nervous.

764
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:05,328
RONDA: Does she even know
that we're on the same...

765
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,125
COURTNEY: No, she has no idea we're here.

766
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:09,598
'Cause Candis is there and
she's, like, doesn't know...

767
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:12,424
You know, like, when you like <i>someone
and you have that electricity?</i>

768
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,464
<i>RONDA: I'm trying to make eye contact
with her and she's not looking.</i>

769
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:16,534
- CANDIS: But they didn't say...
- CAITLYN: Oh, come on.

770
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:19,523
- <i>(Ronda laughs)
- Both of you, turn around.</i>

771
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,189
<i>(laughter)</i>

772
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:23,956
- Our cis <i>girls, just leave 'em up there.
- RONDA: See?</i>

773
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:25,686
<i>COURTNEY: Oh, see? She's
like, "Leave 'em up there."</i>

774
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,932
<i>(birds singing)</i>

775
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:31,598
<i>CAITLYN: We made it! It's the first stop.</i>

776
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,494
- <i>CHANDI: Yay.
- CAITLYN: Everybody out.</i>

777
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,547
- <i>CANDIS: No. (Laughs)
- CAITLYN: Go ahead, baby.</i>

778
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:35,626
- <i>JENNY: Oh, wow, it's beautiful.</i>
- CAITLYN: Go ahead.

779
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:39,941
COURTNEY: Look at how <i>there's,
like, a little house in the woods.</i>

780
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:41,503
<i>Isn't that crazy?</i>

781
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:44,438
<i>CAITLYN: All right!</i>

782
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,997
- <i>Look at this.
- JENNY: Wow, it's gorgeous.</i>

783
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:48,646
<i>JEN: Oh, my goodness.</i>

784
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:50,058
- JENNY: It's beautiful.
- (Jen gasps)

785
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:52,065
- (Jen shrieks, laughs)
- CAITLYN: I brought the moose in for you.

786
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:53,253
<i>COURTNEY: Oh, my God.</i>

787
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,373
- <i>Come on.
- JEN: It's screaming.</i>

788
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,179
- COURTNEY: Touch it.
- JENNY: Screaming at you when you walk in the...

789
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:57,999
Touch it?

790
00:30:58,053 --> 00:30:59,980
- RONDA: Ew, that's just creepy. I can't look, just...
- CAITLYN: Don't touch it,

791
00:31:00,012 --> 00:31:01,392
- it could bite.
- JEN: <i>What did it feel like?</i>

792
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,412
- JENNY: It's like a...
- CANDIS: Wow, it's so gorgeous.

793
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:05,699
CAITLYN: Now, Ronda, are you cooking?

794
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,267
<i>(Laughter)</i>

795
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,345
<i>RONDA: Uh... not tonight.</i>

796
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,424
- CAITLYN: Okay.
- RONDA: I'm sorry.

797
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:13,853
'Cause this is my vacation, remember?

798
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,086
CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, right.

799
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:17,484
<i>(Ronda laughs) RONDA: Well,
don't say "Oh, right."</i>

800
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:18,658
<i>JENNY: Let's sit out here.</i>

801
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:20,517
<i>CHANDI: Oh...</i>

802
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,447
<i>JENNY: So this is California.</i>

803
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:27,463
- Beautiful view.
- CAITLYN: It's kind of cold, yeah.

804
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:29,185
<i>CANDIS: Thank you.</i>

805
00:31:29,243 --> 00:31:31,858
- <i>CAITLYN: Now we're talking.
- CHANDI: Thanks, Ronda.</i>

806
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,294
<i>CAITLYN: The Santa Cruz mountains.</i>

807
00:31:33,354 --> 00:31:34,773
<i>CANDIS: That's beautiful, right?</i>

808
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:37,291
- I love the smell.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, it smells really nice.

809
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,299
<i>RONDA: Caitlyn's finally out.</i>

810
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,832
<i>CAITLYN: I'm out! Yeah, this is the
furthest I've been away from home.</i>

811
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,908
<i>Yay!</i>

812
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:44,803
- <i>(women whooping)
- JENNY: Bravo.</i>

813
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,405
- <i>COURTNEY: Cheers.
- CANDIS: Cheers.</i>

814
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:47,668
<i>Wow.</i>

815
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:49,796
CAITLYN: To be with all these girls who are

816
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:52,609
so accepting of me and who I am

817
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:55,981
<i>is probably the most freeing
thing I've ever done in my life.</i>

818
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,857
<i>Just to be out there...</i>

819
00:31:57,977 --> 00:32:00,347
it makes me really look
forward to the future.

820
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,025
<i>CHANDI: So how does it feel?</i>

821
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:04,631
- <i>CAITLYN: It feels free, baby.
- CHANDI: Right, right.</i>

822
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,119
<i>CAITLYN: Free. To be here with all of you</i>

823
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:08,131
- is nothing but good. <i>
- (Chandi chuckles)</i>

824
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:09,991
- <i>JEN: Feeling good.
- CHANDI: All good, all good.</i>

825
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:11,508
<i>CAITLYN: Nice.</i>

826
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:14,104
<i>(insects trilling)</i>

827
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:17,958
<i>Looks like somebody already
parked down here. Was that you?</i>

828
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:18,818
<i>CANDIS: Yeah, it's the...</i>

829
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:20,579
<i>COURTNEY AND CAITLYN: ...
it's the smallest room.</i>

830
00:32:20,594 --> 00:32:22,404
<i>- CANDIS: Nobody wants to be here.
- CAITLYN: Actually, it is. It's very nice.</i>

831
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:23,949
<i>JEN: This is the room I would've
chosen, just for the record.</i>

832
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:26,479
RONDA: We'll get the honeymoon suite.

833
00:32:26,508 --> 00:32:27,500
<i>COURTNEY: This is my bed.</i>

834
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:29,408
<i>Get off my bed!</i>

835
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:31,364
<i>RONDA: Oh. Oh, you fancy...</i>

836
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:33,014
<i>CAITLYN: What are you guys doing?</i>

837
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:35,188
<i>I guess you girls have taken this room?</i>

838
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,392
<i>COURTNEY: Well, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

839
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,353
<i>CAITLYN: There's only one bed.</i>

840
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:39,077
- <i>RONDA: There's zero...
- CAITLYN: We had two separate</i>

841
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:41,014
<i>beds downstairs for you, if you wanted 'em.</i>

842
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:42,697
<i>COURTNEY: That does not sound good.</i>

843
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:43,578
<i>CAITLYN: Follow me.</i>

844
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,453
- COURTNEY: Down there?
- CAITLYN: Hello!

845
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,547
<i>Ronda.</i>

846
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:51,028
- <i>The guesthouse.
- JENNY: Oh, my God.</i>

847
00:32:51,332 --> 00:32:52,874
- <i>COURTNEY: Wait, no.
- RONDA: Is that really?</i>

848
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:54,853
<i>CAITLYN: Here's the deal:</i>

849
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,154
<i>we're one short down there.</i>

850
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:58,657
- <i>I think you should stay up here.
- RONDA: What, me?</i>

851
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,765
<i>CAITLYN: Yeah. Okay,
everybody's got a room now.</i>

852
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,235
RONDA: Can I just say something?

853
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,235
Caitlyn.

854
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,248
<i>You told me this was a vacation.</i>

855
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,294
- <i>CAITLYN: You're doing fine. Everything's gonna be fine.</i>
- RONDA: Oh, great.

856
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:08,746
I'm gonna hobble down here

857
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,373
<i>to the bathroom in the middle of the night?</i>

858
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,288
- <i>CAITLYN: Yeah.
- (Ronda sighs)</i>

859
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,422
CANDIS: I'll see you in the hot tub.

860
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:22,674
JENNY: Okay. Bathing suit or naked?

861
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,003
JEN: I'm gonna wear my bathing suit.

862
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:24,878
JENNY: You're gonna wear your bathing suit?

863
00:33:24,892 --> 00:33:25,720
JEN: You can do whatever you want.

864
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:27,617
JENNY: Well, it'll be kind
of awkward if I'm... if I'm...

865
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,875
- JEN: Not at all.
- JENNY: ... if I'm not wearing

866
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:30,847
any... I'm gonna wear a bathing suit.

867
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:32,525
If you're gonna wear a bathing
suit, I'll wear a bathing suit.

868
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:34,002
JENNY: I won't be the only trans girl...

869
00:33:34,037 --> 00:33:35,858
naked in the...

870
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:37,565
So I'll put on a thing.

871
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:38,640
JEN: Okay.

872
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:43,189
COURTNEY: It's a little hot,

873
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:46,029
so I'm gonna let myself
in a little bit slow,

874
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,180
'cause it's, like, lobsters cooking.

875
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,237
- CANDIS: Oh.
- RONDA: How hot is it?

876
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:51,607
- COURTNEY: Hottish.
- RONDA: It's 103.

877
00:33:52,016 --> 00:33:54,318
- JENNY: Cait, have you been swimming?
- CAITLYN: What's that?

878
00:33:54,385 --> 00:33:56,703
JENNY: Have you been swimming
in your own bathing suit yet?

879
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:57,280
CAITLYN: No.

880
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,001
Well, I've been in the
bathing suit, but I haven't

881
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:00,835
- gone swimming yet.
- JENNY: You haven't been in the, in the pool?

882
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,402
CAITLYN: No, I haven't even been in
the pool. It's too damn cold right now.

883
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,316
JENNY: It's a really...

884
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:07,171
For me, anyway, it was an
incredible moment when I was like...

885
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,462
CAITLYN: To actually go swimming?

886
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:10,747
To be honest with you,
that'll happen at some point.

887
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:11,751
- I'm in no rush.
- JENNY: It will.

888
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:12,935
CAITLYN: Yeah. I'm in no rush.

889
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:13,629
Yeah.

890
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,743
- JENNY: I hear you.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

891
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:17,778
This process of coming out

892
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,484
doesn't happen overnight.

893
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:21,765
There are so many hurdles to overcome.

894
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:23,558
Every day, it seems like,

895
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,955
you know,

896
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:27,268
what about a "beijing-thuit"?

897
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:29,930
- (spits)
- PRODUCER: Bathing suit.

898
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,413
CAITLYN: Bathing suit.
See, I can't even say it.

899
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,043
It's hard for it to just, to come out.

900
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:37,176
Saying, "A bathing suit."

901
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:40,648
But, you know, that's where I got
to get, and that's gonna take time.

902
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:44,201
CHANDI: Can I say how amazing
everybody looks in their swimsuits?

903
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,595
(Candis whoops)

904
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:47,789
- Okay?
- (Indistinct chatter)

905
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:50,721
RONDA: We're overflowing.
JENNY: It's all these boobs.

906
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,724
JEN: (laughs) It's all the boobs.

907
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:55,660
(laughter)

908
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:58,121
CAITLYN: All right.

909
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:01,701
Little red light's on, camera's working.

910
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:05,278
Jenny: "Come on, let's get in the hot tub."

911
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:07,402
I don't think I'm ready for that.

912
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:09,477
You have to realize,
these girls transitioned

913
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:12,887
years and years and years ago. Um...

914
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:17,902
I just don't know if I'm ready
to expose myself like that.

915
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:20,522
Maybe down the line, I'll feel
more comfortable with myself,

916
00:35:20,528 --> 00:35:21,488
but right now...

917
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,118
I just can't see myself doing it.

918
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:27,543
Bedtime.

919
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:29,335
All right.

920
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:32,333
(Golf ball pings)

921
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:33,413
Wow.

922
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:37,917
It's just absolutely
gorgeous. I love a great view.

923
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:40,785
To me, a view is like freedom.

924
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:44,305
So, uh, Caitlyn being out for
the first time is wonderful.

925
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,640
Well, the big question now is:
does it make a difference...

926
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:51,647
swinging a golf club... with boobs or not?

927
00:35:51,678 --> 00:35:56,084
Will I still be free enough to
be able to swing the golf club?

928
00:35:56,147 --> 00:35:57,832
But I think in the putting department,

929
00:35:57,854 --> 00:35:59,942
I think it's gonna be very
good, 'cause you can just kind of

930
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:03,338
latch onto those little babies
under your arm, right here,

931
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,010
and get a nice putting stroke going.

932
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:08,707
So I'm optimistic about the future,
'cause I needed help on my putting.

933
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,251
(Caitlyn whoops)

934
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,045
JENNY: So are you enjoying the ride?

935
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:16,505
JEN: Yeah, of course, of course, it's...

936
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,571
I don't know, I kind of
almost take it for granted. I

937
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,507
spend so much time with
trans women already,

938
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:22,583
but Caitlyn's joy is kind of contagious.

939
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:23,967
Like that feeling when you're first out

940
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,677
- and everything is new.
- JENNY: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no.

941
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:28,793
CAITLYN: Oh, that was great, actually.

942
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:31,471
JENNY: So we're going to HRC today.

943
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:32,411
- JEN: Mm-hmm.
- JENNY: Right?

944
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:34,637
To see these trans women,

945
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:35,885
many of whom have done

946
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,903
sex work and who are gonna talk in a very

947
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:40,914
vulnerable and personal way about that, and

948
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,499
Cait needs to learn

949
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:44,790
what the risks are to the community.

950
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,639
JEN: Yeah.

951
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:49,187
JENNY: You know, if Cait emerges
from this whole thing thinking that,

952
00:36:49,385 --> 00:36:51,254
you know, that it's...
that womanhood is a party,

953
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,052
or that being... that being trans...

954
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:56,488
I mean, and we, you know,
she's so happy, and it's so...

955
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,921
it's so moving to see
her so elated, you know?

956
00:36:59,262 --> 00:37:01,642
Um, but it's also, I'm
afraid people will think that,

957
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,334
you know, it's... it's just, you know,

958
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:05,657
that... it's all about makeup and hair.

959
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:08,745
And yet there are all
these trans women out there

960
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:10,814
who are in real danger.

961
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:14,592
Transgender people often go through
a kind of second adolescence.

962
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,828
And when you first come out,

963
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:17,735
you can really find yourself acting,

964
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:19,768
you know, like a giddy teenager.

965
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,224
The sad fact is that our community

966
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:23,959
is in trouble.

967
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,863
Caitlyn, she wants to be our savior,

968
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,730
but most people don't have

969
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:31,332
what she has, and she may be oblivious.

970
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,622
- JEN: I mean, that's why we're here.
- JENNY: She's... she's

971
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:33,362
eager to learn, but,

972
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:35,484
you know what, there are some
times I'm not sure what...

973
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,047
- what gets through to her.
- JEN: Yeah.

974
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,705
CAITLYN: Beautiful! Caitlyn is out.

975
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,780
I really haven't done anything

976
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:50,278
to alter my voice. We
talked about it last time.

977
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:53,390
CAITLYN: This is not what I looked
like, okay? That's somewhat scary.

978
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:54,679
But what I sound like...

979
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,001
CAITLYN: I've seen some trans people,

980
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,866
they look great, and then
they open up their mouth,

981
00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:00,146
- and you go, "Oh, my God."
- JEN: Yeah.

982
00:38:00,185 --> 00:38:01,707
CAITLYN: I felt... I felt sorry
for them, 'cause they were,

983
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:02,985
you know, they had a
real deep voice, you know?

984
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,302
JEN: Yeah, I know girls like that.

985
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,977
CAITLYN: And I went,
"God, I don't want that

986
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,887
for me." Because I do so much speaking.

987
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,189
CAITLYN: You know, 'cause there's
all sorts of options on that.

988
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:13,534
CAITLYN: It's little things
that get into your head.

989
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:15,463
RONDA: We got to go.

990
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:17,018
- CAITLYN: Well, let's go.
- RONDA: Otherwise, we... we're gonna be late

991
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:18,516
- for the, um, meeting.
- CAITLYN: Let's do it.

992
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:19,495
JENNY: Do we need to bring our bags?

993
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:21,578
CAITLYN: Yeah, actually, you
know what the other good thing is?

994
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:24,734
We get guys to carry our bags for us.

995
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,615
(Laughter)

996
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:30,965
I want to kind of keep it low-key.

997
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:33,639
I don't want to make, like, a big
spectacle or anything like that.

998
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:34,468
Keep it low-key.

999
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,638
We're going in to the HRC place. Now,

1000
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:38,517
you work with them.

1001
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:41,388
- JEN: Yeah, I do, so...
- CAITLYN: What would you like to accomplish?

1002
00:38:41,897 --> 00:38:43,575
JEN: Primarily, just to
hear these girls' stories.

1003
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:47,276
They're survivors of... of
violence because they're trans.

1004
00:38:47,396 --> 00:38:50,711
We don't want to reduce them
to these traumas, you know?

1005
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:53,618
JEN: They're so much more than... than
these things that they've suffered.

1006
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:55,848
But we also need to
acknowledge what's happened...

1007
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:56,744
- CAITLYN: Yeah, right.
- JEN: ... in order to

1008
00:38:56,758 --> 00:38:58,257
lift the visibility of their stories.

1009
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:01,046
- CAITLYN: I am so amped.
- JEN: Good. Good, I'm glad.

1010
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,577
JEN: Hi.

1011
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:08,746
MAN: We're ready to
welcome you with open arms.

1012
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:10,517
- JEN: Hi, I'm Jen.
- MAN: Welcome to the Human Rights Campaign...

1013
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:12,597
- just really carefully watch your step.
- JEN: All right, okay. Thanks.

1014
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:13,439
CAITLYN: Caitlyn. Nice to see you.

1015
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,952
- Thank you for having us.
- MAN: Good to meet you.

1016
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,107
(Jen laughs giddily)

1017
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:23,296
- CAITLYN: Is this your friend?
- ANGELICA: Yes. Hello,

1018
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:25,352
gorgeous, how are you? Can I get a hug?

1019
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:28,023
- CAITLYN: Absolutely. How are you?
- ANGELICA: I'm awesome.

1020
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,791
- CAITLYN: So nice to meet you.
- JAY: It's a pleasure to meet you.

1021
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:31,982
- Thank you.
- ALISON: Hi, Alison Gill.

1022
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:34,255
- It's nice to meet you.
- JENNY: I'll say it again, I'm so glad to be here

1023
00:39:34,326 --> 00:39:36,631
- at HRC. It's a pleasure.
- LAYA: Laya Monarez.

1024
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:37,796
CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

1025
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:40,323
- BLOSSOM: I'm Blossom.
- JENNY: How are you, Blossom?

1026
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:41,388
- That's a pretty...
- BLOSSOM: Nice to meet you.

1027
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:43,256
- JENNY: Pleasure to meet you.
- JEN: Okay.

1028
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,314
CAITLYN: Oh, my gosh, where do we start?

1029
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,728
JAY: We're really happy to be
here today, talking with you

1030
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,570
and talking about sort of the
issues that the community faces.

1031
00:39:52,588 --> 00:39:54,169
I mean, we're really honored to have some

1032
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:57,492
incredible advocates here, uh, today
to talk about their personal stories.

1033
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:59,349
ALISON: You know, most
people think that trans people

1034
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:01,299
are protected from
discrimination across the country,

1035
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:04,156
and that's really not the
case. And it can really lead to

1036
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:06,192
- all sorts of problems.
- (Others affirming)

1037
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:07,883
ANGELICA: I've been
transitioning since I was 19.

1038
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:10,028
I still haven't been able to access

1039
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:12,612
what you've been able to access so quickly.

1040
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:16,413
When I first came out, I was fired
from, like, four jobs in a row...

1041
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:20,509
once they found out I was trans, so
I felt like I would never in my life

1042
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:23,252
choose to do sex work...

1043
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:25,895
but after being fired after so many jobs,

1044
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:28,633
- what other choice did I have?
- WOMAN: Yeah, mm-hmm.

1045
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:31,689
JENNY: This type of
discrimination is all too common

1046
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:33,586
in the workplace for trans women.

1047
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,615
We have to struggle to be employed,

1048
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:39,648
which is one reason why sex work
is so prevalent in our community.

1049
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,082
For some transgender women,

1050
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:42,866
it's the only work that we can get.

1051
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,434
BLOSSOM: Whenever someone
sees a transgender person,

1052
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:47,720
uh, the first thing they're gonna
think is, "Oh, they're a prostitute."

1053
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,530
You know, I mean, it's
sex work or whatever.

1054
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:51,645
- But what people don't understand is...
- CAITLYN: Is that what they're gonna think of me?

1055
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:53,487
- (laughter)
- ANGELICA: Not you, girl.

1056
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:57,874
- BLOSSOM: Yeah, not you.
- CAITLYN: My God, all of a sudden... shock.

1057
00:40:57,928 --> 00:40:59,089
Wait a second.

1058
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:00,886
BLOSSOM: Yeah, but, see, what
people don't understand is,

1059
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:03,006
the reason why some of
us do turn to sex work

1060
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:05,478
- is because people will not hire us.
- ALISON: Mmm, that's right.

1061
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,239
BLOSSOM: I'm gonna be honest. Caitlyn,

1062
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,017
when you came out, it was
so mixed or whatever, because

1063
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:13,914
it seems like you have these
transgender women of color

1064
00:41:13,968 --> 00:41:15,286
who are going out here, and... and

1065
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:17,294
we're basically saying the
same thing you were doing,

1066
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,381
- and, like, nobody wanted to hear it.
- CAITLYN: No, okay, first of all...

1067
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:22,926
BLOSSOM: Nobody wanted to hear
it. And, you know what I mean?

1068
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:24,763
And... you were... it was...
it had something... (sighs)

1069
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:25,557
Let's just be real,

1070
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:27,636
it had something to do with
your socio-economical status.

1071
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:31,275
(others affirming)

1072
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:32,740
CHANDI: It's not your problem,

1073
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:34,577
but it would be great
if you would just step up

1074
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:36,673
and let the people who are doing wrong

1075
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,654
- know that they're wrong.
- ALISON: Uh-huh.

1076
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:41,226
BLOSSOM: I definitely agree
with that. You're up there.

1077
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:45,588
Come down and... and
understand with everybody else.

1078
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,873
CAITLYN: Months and months ago...

1079
00:41:57,177 --> 00:41:59,768
I thought, "How could I make a difference?"

1080
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:03,626
And I'm thinking about my
family, and I struggled...

1081
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:04,660
Damn it.

1082
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,403
We're gonna go roller-skating.

1083
00:42:08,294 --> 00:42:10,338
- (woman whoops)
- CHANDI: Put a ring on it.

1084
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:13,156
CAITLYN: Ooh, wait a second,
we got to get our legs.

1085
00:42:13,276 --> 00:42:15,061
COURTNEY: Who's more attracted to men?

1086
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:17,683
- JENNY: Is that a hand?
- CAITLYN: I don't know.

1087
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:20,413
You would feel so much more
feminine if you were with a guy,

1088
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:21,645
- you know?
- JEN: Wait, what?!

1089
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,545
CAITLYN: I can appreciate the male form.
