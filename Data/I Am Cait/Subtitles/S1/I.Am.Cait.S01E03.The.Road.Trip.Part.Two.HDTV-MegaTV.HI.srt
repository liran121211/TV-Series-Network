1
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:06,124
CAITLYN: I am so honored to
be part of this community.

2
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:08,157
- WOMAN: Are we supposed to haze her?
- (Laughter)

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:10,431
CAITLYN: I finally feel
like I fit in somewhere.

4
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:12,316
- KYLIE: Lean back.
- CAITLYN: Wow.

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,279
Could be Caitlyn's first post.

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:15,323
KYLIE: What do you want to say?

7
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:17,610
- CAITLYN: Okay... My dad?
- (Laughter)

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,874
KIM: All right, can I see
these new things in your closet?

9
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:22,633
CAITLYN: I love this Tom Ford dress.

10
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,612
KIM: Mom has that. (laughs)

11
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,679
CAITLYN: That is funny.

12
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,247
- Road trip!
- (People cheering)

13
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,050
WOMAN: Viva la road trip.

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,102
- CHANDI: How does it feel?
- CAITLYN: Free! To be here,

15
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,488
with all of you, is nothing but good.

16
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,801
Everybody seems to have
pretty good vocal chords.

17
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,275
That's always been a concern for me.

18
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,628
WOMAN: I worked really hard. I
hated being outed by my voice.

19
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,496
WOMAN 2: She's never had
a girls night like this.

20
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,460
RHONDA: I feel kind of jealous.

21
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,184
WOMAN: There are all these trans
women out there in real danger.

22
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,822
Most people don't have

23
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:52,873
what she has, and she may be oblivious.

24
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,994
ANGELICA: I've been
transitioning since I was 19.

25
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:57,598
I still haven't been able to access

26
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:00,090
what you've been able to access so quickly.

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,503
BLOSSOM: Let's just be
real. It has something to do

28
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,363
with your socio-economical status.

29
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:06,553
You're up there. Come
down with everybody else.

31
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,888
ANGELICA: A lot of people
who want to be seen as heroes

32
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,123
and want to, like, save our community.

33
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,158
They want these kind of
direct, wrap a bow around it,

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,127
now this person's all
better and they have a job.

35
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,530
(Indistinct arguing)

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,970
ALISON: Trans people have about four
times the heightened extreme poverty rate

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,888
as the general population, so
that's very difficult to live

38
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,861
at that level.

39
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,434
CHANDI: We made it clear to Caitlyn

40
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:36,033
that a lot of girls are going to be jaded,

41
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:40,523
because the things that Caitlyn has
been able to achieve in a few months,

42
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:44,649
some of them will never achieve
those things their whole entire life.

43
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,019
So, taking that into consideration,

44
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,788
Caitlyn is still wanting to do the work

45
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,556
to make a difference in the community.
Because even us sitting in this

46
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:57,166
room, right now, have people
who don't like us for their own

47
00:01:57,196 --> 00:02:00,036
individual reasons. It
doesn't have anything to do...

48
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:03,507
Right! Right! Right! It has
nothing to do with us not

49
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:06,897
being good people and we
can't allow that to prevent us

50
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,173
from moving forward,
doing the work that we do.

51
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,743
Those are the things that keep us inspired.

52
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,045
CAITLYN: We have to understand that, yeah,

53
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:17,392
everybody's different,
okay? Everybody's got issues.

54
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,687
This is our issue, okay? And
we're trying to deal with it,

55
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:22,194
- best we possibly can.
- JENNY: But, you know, we can't do

56
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:25,214
all this work by ourselves; we need allies.

57
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:28,140
Um, there's just not
enough transgender people...

58
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,794
LAYA: When I came out, I
had finally transitioned,

59
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:32,469
trying to be myself and here I
am applying to job, job after job,

60
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:36,235
trying to get jobs. And, uh... nothing.

61
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:38,880
You know, I did, I didn't
want to, like, have to do this,

62
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,015
but I ended up doing a lot of sex work.

63
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:44,671
One night I was doing it and
this guy grabs behind the seat,

64
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,023
pulls out a knife and he
just starts stabbing me.

65
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,542
(Woman gasps)

66
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:52,216
So I jumped out and then I hear screeching.

67
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:54,843
And the car screeches and turns around

68
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,556
and he's coming back after me

69
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:58,553
- to run me over.
- ANGELICA: Oh, my God.

70
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:01,430
CHANDI: Society needs to see

71
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,427
us as being normal human beings,
just like the next person.

72
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:08,499
BLOSSOM: I wanted to be in
nursing school so, so bad.

73
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:11,791
I had a good GPA. I had a good ACT score.

74
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:14,135
And, you know, the first
time, I didn't get in.

75
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,028
Okay, so let me work a little harder.

76
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:18,124
We took some classes, applied again.

77
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,975
Still nothing. And I couldn't
get into nursing school

78
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:23,140
for, like, the sixth
time, because I'm trans...

79
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,203
that people are looking at that.
And you need to be looking at my

80
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,800
hard work and the dedication
that I put into that hard work.

81
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,370
It... it bothers me to this
day when I see those students

82
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:35,471
that I went to school with in
nursing school, getting those degrees,

83
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,363
and the only reason why I didn't
get in was because I'm trans.

84
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:41,094
And I make straight A's. I work hard.

85
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,763
Stop looking on the outside
and start looking on the inside

86
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:48,404
and seeing that we want
to be just normal people.

87
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,943
CAITLYN: I've lived a great life.

88
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:53,813
And I realize, in this transition...

89
00:03:53,843 --> 00:04:00,140
that I kind of have that privileged
status. You were a white guy.

90
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,704
I worked hard. I've, you know...

91
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:07,445
been able to put a few dollars away.

92
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:13,649
So... I'm blessed. I'm
in a wonderful position

93
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:18,523
in life and boy, oh, boy, what
I'm learning... unbelievable.

94
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:23,362
Um, it's shocking to me to see
the struggles that are out there.

95
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:26,027
BLOSSOM: And everybody knows
I am a big Ellen DeGeneres fan.

96
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,816
Seeing when she first came out

97
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:30,541
as a lesbian, she had her
sitcom going and, you know,

98
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,169
they cancelled it right after and

99
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,194
it seemed like so many things
was going wrong for her, but then,

100
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:37,176
at the end, she got <i>The
Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>.

101
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:39,242
I think about nursing school that way.

102
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:40,752
I didn't get it yet,

103
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,289
but one day, I'm gonna get
it and I'm gonna stay in it.

104
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,743
(All talking at once)

105
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,779
CAITLYN: Thank you for sharing
that with us. Thank you.

106
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,545
JEN: That was an amazing afternoon.

107
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:56,885
- CAITLYN: Yeah, it really was.
- JEN: Um, life-changing.

108
00:04:56,915 --> 00:05:00,275
CAITLYN: Blossom's passion.
I loved her passion.

109
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:03,282
JEN: She's really special.
She's really special.

110
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:07,116
To see someone who was genuinely
trying, who was working really

111
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,581
hard in school, who was, you
know, getting good grades,

112
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,911
who wanted to do something with
her life, and was still being met

113
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:15,216
with obstacles, still being told no.

114
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:17,474
I think that was really kind of
shocking for Cait, that, like,

115
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:20,778
oh, gosh, this is true, like,
you as a black trans woman

116
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:24,090
can't do what you clearly want
to do and should be able to do

117
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,962
because of these
intersections of your identity.

118
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:27,552
CAITLYN: Kind of puts
it all in perspective,

119
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,311
- doesn't it?
- JEN: Yeah.

120
00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:31,116
CAITLYN: My big problem
is I'm worried about

121
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,222
some stupid paparazzi taking a picture.

122
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:34,538
JEN: We need to have these conversations.

123
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,819
We can really learn from each other.

124
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,738
CAITLYN: In? We're... Oh, right here.

125
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,523
Okay. Hola.

126
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:58,250
- (Chuckles)
- What did you think of that?

127
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,148
- JENNY: Amazing.
- (All talking at once)

128
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:03,883
CAITLYN: Okay. This is what I want to do.

129
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:07,720
Uh... I was crying during Blossom's talk

130
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,127
about what she's been through,
okay? Andrea, you're in this.

131
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:12,613
- Sit right down here.
- ANDREA: Okay.

132
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:14,509
CAITLYN: Andrea, our producer.

133
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:19,909
Um, I want you to take
that talk that she had.

134
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,702
- ANDREA: Yeah?
- CAITLYN: I want you to edit it together.

135
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:22,856
- ANDREA: Okay.
- CAITLYN: Okay, and I want you

136
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,295
- to give it to me.
- ANDREA: You got it.

137
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,780
CAITLYN: Okay? Um...

138
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,345
uh, we're gonna get her on the...

139
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,793
We're gonna get her on
The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

140
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:35,797
- I'm gonna call Ellen.
- ANDREA: Yeah.

141
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:40,338
CAITLYN: And... she's
gonna go to nursing school

142
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:43,357
- and we're gonna pay for it, okay?
- ANDREA: That's amazing.

143
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:44,438
- That's amazing.
- CAITLYN: And we're not gonna tell her

144
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,835
until then. I guarantee you...

145
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,333
Ellen sees that story.
She would have her on.

146
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,143
We got to help.

147
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,172
- ANDREA: That's amazing.
- CAITLYN: It's a great story.

148
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,696
- ANDREA: That's a great story.
- CAITLYN: Okay?

149
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:58,824
All you got to do is
edit it together. Come on.

150
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,938
CHANDI: Cait, she has the
biggest heart and she wants

151
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:07,881
to help everyone. But
she cannot save the world.

152
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,896
She's got to work on one person at a time.

153
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:14,849
And if she's able to
help that one somebody,

154
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,669
then her work is done.

155
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,638
CAITLYN: One at a time, baby! Get it done.

156
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,871
- CHANDI: Get it done.
- CAITLYN: Get it done.

157
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,274
CHANDI: Get it done.

158
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,735
RONDA: The villa in Sonoma fell through.

159
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:28,407
I'm supposed to find a villa in a day.

160
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:30,615
It took me weeks.

161
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:33,338
She's telling me that I'm
supposed to come here and have

162
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,810
fun and... and relax. And I'm not relaxing.

163
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,391
I'm actually more stressed
out than I need to be.

164
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,975
COURTNEY: I don't think
she knows that at all.

165
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:43,738
And I think she thinks, "I'm so
lucky I get to work and hang out

166
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:46,147
with my best friend every single day.

167
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,680
And she thinks you feel the same exact way.

168
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,662
RHONDA: There's no point in my
being here; I'd get more done

169
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,801
- if I were at home.
- COURTNEY: Maybe you just need

170
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,877
to talk to her, 'cause I
don't think she has any idea

171
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,565
that you feel this way.
Because when you're around her,

172
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:59,477
- you're like, "I got it, I got it... "
- RHONDA: No, I know, I know, I know;

173
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:00,855
I do want to talk to her about it,

174
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:03,211
but at this point, I'm not gonna
talk to her about it on this trip.

175
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:04,253
- COURTNEY: Yeah.
- RHONDA: This is the first

176
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,283
time she's got out and I want it

177
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:10,267
to be special for her.
We were best friends.

178
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:12,532
I took her to the hospitals
in the middle of the night.

179
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,859
- COURTNEY: I know.
- RHONDA: I nursed her back to health.

180
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:17,150
I did everything for her.

181
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,518
Now she's got all these new friends

182
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:23,133
and it's, like, she's just
acting like, "Oh, see you later."

183
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:26,219
And she doesn't see it; she doesn't.

184
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,371
- CAITLYN: Look at Chandi!
- CHANDI: Put a ring on it.

185
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:39,170
CAITLYN: I hate skates. Oh!

186
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:41,903
WOMAN: Look at Candis! She's so good!

187
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,880
CHANDI: Some days it's so
heavy, we have to let it go

188
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,622
- sometimes and have fun.
- (Laughing)

189
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,909
- SKATER (in distance): Ooh!
- BLOSSOM: Uh-oh.

190
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,209
WOMAN: Okay. Who's more attracted to men?

191
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,014
- Raise your hand.
- CANDIS: Is that a hand?

192
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,365
CAITLYN: I... I don't know.

193
00:08:57,395 --> 00:09:00,424
You would feel so much more
feminine if you were with a guy.

194
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:02,139
- WOMAN: Wait, what?
- WOMAN 2: Right.

195
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:07,054
CAITLYN: You gonna date women,
you gonna date men? I don't know.

196
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:17,630
CANDIS: All right. Ready.
Ready for a roller derby.

197
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,588
- (Laughing)
- CAITLYN: My question, Candis...

198
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:23,000
- CANDIS: Yeah?
- CAITLYN: How did you get that voice?

199
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,460
- CANDIS: I just had it.
- CAITLYN: Just had it?

200
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,823
You never had any adjustments, nothing?

201
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:29,391
- CANDIS: Nothing.
- CAITLYN: You were just fortunate

202
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,043
to have that voice,
right from the beginning.

203
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,494
CANDIS: Yeah. I work it.

204
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:34,801
- (Laughs)
- CHANDI: I don't know, I like my voice.

205
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,963
CAITLYN: I like your voice, too... no...

206
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,279
CHANDI: I like my voice. It works.

207
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,748
CAITLYN: Yeah, it just, like, it fits you.

208
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,930
CHANDI: 'Cause I know people who...

209
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:43,066
who are cisgendered women
whose voices are actually

210
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:44,556
- deeper than mine.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

211
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:47,104
CHANDI: And that's what
people say they clock me for,

212
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:48,726
- is my voice.
- CANDIS: But you know what?

213
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:52,293
The more you live with yourself
in a comfortable way, the more

214
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:54,927
you don't care if people clock
you, you know what I mean?

215
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,327
- CAITLYN: Yeah, right.
- JENNY: This... this is it, people.

216
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:58,334
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- JENNY: Get over it.

217
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,465
- Right?
- CANDIS: Get over it.

218
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:00,969
- CHANDI: Yeah, totally.
- JENNY: You know, we're gonna go

219
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,885
go just so far but then it's...
everybody else has to meet us.

220
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,160
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.
- JEN: Right, exactly.

221
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,804
People also make up the reasons
they clock you, after they know.

222
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,290
- (Laughter)
- They're like, oh... once you

223
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,213
tell them, "Oh, yeah, I could tell
by your hands, your Adam's apple

224
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:13,683
your voice." But show
a guy a random picture

225
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,264
of any regular girl and say,
"She's trans," and they go,

226
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,766
- "Oh, yeah, I can tell."
- JENNY: Oh, yeah.

227
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,067
- CANDIS: I can tell by her voice.
- JEN: I can guarantee you.

228
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,440
- They'll be like, "Oh, yeah, I can tell."
- (Laughs)

229
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,770
CANDIS: And I've always been like,

230
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,105
- shut the (bleep) up.
- CHANDI: Right.

231
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:24,272
CANDIS: You don't know (bleep).

232
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:26,634
- (Jen giggles)
- CANDIS: Sorry I'm swearing.

233
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,532
- CAITLYN: That's funny.
- CANDIS: I'm kind of from the

234
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:32,637
school of thought where...
and I hope to get Cait here...

235
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:35,293
your voice is powerful. It's who you are.

236
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:38,703
It's your identity. You
were this other person

237
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:43,064
and you're allowed to be both.
You're allowed to start from one

238
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:47,431
place and end in another and
not completely erase who you are.

239
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,874
And your voice has a lot to
do with... with who that is.

240
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:54,901
- CAITLYN: Let's go!
- CHANDI: You like ponytails, Caitlyn?

241
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:57,088
CAITLYN: I... you know what? This is
the first time I've gone with a ponytail.

242
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,075
CHANDI: Okay.

243
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:06,274
- CLERK: Hi.
- CAITLYN: 12 to a 13.

244
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:07,163
- CLERK: Okay.
- CAITLYN: Somewhere...

245
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:09,004
- somewhere in there.
- CLERK: Okay.

246
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,470
â™ª

247
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,975
- JENNY: Thank you for helping me.
- CANDIS: Of course.

248
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,287
CAITLYN: I hate skates. Whoa!

249
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:18,119
- CANDIS: Oh, no!
- CAITLYN: Look at Chandi!

250
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,377
CHANDI: Put a ring on
it. Some days are so heavy

251
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:25,382
and it's always work, work, work,
work, work, so we have to, you know,

252
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:28,948
let it go sometime and... have fun.

253
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:31,020
WOMAN: Look at Candis! She's so good!

254
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:33,905
â™ª If there's a God â™ª


255
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:38,470
â™ª surely He wants me to be myself â™ª

256
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,597
â™ª if there's a God... â™ª

257
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,566
- CANDIS: Ah.
- (Caitlyn whooping)

258
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:46,895
â™ª If there's a God! â™ª

259
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:49,916
CAITLYN: You and me, we
have a long way to fall.

260
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,607
- BLOSSOM: Yes! A long way.
- CAITLYN: So, yeah, yeah. Sing it.

261
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,301
- BLOSSOM: You're so tall.
- CAITLYN: I know.

262
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,188
- That's it. Sideways.
- BLOSSOM: Thank you,

263
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,315
- Caitlyn, for teaching me.
- CAITLYN: See, when I skate, I want

264
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:59,617
- it to go this way and this way.
- BLOSSOM: Okay.

265
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,148
Oh, my gosh, am I skating?

266
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,638
- CAITLYN: You're skating. You are skating.
- BLOSSOM: I'm skating!

267
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:06,176
- CAITLYN: Now, where's home for you?
- BLOSSOM: Mississippi.

268
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,103
- CAITLYN: Oh, you live in Mississippi.
- BLOSSOM: Yes.

269
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,369
When I graduate, I'll be the first
transgender woman from my university.

270
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,293
- CAITLYN: Really?
- BLOSSOM: Yes.

271
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,483
CAITLYN: Now, where
are you going to school?

272
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:15,617
BLOSSOM: Um, I'm at Mississippi
University for Women now,

273
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,163
and when I graduate, I want to go to DC.

274
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,875
I'm gonna apply for nursing school again.

275
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,951
I feel like there's so
much more opportunity for me

276
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,253
- there than in Mississippi.
- CAITLYN: In the nursing

277
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,781
- world?
- BLOSSOM: Yeah.

278
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,854
CAITLYN: Good! We all
gotta live our dreams.

279
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,787
BLOSSOM: That's right. I might have to go

280
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,998
the alternative route, but
I'm gonna keep going forward.

281
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:33,240
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- BLOSSOM: Keep going.

282
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,298
CAITLYN: I really can't imagine
what Blossom has gone through.

283
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,155
I mean, she's worked so hard to...

284
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:40,789
to do all the right things,
to move forward in life.

285
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:44,128
The educational system
in the United States, um,

286
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:48,260
needs to realize that these
are just normal people.

287
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,833
_

288
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:52,218
_

289
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:53,247
_

290
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:55,310
_

291
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,719
- CHANDI: Ah!
- BLOSSOM: Uh-oh.

292
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:00,042
(Chandi laughs)

293
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,864
- RONDA: Look who's here.
- ZACKARY: Hi!

294
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:14,860
CAITLYN: Oh! Well, look who's here!

295
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,438
- ZACKARY: How are you guys?
- RONDA: Blossom's here.

296
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,746
BLOSSOM: Hello, you guys, hi!
CAITLYN: Everybody's talking about you.

297
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:21,762
BLOSSOM: Hi.

298
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,444
- ZACKARY: I'm Zackary.
- BLOSSOM: Hi, I'm Blossom.

299
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,380
- Nice to meet you.
- CAITLYN: Well, let's go

300
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:28,281
up there. Let's do it.

301
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:40,360
- RONDA: Oh, my God!
- JEN: This is so gorgeous.

302
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,006
- RONDA: Let's go inside.
- CAITLYN: Let's go.

303
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:45,111
RONDA: Remember this was,
like, the last minute.

304
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,250
- CAITLYN: I love it.
- JENNY: This is beautiful.

305
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,996
- ZACKARY: I think we did good.
- CAITLYN: We did good?

306
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:51,455
- RONDA: I didn't totally fail.
- CAITLYN: Oh, good job.

307
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:52,805
JEN: You did good, honey.

308
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:54,962
- CAITLYN: You're back in our good graces.
- CANDIS: This is amazing.

309
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,502
- JEN: Who's going in?
- RONDA: I am, I am.

310
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,718
- You are.
- WOMAN: Let's go.

311
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:02,882
CAITLYN: Chandi... party in the pool.

312
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,489
I've been thinking, "Damn, I'm
feeling way too comfortable."

313
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:13,053
- (Laughter)
- CANDIS: Yeah.

314
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,848
CHANDI: It's your destiny,
Cait... what's destined

315
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,812
- to be will be.
- CANDIS: Did you think it

316
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,797
- would be this comfortable?
- CAITLYN: I've been comfortable

317
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,980
by myself my entire life.

318
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,062
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: This trip, I've been

319
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:29,603
not in my house, and I've been
out, feeling extraordinarily

320
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:33,619
comfortable being myself.
And to be honest with you,

321
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,367
- it's scary.
- CANDIS: Yeah.

322
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:40,648
CAITLYN: Because I'm already thinking,
"I don't want to go back there."

323
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:42,337
I am really enjoying

324
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,596
the peace and quiet up here.
It is so nice to be free.

325
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:50,664
In L.A., I have the... the media
coming after me, and there is

326
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:53,247
no privacy. And, you know, hey, I get it.

327
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:57,210
I'm doing this very publicly.
So I can understand that.

328
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,805
But it also can drive you crazy.
I don't want to go back home.

329
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:08,538
- CAITLYN: I don't want to go home...
- CANDIS: What do you do, then?

330
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:09,896
CAITLYN: I'm just having a
wonderful, wonderful time here.

331
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,061
- HANDI: Right.
- CANDIS: Yeah.

332
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:13,194
CAITLYN: With friends
and people that identify

333
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:16,266
with me and I identify with
them, and the stories we've had.

334
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:17,328
CANDIS: And no matter h... how

335
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,942
many people say they
understand and support...

336
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:21,738
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- CANDIS: they don't truly

337
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,025
- understand.
- CAITLYN: Understand... Nobody

338
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,417
understands it like everybody on this trip.

339
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:27,008
CANDIS: So there's... there's
a comfort level being around

340
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:29,090
- trans women that I've found.
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

341
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,431
CANDIS: So what do you
do to combat that feeling

342
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:36,367
- of not wanting to go home?
- CAITLYN: Uh, to be honest

343
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:43,321
with you, uh, I, uh, at this point,
uh, I, honestly, I really don't know.

344
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:46,596
Um, you know, I've got

345
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:51,055
five weeks until the ESPYs,
which will be my first public

346
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:53,935
appearance. Scared to death of that, 'cause

347
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:56,346
I'm doing it right in front of my peers.

348
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:57,488
CANDIS: Yeah, that's a lot of pressure.

349
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:59,582
- CHANDI: That is a lot.
- CAITLYN: Super Bowl champions,

350
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:01,772
- the... all the guys who won...
- CHANDI: All the hypermasculine men.

351
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,291
- CAITLYN: Oh, boy.
- CANDIS: What are you most

352
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:09,895
- nervous about that night?
- CAITLYN: Exposing yourself to the world.

353
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,388
Doing it live.

354
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:18,226
Five weeks, that's the day.

355
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,932
(Shuddering breath)

356
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:27,979
It's gonna be tough.

357
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:30,477
(Voicebreaking): My family...

358
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,274
(Sighs deeply, sniffles)

359
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:38,722
Not being... having my whole family there.

360
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:41,615
That's the tough part.

361
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,014
I want 'em to be proud of their daddy.

362
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:47,909
(Sniffles)

363
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,440
CHANDI: And they are. They truly are.

364
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:03,262
CAITLYN: Uh, well, yeah. So, anyway...

365
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,289
It'll be a marginal...
I hope I can hold myself

366
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,063
together... I can't even hold
myself together thinking about it.

367
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,060
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

368
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:12,784
- CAITLYN: But... I'll do it.
- CANDIS: You have the girls' support.

369
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,455
CHANDI: Yes, you do.

370
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:16,450
So give old Caitlyn a big old hug.

371
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,421
- CAITLYN: I appreciate it.
- CHANDI: Cait is on a journey

372
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:25,927
that is amazing, but, unlike
her, we... our... we didn't do

373
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:29,463
our journey underneath the
lights and cameras, you know?

374
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:34,035
So she has a whole nother can
of worms that she's investing in

375
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,904
by going through this process.

376
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,416
- CANDIS: Well, all right.
- CHANDI: Word!

377
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:49,082
CANDIS: That is a sheer suit. I love it.

378
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:53,286
- JEN: How's the water feel?
- CHANDI: It feels great.

379
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,019
JENNY: Is that... is that a one-piece?

380
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,656
CAITLYN: Uh, that's a
one-piece, this is a two...

381
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,991
- two-piece, right here.
- JENNY: Okay.

382
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,566
CAITLYN: All right, we'll
lay 'em out on the bed.

383
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:04,735
That one rocks. This is a one-piece.

384
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:07,939
- I love my daughter to death...
- JENNY: Okay.

385
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,320
- CAITLYN: Kimberly.
- JENNY: Mm-hmm.

386
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,263
CAITLYN: But this is kind of,
uh, one that Kimberly would wear.

387
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,083
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- JENNY: Uh, not really.

388
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:15,326
(Jenny laughs)

389
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:16,970
- I'm sorry.
- CAITLYN: Yes.

390
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,729
Probably a little bit more revealing

391
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,635
- in the cleavage department.
- JENNY: Oh, I see. Okay.

392
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:21,680
Well, you've got it to work with now.

393
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:23,526
CAITLYN: Well, I got
something to work with, yeah.

394
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:24,560
- You know?
- JENNY: I want to see the white.

395
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,636
- CAITLYN: I'm going with white too...
- JENNY: Yeah.

396
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,899
CAITLYN: All right.

397
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,655
CAITLYN: This is the
decision: it's the white,

398
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:32,758
over-the-one-side-of-the-shoulder outfit.

399
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,094
_

400
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:38,429
RONDA: Oh, let me see this. Look at her.

401
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,785
- What the heck?
- JENNY: Have you been swimming

402
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,985
- in your own bathing suit yet?
- CAITLYN: No.

403
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:46,791
WOMAN: Oh, my gosh.

404
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,207
CAITLYN: I can't go to
the beach or to a pool

405
00:18:49,237 --> 00:18:51,880
unless I wear one of these things anymore.

406
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,686
Putting on that bathing
suit represents a lot to me.

407
00:18:55,716 --> 00:19:01,417
Um, kind of scary because, you know,
you're really exposing yourself.

408
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:03,263
Okay, Jen, this is the big one.

409
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:07,223
I am about as nervous I
can possibly be right now.

410
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,499
- (Indistinct chatter)
- CANDIS: Bang, bang, bang.

411
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:24,369
- (Women whooping)
- CAITLYN: Okay, are you ready?

412
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,673
- OTHERS: Yeah! There she is!
- (Chattering, whooping)

413
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:32,736
- CAITLYN: We did it! Yay!
- CANDIS: Ay, ay, ay.

414
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:34,779
CAITLYN: But I'm not getting
my hair and makeup wet,

415
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:37,050
'cause we got to do this other thing, yeah.

416
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,182
Okay, I did it. I got the bathing suit on.

417
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:42,703
In the water,

418
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:44,504
it was nerve-wracking.

419
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,164
It just... yes, it felt very freeing.

420
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:51,423
And I did see my reflection
in the... in the glass door.

421
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:55,824
Looked pretty good.

422
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,109
The ability to grow

423
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,530
is directly related

424
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:03,060
to the amount of insecurity

425
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:04,966
- you can take in your life.
- JENNY: (gasps) Ooh.

426
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:06,542
CAITLYN: Do you like that one?

427
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:07,944
- JENNY: That's beautiful.
- CHANDI: Jen.

428
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,456
- JEN: I can't touch.
- JENNY: I'm now gonna do a magic trick.

429
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:12,804
Watch my eyelashes disappear.

430
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:14,965
CAITLYN: Disappear. Oh,
there they go. Okay. Whoa!

431
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,324
Okay. (laughter)

432
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:24,290
CAITLYN: Rid a motorcycle?

433
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,950
ZACKARY: I... No.

434
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:27,964
CAITLYN: Don't lie. Okay,
good... okay, say so.

435
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,595
JEN: Never. Never.

436
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:32,574
BLOSSOM: I've ridden
one, once, with someone.

437
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,050
- CAITLYN: Okay, this is scary. Okay.
- (laughter)

438
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:38,708
ZACKARY: There's this tendency
for... for trans women to

439
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:43,331
really conform to traditional
ideas of femininity, you know?

440
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:45,201
Like, as much as possible.

441
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:46,628
CAITLYN: Let's just screw it up.

442
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:49,886
ZACH: Yeah, I was just
gonna say. It's so awesome

443
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:52,155
that you're disrupting that.

444
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:55,388
CAITLYN: This is a off-road practice place,

445
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:56,774
just for women.

446
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:00,168
I have ridden motocross bikes all my life,

447
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,212
and I have all the scars to prove it.

448
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:05,369
I really thought, with the girls,
I wanted... have... do something

449
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,939
besides roller-skating

450
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,802
to kind of get 'em out
of their comfort zone,

451
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:10,556
try something very new.

452
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,409
- SHELINA: Hi, I'm Shelina.
- CAITLYN: Nice to see you.

453
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,062
SHELINA: I run Girlz Motocamps,

454
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:16,801
and we're here to teach
you guys all how to ride.

455
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,047
CAITLYN: Let's do it! I
want to see them on a bike!

456
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,906
(laughter)

457
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,288
I'm gonna be right beside
you, holding your hand.

458
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,142
JENNY: We have all this group of women

459
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:26,945
suited up and ready to ride,

460
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,976
and I think a lot of us are
a little bit afraid of it.

461
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:31,658
But the whole point of
this is to do something new,

462
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:32,880
to do something brave,

463
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,718
and to do it out in the open.

464
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:42,118
JEN: I paid a lot of money for this chest,

465
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,506
- so it needs to be protected.
- (laughs)

466
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,066
BLOSSOM: I'm about to ride a
dirt bike for the first time ever

467
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:51,421
in my good Southern country life.

468
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:54,285
Yes, it's amazing that I'm here

469
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:57,400
and that I'm trying new
experiences and everything.

470
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:00,824
- Ooh!
- CAITLYN: No...

471
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:06,458
SHELINA: You all right?

472
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,146
- BLOSSOM: Yes, yes.
- CAITLYN: Okay,

473
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:08,575
that's the worst that's gonna happen.

474
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:10,849
If you start going too fast,

475
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:12,544
just pull that clutch in,

476
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,382
- and that'll help slow you down.
- BLOSSOM: Pull it in.

477
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:15,798
- All right.
- CAITLYN: And it'll... it'll stop.

478
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:16,887
- BLOSSOM: Gotcha.
- SHELINA: Want to try again?

479
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,689
- (Blossom screams happily)
- CAITLYN: Way to go!

480
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,843
CAITLYN: Oh! Hey! That's
the stuff. There you go.

481
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:34,674
- SHELINA: That was awesome!
- CAITLYN: All right, way to go!

482
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:37,234
_

483
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,185
I've learned from Cait

484
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,937
to hang in there and you can achieve

485
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:45,131
what you want when you
take that time to do it.

486
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:49,153
- RONDA: My hand is killing me.
- COURTNEY: You need to put ice on that.

487
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:49,892
You're injured.

488
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:51,160
RONDA: I kind of had a

489
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:54,226
little accident last night
when we were roller-skating.

490
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,609
CAITLYN: Let's go. You ready?

491
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:56,982
- RONDA: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Where's all your stuff?

492
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:57,909
RONDA: Caitlyn.

493
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,278
- Ow!
- CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

494
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:02,527
Look at that hand. It's looking worse.

495
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:04,629
Grab my finger. See? You can ride.

496
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:05,439
That's all you need to do.

497
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,445
- COURTNEY: Don't pull it.
- RONDA: Really?

498
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:08,096
CAITLYN: Yeah, that's all you need to do. ?

499
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,264
(engine starts)

500
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:18,105
CAITLYN: All right!

501
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:20,577
CANDIS: I'm riding!

502
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:24,060
CAITLYN: That's it.

503
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:26,571
CANDIS: It was so fun.

504
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:32,063
Oh. I've always wanted to do that.

505
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,697
CAITLYN: Look it, her hair's still perfect.

506
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:35,070
That's not fair.

507
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:37,894
SHELINA: Thank you all for
coming to Girlz Motocamps.

508
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:40,963
- (all whooping)
- I'm really proud of all of you guys.

509
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,004
CAITLYN: This group has been
through a lot in their lives,

510
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,927
and to see everybody out there
with a smile, having some fun,

511
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,792
um, and overcoming another obstacle,

512
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:51,653
uh, has been really great, and you guys
did good. I was really proud of you.

513
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,044
It's an experience we'll
always remember together.

514
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,910
And last but not least, we're
all very jealous of your hair.

515
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,468
- (laughter)
- Yeah. Yeah, look at that.

516
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:01,525
Look at that head of hair she's got.

517
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:03,101
Oh, my God!

518
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:14,131
JENNY: Because I'm a gentleman,

519
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:15,927
I'll hold your chair for you.

520
00:24:16,574 --> 00:24:19,633
- ZACKARY: To Caitlyn for having us.
- CAITLYN: Yay!

521
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:24,973
And to everybody here for
helping out on this cause.

522
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:27,245
CANDIS: I want to hear what it is like

523
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:31,218
to date as a trans woman in our community.

524
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,315
WOMAN: Caitlyn, you start.

525
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:35,837
(laughter)

526
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:38,191
CAITLYN: Absolutely nothing.

527
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,689
(laughter)

528
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,874
CHANDI: I know for a fact
you've said many times

529
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:46,218
that you've only been attracted
to women. You've never been...

530
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:47,680
CAITLYN: I've only been with women.

531
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,564
CHANDI: And only been attracted to them.

532
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:53,341
CAITLYN: I got bigger things
than an orgasm to worry about.

533
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:54,740
CHANDI: Bigger things to figure out.

534
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,422
CAITLYN: Bigger things to
worry about than orgasms.

535
00:24:56,424 --> 00:24:58,424
WOMAN: Who's more attracted to men?

536
00:24:58,426 --> 00:24:59,733
Raise your hand.

537
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:02,924
JENNY: Is that a hand?

538
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,379
CAITLYN: I... I don't know.

539
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:06,134
- I don't know.
- WOMAN: She doesn't know.

540
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,480
CAITLYN: I've never been with a guy.

541
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:11,355
Are you gonna date women? You gonna
date men? What are you gonna do?

542
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,455
I don't know.

543
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:17,972
CAITLYN: The whole dance
between a male and a female...

544
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,379
- WOMAN: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: um,

545
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:22,247
you would feel so much more
feminine if you were with a guy.

546
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:24,957
- WOMAN: Wait, what?
- CAITLYN: No.

547
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,386
- WOMAN: Wait, what?
- RONDA: Just physically.

548
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:28,098
CAITLYN: You would feel more feminine,

549
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:30,671
like you say, if you're with a guy

550
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:31,919
who treats you that way.

551
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:36,015
I can appreciate the male form, okay?

552
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,636
Um...

553
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,369
JENNY: I love to hear you say that.

554
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:40,851
I've never heard you say that before.

555
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:44,492
CAITLYN: Yeah. Or you could look
at... yeah, you can appreciate that.

556
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:49,274
Um, it... it doesn't mean that I
would go that... I... I don't know,

557
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:51,851
- unless I... I got there.
- CHANDI: Right.

558
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:56,573
CAITLYN: And for me,
if that was the case...

559
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,863
as far as a male/female relationship,

560
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:03,134
I would want to have the right parts.

561
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,774
WOMAN: The parts you feel comfortable with?

562
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:07,352
- CAITLYN: What's that?
- WOMAN: The parts you'd feel comfortable with?

563
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,782
CAITLYN: Uh, yes, and he
feels comfortable with.

564
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:13,055
But I... I don't count anything
out in the fu... I don't

565
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,127
know where it's all going.

566
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,420
CHANDI: Cait is going to

567
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,400
figure out who she wants to date.

568
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:22,773
She says that she's never
had an interest in men before,

569
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,224
but she's hot, so

570
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,289
what are you gonna do when
men begin to approach you?

571
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:30,799
JENNY: I think I'm the only woman here who

572
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,715
was and is exclusively

573
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:34,177
attracted to women

574
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:36,320
before and after and

575
00:26:36,354 --> 00:26:38,179
I'm not less of a woman or less feminine

576
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,519
because I'm attracted to women.

577
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,813
CAITLYN: Absolutely, I agree.

578
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:42,642
But that... that, absolutely, I agree,

579
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,689
because that's the way you feel.

580
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:46,602
CHANDI: And it's so good that people

581
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:50,038
are now having to realize that gender

582
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,149
- is more than just male and female.
- WOMAN: Yes.

583
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:56,340
CHANDI: I want someone who
is a great all-around person,

584
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,359
regardless of whether
you're masculine or feminine.

585
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:02,427
I just want you to be cool.
I want you to be somebody

586
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,795
who I can chill with. Um,

587
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:07,313
if you like Beyoncé,
that's a bonus, you know?

588
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:08,320
(laughter)

589
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:19,521
JENNY: Ronda.

590
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,828
I just didn't,

591
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:23,087
I didn't know your history.
I didn't know that you were,

592
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:24,111
you were friends.

593
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:25,380
RONDA: We're best friends.

594
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:28,132
Like, we would go to
m... movies twice a week.

595
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:29,818
We would have dinner.

596
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,134
She'd come to my house.

597
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:33,233
And I miss my friendship with her.

598
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,021
And I feel like

599
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:37,222
everyone else is kind of trumping me.

600
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:40,522
JENNY: I mean, right now she
is a woman walking in sunshine.

601
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:41,211
RONDA: Oh, exactly.

602
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,027
- JENNY: You know, for the first time.
- RONDA: Yeah.

603
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,973
JENNY: She's not gonna
forget who her friends are.

604
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:46,813
The place she's at right now

605
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:48,476
- is not the place she's gonna stay.
- RONDA: Okay... oh!

606
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:49,482
JENNY: You know, and...

607
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:51,621
RONDA: Well, I don't know.
'Cause I feel like she's so happy

608
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,300
and she's so, like, high and,

609
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,612
- like, I want her to be happy like that.
- JENNY: Well, yeah, she'll, she'll,

610
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:56,796
she'll stay high and happy.

611
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,138
My best friend from... from high school,

612
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:01,268
he was caught off-guard by my transition.

613
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:03,022
He didn't, he didn't quite get it.

614
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,011
I mean, he said he loved me.

615
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:05,318
He said he... he'd follow me,

616
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:07,135
but he had no idea what
I was talking about.

617
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,649
There are times when you're close,
there are times when you're less close,

618
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:13,579
but you know, friendship-friendship
is a long game.

619
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:14,856
- RONDA: No, exactly.
- JENNY: And,

620
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:17,261
but none of that means
it doesn't hurt right now,

621
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:19,947
and, so, the best thing you
can do is take care of yourself.

622
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:21,844
Have you talked to her about this?

623
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:24,708
RONDA: I want to, but I can't do it now.

624
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:26,119
I don't want her to know.

625
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:27,975
(voice breaking): I don't want her to know.

626
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:29,432
JENNY: What don't you want her to know?

627
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:34,693
RONDA: I miss, I miss what we had before.

628
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:38,480
JENNY: You ever had a friend who... who

629
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:39,486
- got married?
- RONDA: No...

630
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:41,870
- Yes! Yes.
- JENNY: Who's, and... and like,

631
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:43,377
and like, the, like, the...

632
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:44,827
between the engagement and the wedding...

633
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,565
- RONDA: Yes, yes.
- JENNY: they were, like, and they were your best friend

634
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:47,558
and suddenly they were, like,

635
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,111
- monsters?
- RONDA: Mm-hmm.

636
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:50,732
JENNY: Like the Bridezilla thing?

637
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:53,162
- RONDA: Well, yes...
- JENNY: There is such a thing as Transzilla.

638
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:56,216
RONDA: (laughing): Is
that what it's called?

639
00:28:56,225 --> 00:28:58,036
JENNY: I, well, I would, I
would never say that because...

640
00:28:58,065 --> 00:28:59,894
RONDA: See, you're making me
feel better, because it's like

641
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,935
now I feel like I'm not crazy.

642
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,116
- Thank you.
- JENNY: Okay.

643
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,310
RONDA: Thank you.

644
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:09,969
I really thank you, Jenny.

645
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:12,524
CAITLYN: Blossom, I want to
say thank you for everything.

646
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:14,211
- BLOSSOM: Oh...
- CAITLYN: You're a really a great person.

647
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:16,086
- BLOSSOM: Thank you. So are you.
- CAITLYN: Go back home and I wish you nothing but the best.

648
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,619
Blossom just wants to make
this world a better place.

649
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:21,877
And with help from friends,

650
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:23,773
you can kind of conquer the world.

651
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,222
You can go out into the world

652
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,515
and be accepted and be understood

653
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:30,016
and be a productive citizen.

654
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:33,447
JENNY: Oh, my God, that... that's
perfect. That's (bleep) perfect.

655
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:35,748
BLOSSOM: Yeah, I was getting tired
of holding it just a little bit.

656
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:38,405
_

657
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:39,779
BLOSSOM: I love you.

658
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:51,241
- CAITLYN: Candis?
- CANDIS: Yeah?

659
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:52,959
CAITLYN: I have a fashion question.

660
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,928
- You're wearing that outfit.
- CANDIS: Right.

661
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:57,627
CAITLYN: With a bra
that you see the straps.

662
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:00,258
- CANDIS: Right.
- CAITLYN: Now I always wonder

663
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:03,394
is that, oh, is that, like, permissible?

664
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:05,032
CANDIS: In a casual setting it is.

665
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:06,352
CAITLYN: In a casual setting it is?

666
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,383
- CANDIS: Yeah.
 - CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

667
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:09,200
CAITLYN: A little wine tasting.

668
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:10,694
SHARON: Great to meet you all!

669
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,607
Welcome! We like to

670
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,908
start off our celebration with a saber,

671
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:18,955
so if anyone is up for sabering
the first bottle that we open.

672
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,750
CAITLYN: Okay, all right.

673
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:22,812
One, two...

674
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:26,437
- Whoa!
- First try.

675
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:28,211
CANDIS: First try.

676
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:29,781
SHARON: That came off beautifully.

677
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,614
- CAITLYN: Just like I knew what I was doing.
- SHARON: It was perfect, yes.

678
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:33,327
(laughter)

679
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,414
So, cheers to your celebration.

680
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:38,120
CANDIS: I was always told
you were supposed to look

681
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:40,111
- people in the eye when you cheers them.
- ZACKARY: Yes, ma'am.

682
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,166
CAITLYN: To a great four days together.

683
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:43,351
WOMEN: Yes.

684
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,367
JENNY: Outside of your
own family, what woman

685
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:48,559
has had the greatest influence on you?

686
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:50,848
CAITLYN: That's a great question.

687
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:52,179
ZACKARY: Flawless Sabrina

688
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:55,392
started running drag contests in 1959.

689
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:58,637
CAITLYN: You're not old enough to
even know anybody that was in the '60s.

690
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:01,297
ZACKARY: Well, I love elder
folks and I always have, so...

691
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,155
CAITLYN: Well, that's good,
yeah, that's good, okay.

692
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:05,790
- (laughter)
- CHANDI: Um, Caitlyn Jenner.

693
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:09,482
CAITLYN: Ooh! Baby, baby, baby!

694
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,261
- JENNY: I'll drink to that.
- CAITLYN: Chandi,

695
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,376
I appreciate that.

696
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,633
CANDIS: Miss Loudon, who ran
the drama department in...

697
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:19,003
in the high school, Baldwin High, um,

698
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,397
she...

699
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:23,074
she was always there, you know?

700
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,214
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.
- CANDIS: I don't want to get emotional, that's stupid.

701
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:29,124
CAITLYN: No, you know, it's
important, the people that

702
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:32,050
had such a big impact on your life.

703
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:35,508
CANDIS: She was, she... she helped
all the kids that couldn't fit in...

704
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,260
have a place to fit in.

705
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,548
(quietly): So...

706
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,076
CAITLYN: Well...

707
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,763
CANDIS: And I was one of them.

708
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:44,961
CAITLYN: That is a great,
yeah, that's a great legacy.

709
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,078
Outside of family,

710
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:49,897
you guys have probably had
the biggest impact on me ever,

711
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:51,739
you know? And listening to your stories

712
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,442
and what you're doing and feeling
comfortable about yourself and...

713
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,131
Out of women in my life,

714
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:58,377
I probably learned more in the last month

715
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,403
about me and about life...

716
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:03,385
uh, than ever before in my entire life.

717
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,558
Okay.

718
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:10,856
I got to say something.

719
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:15,848
(sighs)

720
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,022
CAITLYN (voice breaking): Months...

721
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:21,739
months and months ago,

722
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:23,685
I...

723
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:25,196
(sniffling quietly)

724
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:27,560
Damn it.

725
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:31,217
I thought about doing this show.

726
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:39,026
And I thought how could I do a show

727
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:41,155
that's gonna make a difference...

728
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:42,775
in the world?

729
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,680
And I had all these ideas.

730
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:49,369
All these things.

731
00:32:50,455 --> 00:32:54,878
And I'm struggling with it.
And I'm thinking about my family

732
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,682
and I'm thinking about
all this kind of stuff

733
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,369
and I struggled with all this stuff.

734
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:03,255
And seeing the things that you
have gone through in your life

735
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,202
and being so honest with this,

736
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:10,666
and I so apprec... appreciate all your,

737
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,027
your input.

738
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:13,163
This has been great.

739
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:17,853
You know, it just really has been
great and the damn wine got to me!

740
00:33:17,894 --> 00:33:18,917
(laughter)

741
00:33:19,037 --> 00:33:21,657
I don't know if it was
the pinot or whatever,

742
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:24,025
but I so appreciate your honesty.

743
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,264
- JENNY: Everybody on Jenner.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah, oh, no.

744
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:29,173
- You don't have to do that.
- JENNY: Yep.

745
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,836
CAITLYN: No, no, no. But, um,
I so appreciate your honesty

746
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:35,142
and all that kind of stuff. Um,

747
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:38,332
it's just been great. What
has really impressed me

748
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,446
is, at this point in their life, how normal

749
00:33:41,784 --> 00:33:43,090
these girls are.

750
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:46,503
And I just see great examples of people

751
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:49,755
who have overcome tremendous
obstacles in their life.

752
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,874
And it turned out on the other
end, coming out the other side,

753
00:33:52,928 --> 00:33:54,114
a better person.

754
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,104
I know, Candis, you're
gonna need some Visine.

755
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:58,529
You're turning into me.

756
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:01,055
Emotional absolute wreck.

757
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:03,607
- Wow.
- CHANDI: And that's okay.

758
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:04,871
ZACKARY: It's okay.

759
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,389
CANDIS: Caitlyn, she has a
story that you should hear.

760
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:09,184
- CAITLYN: I want to hear.
- SHARON: Well,

761
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:12,250
your transformation has

762
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:14,463
helped me to understand my father

763
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,526
in a way that I never did before.

764
00:34:16,572 --> 00:34:17,428
CAITLYN: Really!

765
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,065
SHARON: He used to dress up

766
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,480
and go to San Francisco in the '70s.

767
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:23,840
He just came to us and told us the truth,

768
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:26,141
that he couldn't live the lie anymore.

769
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:29,942
And he needed to move on and be who he was.

770
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:32,594
That one point that you made, about

771
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:37,346
- being on your deathbed and not living your life...
- CAITLYN: It's so true.

772
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:39,984
SHARON: It... I knew, you
know, at that moment I knew,

773
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,721
when he came to us and
had to tell us the truth

774
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:44,017
- and how hard that was for all of us.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

775
00:34:44,022 --> 00:34:46,619
SHARON: But it still... was him being free.

776
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:48,515
CAITLYN: So wonderful to hear that story.

777
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,837
- It makes my heart feel so good.
- SHARON: It's beautiful.

778
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:54,086
- CAITLYN: Thank you. I appreciate that.
- SHARON: It's absolutely beautiful. Thank you.

779
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,407
(sniffles) (bleep) damn
it! This is so good!

780
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,283
I love this stuff!

781
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:00,245
(laughter)

782
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,082
(birds chirping)

783
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:04,395
(crickets chirping)

784
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:07,877
CAITLYN: This is our last dinner together.

785
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:10,147
- WOMAN: Cheers, everybody.
- JENNY: Love, love.

786
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:12,992
- WOMAN 2: Love, love, love.
- JENNY: Lovey, love, love. Love.

787
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:15,278
CHANDI: Candis talking about high school

788
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:18,243
put me in the frame of mind
of where I was starting to

789
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,379
try to remember those teachers
and those experiences that I had.

790
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:25,393
How was high school for you ladies?

791
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:27,226
JENNY: More light dinner conversation?

792
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:28,569
- CHANDI: Yeah.
- WOMAN: Oh, God.

793
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:31,465
JENNY: My experience of high
school was a lot of bullying,

794
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:36,788
a lot of being beaten up and
teased for being, um, trans.

795
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:39,999
Which was weird, 'cause I
was trying not to be feminine,

796
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:42,400
but people just saw it
in me. They just, they...

797
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:44,435
they could see it in me no matter
how much I tried to hide it.

798
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:46,539
ZACKARY: You know, I never
had the option to hide.

799
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:49,139
I mean, I was bullied a lot. I got,

800
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:52,861
- like, death threats in my locker, I was...
- CAITLYN: Wow.

801
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:56,713
ZACKARY: I never was able to
go into the boys' locker room.

802
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,594
- WOMAN: For fear...
- ZACKARY: For gym class.

803
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:02,877
ZACKARY: So I would change
in sort of, like, a...

804
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:06,275
a remote bathroom that
nobody used, you know?

805
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,838
And then I would run across
the school to go to gym class,

806
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,567
- every other day.
- CAITLYN: Wow.

807
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:14,987
Have you all had fun coming
here and discussing this?

808
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,929
- JENNY: Yes!
- ZACKARY: Oh, my God, I'm so thirsty for it.

809
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,921
JEN: We're actually all learning,
just in having these conversations.

810
00:36:19,957 --> 00:36:21,237
CANDIS: Yeah. I mean, I haven't

811
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:25,989
bawled like that, just talking
about a teacher, in years.

812
00:36:26,036 --> 00:36:27,925
Like, I hadn't even thought about that.

813
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:30,859
- (laughter)
- CAITLYN: So all we have now is happy stories.

814
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,064
If I hear... if you get
me crying one more time...

815
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,945
you're going to lose
your dessert privileges.

816
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:43,564
(knocking at door)

817
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:46,169
- JENNY: Cait, I hate to bother you...
- CAITLYN: Jenny!

818
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,694
JENNY: I know you're... I
know it's been a long day.

819
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:49,824
CAITLYN: Look at my good boots.

820
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:52,554
- JENNY: Oh, those are awesome. I...
- CAITLYN: From motocross.

821
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,381
- JENNY: Oh!
- CAITLYN: Lookit, they're all dusty.

822
00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:56,991
I gotta take care of my stuff.

823
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,293
JENNY: Right now, you're
in this thing that we call

824
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:00,975
"the pink cloud."

825
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:02,483
- (chuckles)
- Which is...

826
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:07,176
which is this place of
euphoria and happiness.

827
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:08,989
- Which is...
- CAITLYN: I... I do feel pretty good.

828
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,009
- JENNY: Which is good, right?
- CAITLYN: I wouldn't quite go with a "pink cloud,"

829
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:12,309
but yeah, I... I would go with...

830
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,917
Yeah, I feel, I feel good. Right.

831
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:15,650
JENNY: And... and that's, that's good.

832
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:17,258
- CAITLYN: It is good.
- JENNY: But it also means

833
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:19,663
that you can be a little blind to...

834
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,654
things other than yourself.

835
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:24,831
The conversation that I had

836
00:37:25,062 --> 00:37:27,572
with Ronda last night made
me feel a little funny.

837
00:37:27,614 --> 00:37:29,347
I... I'm, I'm just afraid that

838
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:31,265
you're kind of in the
midst of this whirlwind

839
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,131
and you're forgetting some of the...

840
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:35,629
- CAITLYN: Um...
- JENNY: some of the people that you love.

841
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:41,133
You've got to find a way of getting...

842
00:37:41,856 --> 00:37:43,046
as soon as you can,

843
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:45,020
outside of yourself.

844
00:37:49,012 --> 00:37:50,918
(birds singing)

845
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:52,568
CAITLYN: Did everybody have a good time?

846
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,538
- ZACKARY: Yes, ma'am.
- CANDIS: It was so much fun.

847
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,040
- I can't wait to do it again soon.
- (laughter)

848
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,481
CAITLYN: Let's go climb Mount Everest!

849
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:00,522
- (laughter)
- CANDIS: I don't know about that one.

850
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:02,263
- JENNY: Don't forget the skydiving.
- CAITLYN: We could be the first trans girls

851
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:04,595
to the top of Mount Everest!

852
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,385
I mean, we could do something.
We gotta break ground, here.

853
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:08,951
CANDIS: I'll be at base
camp and I'll just, like,

854
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:10,512
- cheer you on.
- CAITLYN: You'll be fine...

855
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:13,089
ZACKARY: If you feel cooped up at home,

856
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,290
- I would love to come over and visit your house.
- CAITLYN: Yeah. You got it.

857
00:38:15,303 --> 00:38:17,325
- Yeah, yeah.
- ZACKARY: Watch a movie.

858
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,272
- CAITLYN: All right, baby.
- CHANDI: Mmm...

859
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:21,417
CAITLYN: We are out of here. Good luck.

860
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,562
JENNY: Cait has come so far.

861
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:26,618
Here's a woman who's lived largely,

862
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,808
for 65 years, in her head.

863
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:30,792
And suddenly, she's with

864
00:38:31,013 --> 00:38:34,450
this whole team of... of women, having fun

865
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,752
and learning about the community.

866
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:39,111
I cannot wait to see what she does next.

867
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:40,046
It's gonna be awesome.

868
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:43,083
- CAITLYN: Candis and I are leaving together.
- (all laughing)

869
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:45,282
- But we'll see you back in L.A.
- CANDIS: Love you, girls.

870
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:46,732
- ZACKARY: Bye.
- CHANDI: Bye, baby.

871
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:50,754
Candis and Caitlyn in
the tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

872
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:53,654
CANDIS: Seeing Caitlyn
discovering this, like,

873
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:57,092
this new world has been
kind of amazing, because

874
00:38:57,116 --> 00:39:00,153
no matter what situation you're in,

875
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:03,356
no matter how far along
you are in one life,

876
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:06,373
you have the power to change it

877
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:09,578
yourself, with strength and courage.

878
00:39:09,662 --> 00:39:11,885
CAITLYN: Back to reality. At
some point, you gotta go back.

879
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:13,285
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

880
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:14,772
- CANDIS: Face the music.
- CAITLYN: I know.

881
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:16,095
But it certainly was nice.

882
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:17,866
I really love these girls.

883
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:19,448
We're gonna be friends forever.

884
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,724
And I learned so much from them.

885
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,451
I have realized my voice is, like,

886
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,217
the last thing to worry about.

887
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:27,805
It's about the words that come out,

888
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,913
the importance of those words.

889
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,471
Not about the pitch.

890
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:32,661
Through this whole trip,

891
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:34,307
I learned a lot about life

892
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:37,014
and that, to me, is the most
important thing, 'cause I want

893
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,141
to keep learning

894
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,175
and take it day by day.

895
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:42,777
CANDIS: So we're home. You ready for this?

896
00:39:42,957 --> 00:39:44,890
CAITLYN: No. I know. Am
I ready for these things?

897
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,327
CANDIS: You're gonna be good.

898
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:49,149
- You're gonna be good.
- CAITLYN: It is... it's just back to the "real world."

899
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,045
CANDIS: Yeah, the real world.

900
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,154
SINGER: â™ª If there's a God... â™ª

901
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:59,258
â™ª Surely He wants me to be myself â™ª

902
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:02,385
â™ª If there's a God â™ª

903
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:07,361
â™ª If there's a God... â™ª

904
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:09,344
CAITLYN: Want a pickle?

905
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,936
RONDA: I'll have a French fry.

906
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,375
CAITLYN: God, that pickle's sour.

907
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:15,911
- (Ronda laughs)
- Um...

908
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:18,354
so what is the deal

909
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:21,230
with you and Jenny talking?
Honestly, what's going on?

910
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:23,324
RONDA: I feel like...

911
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:26,111
everything's changed,

912
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:26,869
- and it...
- CAITLYN: Everything's what?

913
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:28,986
- RONDA: Well, obviously, everything's changed.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

914
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:29,558
RONDA: But

915
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,438
for me, the most...

916
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:32,534
I... I...

917
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:35,134
I've been working for
you for two years, and...

918
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:35,677
CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

919
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:37,480
RONDA: we've been friends for

920
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,918
that amount of time...
well, me and Caitlyn.

921
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,258
- CAITLYN: And, yeah... and before that.
- RONDA: And longer.

922
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,872
And.. but everything's, like...

923
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:44,870
Now it's like this, like,

924
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,398
rollercoaster and I feel like

925
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:50,245
I don't even exist anymore, other than,

926
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:52,128
like, "Uh, where's my Starbucks?"

927
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:53,625
CAITLYN: We have been,

928
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:55,830
- obviously, very busy.
- RONDA: Yeah, I know.

929
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:56,769
CAITLYN: Um...

930
00:40:57,577 --> 00:40:59,284
Sometimes, when I get like this,

931
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:02,354
you know, I... I kind of
go a little crazy, okay?

932
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:04,312
And I think I miss out

933
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:05,909
on the important things in life.

934
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:08,146
The important things
in life are friendship.

935
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:09,686
And I've always,

936
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:11,230
you know, for the last two years,

937
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,694
so appreciated your friendship.

938
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,104
You were there for surgeries,

939
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:16,205
you're there, you're driving
me, all that kind of stuff.

940
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:19,439
And if I seem a little cold, insensitive,

941
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:20,806
I apologize.

942
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:24,711
RONDA: Do you realize we used
to go to the movies all the time?

943
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,259
CAITLYN: Let's go to a movie right now.

944
00:41:28,763 --> 00:41:29,722
RONDA: Really?

945
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:32,012
- CAITLYN: Damn it, let's go to a movie.
- RONDA: Okay, let's go.

946
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,509
CAITLYN: Okay. Come on.

947
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:36,331
- Come on. Let's go.
- RONDA: Okay.

948
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:37,400
CAITLYN: Get your... get your little thing,

949
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:39,588
- so we can get the tickets on the way.
- RONDA: All right.

950
00:41:39,618 --> 00:41:41,695
- CAITLYN: See, you can't...
- RONDA: Okay, I love you.

951
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,796
CAITLYN: You just love me. I know, I know.

952
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,162
RONDA: No, you're supposed to love me, too.

953
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:45,378
CAITLYN: I know. I do love you.

954
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:46,968
RONDA: No, actually, you're
supposed to say, "I love you."

955
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:49,320
CAITLYN: Okay? I do. Man,
this is one sour pickle.

956
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,465
- That's all I can say.

CANDIS (laughing): You
made it up the stairs.

959

CAITLYN: Candis and I have been
spending a lot of time together.

WOMAN: We are freaks to a lot of the world.

963
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:09,661
CAITLYN: We're really
trying to normalize this.

964
00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:12,671
WOMAN: The reason you want to is
'cause you don't want to be a freak.

965

KIM: I read the Vanity Fair.

966
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:16,865
You look amazing, but
you don't have to bash us.

967
00:42:16,906 --> 00:42:17,927
CAITLYN: Don't go there.

968
00:42:18,418 --> 00:42:20,473
We really haven't had
a chance to talk after

969
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,569
you sent me those tough texts.

COURTNEY: When you try to tell me

971
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,889
that I don't know what I'm
talking about because I...

972
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:27,113
CAITLYN: Because you don't know.
