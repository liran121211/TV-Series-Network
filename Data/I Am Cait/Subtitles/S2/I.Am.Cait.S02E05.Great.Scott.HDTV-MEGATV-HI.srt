00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:03,678
- CAITLYN: Disick is in the house.
- SCOTT: Hello!

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,552
CAITLYN: I don't think Scott
and I have ever really "bonded."

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,691
SCOTT: Come on, girls.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,873
JENNY: The purse, can I just
say, it's a slippery slope.

5
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:11,123
- Be careful.
- SCOTT: I know.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,651
CAITLYN: Come on, let's ride!

7
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:15,431
(revs engine)

8
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:17,814
CHANDI: Back in the day,

9
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:21,001
I was running around with the wrong crowd,

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,133
and I ended up going to prison.

11
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:27,331
CANDIS: You're cute. I
could totally kiss you.

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,290
It's really nice to be able to, like,

13
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:32,108
have something with somebody that I like.

14
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,402
What are you thinking?

15
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:39,939
Being on this trip, it's so so weird,

16
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:42,730
- I can't remember what day it is.
- CHANDI: Is it Monday?

17
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:45,153
- JENNY: Today is "Mundy" night.
- CHANDI: Exactly.

18
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:46,827
CANDIS: Monday? "Mundy"?

19
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:48,524
- JENNY: "Mundy" night.
- CANDIS: "Mundy."

20
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:49,915
- JENNY: "Mundy."
- CHANDI: "Mundy"?

21
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,242
JENNY: Do I say other things
with... with an accent?

22
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,000
- "Mundy." "Mundy" night.
- CHANDI: "Mundy." "Mundy."

23
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,082
JENNY: Mon... Mon-day. What do you say?

24
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,875
- CANDIS: Monday.
- JENNY: "Mundy."

25
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:59,828
- CHANDI: "Mundy." (laughing)
- JENNY: What?

26
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:02,881
- Wait, you say it.
- CHANDI: Monday.

27
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:05,226
- JENNY: "Mundy."
- CHANDI: "Mundy." (laughs)

28
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:08,083
- She's like, "What?"
- ELLA: "Toosdy."

29
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:09,568
- JENNY: Mon... Monday?
- CHANDI: Monday.

30
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:11,907
- JENNY: Mon... Monday.
- CHANDI: "Mundy."

31
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:14,178
- JENNY: Is that how you say it, "Mon-day"?
- CHANDI: "Mundy"?

32
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:15,680
(laughs)

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,661
We got our lives on "Mundy."

34
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,821
(laughter) JENNY: You're killing me.

35
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:23,276
(laughter) CHANDI: J.B.!

36
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,140
- (Candis laughing)
- Whew!

37
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:28,204
- ELLA: It's "Mundy."
- CHANDI: Well, actually, it's Tuesday.

38
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:29,448
It's Tuesday now.

39
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,408

(phone ringing)

42
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:55,001
- CAITLYN: There you are!
- KOURTNEY: How's it going?

43
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:57,396
CAITLYN: It's going, actually, very well.

44
00:01:57,413 --> 00:02:00,706
I'm on Highway 70 to St. Louis, Missouri.

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,788
KOURTNEY: Oh, nice!

46
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,585
- CAITLYN: And guess who called me.
- KOURTNEY: Yeah. Who?

47
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,064
CAITLYN: Scott.

48
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:08,464
- KOURTNEY: Oh, really?
- CAITLYN: He kind of reached out.

49
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:09,909
Kind of wanted to talk,

50
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,497
hang out, so he's on his...
"supposably" on his way to St. Louis. So,

51
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,450
he's gonna meet us there tomorrow.

52
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,834
KOURTNEY: Oh, no way!

53
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:21,501
CAITLYN: So, yeah. So, I just
kind of wanted to check with you

54
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,090
- KOURTNEY: Yeah, that's fine with me.
- CAITLYN: Oh, okay.

55
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:26,044
I hear he's sober.

56
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,440
Is that what you hear?

57
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:31,893
KOURTNEY: Yeah, he's been sober.
He's been seeing the kids every day.

58
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:34,600
CAITLYN: Yeah, well,
good. I... I'm glad he's,

59
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:36,129
you know, doing well.

60
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:39,846
I have not seen Scott since
he got back from rehab.

61
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:42,095
You know, he's been through a lot, so

62
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,954
I would love for him
to be around the girls,

63
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,684
who have been through
so much in their life

64
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,749
and have come out so well.

65
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:51,679
So I think he's gonna spend a
day with... with me and the girls.

66
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:54,392
- KOURTNEY: Okay, fun!
- CAITLYN: Okay. Good, good.

67
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,776
All right, then it should begood.

68
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:57,199
Love you! Bye!

69
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,030
KOURTNEY: Love you! Bye!

70
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:01,877
KATE: Who is Scott?

71
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:06,096
CAITLYN: Scott is my stepdaughter
Kourtney's baby daddy.

72
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:07,737
KATE: Oh...

73
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:08,703
CAITLYN: They never got married,

74
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,367
but they just had three kids together.

75
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:11,784
Wonderful little kids.

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,011
Scott is not a bad guy, but he's got...

77
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,585
he's had a huge drinking problem.

78
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:20,536
And it's really had a
major impact on his life.

79
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:23,294
So he's trying to get
his life back together.

80
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:25,331
You know, he's been through a lot.

81
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:28,992
So, uh, anyway, he's
gonna meet us in St. Louis.

82
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:37,021
- Chandi, to get back on a serious note...
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:39,638
CAITLYN: As you know better
than anybody, we had a bad year.

84
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:43,091
21 hate crimes towards trans women.

85
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:45,472
So many of these women,

86
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,318
- especially in the homicide side of it...
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

87
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,418
- CAITLYN: ... uh, are trans women of color.
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

88
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:54,831
CAITLYN: Why?

89
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:59,681
CHANDI: Well, a lot of them don't
get the love that they need at home.

90
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:02,052
It's a lot easier for... for parents

91
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,363
to accept their children being gay.

92
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:07,503
Being trans is taking things
to a whole nother level.

93
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,783
That's... a little bit
harder for them to accept.

94
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,326
They choose to,

95
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:16,602
in most cases, put their children
out. That's why they have to turn

96
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:21,681
to, um, survival sex
and survival situations

97
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:25,943
in order for them to be able to
navigate themselves through life.

98
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:28,037
CAITLYN: Do they understand
the dangers of doing it,

99
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,555
- what they're doing?
- CHANDI: They don't care about the danger.

100
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:31,623
CANDIS: They know the dangers,

101
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,409
- but they don't care.
- CAITLYN: They don't care?

102
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,804
- CANDIS: They don't care.
- CHANDI: ... on the street.

103
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:36,821
- CANDIS: They need to survive day to day.
- CHANDI: They need a...

104
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,768
a roof over their head at night.

105
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:41,363
They need to know where their
next meal is coming from.

106
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:46,282
It's all about making money
to survive on the streets.

107
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:51,431
CAITLYN: Why is it so difficult
for trans women of color

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,217
- to get a job?
- CHANDI: A lot of times,

109
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,308
- race plays a big part of it.
- CANDIS: It really does.

110
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:59,007
- CHANDI: It does.
- CAITLYN: That's shocking to me.

111
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,721
- CHANDI: That's how it's been.
- CAITLYN: I... I... No. O... obviously.

112
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:05,197
I... I've never seen it, so... but
I... obviously, you lived through this.

113
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:08,880
- But I... I...
- CHANDI: I do feel like Cait needs to embrace

114
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:13,158
the issues that African-American
trans women go through

115
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:16,925
a little more, but it's still a
journey that she'll never relate to

116
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,857
in any way.

117
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,470
CANDIS: Oh, the Arch! The St. Louis Arch.

118
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:32,107
- CAITLYN: The Arch of St. Louis!
- ELLA: Oh, my golly!

119
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,981
- CAITLYN: There it is, right over there. See it?
- KIP: Oh, wow, look at it!

120
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,928
ELLA: Oh, yeah!

121
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:39,977
♪ ♪

122
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:43,060
KATE: Oh, golly, we're here.

123
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,141
ELLA: We made it!

124
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,252
KATE: Good evening to you.

125
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:58,938
(birds chirping)

126
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:01,917
(treadmill whirring)

127
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:03,633
ANDREW: I told you I was
gonna push you, didn't I?

128
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,370
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- ANDREW: Yeah.

129
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,523
See, now you started
out liking me, loving me,

130
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:11,614
and now you just kind of like, uh, uh...
now it's got a love/hate relationship.

131
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:14,398
CANDIS: So I've been
feeling a little blah lately

132
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,023
because I haven't been working out.

133
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,530
So I found a trainer,

134
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,572
and he's super cute so I'm
excited about our workout.

135
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,586
ANDREW: Good job. Take a break,
minute break. Here you go.

136
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,251
So what do you have planned
for the rest of the day?

137
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:29,607
CANDIS: Maybe walk down here
and see the sights or something?

138
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:30,995
ANDREW: Perfect.

139
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:34,121
- CANDIS: If you're bored, you could join me.
- ANDREW: Okay, yeah.

140
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:35,558
- Take a little walk.
- CANDIS: Yeah.

141
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:38,495
I'm not somebody who
usually asks somebody out,

142
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:41,139
so I kind of was like, "Let's just

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,839
kind of take a chance and...

144
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,037
- see what happens."
- ANDREW: I'll see you at the lobby.

145
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,158
- All right.
- All right. Bye.

146
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,972
I'll have a cappuccino.

147
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:55,282
CANDIS: You're gonna make me eat alone?

148
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,724
- ANDREW: Okay. I'll eat.
- CANDIS: Thank you.

149
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,914
(Andrew chuckles)

150
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,091
- ANDREW: Um...
- CANDIS: See? I get my way.

151
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,912
ANDREW: You do, you do, you do.

152
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,151
CANDIS: It's just so cute,
this little alley there,

153
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:08,608
- with, like, the restaurants and...
- ANDREW: So, question.

154
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:10,023
'Cause I'm curious.

155
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:12,569
- And, of course, you can stop me if you want.
- Yeah.

156
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:15,869
- Um, you've dated other guys, right, in the past?
- CANDIS: Yeah.

157
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,864
ANDREW: Like, 'cause you've
totally been open with them.

158
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,376
- Like, "This is who I am and..."
- CANDIS: This is who I am.

159
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,287
- ANDREW: Right.
- CANDIS: For me, personally,

160
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:25,998
I'm always open about my
transition when I'm dating somebody.

161
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,421
ANDREW: How... how have they taken that?

162
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,256
CANDIS: Well, the guys that I've dated,

163
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,398
obviously, are fine with it, you know?

164
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:34,307
I guess it depends on the guy
and how comfortable they are

165
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,114
with their own masculinity. And

166
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:38,563
this is the longest I've
been without a relationship,

167
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:42,324
and it's been nice to finally
date myself for a while.

168
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,774
You know what I mean?

169
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:47,141
- And I think I've discovered what I like and...
- ANDREW: What do you like?

170
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:49,228
- CANDIS: Tall, dark, and handsome.
- ANDREW: Tall, Dar... Oh, really?

171
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:50,239
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- ANDREW: Interesting.

172
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:52,466
- I think it might be just around the corner.
- CANDIS: Yeah.

173
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,336
Andrew is kind of surprising me,

174
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:57,105
because we're actually really connecting

175
00:07:57,112 --> 00:08:01,138
and I'm attracted to him and he
seems like he's flirting back.

176
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:02,979
So that's kind of cool.

177
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:06,238
ANDREW: There anything you
would want to know about me?

178
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:09,992
CANDIS: How did you get that
perfect skin and that gorgeous body?

179
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:13,827
ANDREW: Well, I was born this
way, and so thank my parents.

180
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:15,859
(both laugh)

181
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,477
- (birds chirping)
- (doorbell rings)

182
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:23,558
- (door opens)
- CAITLYN: Hey, babe.

183
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,381
- CHANDI: Look at you!
- CAITLYN: Look at you. Look at you!

184
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,447
- My God, girl.
- CHANDI: Well, you know?

185
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:30,307
CAITLYN: This time in the morning, and
you're just all dressed up, ready to go.

186
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:33,083
- Let's take this day on.
- CHANDI: I think I felt a little...

187
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:36,816
unresolved, like there was
something that I needed to say

188
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:41,243
to Cait so that she can
identify better with where

189
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:44,288
African-American trans women come from.

190
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,123
CAITLYN: I hear Mama's
coming to St. Louis.

191
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,874
- CHANDI: She adores you.
- CAITLYN: Mmm, I know.

192
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,695
(both laugh)

193
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,359
Anyway, you said you wanted to talk.

194
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:55,003
CHANDI: Yeah, I wanted to talk to
you because I wanted to tell you

195
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:59,378
a little bit about my
past. Back in the day,

196
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:04,262
before I got into doing all of
this work that I've been doing,

197
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:07,987
I was running around with the wrong crowd.

198
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:14,922
Because I was going through
trying to figure out who I am

199
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:20,209
and I didn't necessarily want to
deal with explaining it to my family,

200
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:24,876
so I wanted to try to see if I
could figure it out on my own.

201
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,051
I got into some heavy stuff, you know,

202
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,918
doing some white-collar crimes and

203
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,811
writing checks and doing credit
cards and stuff like that,

204
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,434
and I ended up going to prison.

205
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,395
- CAITLYN: Disick is in the house.
- SCOTT: Hello!

206
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,753
- Look at this!
- CAITLYN: This is unbelievable.

207
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:50,761
I don't think Scott and I
have ever really "bonded."

208
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,358
(motorcycles rumbling)

209
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,124
Come on, let's ride!

210
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,575
CHANDI: I ended up going to prison.

211
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,024
I was scared to death.
I was scared to death.

212
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:13,338
And, um, at that time, like, maybe
ten of us who were openly homosexual...

213
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:16,276
as that's... 'cause that's
what they called us... um,

214
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:20,309
up against maybe 1,500 men.

215
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:25,486
CAITLYN: For me, I... I can't see
little Chandi, you know, in jail.

216
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,389
I can't even visualize that,
'cause she's such a good person.

217
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,712
What were you using
that money for, just...

218
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,638
CHANDI: Survival. Um, food,
hormones, a place to stay.

219
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,787
'Cause none of us had jobs.

220
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:40,669
We were all living from day to day.

221
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,971
You know, it wasn't a
easy road getting here.

222
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,623
I wish someone would've
told me back then that

223
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:49,174
if I became a felon that I
wouldn't be able to work at a bank

224
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,809
or how it would be a problem
for me to get a passport.

225
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:56,862
That was me back in that
day before I became who I am.

226
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:59,862
CAITLYN: Your parents
were not there for you.

227
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:03,777
CHANDI: They weren't there only
because I didn't want to tell them.

228
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,156
- CAITLYN: About being trans?
- CHANDI: About being trans.

229
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:08,354
I just didn't know how
they would accept that.

230
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:13,308
Me and my mom struggled through
my transition because we...

231
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:18,625
just didn't know how
we would come together

232
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,830
on the fact that I was changing
from who she bore as a child.

233
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,340
CAITLYN: Did you have anybody
to confide in, at that point?

234
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:29,278
CHANDI: Well, my friends that I was
running around with at that time,

235
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:33,289
um, we all, you know, talked about
it, because there was a couple of us

236
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,166
who were going through the same thing.

237
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:39,122
We were just living it from day
to day, performing in the clubs,

238
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,425
trying to make tips, and, um,

239
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:43,601
trying to support ourselves in those ways.

240
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:46,657
And so that was fast money.

241
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,337
For us. Back then.

242
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,310
- But fast money doesn't last long.
- CAITLYN: No, it doesn't.

243
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:55,712
It's so interesting to me to see
what she's been through in her life

244
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,303
and so many trans women go through
and that is survival crimes.

245
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:01,978
She was trying to survive

246
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,875
and didn't know any other way to do it.

247
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:07,531
And to hear that from somebody
that you love and adore,

248
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:11,627
I think, for me, it helps
understand the issues better.

249
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,364
(horn blowing)

250
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,549
Scott Disick.

251
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,633
I don't think Scott and I
have ever really "bonded,"

252
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:33,086
in the sense that... I think
we're just different people.

253
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:35,012
(doorbell rings)

254
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:37,691
- Disick is in the house.
- SCOTT: Hello!

255
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,859
- CAITLYN: How the hell are you doing?
- SCOTT: How you doin'?

256
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:44,801
CAITLYN: Can't believe the family
member here. This is unbelievable.

257
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,420
- Yeah!
- SCOTT: Good livin'.

258
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:48,499
- CAITLYN: Have a seat.
- SCOTT: Nice boots!

259
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,862
- CAITLYN: Well, thank you, thank you.
- SCOTT: What's going on?

260
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,792
CAITLYN: Well, just
hanging out with the girls.

261
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,111
SCOTT: How's it being in a bus?

262
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,476
CAITLYN: A lot of very
interesting conversations.

263
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:01,539
- SCOTT: I'm sure.
- CAITLYN: Transitioning, dealing with gender...

264
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:05,295
all of that. And, um,
I... I think, for you,

265
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,823
being around all these girls with
their stories and their stuff,

266
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:11,826
- I think can only be very positive for you.
- SCOTT: Yeah, well, that's what I was thinking.

267
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,493
CAITLYN: Yeah. These girls have
overcome so many obstacles in their life

268
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,217
that hopefully it'll be inspiring for him

269
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:21,605
to be around this really
great group of people.

270
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,783
CANDIS: Hi.

271
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,446
- SCOTT: Hi. Scott.
- CAITLYN: Oh, you haven't met!

272
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,244
SCOTT: Hi. How are you?

273
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:27,113
- CANDIS: Nice to meet you.
- SCOTT: Nice to meet you.

274
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:28,643
- How you doin'?
- CANDIS: I'm good.

275
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:31,657
- ELLA: Hello, ladies!
- CHANDI: How's it going?

276
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,582
Hey, Lord Disick, I do hugs. I do hugs.

277
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:35,570
- SCOTT: There you go.
- CHANDI: How you doin'?

278
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:36,625
- SCOTT: Not bad.
- CHANDI: Great.

279
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:37,942
JENNY: Scott, Jenny. How are you?

280
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:39,192
- CAITLYN: Jenny Boylan.
- JENNY: Pleasure.

281
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:40,910
I feel like I know you, but...

282
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,528
- SCOTT: Well, you're gonna get to.
- (laughter)

283
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:45,192
- CAITLYN: Let's go.
- SCOTT: Are we riding there?

284
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,609
CAITLYN: Yeah, we got to bus out there.

285
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:47,775
SCOTT: Come on, girls.

286
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:50,064
- JENNY: Disick, it's a slippery slope.
- CAITLYN: I used to give him a hard time

287
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,041
- about his purse...
- SCOTT: Yeah.

288
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:53,173
JENNY: The purse, can I just
say, it's a slippery slope.

289
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,535
- Be careful.
- SCOTT: I know.

290
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:57,359
- A few more days here, God knows.
- (Kate chuckles)

291
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,469
(birds chirping)

292
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:03,472
- ELLA: Okay, let's go.
- CAITLYN: Let's check it out.

293
00:14:04,164 --> 00:14:05,772
CHANDI: Now, Scott, don't get quiet on us,

294
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:08,004
- 'cause we know you're not shy.
- SCOTT: Okay.

295
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:11,124
(Van shouts)

296
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,161
- CAITLYN: God!
- VAN: Caitlyn!

297
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,298
CAITLYN: We came to you! We came to you!

298
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,726
Aren't you so happy? We're here.

299
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:20,204
VAN: Oh, my God, I so
wasn't ready for that.

300
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,370
- CAITLYN: You weren't ready for that.
- VAN: Oh, my God.

301
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,067
Everyone, this is my husband Rick.

302
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,417
- CAITLYN: Hello, Rick.
- RICK: Hi. Nice to meet you.

303
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,409
- VAN: Welcome to St. Louis.
- CAITLYN: It's been

304
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,803
quite a long journey to
get here, but we're here.

305
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:34,163
So excited to see Van Barnes.

306
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,699
She's a friend of all of us.

307
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,597
Uh, uh, very close to Zackary.

308
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:39,316
She works on Transparent with her.

309
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:42,865
And she's happily
married to a cisgender...

310
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:47,101
which means not
transgender... male, big daddy.

311
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,406
- SCOTT: This pool table is, like, for a child.
- COURTNEY: Just focus.

312
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,599
SCOTT: There you go.

313
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:55,296
CANDIS: Oh, my God, I had the best
time with the trainer that's, like...

314
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:56,550
VAN: You got a trainer in St. Louis?

315
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,854
- CANDIS: Yeah, well, he's...
- VAN: You're such a liar.

316
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:00,167
- Okay, start the story over.
- CANDIS: No, so we have...

317
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,712
CHANDI: Uh, oh! You want to see him?

318
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,753
VAN: I thought there were...
Is he one of the bodyguards?

319
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:06,182
- CHANDI: That's her new husband.
- VAN: Oh, right, honey.

320
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:08,008
- CHANDI: Uh-huh.
- VAN: And does Cait know you're cheating on her?

321
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:09,361
- CANDIS: Shh...
- CHANDI: No.

322
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,192
- WOMAN: Say cheese!
- CANDIS: Scott.

323
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:14,009
- SCOTT: Yes.
- CANDIS: Come join us!

324
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,032
SCOTT: All right, what did I miss?

325
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,893
VAN: We need you to, um, kind of mediate

326
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,595
this whole piece on the side
issue that Candis has right now.

327
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,523
CANDIS: No, uh, we were just talking about

328
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,157
- wanting you to be in our group.
- SCOTT: Yeah.

329
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:28,551
CANDIS: You're an honorary trans woman.

330
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:29,922
SCOTT: I been here ten minutes.

331
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:33,048
VAN: If you did, we might
even let you join our club.

332
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,173
SCOTT: Stop! Well, now, when you say that,

333
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:38,004
I'd be open to changing around town.

334
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:40,365
VAN: You would be in training
though for, like, a little while.

335
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:41,968
SCOTT: Well, of course.
It's gonna be a long journey.

336
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:43,732
- CANDIS: (laughs) It is.
- CHANDI: He's trying to wrap his head

337
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:45,692
around being around all these girls.

338
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,000
SCOTT: I'm used to being
around a lot of women.

339
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,800
I'm just not used to
being asked to become one.

340
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,743
(laughter)

341
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:55,909
CAITLYN: All right. Come on, let's ride!

342
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:57,837
(motorcycle rumbling)

343
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,744
This is not my first rodeo.

344
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:01,642
- VAN: I bet it isn't.
- (Caitlyn laughs)

345
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,825
CANDIS: I'm riding behind your man.

346
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:05,668
- VAN: Go easy on him.
- (Candis laughs)

347
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:12,320
(motorcycles rumbling)

348
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:21,751
CANDIS: I'm gonna go
grab a drink with Andrew.

349
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,512
CAITLYN: Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

350
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:28,092
- CANDIS: You have ten children.
- (both laugh)

351
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,642
- SCOTT: I haven't talked to you all night.
- COURTNEY: _

352
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,022
CAITLYN: No, I'm not ignoring him.

353
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,245
- He's over there!
- SCOTT: I'm not that far.

354
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,661
CAITLYN: But, for me, with my ears...

355
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:39,979
SCOTT: Is it really your ears,
or you just don't want to listen?

356
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:45,130
(motorcycles rumbling)

357
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,771

RICK: _

359
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:56,472
- CANDIS: I did?
- RICK: Yeah.

360
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:57,848
- You okay?
- CANDIS: Yeah.

361
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,187
I don't know what happened.

362
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:02,170
- VAN: You got road rash, girl?
- CANDIS: I got road rash.

363
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:06,647
I did not lean on that motorcycle.

364
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,041
It was not my fault.

365
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,737
- VAN: Look at Miss Cait.
- COURTNEY: Do you want to get back on, or no?

366
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,657
You don't have to, you don't have to.

367
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,341
- VAN: Here, I'll take your spot.
- CANDIS: I think you should go, yeah you're used to it.

368
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:17,377
COURTNEY: What's happening?

369
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:21,805
CANDIS: I knew I shouldn't have
gotten onto his (bleep) motorcycle, no!

370
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:24,447
- ELLA: Candis, are you okay?
- JENNY: Sweetie, what happened?

371
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:26,210
- CANDIS: I'm okay.
- ELLA: I just heard the news.

372
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,398
- JENNY: Do you need a Band-Aid or something?
- CANDIS: No, I'm okay.

373
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:31,157
- I need a drink.
- JENNY: Okay. We need a drink for this injured

374
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,989
- motorcycle rider.

376
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,055
VAN: Lead the way, girl.

377
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:48,375
- (whoops)
- CAITLYN: Hey!

378
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,203
SCOTT: What is tomorrow, exactly?

379
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:56,560
ZACKARY: It's the
Transday Remembrance, so,

380
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,797
you know, trans people are murdered,

381
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,288
- at... at an alarming rate in some way...
- SCOTT: Really?

382
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:03,966
ZACKARY: So, the Transday
Remembrance sort of

383
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:07,481
celebrates the lives that have been lost

384
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:10,646
over the past year. It's
been happening for 16 years.

385
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:13,458
Even the numbers that we have
are not necessarily accurate

386
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:16,588
because so much of it is not reported,

387
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:20,668
or people are misgendered in the news.

388
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:22,177
It's tough.

389
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:29,134
- Here they come.
- SCOTT: Oh, yeah. Hell's Angels.

390
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:31,246
CAITLYN: Hey, there.

391
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:37,898
VAN: You're an old pro, girl.

392
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:40,528
- CAITLYN: Oh, thank you. That was fun.
- RICK: It was fun.

393
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:41,287
- VAN: All right.
- CAITLYN: I know.

394
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:42,337
RICK: Most of it was.

395
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:46,003
CAITLYN: What age were
you when you transitioned?

396
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,231
VAN: I transitioned twice, actually.

397
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:50,354
The first time around,
I just found it so hard

398
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:53,698
to find gainful employment
that I, uh, regressed,

399
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,216
and went back to, uh, presenting male

400
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,944
- in order to make a, uh...
- CAITLYN: Pay the bills.

401
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,252
VAN: Yeah, basically.
Pay the bills honestly.

402
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:03,489
But it's hard to have to do that twice.

403
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,457
After the first time, I actually had, uh,

404
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,069
liposuction on my torso,

405
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,529
on my breasts, because
I'd grown them naturally.

406
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,061
CAITLYN: I had the exact same thing.

407
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:14,601
VAN: Oh, really, when you were in hiding?

408
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:16,887
CAITLYN: '80s, uh, I was on hormones

409
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:17,935
for four and a half years.

410
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,516
- SCOTT: Oh, by the way, you know...
- No more secrets. I must be so boring.

411
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,558
CAITLYN: Because I just don't
even have any more secrets.

412
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,161
- I'm a lot happier.
- VAN: No, honey.

413
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,777
- ELLA: None?
- CAITLYN: What else can I tell?

414
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,263
- ELLA: None?
- CAITLYN: So, when it was Kim's birthday,

415
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:30,627
- and Kendall and Kylie...
- SCOTT: Cait... Caitlyn, you know what?

416
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,145
CAITLYN: ... really nice gifts.

417
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,025
- SCOTT: Caitlyn?
- CAITLYN: I figured they'd feel guilty,

418
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,487
they wouldn't mind spending
it, you know, on me.

419
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:39,457
- SCOTT: Caitlyn.
- CAITLYN: This year, for my birthday,

420
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:40,852
I told these girls,

421
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:44,235
"If I get one more goddamn
golf shirt, you're dead."

422
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:47,527
- SCOTT: She gets to talk and she gets to talk.
- JENNY: Yeah, right, also...

423
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:48,816
- SCOTT: That hasn't changed.
- JENNY: I think she can't,

424
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,981
- she can't always hear.
- SCOTT: Yeah, it's true.

425
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:54,387
- JENNY: Just a little.
- SCOTT: Especially with the hair. Just saying.

426
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:57,618
JENNY: You said you had some
questions about family stuff.

427
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,259
SCOTT: Well, yeah, I just kind of...

428
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:01,459
I mean, I feel like
Caitlyn has been so busy

429
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:04,277
running around and traveling and,
you know, bringing awareness...

430
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:06,063
- JENNY: Mm-hmm.
- SCOTT: ... that, you know, my kids

431
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,227
don't really know exactly what's gone on,

432
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,868
I don't know if they're old
enough. You know, my daughter

433
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:16,675
has met her and was totally okay,
didn't really, I don't think,

434
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:21,368
grasp exactly that... that
was grandpa, now it's grandma.

435
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:23,059
My son was a little nervous.

436
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,789
JENNY: They get the message you send them.

437
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:27,027
So, if you talk about it with them

438
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,153
like you're on tenterhooks
and you're all jumpy,

439
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:30,348
- they'll get that.
- SCOTT: Yeah.

440
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,955
JENNY: I sat down with
my children and said,

441
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:35,545
"You've probably noticed that
I've been looking more and more

442
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,782
like a girl recently,
and I have this condition

443
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,885
where my insides don't match my outsides."

444
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:44,095
"Um, I know that might be weird for you,

445
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:46,104
but you know I'm always gonna love you."

446
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:48,342
And I think my son said
something like, "Well,

447
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,860
if you're always gonna
love me, it won't be weird."

448
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:53,104
In my experience, it
seems like a bigger deal,

449
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,269
I think, to grown-ups than it is to kids.

450
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:12,635
CAITLYN: Oh, is that adorable?

451
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,660
We've spent so much time in that bus

452
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,993
in very close quarters that
it did get a little heated,

453
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,159
that it's time to kind of,
like, just take a break,

454
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:23,993
uh, get on a riverboat cruise
where we can see the city,

455
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:26,516
the Arch, everything. It should be fun.

456
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:29,441
COURTNEY: Ooh, it's chilly.

457
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,717
VAN: If we had to like,
jump out right now and swim,

458
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:33,532
could you do it?

459
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,844
- ZACKARY: Yeah.
- VAN: Yeah, me too.

460
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,736
(horn blows)

461
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,809
CANDIS: Oh, my God. I think they...

462
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:46,057
- they did that on purpose.
- ZACKARY: I think I got to change my panties.

463
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:48,954
CANDIS: Jesus Christ.

464
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:53,364
CAITLYN: It's too cold
here, let's go inside.

465
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,625
I'm freezing.

466
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,171
JENNY: All right, let's get in.

467
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:59,726
CHANDI: You know, there's a new term
now, maybe you've heard it: pansexual.

468
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:00,820
- ELLA: Pansexual.
- SCOTT: What the hell is that?

469
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:04,628
CHANDI: Okay, pansexual means
that you're open to all genders.

470
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:07,820
- That you're just...
- SCOTT: Oh, just testing waters.

471
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:09,935
CHANDI: Just testing
waters, trying whatever.

472
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:12,815
SCOTT: Now, one other question,
is that a talked-about thing...

473
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,472
who's gone full circle and who hasn't?

474
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:17,911
CHANDI: Not all transwomen
choose to have the surgery

475
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:19,056
to have a vagina.

476
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:21,299
SCOTT: It's unbelievable
that the body can do this.

477
00:22:21,316 --> 00:22:22,661
It's almost like,

478
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,738
you know, when you build a car,

479
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:26,167
you can change the wheels up.

480
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:27,306
- CHANDI: Right.
- SCOTT: It's like God made

481
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,829
the body, and able to do it.

482
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,550
JENNY: It's like a car,
that's right. It's like a car.

483
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:32,779
SCOTT: I'm just saying...

484
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:34,075
- JENNY: I appreciate...
- SCOTT: It's like a pit stop. (Imitates electric drills)

485
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:35,657
JENNY: That's exactly
right. That's exactly it.

486
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,253
- SCOTT: Boom.
- JENNY: That's what it was like for me.

487
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,457
We have to find a way
of talking about surgery.

488
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:42,935
And joking about it
isn't the solution, but

489
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,931
I get that this is Scott's way
of trying to find a way to relate

490
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,821
to something that's so new to him.

491
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:49,413
SCOTT: Is there any maintenance?

492
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:51,035
JENNY: Not particularly. There's some.

493
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:52,508
SCOTT: You don't have
to go in for tune-ups?

494
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:55,898
- JENNY: So, here... here's the thing...
- SCOTT: I need it to relate to cars.

495
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:57,461
- COURTNEY: Oil change?
- SCOTT: An oil change.

496
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,836
JENNY: There's an oil
change, definitely, yeah.

497
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,623
The... I guess the
important thing, though, is

498
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:04,856
we're not about an
operation. We're about soul.

499
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:07,222
SCOTT: Obviously, the
soul part is the first,

500
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:08,339
- and the most important...
- JENNY: Yeah.

501
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:10,196
SCOTT: But the other stuff
comes along with the territory.

502
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:12,393
- CHANDI: Right.
- SCOTT: I just kind of want to have knowledge.

503
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,148
Just because, don't forget,

504
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:16,068
people ask me these type of questions,

505
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:18,444
and I would love to be able
to have the right answers,

506
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:23,913
especially for the straight person
that's not understanding, to... anything.

507
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:26,137
JENNY: I don't generally
talk about down below,

508
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:27,391
because, you know, that's private.

509
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:30,750
SCOTT: I mean, listen, I like to know the
interior color on a car, like, I mean...

510
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,328
- COURTNEY: Pick out the accessories.
- JENNY: It's pink.

511
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:36,650
SCOTT: Oh! I... I'm being inappropriate.

512
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:37,802
CHANDI: Yeah, right.

513
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,012
SCOTT: Anything else?

514
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:43,110
- (horn blows)
- (Candis whoops)

515
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:54,469
CAITLYN: Chandi's mom is in town, baby.

516
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:56,719
- Hello, baby, how're you doing?
- TINA: You look so beautiful!

517
00:23:56,746 --> 00:23:57,884
CAITLYN: Thank you, baby, so do you.

518
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,336
- TINA: Baby, you look beautiful.
- CAITLYN: Look at you, you are just...

519
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:00,608
- TINA: Come get my hug.
- CANDIS: Hi!

520
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,738
- TINA: Hi, honey.
- KATE: Hello.

521
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:04,229
TINA: Hi. Give me my other...

522
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:06,011
- KATE: Absolutely.
- TINA: How are you?

523
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:09,024
KATE: I'm good, I see now where
Chandi gets her good looks.

524
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:09,824
TINA: Oh!

525
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:11,444
- KATE: Right?
- CHANDI: You didn't meet Scott.

526
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,184
- TINA: Hi, Scott.
- SCOTT: I haven't transitioned yet.

527
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,064
- (Chandi laughs)
- TINA: Come give me a hug.

528
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,447
(kisses) Good to see you.

529
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,902
SCOTT: Next month, it's gonna be a new me.

530
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,305
CHANDI: Scott is not transitioning,
he's just playing games.

531
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:21,425
- TINA: Okay.
- SCOTT: I'm just playing.

532
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:24,319
CAITLYN: Let's go. Get something to eat.

533
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:30,254
(indistinct chatter)

534
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:34,432
SERVER: What you in the mood
for... you want to do beer, liquor?

535
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:35,808
Coc... specialty cocktails.

536
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:38,166
CAITLYN: In a mixed
drink that you would say,

537
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:40,546
"Oh, wow, this is a mixed drink for here."

538
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,108
SERVER: I have a hurricane...

539
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:44,559
- ANDREW: Hi.
- CANDIS: Have a seat.

540
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:46,296
- ANDREW: Thank you, thank you.
- SERVER: Um, I also have a sazerac.

541
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:47,801
- CANDIS: Do you want a drink?
- ANDREW: Sure.

542
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:51,262
- CHANDI: I got the pictures with Bill Clinton.
- TINA: Yeah, look at you with Clinton... okay.

543
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:52,543
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.
- TINA: Please save that.

544
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,815
CHANDI: I... Of course.

545
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:55,699
ELLA: That's a gorgeous dress, too.

546
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:57,815
CAITLYN: Look at that. He's the designer.

547
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,333
JENNY: Scott, where are
you from, originally?

548
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:01,075
- SCOTT: Uh, New York state.
- JENNY: Near a city?

549
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,549
- I lived in Maine for ten years.
- SCOTT: I lived in Vermont for a while.

550
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:05,598
JENNY: Yeah? Are you the guy, who,

551
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:08,840
when talking about your own, like,

552
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,433
- pain and trouble and suffering...
- SCOTT: Yeah.

553
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:13,005
JENNY: ... you're the, "Oh, no, it's
not a big deal" guy, are you that guy?

554
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:14,921
SCOTT: No, I'm pretty open with...

555
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:18,055
that I've gone through things
that have hurt me a ton.

556
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:19,502
JENNY: Tell me if you don't want to go...

557
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:21,663
go down this rabbit hole
of, like, getting divorced.

558
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,365
SCOTT: Yeah, no, I was never married.

559
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,396
JENNY: Yeah, but you were...
but you were a couple.

560
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:27,057
- SCOTT: Yeah.
- JENNY: And now you're not a couple

561
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,811
- and that's... that's got to... that's got to hurt.
- SCOTT: Yeah.

562
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,574
Well, yeah, no, it's very tough.

563
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,454
You know, I made a lot of decisions
that weren't great, you know?

564
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,892
JENNY: So, do you think you can...

565
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,164
I don't want to say "win her back", but

566
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:37,798
- do you think you can...
- SCOTT: Oh, I don't know.

567
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:42,388
I have absolutely no control over
an... everybody and anybody else,

568
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:45,125
other than myself. And
all I can do is just

569
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,152
stay on the right path, and
if things fall into place

570
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,725
and they're meant to be, I
believe that they will be.

571
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,595
JENNY: Right. Scott made a real effort

572
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:54,467
to come all the way, to... to be with us,

573
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:57,767
and I'm glad I got to
bond with him a little.

574
00:25:57,887 --> 00:25:59,263
But it's just kind of ironic.

575
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,429
I'm not the person he
came there to bond with.

576
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:03,755
KIP: Oh, my God! Wow!

577
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,103
JENNY: Have you ever had an oyster?

578
00:26:05,157 --> 00:26:07,086
- CANDIS: Chandi likes oysters.
- SCOTT: Caitlyn,

579
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:09,470
I haven't talked to you all night.

580
00:26:09,497 --> 00:26:10,480
CAITLYN: I know.

581
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:11,650
- JENNY: She can sit over here.
- SCOTT: No, no.

582
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:13,177
COURTNEY: _

583
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,182
CAITLYN: No, I'm not
ignoring him. He's over there.

584
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:18,365
SCOTT: I'm not that far.

585
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,026
CAITLYN: But, for me, with my
ears, you are that far, yeah.

586
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:25,446
SCOTT: I... Is it really your ears,
or you just don't want to listen?

587
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,569
CANDIS: You're cute. I
could totally kiss you.

588
00:26:33,578 --> 00:26:34,972
What are you...

589
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:36,704
thinking?

590
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:42,744
SCOTT: I'm here for you. I'm
not here for just your people.

591
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,558
- CAITLYN: I know. Have a seat.
- SCOTT: You know what I mean?

592
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,361
CAITLYN: I know, I know.

593
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:47,183
SCOTT: I've spent more time
with them than I have with you.

594
00:26:51,422 --> 00:26:53,059
SCOTT: I haven't talked to you all night.

595
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:54,090
CAITLYN: I know.

596
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,202
- JENNY: She can sit over here.
- SCOTT: No, no.

597
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:56,640
COURTNEY: _

598
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:59,515
CAITLYN: No, I'm not
ignoring him. He's over there.

599
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:01,037
SCOTT: I'm not that far.

600
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,484
CAITLYN: But, for me, with my
ears, you are that far, yeah.

601
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,837
SCOTT: Is it really your ears,
or you just don't want to listen?

602
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:08,164
CAITLYN: Well, maybe two...
Yeah, one of two things, yeah.

603
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,954
- SCOTT: I always wondered.
- CAITLYN: Combination.

604
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:12,651
SCOTT: Okay. I'll settle with both.

605
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:14,310
CAITLYN: Boom, you got it.

606
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:15,660
SCOTT: Good night, ladies and...

607
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:18,402
- gentlemen.
- CAITLYN: "Ladies" is enough.

608
00:27:20,858 --> 00:27:23,796
KATE: I think he's upset
or embarrassed or something.

609
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,284
He went bam.

610
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:28,257
CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah, I have... I've
known Scott for a long time, yeah.

611
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:31,017
And I would much rather deal
with something like that,

612
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,714
which is a little strange, than
having to deal with him being,

613
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:35,402
you know, hammered, you know,

614
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:37,170
all the things that go along with that.

615
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,211
(crickets chirping)

616
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,038
CANDIS: I'm gonna go
grab a drink with Andrew.

617
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:49,887
CAITLYN: Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

618
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,378
CANDIS: You have ten children.

619
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,611
(both laugh)

620
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,299
- CAITLYN: I'll see you guys later.
- CANDIS: Gonna go have a drink.

621
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,179
Have a good night, you guys!

622
00:27:58,206 --> 00:27:59,081
ELLA: Love you.

623
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:01,729
- ANDREW: Let's have a drink.
- CANDIS: Let's have a drink.

624
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,274
- ANDREW: Have you ever had a Moscow Mule?
- CANDIS: I did recently.

625
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,515
ANDREW: You want to try some?

626
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:08,083
CANDIS: Yeah, I'll try it.

627
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,329
- ANDREW: It's good.
- CANDIS: The ginger is a nice flavor.

628
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:14,222
ANDREW: I know.

629
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:15,437
So you haven't seen the Arch yet.

630
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,241
This is... this is the
closest you've been so far.

631
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:19,932
CANDIS: Yeah. This is,
like, the best view.

632
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:22,264
- Let's go out and look.
- ANDREW: Let's go.

633
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:25,015
Man, it's windy.

634
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,501
CANDIS: It is kind of windy.

635
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,421
- I'll be fine.
- ANDREW: Are you sure? You want my jacket?

636
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,675
- CANDIS: Okay.
- ANDREW: All right.

637
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:32,775
There you go. Okay.

638
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:34,735
CANDIS: Are you cold now?

639
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:35,776
ANDREW: I'm good.

640
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:37,245
As long as you're warm.

641
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:38,415
- CANDIS: Here.
- ANDREW: Oh.

642
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:40,169
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- ANDREW: I'll get under the jacket?

643
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,237
CANDIS: You have to share it
with me. You're gonna get cold.

644
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:46,389
There's no denying there is a
little bit of chemistry there,

645
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:48,926
and so it's really nice
to be able to, like,

646
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:52,426
actually have something
with somebody that I like.

647
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,843
I have to say, you're a very sweet guy.

648
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:56,636
ANDREW: Well, thank you. You're amazing.

649
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:58,752
- CANDIS: Thank you.
- ANDREW: You are amazing. You're sweet.

650
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:00,002
CANDIS: Are you nervous?

651
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:02,288
- Am I making you nervous?
- ANDREW: No, you're not making me nervous.

652
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,954
- You're not making me nervous.
- CANDIS: Okay, good.

653
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:06,315
Um...

654
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:10,658
well, I'm just kind of, like, one of those
people that kind of goes with the flow.

655
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,174
You know what I mean? Just like...

656
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:14,845
What... what are you...

657
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:16,327
thinking?

658
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:20,744
ANDREW: Are you meaning like more than...

659
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:22,744
what's going on right here?

660
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:25,731
CANDIS: Well, I mean,
of course. I'm, like...

661
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,478
You're cute. I could totally kiss you.

662
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:30,500
- You know, that kind of thing.
- ANDREW: Mm-hmm.

663
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:36,118
I don't think I really
could go there just yet.

664
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:37,788
You know?

665
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,248
CANDIS: Okay.

666
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:42,422
Okay, well, I've... (laughs)

667
00:29:42,886 --> 00:29:45,923
- On that note, I'm gonna go to bed.
- ANDREW: Okay.

668
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:47,253
You okay?

669
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:48,419
CANDIS: No, I'm good.

670
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:50,116
- I'll see you...
- ANDREW: So, tomorrow morning?

671
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:51,728
CANDIS: I'll... I'll call you.

672
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:53,711
ANDREW: Candis.

673
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:02,893
CANDIS: I just felt like
maybe we had a connection,

674
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:05,154
and then I just assumed it was 'cause

675
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:08,328
- of the trans thing.
- ANDREW: It's, um... I just...

676
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:14,241
CAITLYN: What were your big concerns?

677
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:17,876
TINA: I'm a person
that's, uh, very religious.

678
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:19,778
I was very hurt.

679
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:24,719
CAITLYN: All right, we're recording.

680
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:26,891
You know, tough day coming up.

681
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,949
This is my first day to participate in the

682
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:33,615
Transgender Day of Remembrance.

683
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:35,632
Uh, we've lost a lot of very good people

684
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,422
that should be with us here today.

685
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,619
Um, it's a very emotional
time for my community

686
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:42,282
and for people all around the world.

687
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:44,790
So, tough day for everybody,

688
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,156
but, uh, we need to do it.

689
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:50,275
- (doorbell rings)
- CANDIS: Hello?

690
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:51,984
- ANDREW: Hey.
- CANDIS: Hey.

691
00:30:52,104 --> 00:30:53,466
- Come on in.
- ANDREW: How's it going?

692
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:56,028
- CANDIS: It's going good.
- ANDREW: Good. Do you have time to talk?

693
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,256
CANDIS: Yeah, sure.

694
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:59,265
- How are you? What's up? What's going on?
- ANDREW: Good.

695
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,199
Uh, nothing, just getting ready.

696
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:02,535
Got to head out later on today.

697
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,615
Some things came up, so I have to fly out.

698
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,897
- CANDIS: Okay.
- ANDREW: Yeah. But, um...

699
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,715
So, last night, what happened?

700
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,956
CANDIS: I don't know. I
just was kind of over it,

701
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,143
- to be honest with you.
- ANDREW: But over what?

702
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:18,479
CANDIS: I don't know. We
were talking and I was like,

703
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,877
"What's going on with you?"

704
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,645
And you were like, "I can't do this."

705
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:22,695
ANDREW: Right, right.

706
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,780
CANDIS: I just felt
like we had, you know...

707
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:25,887
- ANDREW: Like, something.
- CANDIS: ... something.

708
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:28,445
- ANDREW: Like a spark?
- CANDIS: So, I... I don't know.

709
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:30,745
I mean... I... And then I
just assumed it was 'cause

710
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:33,009
of the trans thing and...

711
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:35,808
ANDREW: It's, um... I just...

712
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,224
You could say yes. That could be...

713
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:42,296
Uh, uh, but, honestly,
that's a big issue, yes.

714
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:43,917
Um, but at the same time, like,

715
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,458
there's noth... there's no judgment,
there's no anything like that, um,

716
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:48,428
by all means. It's just something that...

717
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,696
it's just not me.

718
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,866
CANDIS: All right.

719
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,644
Um...

720
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,399
I kind of knew it was the trans thing.

721
00:31:57,434 --> 00:32:00,837
It's like the... the tables
are stacked against you,

722
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,632
you know, your whole life.

723
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:06,396
It's tough, because you
never have a break, you know?

724
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,947
Sometimes you get glimmers of that

725
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:13,890
moment that could be,

726
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,288
and then most of the
time it doesn't happen.

727
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:19,065
It really hits home.

728
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:28,750
(indistinct chatter)

729
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,446
CAITLYN: Good morning. There you are.

730
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,996
TINA: How's my baby doing today?

731
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:34,537
CAITLYN: Mama, I'm doing good.
Let's get some breakfast going.

732
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:36,508
CAITLYN: The other night,

733
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:39,524
when I was, uh, in Chicago,

734
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:42,114
- we went to the Baton...
- TINA: Uh-huh.

735
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:45,060
CAITLYN: ... and Chandi
was bringing the house down.

736
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,949
TINA: Uh-huh, yeah, looking
like Patti LaBelle, huh?

737
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:49,202
- CAITLYN: Have you been to her shows?
- TINA: Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

738
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,883
CAITLYN: Since today is

739
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,251
- Transgender Day of Remembrance...
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

740
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:57,974
CAITLYN: I kind of heard
that, at the beginning,

741
00:32:58,349 --> 00:32:59,636
it was tough on you.

742
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:02,221
What were your big concerns?

743
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,748
TINA: At first, I was very hurt.

744
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:09,187
I questioned myself as a mom.

745
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:14,916
KATE: We are the first generations

746
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:19,774
who are actively bringing
about the end of transphobia.

747
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,720
(cheering)

748
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:25,270
CAITLYN: I have been
isolated my entire life.

749
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:28,137
I... I never felt like I fit in anywhere.

750
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,476
And I know that's probably the
feeling that you get sometimes.

751
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,334
SCOTT: Yeah, that's for sure.

752
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:37,348
TINA: At first, I was very hurt.

753
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:39,442
I questioned myself as a mom.

754
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,612
Took me a while to get
my grips on this here.

755
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:44,344
'Cause first of all, I'd never...

756
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:46,692
CAITLYN: I was gonna
say, you had no idea what

757
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:48,897
even the word "transgender" was, did you?

758
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:51,121
A... and... which is most cases, yeah.

759
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:53,353
TINA: When I started looking at the fact

760
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,579
and I'm seeing the
things around my child...

761
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,329
young ladies getting murdered,

762
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:04,696
young ladies are being abused...

763
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,152
would I want my child like that?

764
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:10,662
No. No.

765
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:13,814
CAITLYN: Did you have fear for
her safety at the beginning?

766
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,498
TINA: Yes, I did.

767
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,136
And yeah, I still fear.

768
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:19,364
- CAITLYN: You still feel that way?
- TINA: Yes. Yes.

769
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:21,472
CAITLYN: It's hard for me to accept that

770
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:24,526
Chandi could actually be at risk

771
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,593
just being out in the public.

772
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:28,620
Unfortunately, this is the reality

773
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,567
of living in a transphobic world

774
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,594
that doesn't accept trans people.

775
00:34:33,211 --> 00:34:35,564
TINA: You know, I am a person that's, uh,

776
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:40,211
very religious, and I
think what really keeps me

777
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:43,659
on the positive side is
that just because my child

778
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,342
might not be like me...

779
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,517
but they're still my child.

780
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,227
So that's what God said
in his word. He said,

781
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:55,111
your, uh, situations may be a
little different, but guess what?

782
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:56,709
- He made us all.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

783
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:59,660
TINA: We have to learn
how to love and accept them

784
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:02,947
for what they are. You can't
be pulling against them,

785
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,500
- you got to pull for 'em.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

786
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:06,897
TINA: Especially when...
when you have a child that's

787
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,665
- about doing something positive.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

788
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:12,197
You just have to be so
proud of what she's doing.

789
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,461
TINA: I'm very proud.

790
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:14,908
- CAITLYN: You know?
- TINA: I'm very proud.

791
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,047
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- TINA: I really am.

792
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,391
(elevator beeping) (elevator bell dings)

793
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:26,110
CAITLYN: Chandi's mom
is such an inspiration,

794
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:29,844
'cause she never gave up on her child.

795
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,286
And look how Chandi has turned out...

796
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:32,769
she's doing so much good.

797
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,537
Kind of the same way I feel with Scott.

798
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:36,305
I always wanna be there for him.

799
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,283
I don't wanna give up on Scott,

800
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,886
and hopefully, he can
turn his life around.

801
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:43,373
SCOTT: Coming!

802
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,360
- Com...
- CAITLYN: It's locked!

803
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:48,431
- Scotty.
- SCOTT: If you're a woman now,

804
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,024
I think you need to tone down your knock.

805
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,454
CAITLYN: You think so?
It should be more gentle?

806
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,209
- (Scott pounding on door)
- Not like that?

807
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:54,107
SCOTT: Yeah.

808
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:55,536
- CAITLYN: How you doin'?
- SCOTT: What's happening?

809
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,909
CAITLYN: Well, I heard you were
thinking about leaving, number one.

810
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:00,463
And I don't think you should.

811
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:02,740
We have this ceremony tonight,

812
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,999
I think it would be good for you.

813
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,727
SCOTT: Yeah, but again, I'm here for you.

814
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:07,772
I'm not here for just...

815
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,728
your people.

816
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,808
- CAITLYN: I know. Have a seat.
- SCOTT: You know what I mean?

817
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:15,344
- CAITLYN: I know, I know,
- SCOTT: I've spent more time with them

818
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,772
than I have with you.

819
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,260
SCOTT: I'm here for you.
I'm not here for just...

820
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,150
- your people.
- CAITLYN: Have a s... have a seat.

821
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,583
- SCOTT: You know what I mean?
- CAITLYN: I know, I know,

822
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,329
SCOTT: I've spent more time
with them than I have with you.

823
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:31,208
CAITLYN: But...

824
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,610
I know. But...

825
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:37,518
all of these people have
a lot in common with you.

826
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:40,311
I have been isolated my entire life.

827
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:43,137
I... I never felt like I fit in anywhere.

828
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:46,726
When I finally decided to be
true with myself and come out,

829
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:50,436
I surrounded myself with
some really great people...

830
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:54,175
all these girls that have
so much in common with me.

831
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:57,865
My life changed around immediately.

832
00:36:57,899 --> 00:37:00,689
And I feel like you're kind
of in the same place here.

833
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:03,284
The... the whole, you
know, drinking thing and

834
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:05,835
all that kind of stuff...
it just... it's not good.

835
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,928
And you certainly don't
find happiness there.

836
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:10,177
SCOTT: Mm-mm. I used to always think that

837
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:11,779
when I was drunk

838
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,510
the real me came out.

839
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:16,144
And I always thought the
real me was a bad person.

840
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:17,986
And I've realized that, you know,

841
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:20,453
substances make people something else.

842
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,981
It's not really who they are.

843
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:25,749
So I've been able to kind of
forgive myself for all the things,

844
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,429
and now I'm just focusing
on actually being me.

845
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,764
I've just been happy for the
first time in a long time.

846
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,403
CAITLYN: You got to
make some major changes,

847
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:35,162
but it's all for the good. Now,
I mean, I look at my life now,

848
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:38,171
I've never been in a better
place in life than I am right now.

849
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:41,355
Better than the Games,
standing on top of a platform.

850
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,445
SCOTT: You know, whatever you want to do,

851
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:44,575
and I'm there to do with you.

852
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,888
CAITLYN: I want you to know
that I'm there for you, too.

853
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,523
It seems like Scott is
getting his act together.

854
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,344
He seems more self-aware.

855
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,831
To me, that's progress.

856
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:56,037
I've been through a lot.
He's been through a lot.

857
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:57,988
And it's not going through these issues,

858
00:37:58,001 --> 00:37:59,850
it's how you come out the other side.

859
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,350
It's all good. Life's
very short, as we all know.

860
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:03,779
SCOTT: Yeah, that's for sure.

861
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:05,547
CAITLYN: Yeah. Don't throw it away.

862
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:08,860
- Yeah.
- SCOTT: Listen, now that we've had this talk,

863
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:11,364
I mean, I feel more
comfortable. I just felt like...

864
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:14,936
I felt a little bit of
an outsider, even here,

865
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,312
so it kind of got me down. But I can...

866
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:20,675
I can push the flight a little
and go with you to this...

867
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:22,514
- remembrance thing.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, no I think... I think it'd be good, yeah,

868
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,684
- I think it would be good to go.
- SCOTT: All right.

869
00:38:23,697 --> 00:38:24,751
CAITLYN: Give me a hug.

870
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:26,519
Good.

871
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:28,966
All right, we'll see you. Get ready.

872
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:31,109
SCOTT: You may need to tone
down your hugs, too, with the...

873
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:33,391
- CAITLYN: It's good.
- SCOTT: It's like the door knock.

874
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:34,480
CAITLYN: I know.

875
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:42,580

877

Here you go.

00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:48,537
CAITLYN: Hello. How are
you doing? Nice to see you.

880
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:54,878
CHANDI: Having my mom here for Transgender
Day of Remembrance is so amazing.

881
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,907
And it will be great for her to be amongst

882
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,903
all these trans people who are

883
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:04,845
paying homage to those who
have been lost this year.

884
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:09,636

(crying): But when you read the names,

889
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:21,665

CANDIS: Any one of us
could be in a situation

899
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:42,413
where we could be just like

900
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:44,779
our brothers and sisters who are murdered

901
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:46,798

that out of tragedy comes hope,

904

resilience and triumph.

905
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:56,791
I'm here to support, maintain and
nurture this trans memorial garden,

906
00:39:56,911 --> 00:40:00,078
which, again, is the very
first of its kind in the nation.

907
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:02,405
We are making history
right here, in The Grove,

908
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:04,294
in St. Louis, in the Midwest.

910
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:07,378
History is being made.

KATE: Well, thank you, St.
Louis, for putting this here.

912
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:15,778
I want to acknowledge that
we are the first generations

913
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:18,452
who are actively bringing about

914
00:40:18,471 --> 00:40:21,172
the end of transphobia.

915
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,628
