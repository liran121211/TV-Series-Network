1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:02,847
- KENDALL: Her name in my phone is "Mad."
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

2
00:00:02,854 --> 00:00:04,506
- KENDALL: 'Cause she's a little mad.
- KYLIE: Yeah.

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,566
(laughter)

4
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,668
- CAITLYN: Road trip, baby.
- CANDIS: Wow!

5
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:12,504
JENNY: This bus trip was Caitlyn's idea.

6
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:14,046
She thought it was gonna be fun.

7
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:16,519
(cheering)

8
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:18,991
She needs to realize that

9
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,914
she's not gonna get a pass anymore.

10
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:23,532
- CAITLYN: Democratic National Debate.
- CHANDI: Right.

11
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,116
We're so excited that
Cait's even gonna go.

12
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:27,859
- CANDIS: I'm excited for Cait.
- CHANDI: Right.

13
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:29,764
And sit and listen to the Democrats.

14
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:32,503
- CAITLYN: It's the last place I want to be.
- CHANDI: I know. I know.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,325
CAITLYN: They're all
Democrats. I'm the only

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,416
conservative Republican on the bus.

17
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:40,796
We're 18 and a half
trillion dollars in debt.

18
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:43,508
Our economy is going to collapse.

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,538
(Candis sighs)

20
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,748
The Democrats are
destroying the country.

21
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,581
KATE: Oh, dear.

22
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,354
- CAITLYN: Okay?
- JENNY: I do not want to argue about

23
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:53,554
the government from here
to San... to Santa Fe.

24
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:54,845
The stakes are very high.

25
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:56,421
If she doesn't

26
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,549
listen to the rest of the community,

27
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:02,233
I think she's gonna find
herself isolated and irrelevant.

(music playing faintly)

31
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:45,566
CAITLYN: Yay!

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,404
We made it to New Mexico,

33
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:52,160
the Land of Enchantment.

34
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:54,232
Whatever that means.

35
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:56,353
- (Kip laughs)
- Um, yeah, m...

36
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:58,291
And where's everybody?
They're in the back.

37
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:59,930
After all the political talk,

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,445
they went to the back and went to sleep.

39
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,947
- KIP: It tuckered 'em out.
- CAITLYN: I think I just... Yeah.

40
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:06,758
- Put 'em right to sleep.
- (Kip laughs)

41
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:16,119
CANDIS: (sighs) It just
frustrates me sometimes.

42
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,351
But at the end of the
day, I realize that, like,

43
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,632
we have a lot of differences.

44
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:26,433
But this trip is gonna help
girls that are coming up and

45
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:28,670
seeing all of us together.

46
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,736
And somebody, like, of your age

47
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,315
- can learn a lot from all of us women.
- ELLA: Yeah.

48
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,862
I'm definitely at an age where
I am soaking everything up.

49
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:41,112
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- ELLA: Definitely. Yeah.

50
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,468
You know, just graduating high
school, I definitely feel like

51
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:49,436
I am getting more than an abundance
of education from all the women

52
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:52,973
about our issues and,
um, politically as well.

53
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55,004
CANDIS: Who do people
tell you you look like?

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,563
ELLA: Who do you think I look like?

55
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,205
- CANDIS: Natalie Portman.
- ELLA: It's weird, 'cause my whole family,

56
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:01,010
they all look like Natalie Portman.

57
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:04,427
It's... it's really strange.
You remind me of a really

58
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:07,128
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous actress.

59
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,721
Candis Cayne. That's
who you remind me of.

60
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:11,672
- CANDIS: Stop it.
- (Ella laughs)

61
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,045
- Stop.
- ELLA: There goes Candis with her hair.

62
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,765
(Candis laughs)

63
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,623
(Ella chuckles)

64
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,543
CANDIS: Oh, my God, the
bathroom smells so bad,

65
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:26,592
but I really have to pee.

66
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:29,270
Ooh, that is so bad.

67
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,325
Jesus Christ!

68
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,181
Oh, my God, that's awful!

69
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,989
- (laughter)
- Ugh!

70
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:38,662
CHANDI: The bus is totally great,

71
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:41,024
although the bathroom
doesn't smell that great.

72
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:44,519
ELLA: The sewage isn't
really working that well,

73
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:46,974
so it smells like a...

74
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,825
- (Candis coughing)
- _

75
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:51,153
CANDIS: Jesus.

76
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,133
KATE: The bathroom on the bus,

77
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,073
goodness, goodness, goodness.

78
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,371
- (exhales)
- CANDIS: Oh.

79
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,675
- CAITLYN: Oh, my God.
- CANDIS: (laughs)

80
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,185
Excuse me!

81
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,997
You got a lot of nerve callin' me out!

82
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,642
No privacy in this damn bus.

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,736
It's like...

84
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:18,026
Oh. Oh, my God, that is hideous.

85
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:20,717
- ELLA: Okay, but let me go.
- CANDIS: Good luck.

86
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:24,037
- (spraying)
- Really?

87
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,564
- KATE: We have been room freshened.
- CHANDI: Right.

88
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:28,391
You smell mangos and peaches.

89
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:31,331
- (laughter)
- CANDIS: Oh, that is so bad up in that.

90
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:34,405
Oh, Jesus Christ!

91
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:38,543
- That is one wrong bathroom.
- (laughter)

92
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,936
KATE: Courtney, question,

93
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:48,875
"tranny" has been around
as a word since the '70s.

94
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,813
- COURTNEY: Mm-hmm.
- KATE: I don't call myself a woman;

95
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:52,795
I do call myself a tranny.

96
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:57,838
And transgender women have
a lot of problems with that.

97
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,688
COURTNEY: So it used to
be an acceptable term?

98
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,288
KATE: "Tranny" was a family word.

99
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,066
COURTNEY: But now
that's, like, derogatory.

100
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:08,166
KIP: Is that... So is it okay between
trans women to still use that word?

101
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,827
Or it's just better not to say it?

102
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,572
KATE: No. No. I don't think so.

103
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:17,513
The people who object to the
word "tranny" are people who...

104
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:22,341
are very invested in being
women, not trans folk.

105
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:25,362
COURTNEY: Even some trans women
think that word's offensive,

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,700
even for them to use as well.

107
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,847
- JENNY: And I would... I would be one of them.
- COURTNEY: Yeah.

108
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,360
JENNY: Kate and I have
known each other for decades.

109
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,135
I've taught her books
even before I came out.

110
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,177
I taught, um,<i> Gender Outlaw.</i>

111
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,142
You know, I've been a fan of her work

112
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,589
forever, but we see
things very differently.

113
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:43,315
If I hear that word, I will
generally leave the room.

114
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,972
I find it really hurtful.

115
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:48,746
And I recognize that there are other
people who own that word proudly,

116
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,880
and that is fantastic for them.

117
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:53,112
Um, it's not fantastic for me.

118
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:54,701
For me, it is like... like

119
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,276
saying the F-word to a... a gay man

120
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,330
or the N-word to...
to a person of color.

121
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:02,797
It's a word I associate with
beatings, being diminished,

122
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,873
being on the receiving end of violence.

123
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,290
KATE: Did you have an experience?

124
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:09,552
Were you attacked and...
and yelled at and hurt?

125
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,374
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- JENNY: Yeah, more than once.

126
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,536
JENNY: Somebody, um...

127
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,984
uh, uh, grabbed me by the neck,

128
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:24,326
used that word, um, and other
words, dragged me around, um,

129
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,900
you know, by my neck
for about a half an hour

130
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,722
and finally dropped me.

131
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:32,953
And I lay there on the
ground, kind of unable to move.

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,947
Words can hurt as much as...

133
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,195
um, violence can.

134
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:40,802
For... for me, it's
still a triggering word.

135
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,346
KATE: We... we developed
the word "tranny" ourselves.

136
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,320
JENNY: Yeah, I'm not sure the
guys who were beating me up

137
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,022
- thought of it in those terms.
- KATE: No.

138
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:49,691
Our word got stolen. We are using it

139
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:53,287
in the way we've always used
it, with love and respect.

140
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,627
And you need to hear the
love and respect in my voice

141
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,429
when I say the word casually
and you happen to hear it.

142
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,505
JENNY: And I hope you
know you're asking a lot.

143
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,755
For me, Kate.

144
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:05,934
That's... that's not an
easy thing for me to do.

145
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,502
KATE: Ask a lot from me.

146
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:12,163
Yes, I know I'm asking
a lot. It's my name.

147
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:15,054
It's who I am.

148
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:21,420
It's... it's the love I have
for my queer, queer trans family.

149
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,006
JENNY: And I love you,
but it's not my name.

150
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,813
KATE: Oh, I get that. I get that.

151
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:29,911
CAITLYN: I'm, you know,
obviously new to the community.

152
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:32,260
I heard a lot of people
call it, in the past,

153
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,153
"tranny" or this or that.

154
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:36,029
Fortunately, I had never
developed the habit,

155
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:39,121
so it was easy to change. Jenny Boylan,

156
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,578
Kate Bornstein look at
this issue very differently.

157
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,641
They've both written books on it.

158
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,196
They're both very smart.

159
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,088
And so for me, it's great, 'cause
I love taking a little bit here,

160
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,833
taking a little bit there, put it
in my little computer in my head,

161
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,597
and find out what works for me.

162
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:57,634
KATE: We're on the same side
but a totally different track.

163
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:00,285
ELLA: I think that's...
that's evident, but...

164
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:03,457
JENNY: You think... Is it evident? I
don't... I don't think of myself as being

165
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,747
really so far from... from
Kate, but I think that we...

166
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:08,251
ELLA: No, you guys are very alike.

167
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,201
I think you both are so
intellectually on the same level...

168
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:15,591
JENNY: Well, we're both...
we're both brilliant.

169
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,761
ELLA: Kate,

170
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:18,526
I love her freedom.

171
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,888
And she has this perspective

172
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:24,629
that can sometimes
be dangerousterritory,

173
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,687
- especially for Jenny.
- JENNY: I think that Kate

174
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,224
celebrates people who
don't fit into any...

175
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:34,571
compartment, and particularly
binary compartments.

176
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:38,425
I don't think of myself as an
outlaw because of my gender.

177
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,074
And my identity as a woman

178
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,479
is a... is much more

179
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,314
important to me than my
identity as... as a trans woman.

180
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:49,619
KATE: I think what I opened the doors to

181
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:52,838
is my notion that
gender is more than two.

182
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:56,358
- JENNY: Yeah.
- KATE: And gender doesn't

183
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:59,767
rely on anatomy or biology.

184
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:04,433
When I let my hair
down, I'm... you know,

185
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:07,803
tranny this, tranny
that, let's go, trannies!

186
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:10,265
And I don't, to this day,

187
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,092
claim to be a woman.

188
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,520
And this is where we kind of differ,

189
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:19,271
because as far as I know, I'm the
only not-man-not-woman on this bus.

190
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:28,633
I identify myself as a
non-binary trans person.

191
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,190
I call myself a tranny.

192
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:34,482
I've been a tranny for 30 years.

193
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:38,286
If you want me as part of
your family, you say my name.

194
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,792
ELLA: We're all trying
to get to the same place.

195
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:43,292
JENNY: Are we gonna be having this
conversation for the next month?

196
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,609
KATE: I will probably come back to it.

197
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:49,279
To be the object of disgust...

198
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:52,387
that's how I spent my first 20 years

199
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,503
as a trans person.

200
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,766
I was disgusting to people.

201
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:02,183
And I still am an object of disgust.

202
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,984
It really gets me in the gut

203
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:09,123
to receive that from L, G, B or T.

204
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:20,614
ELLA: Have you ever played fluffy bunny?

205
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:24,251
- (Candis laughing)
- (exclaiming)

206
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,931
(laughing)

207
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:31,130
KATE: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?

208
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:35,503
CAITLYN: Oh, my God, I would
never, ever, ever vote for Hillary.

209
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:38,349
JENNY: Kill me now. Someone kill me now.

210
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,142
CAITLYN: If Hillary becomes president,

211
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:41,657
the country is over.

212
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,751
CANDIS: Tell me the things
she's horrible about.

213
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:44,803
CAITLYN: Look at all the things
that are going on in the Middle East,

214
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,245
all because of what she did.

215
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:48,088
She's a (bleep) liar.

216
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:54,629
(phone rings)

217
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:59,337
CAITLYN: Hey, guys.

218
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,966
It's my mother, the winner of the

219
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:06,605
PFLAG Betty DeGeneres Award
for outstanding support.

220
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,570
- Say hi!
- (cheering)

221
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,018
- CANDIS: Hi, Mom!
- CAITLYN: They all say hi.

222
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,269
All right, Mom. Love
you. Have a good night.

223
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,644
(beep)

224
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,139
- My mother called me. You know why?
- ELLA: Why?

225
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,938
CAITLYN: She's telling me how much

226
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:22,060
she's really starting
to like Donald Trump.

227
00:11:22,673 --> 00:11:23,898
COURTNEY: What?

228
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,907
- (Caitlyn laughs)
- (groaning)

229
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,232
- CHANDI: Wah, wah, wah.
- JENNY: Wah-wah.

230
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:32,879
COURTNEY: What?

231
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:36,082
'Cause you're the... you're
the only person she could call

232
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,304
- that was gonna celebrate that.
- CAITLYN: I know.

233
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:39,835
COURTNEY: That's why.

234
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,500
CAITLYN: She just hates what's going on.

235
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,026
She's seeing this country...

236
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:46,179
- All of her husbands fought in World War II.
- CANDIS: No, no, no, no!

237
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:48,891
CAITLYN: You know, land
in Omaha Beach. My dad

238
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,820
fought for this country.
And now we're giving it away.

239
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:54,686
CHANDI: What do you
think of Donald Trump?

240
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:57,711
CAITLYN: Um, I'm not a big fan,

241
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:01,375
because I think of his macho attitude.

242
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,555
I think he would have
a hard time with women,

243
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,365
when he doesn't even realize it.

244
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,217
And it doesn't mean he wouldn't
be good for women's issues.

245
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:11,778
I think he would be very
good for women's issues.

246
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:15,487
- COURTNEY: What?
- JENNY: Kill me now.

247
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,308
Someone kill me now.

248
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:19,664
CAITLYN: I don't think he's
out there to destroy women

249
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:22,187
or take things away or do
any of that kind of stuff.

250
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:31,421
I don't think my views have changed
politically since transitioning.

251
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,426
You know, we're talking
about the economy.

252
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,320
We're talking about
our country surviving.

253
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:38,384
We're talking about an economic
system that can prosper.

254
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,782
Just because I'm a woman now

255
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:42,187
doesn't make me all of a sudden liberal.

256
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,760
KATE: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?

257
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:47,567
CAITLYN: Oh, my God,
I would never, ever,

258
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:51,833
ever vote for Hillary. We're done.
If... if Hillary becomes president,

259
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:53,273
the country is over.

260
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:55,202
- CANDIS: Oh, my God.
- CAITLYN: You can't

261
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,837
fix immigration. You
can't fix the economy.

262
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:59,051
- CANDIS: Oh, my God.
- CAITLYN: You know?

263
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,911
CANDIS: The Kool-Aid.

264
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,899
- The Kool-Aid.
- CAITLYN: We don't have a country.

265
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,595
- And Hillary will not do it.
- CANDIS: She's an amazing woman.

266
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,845
CAITLYN: Tell me what she's
done that's good. Tell me.

267
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:09,660
- _
- CAITLYN: Please.

268
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,573
- _
- CHANDI: So you're a Republican up there, too?

269
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,161
- _
- CHANDI: Okay.

270
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,938
So he's cosigning for Cait.

271
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:18,211
CAITLYN: No, he's... he's
a conservative American.

272
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:20,271
He's an American, yeah. Yeah.

273
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:23,119
CHANDI: Nothing against you.
Boo, I still love you, too, but

274
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:25,799
I just needed everybody to
know that you're cosigning.

275
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,368
(chuckles)

276
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,082
CANDIS: But, you know, there
is a lot to love about Hillary.

277
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,994
She's an amazing woman.

278
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:34,934
Things that she's done in
her life have been incredible!

279
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,809
- To go through...
- CAITLYN: What has she done in her life?

280
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:38,865
- What has she done...
- CANDIS: With the rights that... that...

281
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,588
of women that she's gone through,

282
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,210
it's been incredible!

283
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:45,556
She's become a lawyer when it
was so hard to become a lawyer.

284
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,926
- CAITLYN: What has she done?
- CANDIS: She has served our Senate.

285
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,931
She was our Secretary of State.

286
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,557
CAITLYN: And she was a lousy senator.

287
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,976
- CANDIS: She wasn't a lousy Senator.
- CAITLYN: She was horrible!

288
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,482
- CANDIS: Tell me!
- CAITLYN: Look at all the things that are going on

289
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,875
- Tell me the things she was horrible about!
- in the Middle East.

290
00:13:57,897 --> 00:13:59,728
All because of what she did. Look at...

291
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,992
look at Benghazi. She lied to us.

292
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,376
- CANDIS: She didn't lie to us.
- CAITLYN: She's a (bleep) liar.

293
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,196
CANDIS: When it comes to
debating politics with Caitlyn,

294
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,693
it's not a debate.

295
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:12,163
She just talks and is yelling at us.

296
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,026
That's an uncomfortable situation.

297
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:15,982
CAITLYN: You want a person
that's gonna lie to you?

298
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:17,467
And then lied again about it

299
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:18,452
- and lied again about it?
- _

300
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:19,822
CANDIS: I'm gonna go to the other room.

301
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:21,338
CAITLYN: And then all of her e-mails.

302
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,543
- CHANDI: Okay, okay.
- CAITLYN: She's a political hack.

303
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:24,782
KATE: Oh, boy.

304
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,804
CAITLYN: That's all she
is. She's done nothing.

305
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:29,535
CHANDI: Okay. I... I have
to... I have to listen.

306
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:34,246
I think, in a position where
there were so many people

307
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:38,001
against Republicans,
made her really defensive.

308
00:14:38,349 --> 00:14:39,521
CAITLYN: Cleared this room out.

309
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:40,567
CHANDI: Cleared it out.

310
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,800
Nobody wants to talk
to you right now, Cait.

311
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:45,919
(horse neighs)

312
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,067
CAITLYN: Today, the next adventure.

313
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,564
- CHANDI: Ooh. Uh, uh...
- (horse neighs)

314
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,107
Whoa. I don't know what I'm doing.

315
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:55,395
(horse neighs)

316
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:59,410
CAITLYN: I look at all the issues,
I think, in a much different way

317
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,664
than most people in this
room look at the issues.

318
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,976
JENNY: It's not about the
issues. We're telling you,

319
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:05,941
we were scared.

320
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:11,044
Oh, where's Candis?

321
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:15,730
I just got into a full
screaming match with Caitlyn.

322
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,406
- With Caitlyn.
- KIP: You did?

323
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,787
What did we miss?

324
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:21,464
- CANDIS: About Hillary Clinton.
- COURTNEY: What?

325
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,028
(Candis sighs)

326
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:26,227
CANDIS: I think Cait,
she was disrespecting us

327
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,601
in the way she was talking to us.

328
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:32,299
I mostly got upset that
she wasn't listening

329
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:34,861
to what we were saying.
She was talking down to us

330
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,603
about our views and what

331
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:38,840
she knew to be true,

332
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:42,619
- um, and was yelling at us.
- COURTNEY: She screamed?

333
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:45,145
She screamed? How loud?

334
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,682
- CANDIS: I don't know.
- JENNY: Loud enough for Candis to come back here.

335
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:49,005
CANDIS: Yeah.

336
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:52,329
CAITLYN: Tell me one
good thing she's done.

337
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,285
ZACKARY: Where is
this anger coming from?

338
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,726
- CAITLYN: Where's the what?
- ZACKARY: This anger coming from.

339
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,677
You seem like you're
really angry about this.

340
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,319
CAITLYN: It's so upsetting
to me to see where this...

341
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:02,941
where this whole thing is headed.

342
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:06,327
ZACKARY: You know, I
really appreciate debate,

343
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:09,196
um, but I'm really reticent
to engage ifsomebody's

344
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,332
at an escalated pitch with their voice.

345
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:15,250
You know, I try to be as,
like, diplomatic as possible,

346
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,416
and especially when
it comes to politics.

347
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,205
Um, Hillary Clinton, when
she was Secretary of State,

348
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,494
was the person who
spearheaded the effort

349
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,214
to make it easier for trans people

350
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,023
to change their gender
marker on their passports.

351
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:28,536
CAITLYN: That is very good for us, okay?

352
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,853
But we are .8% of the population,

353
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,705
and that is a very small thing.

354
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:37,948
ZACKARY: Listen, she's somebody
who's dedicated her life

355
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:40,210
- to gender equality.
- CAITLYN: In the scheme of things,

356
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:43,111
that is, like,
itty-bitty, teeny-weeny...

357
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:46,268
ZACKARY: I can go on, but I won't
go on if I'm beinginterrupted.

358
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:49,153
I'm listening to everything
that you're saying, and...

359
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:52,140
- CAITLYN: If you look at it...
- ZACKARY: But I unfortunately

360
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:56,506
don't feel, you know, comfortable
or safe enough to disagree with you.

361
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,785
And I think that that's...
that's unfortunate.

362
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:02,831
CAITLYN: You know what, I... I
appreciate your candor and your

363
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:05,746
calm voice. And you've calmed me down.

364
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,145
But it's just...

365
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,452
very upsetting to me.

366
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,810
ZACKARY: You know, I'm aware
that those ideas are out there,

367
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:19,722
but I've never really been
in the same room with somebody

368
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:22,498
who's trying to kind
of, like, come for me

369
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:25,635
or come for, you know,
my girlfriends, and

370
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:28,575
sort of try to convince us that

371
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:33,534
we're wrong. I mean, I think
that probably comes from 65 years

372
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:37,637
of being a Republican man.

373
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,108
JENNY: She has a kind of
bring-it-on sense of politics.

374
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:43,689
What she doesn't know
is how much it really

375
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:47,115
hurts us, and it hurts us as her
friends, and it hurts us as women.

376
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,008
- COURTNEY: She needs to listen.
- CANDIS: Yeah.

377
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,494
JENNY: When we we first
got on this bus, I thought,

378
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:53,212
"Wow. This is huge." Now I'm thinking,

379
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:55,099
this bus is small.

380
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,736
This bus has never felt so small.

381
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:06,371
- CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.
- COURTNEY: Bunny.

382
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,202
- CAITLYN: Bunny.
- ZACKARY: Just put it in your cheek.

383
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:09,557
ELLA: Oh, my God, I'm dying.

384
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,514
- CHANDI: Fluffy bunny.
- CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

385
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,042
(laughter)

386
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:17,437
KATE: I didn't come out
until after my father died.

387
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:19,463
I got up the courage to tell my mom,

388
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,234
and she goes, "Wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

389
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,582
You get out of here
right now, young man!

390
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:26,442
And if you go through with this,

391
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:28,598
if you really go through with this,

392
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:31,422
don't bother coming back,
because you're not welcome here.

393
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:38,785
_

394
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:40,528
WENDI: Welcome to Sunrise Springs.

395
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,809
CAITLYN: Hi. Nice to meet
you. What's your name?

396
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,347
- WENDI: Wendi.
- CAITLYN: Wendi. Caitlyn.

397
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,223
- Nice to meet you.
- WENDI: Welcome to have you here.

398
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:46,266
How was your trip?

399
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,655
- CAITLYN: Uh, a little long, but not bad.
- WENDI: Yeah?

400
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:49,953
CAITLYN: It wasn't bad at all.

401
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,651
WENDI: What we were gonna do

402
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:53,414
is take you directly to your rooms.

403
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,360
- CAITLYN: Let's do it.
- KIP: Let's do it. It's cold.

404
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:57,676
- WENDI: And then, we're gonna go to dinner.
- CAITLYN: Let's go to... let's.

405
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,158
- CAITLYN: Where did Candis go?
- WENDI: We'll start walking this way.

406
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,328
CAITLYN: Hey, Candis?

407
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:05,269
KIP: Candis Cayne,
Caitlyn's calling for you.

408
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,383
- CHANDI: Paging CC.
- CANDIS: Sorry.

409
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:10,770
CHANDI: Paging CC.

410
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:13,604
- CANDIS: Is Cait upset?
- CHANDI: Yes, she is.

411
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,234
CANDIS: Is she? What did she say?

412
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,133
CHANDI: She said, "Where's Candis?"

413
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,258
CANDIS: Oh.

414
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:23,229
- CHANDI: She said, "Did I clear the room?"
- (laughter)

415
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,256
CANDIS: Oh, honey, I can't.

416
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:28,697
I... I'm sorry, I just couldn't
hear her talking... just...

417
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,167
Ooh.

418
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,248
WENDI: Zackary?

419
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,621
COURTNEY: What about Zackary, 409?

420
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,900
ZACKARY: You know, up until today,

421
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,940
granted, it was day three, right,

422
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,641
and it was very balanced, but when
politics came up the second time around,

423
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,941
it went from zero to 100

424
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:50,319
in, like, a second, and
it felt really hostile.

425
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:52,285
- WENDI: Jenny.
- JENNY: Jenny.

426
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,652
- WENDI: Okay, so you're in 419.
- JENNY: Okay.

427
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:56,317
WENDI: There you go, 419.

428
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,094
JENNY: This is what I was afraid of.

429
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:00,712
Kate Bornstein and I are

430
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:04,226
having the very conversation
that I least wanted to have.

431
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:08,849
Caitlyn Jenner is holding
forth about politics.

432
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:11,378
I'm thinking, "Get me out of here."

433
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:19,302
(people sigh)

434
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,616
JENNY: May I suggest we all join hands?

435
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,839
I'm not gonna say grace. I'm just gonna

436
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,245
accept the grace of
being with all of you.

437
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,044
Today was a hard day, I thought,

438
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:37,358
- um, and, uh...
- CAITLYN: It was a long... It's a long ride.

439
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:40,204
JENNY: I'm grateful for all of you

440
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:41,846
and for all that lies ahead.

441
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:42,932
- CHANDI: Amen.
- COURTNEY: Amen.

442
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:43,845
CANDIS: Amen.

443
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:48,553
CAITLYN: I love talking about politics

444
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:51,471
and listening to other peoples'
views and expressing my views,

445
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,964
but it does cause tension.

446
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,606
And maybe a good idea would
be to change the subject.

447
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:59,286
Five, six days from now,

448
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:02,773
I accept<i> Glamour</i>
magazine's Woman of the Year,

449
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:05,037
and I've been kind of
struggling with this thing.

450
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:08,071
Besides the hair and the makeup
and the clothes and this and that,

451
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:10,241
to each person in this room

452
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:13,885
who's had to work very, very hard
to be the woman that they are,

453
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:16,910
what is it to you to mean to be a woman?

454
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:20,327
CHANDI: Mm. Being 100%

455
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:23,438
comfortable in your
skin and being confident.

456
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:24,739
ELLA: I agree with Chandi.

457
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:28,493
I think it's just being yourself.

458
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:30,619
I think there's so
many ways to be a woman.

459
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,966
ZACKARY: Yeah, for me, I
think being a woman is...

460
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:37,421
being powerful

461
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:40,612
and being aware of your power.

462
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,496
- CAITLYN: Okay, that's an interesting question...
- ZACKARY: Mm.

463
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:44,074
- JENNY: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: ... from my standpoint. You know why?

464
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:46,814
Because a lot of people don't understand

465
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,881
why would you ever transition

466
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:54,043
from the strong, powerful person
that a male is into a weak female.

467
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,270
Now that's the peoples' perspective,

468
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:57,781
okay? I don't believe that.

469
00:21:57,937 --> 00:22:00,814
I mean, I watch Kris,
who's a very powerful woman,

470
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,652
and she... she knew
how to play the game.

471
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,485
JENNY: The first thing I thought of
was a quote by Simone De Beauvoir,

472
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:09,822
who said one is not born
a woman... one becomes one.

473
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:11,698
CAITLYN: Where do you come
up with all this stuff?

474
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:13,872
- ELLA: I know.
- CAITLYN: I love it. I mean,

475
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,512
- I... I mean, I love it, but...
- JENNY: That's a great quote,

476
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,039
and I think each of us
have had to become women...

477
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,977
or except for... for Kate... um,

478
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,847
each of us have had to
become women in ways...

479
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:25,560
- CAITLYN: They've struggled.
- JENNY: I mean that... I mean that respectfully.

480
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,372
- KATE: I... I got it respectfully.
- JENNY: Which means

481
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:30,506
that we've each had to... to find,

482
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:32,795
um, womanhood on our own terms.

483
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,745
CAITLYN: I don't know if I'll
ever really figure it out,

484
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,568
what it is. Is it
grace? Is it compassion?

485
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,947
Is it looking at life
in a different way?

486
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,634
I... Honestly, I go down the street

487
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:47,752
and I look at a billboard and for,

488
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,435
you know, all these years, as
a guy, I was looking up and go,

489
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,707
"Oh, man, there's a hot chick." And so

490
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:54,587
now I go down the street

491
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:59,355
and I... I can't identify that
I'm part of that community,

492
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:02,399
"female," you know?

493
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,638
I've been kind of the
other way for so long,

494
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:06,910
it's kind of tough for
me to grasp that that's

495
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,381
my sister up there.

496
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:10,689
But I think the more time I spend in it,

497
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:13,460
you know, and the more I'm around it,

498
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:16,133
- you kind of blend into that.
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

499
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:19,455
ZACKARY: When you're
transitioning, your mind...

500
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:22,493
is sometimes ahead of your body.

501
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:24,222
And then there's other times when

502
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:28,419
your mind has not caught
up to your social position.

503
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:31,628
It's tough. Like, I really love Caitlyn.

504
00:23:31,672 --> 00:23:34,354
She is six months in. But

505
00:23:34,701 --> 00:23:37,700
she hasn't quite caught
up to herself yet.

506
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,213
KATE: I didn't come out
until after my father died.

507
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:44,686
I was supposed to be the perfect son.

508
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:48,697
If I had told him this, he
would've done the Jewish thing

509
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:52,208
of tearing his clothing, turning
his back, and "I have no child."

510
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,280
- CAITLYN: Really?
- KATE: Oh, yes.

511
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:56,053
- CAITLYN: Wow.
- KATE: Yeah.

512
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:58,766
So shortly after my dad died,

513
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:01,240
I got up the courage to tell my mom,

514
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,560
"Mom, do you know
what a transsexual is?"

515
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:07,830
"Transvestite?"

516
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,841
And my father was a doctor.

517
00:24:10,854 --> 00:24:13,528
She knew the difference. She
didn't want to know the truth.

518
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,462
"No, Mom, a transvestite
wants to wear women's clothing.

519
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,073
Me, I'll be getting surgery.

520
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,713
I'll be taking hormones."

521
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,961
And she goes, "Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

522
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,547
You get out of here right now, young man.

523
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,733
You get out of here right now.

524
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,538
And if you go through with this,

525
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:33,636
if you really go through with this,

526
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,443
don't bother coming back,
because you're not welcome here."

527
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:40,702
I was... I was dizzy.

528
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:43,598
I never expected that. We'd had such...

529
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:46,427
we had a mother-son relationship.

530
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,102
That's a great thing.

531
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:49,693
And...

532
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:52,001
I threw it in her face.

533
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,222
The last thing she said, "Wait a minute,

534
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:56,813
what do you think you're
gonna call yourself?"

535
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:59,078
I said, "Kate.

536
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,243
Kate Bornstein." "'Kate'?!

537
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:04,491
Your name was Albert.

538
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,608
That was my father's name.

539
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,027
I will never call you Kate.

540
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:10,757
If I have to call you Kate,

541
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:12,998
you can call me Mrs. Bornstein."

542
00:25:14,432 --> 00:25:16,473
She went back to her iced tea.

543
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:18,513
(chuckling)

544
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,427
Three months pass, a big hurricane

545
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,414
hit the Jersey Shore, and...

546
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:26,657
which is where my mom was living,
so I called to see how she was doing.

547
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,046
We talked for a while on the phone.

548
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,247
It was the first time
we talked in months.

549
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:34,664
And, uh, she very
pointedly called me Albert.

550
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:36,166
But we were polite to each other.

551
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,702
Finally, she asked me, "How are
you doing?" I said, "How am I doing?

552
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:43,250
They're making, uh...

553
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:45,736
making it terribly hard for me at work.

554
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,579
That's how I'm doing, Mom.
It's really, really hard.

555
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,450
I... I can't talk
anymore." I hung up on her.

556
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:57,507
Ten minutes, 15, the phone rings.

557
00:25:57,627 --> 00:25:59,966
She goes, "Kate... "

558
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:05,445
That was it.

559
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:07,058
And it was beautiful.

560
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:10,347
I said, "I love you, Mom."

561
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,250
She said, "I love you, too, Kate."

562
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,456
She told me something I'll never forget.

563
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:17,480
She said, "Look, I know life is hard,

564
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,307
but that's what happens, baby.

565
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:21,794
You build a world... it falls apart.

566
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,419
But remember this, when
your world falls apart,

567
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:27,216
you always have the kind
heart you were born with.

568
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:29,270
And I will always love you, Kate.

569
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:30,953
You're my daughter."

570
00:26:32,188 --> 00:26:34,638
(others exhaling)

571
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:37,619
JENNY: My mother used to say

572
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:40,373
it's impossible to hate
anyone whose story you know.

573
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:42,877
Kate Bornstein and I have...

574
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:46,407
fought really hard to get where we are.

575
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:49,236
I don't want difference of opinion

576
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,559
to take away from the
progress that we've made and...

577
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:54,662
and the progress that the
whole community has made.

578
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:57,117
Kate and I need to come together.

579
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:05,951
KIP: Cait, she got a special package.

580
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:07,854
(laughter)

581
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:11,222
- ELLA: It looks like a little vacuum cleaner.
- (whirring)

582
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:13,272
COURTNEY: I never can use it now.

583
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,170
I can never use it.

584
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:24,677
- CAITLYN: Off to the horses!
- CANDIS: Yay.

585
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,172
CAITLYN: You've never ridden a horse?

586
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,667
- CHANDI: Never ridden a horse.
- COURTNEY: You're devirginizing Chandi once again.

587
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:32,680
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.
- COURTNEY: Popping another cherry of hers.

588
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:34,727
(laughter)

589
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:37,116
CAITLYN: There has been a
lot of tension on this bus.

590
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:38,572
Maybe the right thing to do

591
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,555
is take all the girls horseback riding.

592
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:42,354
Just get out of the bus,

593
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:43,913
get on a horse,

594
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:47,684
go up into the mountains,
look at the beautiful views,

595
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,861
and maybe even blow off a little steam.

596
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,727
ELLA: Have you ever played Fluffy Bunny?

597
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:54,484
- CHANDI: No. I don't even...
- ELLA: But usually you do it with marshmallows.

598
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,512
Like, you put a marshmallow in

599
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,255
and you say, "Fluffy bunny."

600
00:27:58,311 --> 00:28:00,577
- CANDIS: Oh.
- ELLA: What if I tried...

601
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,910
CHANDI: Fluffy Bunny
with... with powdered donuts.

602
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,587
ELLA: Powdered donuts,
yeah. I'm doing it.

603
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:09,582
At some point, the
politics can only go so far.

604
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,934
So we just needed a little
lightening up and some laughing,

605
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,638
so I did not hesitate to bring
out that bag of powdered donuts.

606
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:18,030
Oh.

607
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:19,806
Fluffy bunny.

608
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:21,705
(laughter)

609
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,737
CANDIS: Does someone know
the Heimlich maneuver?

610
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:25,720
(laughter)

611
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,366
- COURTNEY: Suck 'em back.
- (laughter)

612
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:32,247
- CHANDI: Ooh...
- ELLA: Fluffy bunny.

613
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:35,311
- (laughter)
- CANDIS: This'll be five.

614
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:37,883
- CHANDI: Fluffy bunny!
- (laughter)

615
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,033
- ZACKARY: She's out.
- KATE: Yay!

616
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,750
- ZACKARY: Yay!
- CHANDI: Yay!

617
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,089
- (laughter)
- COURTNEY: All right, Cait, it's your turn.

618
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:49,456
Caitlyn, you have to do six.

619
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:51,717
- CAITLYN: What?!
- (laughter)

620
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:53,093
COURTNEY: Well, Ella did five.

621
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:55,210
- I'm gonna put these on for protection.
- CAITLYN: Lovely...

622
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,282
- COURTNEY: Fluffy.
- CAITLYN: Lovey?

623
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,830
- COURTNEY: Fluffy.
- CAITLYN: Fluffy...

624
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:00,105
- COURTNEY: Bunny.
- CAITLYN: ... bunny.

625
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,119
COURTNEY: Yes.

626
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,823
ELLA: Just put it in your cheek.

627
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,799
COURTNEY: There's one. Fluffy bunny.

628
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,848
- CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.
- (laughter)

629
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:14,367
- COURTNEY: Here's two.
- KIP: Watch out, this is the backsplash area.

630
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,495
CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

631
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:19,853
- (laughter)
- ELLA: Oh, my God, I'm dying.

632
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:22,883
- CHANDI: Fluffy bunny!
- CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

633
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:26,292
- (laughter)
- (cheering)

634
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:29,238
- Fluffy bunny.
- (laughter)

635
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:33,726
ZACKARY: These... these are
some sorority antics, for sure.

636
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:36,349
- (horse neighs)
- WOMAN: This is Bishop's Lodge...

637
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:38,181
we want to welcome you this morning.

638
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,886
CAITLYN: Okay, Chandi,
your first lesson.

639
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,857
- This is what you got to watch out for.
- CHANDI: Ooh.

640
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:43,716
CAITLYN: Ooh, yeah. Ooh!

641
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,393
CHANDI: Wow, that's a big dump.

642
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:47,230
(chuckling) CAITLYN: Let's do it.

643
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:50,850
- Today, the next adventure.
- CHANDI: Ooh.

644
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:53,233
- MAN: Pistol Pete. Anybody can ride him.
- CHANDI: Pistol Pete.

645
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:54,730
JENNY: Toes up, heels down.

646
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,040
CAITLYN: Some never ridden before.

647
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,322
Some have done a lot of riding.

648
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,753
I've done a lot of riding in my day.

649
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:02,282
- JENNY: You're looking good, Chandi.
- CHANDI: Oh.

650
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,376
MAN: All right. Everybody follow me.

651
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,985
CAITLYN: Get that head
pointed in the right direction

652
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,547
- and give him a little kick.
- ZACKARY: Yes. That way.

653
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:11,572
- (horse neighs)
- CHANDI: Um... Oh.

654
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,915
- Uh, uh...
- (horse neighs, sputtering)

655
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:15,511
Uh... Uh...

656
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:19,315
let's come get him.

657
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,945
- Okay. Tell them to come get him.
- (horse sputters)

658
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,028
Okay.

659
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:30,292
Oh, Pistol Pete.

660
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:33,488
Whoa. I don't know what I'm doing.

661
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:36,429
- I'm... I'm trying to be calm.
- (horse sputtering)

662
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:40,139
Okay.

663
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:41,865
(horse neighs)

664
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:43,948
Yes.

665
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,401
Okay.

666
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:48,615
Good job, Pistol Pete. (Chuckles)

667
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:50,658
MAN: You sure you never ride before?

668
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,359
- CHANDI: I'm positive.
- MAN: Oh, you're doing a very good job.

669
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,793
- CHANDI: Oh, well, great.
- MAN: It's like natural.

670
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:57,582
- CAITLYN: Hey, Zackary.
- ZACKARY: Yeah.

671
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:01,073
- CAITLYN: First time riding with boobs.
- ZACKARY: Yeah. Really.

672
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:03,450
CAITLYN: That's why you
need a good sports bra.

673
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:06,502
- (Zackary laughs)
- (horse neighs)

674
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:09,014
JENNY: I don't want
to be a nay-sayer...

675
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,019
- (chuckling)
- ... but, um,

676
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:14,199
there's gonna be trouble
if we don't come together.

677
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,380
I'm loving doing this.
Knowing Caitlyn Jenner means

678
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:19,373
going on wonderful adventures,

679
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:21,100
but it's... it's about
more than having fun.

680
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:24,201
There really are things that
should be called into question,

681
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,730
because Caitlyn has been...

682
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:29,375
I hate to say it, but
she's been kind of a bully.

683
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:32,288
- CAITLYN: How pretty is this, huh?
- ZACKARY: This is beautiful.

684
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:35,530
(insects trilling)

685
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,040
KIP: Look what we
got! Cait, she got a...

686
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,641
- COURTNEY: What is this?
- KIP: She got a special package.

687
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:45,654
COURTNEY: What do you think it is?

688
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:48,311
A tennis bracelet? Diamonds?

689
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:49,982
Better.

690
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:51,948
- CAITLYN: Better?
- COURTNEY: Better than diamonds.

691
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:53,852
It's my favorite thing in the world.

692
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:57,183
CAITLYN: Oh, God. I'm learning so much.

693
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,853
CANDIS: The color's so pretty.

694
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:00,953
- CHANDI: The color is gorgeous.
- CAITLYN: A vroom-vroom.

695
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:03,075
COURTNEY: A... a what?
What did you just call it?

696
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:04,673
You're just gonna grab it?

697
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:06,316
- CHANDI: Vroom!
- CAITLYN: Vroom.

698
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,132
COURTNEY: You're just grabbing it.

699
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:10,672
- ELLA: Wait, this is amazing.
- CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

700
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,604
CANDIS: Show me.

701
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:14,977
COURTNEY: Why is everyone
touching it like that?!

702
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:17,266
- ELLA: Does it vibrate?
- COURTNEY: I'm gonna have to wash it!

703
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:19,466
- CANDIS: Hello?
- (laughter)

704
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:20,630
H... hello?

705
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:24,077
COURTNEY: I never can use
it now. I can never use it.

706
00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:26,087
(laughter)

707
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,395
- CANDIS: It's like lipstick.
- CHANDI: Oh!

708
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:35,226
- (whirring)
- (laughter)

709
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:38,194
(indistinct chatter)

710
00:32:38,314 --> 00:32:40,611
CHANDI: We are gonna toast to

711
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:44,109
- the<i> Glamour</i> Woman of the Year.
- ELLA: Cheers.

712
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,606
COURTNEY: Caitlyn Jenner.

713
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:49,033
- CAITLYN: This award is for all of us.
- (cheering)

714
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,832
KATE: I have a happiness
thing I'd like to share.

715
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:55,299
- CAITLYN: Good.
- KATE: I had

716
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,084
many second thoughts
about coming on this trip.

717
00:32:58,658 --> 00:33:01,637
I... I didn't know whether
I could do it health-wise.

718
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,606
But the other, uh, stumbling block

719
00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:06,583
was Boylan.

720
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,579
JENNY: And... and it was mutual. Right?

721
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:12,119
KATE: We are each other's evil twin.

722
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:17,365
All right? We're both
committed to trans...

723
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:19,967
supremacy! (Laughs)

724
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,061
(laughter)

725
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:26,389
Our tactics and our ideologies

726
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:27,926
are loggerheads.

727
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:31,597
- We had a long talk.
- JENNY: Oh, we did.

728
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:34,994
KATE: We did. What we ended up with is,

729
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:36,932
"Some of your stuff is hard to hear

730
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:39,382
and I know some of what
I say is hard to hear

731
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:42,852
and I'm trying to throttle
it back in your presence.

732
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:46,255
But I know you listen to me and
I promise I'll listen to you."

733
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:48,672
JENNY: And we came to a good place.

734
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:52,776
Is there any way that our friendship,

735
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,541
the fact that we disagree on so much

736
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:55,967
but that we love each other so much,

737
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:58,206
can we use the thing that we have

738
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,016
to open her up a little?

739
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:02,545
KATE: If she allows us in.

740
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:07,095
So this brings me to my mea culpa...

741
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,637
- CAITLYN: Okay.
- KATE: ... and my olive branch to you.

742
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:14,523
(sighs)

743
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,102
The other day on the bus,

744
00:34:17,698 --> 00:34:19,313
I was a smartass.

745
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:23,040
I said to myself, "Oh, I
know Caitlyn's a Republican.

746
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:25,178
Let's see if we can
get a rise out of her."

747
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,619
- And I said, "Hey, Caitlyn... "
- CAITLYN: Did it work?

748
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:32,378
KATE: "Caitlyn... Donald
Trump or Hillary Clinton?"

749
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:35,336
- CAITLYN: Yeah, I know, yeah.
- KATE: And we were off to the races.

750
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:37,552
I walked out of the room

751
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:39,067
while you were talking,

752
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:43,009
and I want you to know it wasn't
because of what you were saying.

753
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:45,744
- I want to know more about that.
- CAITLYN: Right.

754
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,659
KATE: The kind of anger

755
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:52,868
- that was coming... anger's a healthy...
- CAITLYN: It's passion.

756
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,163
KATE: And I hear it as anger

757
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:59,885
and I go, "Uh-oh, scared
little boy, Daddy's angry."

758
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:01,628
And I leave.

759
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,657
JENNY: Caitlyn, I want
to make sure that you hear

760
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:09,184
that it made not just Kate
but many of us uncomfortable.

761
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:12,823
CAITLYN: Yeah, I... I look
at all the issues, I think,

762
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:15,884
in a much different way than most
people in this room look at the issues.

763
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:16,984
JENNY: It's not about the issues...

764
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:19,859
we're asking you to hear the
fact that we're telling you

765
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:21,360
we were scared.

766
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:30,158
CAITLYN: Yeah, I... I look
at all the issues, I think,

767
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:33,112
in a much different way than most
people in this room look at the issues.

768
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,173
JENNY: It's not about the issues.

769
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,944
We're asking you to hear the
fact that we're telling you

770
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,551
we were scared.

771
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:49,505
CANDIS: For me, it
was the idea that I...

772
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:52,289
I listen to you and
what you... what you say,

773
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:54,882
but sometimes you don't listen to me

774
00:35:56,143 --> 00:35:59,280
- when I'm talking.
- CAITLYN: I... I agree with that, yes.

775
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,869
- CANDIS: So, that... that's what it is...
- CAITLYN: Or I disagree...

776
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:05,260
- and I get a little bit excited for the extreme.
- CANDIS: You do, yeah.

777
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:06,779
CHANDI: When you're a sister

778
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,370
and you're coming from a good place,

779
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:11,271
these things should be received.

780
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:12,919
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- CHANDI: They don't have to be liked,

781
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,958
but they should be received,
and that's the important thing.

782
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:18,636
JENNY: When you talk to us,

783
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:21,631
we hope that you will
speak with gentleness

784
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,373
and with love. And I... I...

785
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:25,234
CAITLYN: Um, I... I agree with that...

786
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:27,921
sometimes I get very passionate
about it and I kind of

787
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,801
feel Bruce comes in and I go... (grunts)

788
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:31,744
- JENNY: And that's the thing to pay atten...
- CAITLYN: Would you listen to me,

789
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,388
- what I have to say?
- JENNY: But that's the thing

790
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:35,566
- to... to pay attention to, because...
- CAITLYN: Oh, I totally agree with that.

791
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:38,087
- JENNY: It's... It was scary.
- CAITLYN: And I totally agree

792
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:40,216
with you from that standpoint...
I was a little rough, yeah.

793
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:42,047
CHANDI: I didn't think you was
rough... you know, I sat there with you.

794
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,914
I'm a rider, mm-hmm.

795
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:50,004
CAITLYN: I admit I get very...

796
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,088
uh, upset... uh, not upset, I get,

797
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,197
I become very aggressive
when it comes to politics.

798
00:36:58,246 --> 00:37:01,303
And listening is always
something I have to work on,

799
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,110
okay? That's the feminine side of me

800
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,208
that I'm working on, yeah.

801
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:09,210
ZACKARY: You know, I really,
actually think, with all due respect,

802
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,342
our community has been
prone to infighting

803
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,334
- and division and conflict.
- CAITLYN: Oh, yeah.

804
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:16,727
ZACKARY: And a lot of anger.

805
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:20,507
And I think that, as a
community, the fact that

806
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:25,069
we can all feel safe to kind
of explore our differences

807
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:28,081
in the most respectful way possible

808
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:31,476
is modeling behavior
for the trans community

809
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,867
- and for the world community.
- KATE: Well said.

810
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:37,358
CAITLYN: Yeah, well, we need
that conversation in this country,

811
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:38,525
big time.

812
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:40,383
ZACKARY: Minds are made to change.

813
00:37:40,428 --> 00:37:43,225
We are all evolving all the time.

814
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:46,576
For me, having a friend like
Caitlyn, I've evolved, you know?

815
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:48,660
So I can't help but think that

816
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:51,405
with her having, you
know, five or six friends

817
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:54,354
who have really different
ideas about things is...

818
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,389
We can help her evolve too.

819
00:37:56,764 --> 00:37:58,720
- CAITLYN: By the way, Candis.
- CANDIS: Yeah?

820
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:00,969
CAITLYN: On the Hillary Clinton issue...

821
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:03,339
I know you walked out
and I felt really bad,

822
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:06,003
and I just want to apologize.

823
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:09,109
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: I did not mean to upset you.

824
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:11,127
- I might even take a picture with Hillary.
- (group gasps)

825
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:14,078
I haven't... You and me and Hillary,

826
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,656
- um, but I didn't mean to upset you and I apologize.
- CANDIS: That actually means a lot.

827
00:38:17,656 --> 00:38:20,301
I d... I didn't mean to
raise my voice, either.

828
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:22,774
- CAITLYN: You know I love you.
- CANDIS: I love you too.

829
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,871
CAITLYN: How do we get
on the bus for 30 days

830
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:30,427
and, uh, not go... not
go after each other?

831
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,718
Um, I need to be calmer.

832
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:36,035
I think I could get more accomplished.

833
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:41,009
Let little Caitlyn carry the
conversation in a calm way.

834
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:43,710
Well, I have to try that.

835
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,007
Yeah.

836
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:48,767
- JENNY: Mr. Mayor, it's a pleasure.
- JAVIER: Welcome, and I'm glad you're here,

837
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,101
because we are actually
gonna do something.

838
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:53,952
It's a very small effort
to send a powerful message.

839
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:55,829
KATE: My honor, Mr. Mayor.

840
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:06,409
And now we're going
to meet the mayor. Yay!

841
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,937
- Caitlyn Jenner, hi, how are you?
- JAVIER: How are you, Caitlyn?

842
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,190
- Welcome to Santa Fe.
- CAITLYN: Very nice to meet you.

843
00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:14,173
- JAVIER: I'm Mayor Gonzalez.
- JENNY: Mr. Mayor, it's a pleasure.

844
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:17,386
JAVIER: Over the last
year we passed a important,

845
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:20,361
uh, ordinance... a
gender-neutral bathroom ordinance.

846
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:22,917
A very small thing to do to change out,

847
00:39:22,962 --> 00:39:24,351
uh, the signs of a bathroom,

848
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,743
but it sent out a very powerful message.

849
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:28,205
It wasn't easy.

850
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,174
There was a lot of
fear-mongering that went on.

851
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,595
- CAITLYN: That's exactly, yeah.
- JAVIER: People trying to

852
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:33,837
distort what we were trying to do,

853
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:38,269
but I knew, because of Chloe and so
many other people in our community,

854
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:41,683
that we could not give up.

855
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,229
KATE: The Santa Fe bathroom ordinance

856
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,733
was a big step in the right direction.

857
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:51,341
A single seater was labeled female.

858
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:54,442
Another single seater was labeled male.

859
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:56,724
What is the point in that?

860
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:59,905
So they... they so wisely put up,

861
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:01,571
okay, this is gender neutral.

862
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:04,088
Whoever gets in here
can use the bathroom.

863
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,416
That makes so much sense.

864
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:08,544
CAITLYN: Kate has been an
activist in this community for

865
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,282
- 30 years.
- KATE: 30 years.

866
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:13,468
And you've given me a place to pee.

867
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:16,542
- Thank you so much.
- (applause)

868
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,596
JAVIER: Thank you.

869
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:21,973
And I'm glad you're here, because
we are actually gonna do something...

870
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:24,321
CAITLYN: Hey!

871
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,542
- we're actually gonna change out the signage...
- KATE: Come on.

872
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:28,340
- JAVIER: ... of the bathrooms.
- CAITLYN: And I think you should do it.

873
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:29,418
- KATE: I didn't know that. Oh!
- JAVIER: Would you do it,

874
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:30,571
would you help me do it?

875
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:34,460
CAITLYN: I had a chance to
talk to Kate about her issues

876
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:36,740
over the last 30, 35 years,

877
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,685
with, just the simple thing
as the good old bathroom.

878
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:41,382
And she told me some

879
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:44,746
horrifying stories about
how she was treated.

880
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,893
So I thought it would
really be appropriate...

881
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,555
because I think it would
mean a lot to her...

882
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:51,745
if she changed the sign on the bathroom.

883
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:53,366
JAVIER: And so, as a I said, it's a...

884
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:55,822
it's a very small, uh,

885
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:58,072
effort to send a powerful message

886
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:59,956
to you and everyone
else living in Santa Fe.

887
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,542
So if you would help me put this up,

888
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:04,189
- I would be honored.
- KATE: My honor, Mr. Mayor.

889
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:11,550
- CAITLYN: Yay!
- (applause)

890
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,230
KATE: More than safe... because "safe"

891
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:18,723
is always relative... more
than safe, I feel included.

892
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:21,660
I feel acknowledged, I feel respected.

893
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:29,367
Putting the sign on the door
that said "gender neutral"

894
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:33,813
was surreal. But the fact is there
are gonna be more signs like it,

895
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,381
and Caitlyn was generous enough to say,

896
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:38,891
"Kate, you do that."

897
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:43,307
That's the generous spirit I want
to touch in Caitlyn, right there.

898
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:45,606
She was so sweet to give that to me.

899
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:51,786
CAITLYN: Got it.

900
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:58,498
CAITLYN: Kylie was
supposed to be my date,

901
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,494
I get a phone call from her saying
she's had a wardrobe malfunction.

902
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:05,780
KYLIE: My vagina was out. Not my boob,

903
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:08,467
not my butt crack, my vagina.

904
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:11,215
ZACKARY: Candis Cayne
has a date tonight.

905
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:14,108
CANDIS: I'm waiting for
somebody, nobody's showing up.

906
00:42:14,228 --> 00:42:15,492
CHANDI: It's official.

907
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:17,725
(cheering, applause)

908
00:42:17,774 --> 00:42:20,741
CAITLYN: It's almost, like,
kind of throwing old Bruce...

909
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,648
out the door.
