1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,859
To be honest with you, I can't...

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:07,457
see myself dating, like,
women in the future.

3
00:00:07,577 --> 00:00:08,901
- Wow.
- Yeah, I would date a man...

4
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:12,328
and it's kind of nice just to
get that kind of off your chest.

5
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,506
Like, I moved
out here with a guy, and

6
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:19,110
then when things got rough, he...

7
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:22,473
was abusing. Your pool of men,

8
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:24,634
it gets thinner as you... once you

9
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:27,134
tell them that you're... you're trans.

10
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:30,590
Like, I've failed relationship
after failed relationship,

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,497
and I can't figure out why.

12
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,707
- He's cute.
- Gorgeous.

13
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,128
Miss Candis has a date tonight.

14
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:41,686
I'm alone, waiting
for somebody with a drink,

15
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:43,607
and nobody's showing up.

16
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:45,746
I got to go back to New York

17
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,746
to get the Glamour
Woman of The Year Award.

18
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:48,594
Caitlyn!

19
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,045
Kylie was supposed to be my date,

20
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:53,726
but she's had a wardrobe malfunction.

21
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,060
My vagina was out.

22
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,243
Not my boob, my vagina.

23
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:02,588
It has been so
long since I have performed,

24
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:05,098
so I am a little nervous.

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,022
Chandelier!

26
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:16,153
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

27
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,998
Hello.

28
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,758
- Hi!
- Good morning.

29
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:30,490
- Good morning.
- We're in winter wonderland

30
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:31,494
- this morning.
- I know.

31
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:34,035
Full snowstorm in New Mexico.

32
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,258
- Yeah.
- Of course.

33
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:39,089
This is like home
in New York. This is fine.

34
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:40,317
I'm good with this.

35
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:44,207
- Breakfast!
- Good morning.

36
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:47,176
Morning.

37
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:49,989
Great. I
believe Miss Candis Cayne

38
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,047
has a date tonight.

39
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:56,369
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

40
00:01:56,396 --> 00:02:00,062
I took the liberty of creating a profile.

41
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:02,754
- Mm-hm.
- I just wanted to make an announcement

42
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:06,884
that we've succeeded...
finding a date for Candis Cayne.

43
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:07,898
Go, CC.

44
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,091
- So, what's your type, Candis?
- The A type.

45
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,287
- A pulse.
- So you're looking for tall,

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,707
dark and handsome?

47
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:16,802
I can't believe that even Candis,

48
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,325
an absolutely gorgeous woman,
has to do online dating.

49
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:24,361
I've never realized, or
certainly have experienced,

50
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,674
the issues, uh, when it
comes to trans women dating.

51
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:29,800
Uh, Candis has been out
there for a long time,

52
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:32,889
uh, never been married but had
some very long relationships.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,916
But right now, she doesn't.
She's kind of footloose

54
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:37,707
and fancy free, so, if that's
really important to her,

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,881
hey, Candis, go for it.

56
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,123
- I'm disillusioned with it all.
- Are you not excited?

57
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,699
Uh, not really.

58
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:47,574
After the stimulating conversation
we've had over politics...

59
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,182
- Yes!
- ... that would be like nothing!

60
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,504
That would be nothing!
It would be like sleeping.

61
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:53,157
You might find it more of a relief.

62
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:57,734
I have to say that my online
dating experience so far

63
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:00,935
has been dismal. I don't go out to clubs,

64
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,704
I don't really do anything
but work or go home,

65
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:07,526
and so I thought online
dating would be a good way

66
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:11,745
to meet guys and meet somebody that
I'm compatible with, that I like.

67
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,165
We got a couple
things to open here,

68
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,174
and it's extraordinarily significant.

69
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,224
Drumroll, please.

70
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,264
Drumroll!

71
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:23,743
Everybody ready! Whoa...

72
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:25,230
Whoa!

73
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:27,873
It's official!

74
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,851
We're legal!

75
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,366
In the trans community,

76
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:39,558
proper identification is a big issue.

77
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,381
To get a job, to travel.

78
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,984
I cannot believe you came
all the way down here,

79
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,922
early in the morning, to support me.

80
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,695
Do you understand how important a...

81
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,531
DMV photo is?

82
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,504
Hey, guys.

83
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:57,309
You're here for the big day!

84
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:58,768
Okay, guys, we got the picture.

85
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:00,274
I need to add some good lighting

86
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,649
and light you the right way.

87
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,399
Yeah, baby.

88
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:04,909
Look straight ahead.

89
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,838
Congratulations!

90
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:08,954
Congrats.

91
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:11,745
For Kourtney and Kim to come in

92
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,517
to kind of be at my side,

93
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:17,071
and to have that process done
for me was really important.

94
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,473
The picture came out great!

95
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:21,107
Yeah.

96
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,634
Yeah, that's...

97
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:23,845
You know what?

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,635
I noticed it when my social
security card came through.

99
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,433
It's almost, like,

100
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:32,670
a whole part of my life.

101
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,192
Like kind of throwing old Bruce...

102
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,054
out the door.

103
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:42,981
You know, he was a very good person.

104
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:52,370
Did a lot of
good things in his life.

105
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:58,237
And sometimes I feel like
maybe he didn't deserve to be...

106
00:04:58,724 --> 00:04:59,747
gone.

107
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,385
And I probably held
that in for a long time.

108
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:06,333
But at some point in your life,
after all of the other things

109
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:09,455
you're... you gotta say, "Aw,
(bleep), I gotta move forward."

110
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,531
Yes.

111
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:11,893
And, uh...

112
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:14,447
it's not that I ever wanted to

113
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,438
throw him away...

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,944
but, uh...

115
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,128
anyway, it's just a
significant... you know?

116
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,347
You look at this,

117
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:24,878
and not only done a gender
marker, name's changed,

118
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,579
the picture's changed,
all that sort of stuff...

119
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,719
- it's a totally... different person.
- Mm-hmm.

120
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:33,523
And certainly not that
that old person was a bad person,

121
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,311
- just wasn't me.
- Right.

122
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,101
So when you see this...

123
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:38,672
pretty significant.

124
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:39,651
You know?

125
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,383
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

126
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,062
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.

127
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,229
It is kind of symbolic that
I get my driver's license

128
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,872
a couple of days before,

129
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:50,690
uh, I have to fly to New York

130
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,691
to get Glamour's Woman of the Year Award.

131
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,017
Which, to me, is, unbelievable.

132
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:56,419
So I'd like to take,

133
00:05:56,491 --> 00:06:00,848
in the future, all the great
qualities that he had, and, um,

134
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:03,273
put him into her, and move forward.

135
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,332
Remember, this award is for all of us,

136
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:09,220
it's not just about me, that is for sure.

137
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:18,263
Hi, ladies.

138
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,575
- Hi.
- Some tequila?

139
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,523
- Why not? Thank you.
- Excuse me.

140
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,394
- She certainly would.
- Oh, absolutely.

141
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,925
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,867
_

143
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,903
_

144
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,962
You need more moral
support? You know what to do.

145
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:39,069
You would think, but I don't know.

146
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:40,940
Yeah.

147
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,682
Where's the picture of this guy?

148
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,360
You gotta be hard to get, girl.

149
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:48,324
Your biggest problem is, you
gotta get this guy past me.

150
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,021
You know? And so...

151
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:53,472
- I'm watching.
- That might be kind of awkward with the...

152
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:57,401
I've never been, in my entire
life, a, like, a big dater,

153
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:59,232
like I was going out all the time.

154
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,076
So for me in the future,

155
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:03,117
dating as a trans woman,

156
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:06,795
I don't see myself, like,
obsessed, with something like that.

157
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:10,238
I see the girls being rejected
a lot, when it comes to dating,

158
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:12,453
and I don't want that in my life.

159
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:15,033
And so yeah, the rejection
thing kind of scares me.

160
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:18,386
I keep on looking at that door.

161
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,341
Why aren't you just sitting at the bar?

162
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:23,051
- What time is he coming?
- I should be sitting at the bar, waiting.

163
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,444
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I think I'm gonna go

164
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,963
find a seat somewhere and
wait for him to arrive.

165
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,922
- Where is he?
- He's ten minutes late already.

166
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:45,349
Honestly, I feel kind of embarrassed.

167
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:48,803
I'm alone, waiting for
somebody with a drink,

168
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:52,124
and nobody's showing up. It's insulting.

169
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:54,970
Why am I doing this to myself again?

170
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,377
Girl.

171
00:07:56,661 --> 00:08:00,127
- Oh, yes, honey.
- You are a vision.

172
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,075
I just messaged him and said,
"When are you coming by?"

173
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:06,200
- And what did he say?
- Um, he hasn't responded yet.

174
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,349
- Did he show up?
- He didn't show up.

175
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,564
Could you be stood up?

176
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,323
You're laughing?

177
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,237
- No, no, no, no...
- You're laughing.

178
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:15,990
I'm not laugh... I'm not laughing.

179
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,683
- You're totally laughing.
- No, I'm not laughing.

180
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,853
- No.
- I got stood up.

181
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,783
I would be devastated.

182
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,399
I think it takes a lot of guts for Candis

183
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:29,184
to be sitting at the bar, waiting
for this "date" to show up;

184
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,164
it is not easy at all.

185
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,194
I think, for me, at this point,

186
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,120
I... I don't even want to deal with it.

187
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:37,398
Was he supposed to show up
at a certain time, or no?

188
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,738
- Yeah, and he never did.
- He's a dog!

189
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,941
- As most of them are.
- We don't like him already.

190
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,533
- Aren't they all?
- Yeah.

191
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,109
We're in the new millennium.

192
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:48,116
I'm sick and tired of men who feel like

193
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,725
they have the upper hand on trans women.

194
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,672
- you.
- Right.

195
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,935
- I'm sorry. I'm over it.
- I like that attitude.

196
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:59,284
I love it when you cuss.

197
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:09,378
Let's go.

198
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,453
Have you guys ever
been around chickens before?

199
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:12,837
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

200
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,484
Not Silkie chickens.

201
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:19,945
To help your mind/body
experience healthy living,

202
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:22,590
this resort does animal therapy.

203
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,907
So we're just gonna pet Silkie chickens.

204
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,040
They're really, really soft...

205
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:28,810
- it's almost like petting a cat.
- Wow.

206
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:33,184
- Mm-hmm. Come on out.
- All right. Oh, my God.

207
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,138
Wow.

208
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:40,027
So, chickens are part of
our animal interaction here,

209
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,740
'cause they've actually
shown that lowers your anxiety

210
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:46,201
and your stress levels. Each one
has a really different personality.

211
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:48,462
Just like our group of trans women.

212
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:52,457
_

213
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:56,336
_

214
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:02,587
These guys are notoriously hard

215
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,729
to actually tell who are boys and girls.

216
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,034
Story of our life.

217
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,327
Well, it really got me thinking

218
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:12,689
about petting cocks.

219
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,641
But you should...

220
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,419
- Hey, Cayne!
- Yeah?

221
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,694
- Are you ready to get it down?
- I am ready.

222
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:37,680
- We are going dancing, girl.
- Yes. For our, you know,

223
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,494
two-woman show that we're gonna do.

224
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:42,250
I, uh...

225
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,559
I really wanted to

226
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,852
have us all go to salsa
class, but mostly Caitlyn,

227
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:52,490
because I want her to start getting
in touch with her feminine side.

228
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,036
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi! Hello!

229
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:56,140
And it would be a bonus

230
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,601
if there are some really cute guys there.

231
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,398
My name is Carlos Mora,

232
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,351
and I'm gonna be the instructor today,

233
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,611
and I will explain to
you the steps of salsa

234
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:05,973
which are very, very simple,

235
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,501
and then we'll just line up in couples.

236
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,103
Okay, so we're gonna start the class.

237
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:14,274
- Can anybody tell me when salsa dancing was invented?
- _

238
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:19,543
_

239
00:11:19,582 --> 00:11:21,592
- With what?
- _

240
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,769
_

241
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:26,475
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

242
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:27,429
_

243
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,254
_

244
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,035
_

245
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,243
I lost my appetite

246
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,990
when that went down. I was like, ugh!

247
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:40,523
- Oh, well...
- The restaurant owner didn't want us there.

248
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,840
He found out what show it was for,

249
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:46,117
and he said, "No, you
can't film here anymore."

250
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:50,141
What is holding you back from...

251
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,390
just going on a date with someone?

252
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,288
Thought about bringing up to Kylie,

253
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,805
"I should start dating or
doing something like that."

254
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:59,992
I just, I... I can't
even bring the subject up.

255
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,824
_

256
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:06,851
With what?

257
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,430
_

258
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:10,365
_

259
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:12,635
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

260
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:15,488
_

261
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:18,070
_

262
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:22,459
Honestly, Caitlyn hasn't really embraced

263
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,445
those sides of her feminine self yet.

264
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:29,083
But this isn't like speed
dating, this is a dance class,

265
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:34,078
we're doing salsa, and that's usually
pretty normal to have male dancers.

266
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,706
Which way do we start with?

267
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,352
Which way do we start?

268
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,652
- Is it this way or am I that way?
- It's this way, yeah.

269
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:43,677
... and five, six, seven.

270
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,497
And one, two, three...

271
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:47,289
and five, six, seven.

272
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:49,991
Come on, I can shake
it just as good as you can.

273
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:55,204
I was too busy on shaking it.

274
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,664
First of all, who wouldn't
want to dance with Candis?

275
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:00,260
She's a great dancer, great, perfect.

276
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:07,728
I was too back on my heel.

277
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:10,284
I
just feel uncomfortable,

278
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,968
especially if you get
some guy who I don't know

279
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,447
who the heck he is.

280
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:17,416
I am just not ready to
put myself out there.

281
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,228
- I'm gonna stick with Candis.
- Rotate.

282
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,790
We're not rotating.

283
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,620
Thank you very much.

284
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,138
Thank you!

285
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:28,924
- That was fun.
- You did it.

286
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,811
- That was so much fun.
- That was fun.

287
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:39,462
I think I'm ready.

288
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:41,655
First commercial road trip.

289
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,754
God, it's great!

290
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,992
You get to use your driver's
license for the first time.

291
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,650
All those people,
all those people, yeah.

292
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,011
- You have your license?
- Oh, I got it.

293
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,359
Okay. Just making sure.

294
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,247
All right. I
got to leave the trip.

295
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,302
I got to go back to New York

296
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:56,244
to get the Glamour
Woman of the Year Award.

297
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:58,795
- Have a great journey. You're gonna be great.
- Thank you.

298
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,295
- Okay. I'll get through it, I promise you.
- You're gonna be great.

299
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,568
I'll represent.

300
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,623
I'm quite nervous about this.

301
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,855
Kylie's gonna meet me in
New York... she's my date.

302
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:09,819
- It's a really big deal.
- You'll do well,

303
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:11,432
- and we'll... we'll be here for you
- I appreciate it.

304
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:14,474
- ... when you come back.
- Oh, don't worry, I'll find you in Chicago.

305
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,199
- Good.
- Okay.

306
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,990
So, Jason, where we headed to?

307
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,234
- Into Tulsa.
- Tulsa?

308
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:28,814
Tulsa, Oklahoma?

309
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,968
The trans guy, I don't
know if guys you're familiar,

310
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,072
Arin Andrews, lives there.

311
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,052
- He was on Barney's with his...
- The fashion spread.

312
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,295
Yeah. And he's really (bleep) cute.

313
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,734
Oh, we love it!

314
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,408
- Hella.
- Yeah.

315
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:45,896
Well, if we can figure
it out, you should definitely

316
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,308
hang out with him. That would be great.

317
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,670
That would be awesome.

318
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:54,893
I'm super excited, really,
to go to Chicago, to see Mimi.

319
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,802
She's one of my best friends.

320
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,661
She's a showgirl.

321
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:02,462
She's been working at the
Baton for, like, 25 years.

322
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:04,433
- Nothing like a good drag show.
- Yeah.

323
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,307
All the rigmarole

324
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:09,311
- and kinky things that go on...
- Yes.

325
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,667
... back there,
I really miss those days.

326
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,876
I was thinking that maybe
we can go and see her at the Baton.

327
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,985
Maybe I would do a number
with her and Chandi.

328
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:21,685
Oh... oh, yes, please.

329
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,583
No. I'm here to support you girls.

330
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,463
I know, but you were
saying you were kind of missing

331
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:29,772
- the old Chandelier days.
- You used to do drag?

332
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,659
- I did!
- Oh, my goodness!

333
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,103
I used to. I think
about those days a lot.

334
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:38,116
And I would love to
perform again someday soon.

335
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:41,794
Performing is such a great outlet for me.

336
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,898
Not all performers are men.

337
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,578
Just like Candis Cayne.
She's a trans woman

338
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:48,961
who likes to perform and entertain.

339
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:52,478
I feel such happiness when
I'm on that stage, shining,

340
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,146
- getting my life.
- I've never been to a drag show.

341
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:57,350
Oh, my goodness, you are in store

342
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:59,415
for a treat.

343
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,696
Who's hungry?

344
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,600
Oh, this is perfectly okay.

345
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,086
_

346
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,228
_

347
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:21,750
They wouldn't allow us in here,

348
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,390
which is horrible for them, because, um,

349
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,143
you know, a lot of people
see this show, so it would be

350
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:28,867
some good promotion for them.

351
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,870
I lost my appetite when
that went down. I was like, ugh!

352
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:32,998
Oh, well...

353
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:35,085
But, you know, it is, what it is.

354
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,494
It is really kind of a bummer the
restaurant owner didn't want us there.

355
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:43,272
Um, we were allowed to film, and then...

356
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,966
he found out what show
it was for and he said,

357
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:49,400
"No, you can't film here
anymore," he's not interested.

358
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:51,984
We're so used to living
in our... our bubble...

359
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,518
- Our bubble of acceptance.
- ... that everything is happy and accepting.

360
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,033
But this is something we
can look forward to experiencing,

361
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:58,783
being down this way, though.

362
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:00,065
In the South.

363
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,950
It's a little weird, you know?

364
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,395
C'est la vie.

365
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:10,748
- All right, let's do it.
- Oh, God.

366
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:14,069
- He's cute.
- Gorgeous.

367
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:15,263
I know, right?

368
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:17,680
Laith is getting it in!

369
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,442
Kylie says she's coming,

370
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,037
but we'll see. She
hasn't made it here yet.

371
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,560
So I got to do the red
carpet all by myself,

372
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,290
and to be honest with
you, that is very scary.

373
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:31,082
Caitlyn! Caitlyn!

374
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,771
What's going on?

375
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:37,803
You're on speaker now, Mom.

376
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,332
- We're in the van.
- Hi, Mom.

377
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:42,134
- Oh, okay.
- There's Candis, and there's Ella,

378
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:43,674
JB's up there, too.

379
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:46,303
_

380
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,966
We're on our way rock climbing.

381
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,925
_

382
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,549
_

383
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:56,473
Oh! Okay.

384
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:57,801
- You guys take care. Okay.
- All right.

385
00:17:57,829 --> 00:17:59,141
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

386
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:03,652
- Hi.
- Hi.

387
00:18:03,652 --> 00:18:05,494
- How are you? Candis.
- Hi, Candis. Laith.

388
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:08,307
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Candis. I'm Arin.

389
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,502
- Hi. Ella.
- Nice to meet you.

390
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,075
So, actually, Arin told me that

391
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,602
Laith Ashley, another trans guy who
he did his Barney's campaign with,

392
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:19,782
is also in town, so we're gonna
get two for the price of one, so...

393
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,544
Whoo, whoo!

394
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,074
I'm so glad this all worked out.

395
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,228
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Are you all gonna be climbing as well?

396
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:28,847
Well, we're all curious.

397
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:30,326
That's safe, that's safe.

398
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,332
All right, let's do it.

399
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,963
Laith is getting it in!

400
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,858
We need you all the way at
the top, Candis, like Laith.

401
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,564
- Laith is beefy.
- Am I?

402
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:44,649
- Yes, he is.
- All right, Ella.

403
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,693
- Oh, God.
- He's cute.

404
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:48,835
- Gorgeous.
- I know, right?

405
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,963
- They both are.
- Think you're up.

406
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,461
I think so, too, Arin.

407
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,961
You live here?

408
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:56,322
No, no, no, I'm visiting Arin.

409
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,624
I'm from New York, born and raised. Yeah.

410
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:02,699
- I worked at Callen-Lorde in Chelsea,
- Oh, my God.

411
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,797
- Yeah.
- I'm done. I broke a nail.

412
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,582
Well, are we gonna do
this wall over here?

413
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:09,975
- I'll let you take the lead on this one.
- No.

414
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,398
_

415
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,861
_

416
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,659
I mean, it's a good view

417
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:19,471
from below.

418
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,423
Um, I was gonna ask you and Arin

419
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,036
if you guys wanted to
maybe meet for dinner later.

420
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:29,330
- Oh, absolutely, yeah. I'd love to, yeah.
- Cool.

421
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,366
Um, I'll let you know when

422
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,853
- and where and all that stuff.
- Okay, cool. Sounds good.

423
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,227
Okay, good.

424
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:45,578
- Have fun.
- We're at Legends.

425
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,306
_

426
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,266
_

427
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:04,806
_

428
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,275
_

429
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,948
- You got the bull set-up right here.
- I know!

430
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,815
_

431
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,829
Be gentle with me!

432
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,480
Yee-haw!

433
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:30,438
Candis is running
around, dancing and... oh!

434
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:38,434
I never thought about dating
somebody who's trans, ever, and then,

435
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:41,462
you know, meeting Laith...
he's really beautiful.

436
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:44,378
So I should, maybe,

437
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:50,350
open myself up to a bigger pool
of guys that I'm willing to date.

438
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:52,694
_

439
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:54,515
- _
- That's right, I am.

440
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:56,420
That's great.

441
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,667
You're so cute.

442
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:07,011
Do you think it's elegant?

443
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:08,211
- The whole thing?
- It's more than elegant.

444
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,143
That's it, babe. You're so good.

445
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,355
- Are you my date tonight?
- Of course.

446
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:15,327
Of course you're...

447
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:17,608
Well, thank you for
making it here for this.

448
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,073
Oh, my goodness, my pleasure.

449
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:20,315
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- I know!

450
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,822
- It's the Glamour Awards.
- Caitlyn, when did youfind out

451
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:25,199
- you were getting the award?
- Yeah, a couple of months ago.

452
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,308
I was kind of shocked and
extraordinarily honored.

453
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,462
- Why were you shocked?
- You don't grow up your whole life

454
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:35,022
as being me, and think that

455
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,414
your biggest fear is that
you would be thought of

456
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:42,126
as an absolute freak and weirdo, and...

457
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:44,405
- Right.
- To be so welcomed,

458
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:49,121
by not only the trans community, but,

459
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,609
uh, Glamour magazine,
womanhood in general,

460
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,373
it's, um...

461
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:58,559
uh, it's a wonderful, wonderful feeling.

462
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,884
Perfect.

463
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,836
Cinderella!

464
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,283
_

465
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,109
_

466
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:23,391
You got it.

467
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:28,426
- Caitlyn!
- Going to a big event like this,

468
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:31,284
it's always more fun to go and
share it with somebody else.

469
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,897
So, of course, I wanted
Kylie to go with me.

470
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:38,005
But she's had a wardrobe malfunction.

471
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,936
So I gotta do the red
carpet all by myself.

472
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:43,631
And to be honest with
you, that is very scary.

473
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:50,234
Caitlyn! Caitlyn! Caitlyn... !

474
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:52,220
I wanted you right by my side.

475
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:55,396
- My dress ripped all the way down my ass.
- Okay.

476
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,198
I wouldn't want to be on a red carpet

477
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,185
- with my vagina out.
- Uh...

478
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,121
I'll say good-bye to Chandi

479
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:04,905
and come back and say
hello to Miss Chandelier.

480
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:17,558
- All right, will do.
- Hello.

481
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,723
You got it. Till then, bye.

482
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:22,486
Hi, baby. Can I say something?

483
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,749
On the red carpet, you
were supposed to be my date.

484
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,241
Honestly, I wanted you right by my side.

485
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:35,115
My dress was completely see-through

486
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,280
and then my option "B" ripped
all the way down my ass.

487
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,590
- Okay.
- I wouldn't want to beon a red carpet

488
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:42,102
with my vagina out.

489
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:45,356
- Uh...
- My vagina was out. Not my boob,

490
00:23:45,378 --> 00:23:47,921
not my butt crack, my vagina.

491
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:49,603
I didn't know all that, but,

492
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:52,171
hopefully, we could've
worked around that somehow.

493
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,659
And my option "B," my whole
zipper ripped down, so...

494
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:57,345
- Okay.
- And I had a tailor there,

495
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:58,780
- trying to fix it.
- Okay.

496
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,588
Kind of disappointed in Kylie,

497
00:24:00,616 --> 00:24:04,088
but at least she showed
up for the actual show.

498
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,515
Of course, I wanted her to
go with me to the red carpet,

499
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:11,181
but I need to feel comfortable
just doing them on my own.

500
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:13,480
Okay, well, then next time...

501
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,035
- I'm dragging your ass there.
- Yeah.

502
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,354
- Hey.
- Hi! Are you ready for the drive?

503
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:31,828
Ready, ready. Born ready.

504
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:45,895
- _
- To Chicago.

505
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:48,032
It's a red eye!

506
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,255
Look, see? Red.

507
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:54,285
- What's the hardest part of road life?
- There's not enough marijuana.

508
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:59,239
#boomboom.

509
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,546
Ha ha! Hello, Chicago!

510
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:19,107
- It's the woman of the year!
- Woman of the year!

511
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,662
Hey, babe,

512
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:24,827
- there you go, Chandi, how you doing?
- Incredible!

513
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:27,121
- I'm loving the hair.
- Zackary, you're back!

514
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:29,740
I think we need to go have some
pizza and talk about all that.

515
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,945
Yes.

516
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:35,998
I've heard about this for years.

517
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:37,791
It's delicious. The
best pizza in the world.

518
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:40,995
We are in Chicago, and
you know, Chicago's known

519
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:44,050
for the Baton Show Lounge.
Mimi Marks works there,

520
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:46,792
and so I asked her if I could
come and do a number with her...

521
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,901
- Ooh!
- And you guys

522
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,157
could come and watch the show...

523
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:51,189
- We gotta see the show.
- ... and see the other performers.

524
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:53,868
And trans people have
been performing in drag

525
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:56,686
- bars since the beginning of time.
- Oh, I... I agree.

526
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,465
It totally saved me and
helped me figure out who I was.

527
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:01,732
I look at it a, um, a beautiful thing.

528
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:04,461
I don't see you going to drag shows.

529
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:06,554
Um, it's not... it's not really my thing.

530
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:08,524
Some of my sisters and brothers,

531
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,805
it's important for them to see
their lives not as a performance,

532
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:15,138
but as... as reality.

533
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:18,649
I'm totally confused
with how some of your,

534
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:23,668
um, brothers and sisters, who
identify with our community,

535
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:27,669
separate themselves from the world

536
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:30,080
in which some of us began.

537
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:32,318
Drag doesn't do a lot for me.

538
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:34,345
I'm not pretending to be anything.

539
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:37,883
So there are people in the drag
community who find this, uh,

540
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:42,443
a great source of fun and
love and celebration of life.

541
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:45,385
And then there are other people who say,

542
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,305
"This is about performance,

543
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,298
and our lives are not about performance,

544
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,243
our lives are about the
reality." Some of us come from,

545
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:58,227
uh, a drag or a performance
or... or showgirl universe.

546
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:00,589
- Mm-hmm.
- And some of us don't.

547
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:03,575
I would never expect
you to be able to identify

548
00:27:03,608 --> 00:27:05,696
with the world that we've come from,

549
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:10,151
because it has never been your
stilo. It wasn't your introduction.

550
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:12,829
I totally respect the fact

551
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:15,681
that Jenny sees things
from that perspective.

552
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:20,503
But she should be able to see the
connection between our communities.

553
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:33,368
Jenny and Cait
processed it differently,

554
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,499
- they hid differently.
- If it wasn't for drag,

555
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:40,457
maybe I would be a
miserable gay boy, trapped.

556
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,677
Would it be harder
for you to be dating a man,

557
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:47,037
- as opposed to a woman?
- I think it might be a little bit tougher on the

558
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:50,082
girls if it was, um, a guy.

559
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:53,735
If I was dating some
guy, they would go, "Wow!"

560
00:27:58,151 --> 00:28:00,111
Hi, honey. Can I come in?

561
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,462
Sounds like what I was
doing at your door the other day.

562
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,387
Ooh, you have
it chilly up in here!

563
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:07,772
- I was gonna pop this champagne open.
- Oh!

564
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,978
Mm-hmm. I couldn't get over JB.

565
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,139
If it wasn't for drag
and being able to do...

566
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,238
do those shows, maybe I would
be a miserable gay boy, trapped,

567
00:28:20,692 --> 00:28:21,885
right now.

568
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:26,314
A lot of times,
like Jenny and Cait,

569
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:30,005
they come from a different side,
they processed it differently,

570
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,638
they hid differently.

571
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:34,617
That used to be a stress
reliever for me, and I miss...

572
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:38,238
- I miss it. I really do.
- We all know how much you love

573
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,885
- your work and you love your kids.
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:45,591
But there is... You will
not survive if you don't clock out.

575
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,349
Right. Clocking out

576
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:51,960
is a big issue for me. Because I feel like

577
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:54,291
I need to be there for them.

578
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:58,645
And my mom, she's dealing
with a lot right now.

579
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:12,783
My dad was one
of the best people that...

580
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,894
... any person could really ask for.

581
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,073
And he has been dealing with dementia

582
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,384
and my mom is always, always, always

583
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:29,930
not thinking about herself

584
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,988
because she's so worried about him.

585
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:33,813
And that's where I get it from.

586
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,174
When you talk all day and you have to,

587
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:38,596
you know, try to fix things for people,

588
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:42,810
and you're... you're trying to find
housing and you're trying to find food,

589
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,868
it's one of those things
that gets really crazy for me,

590
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:48,972
because it makes me
want to do so much more.

591
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:51,427
I know, honey.

592
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,657
Chandi is amazing.

593
00:29:56,674 --> 00:30:00,866
She comes across, always,
as really happy and

594
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:04,232
she's always a really
positive person, and she

595
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:07,452
works non-stop with on-the-edge youth.

596
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,200
Hi!

597
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,058
We do get into heavy discussions.

598
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,340
You know. We lay it all on the line.

599
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,076
They asked me for my I.D.

600
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:17,113
and then it was like,
um, "She's a tranny."

601
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:18,932
Some people look at me as a human,

602
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:20,986
and some other people
look at me as an animal.

603
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,672
It's extremely important that we're heard.

604
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,451
And we say thank you for
everybody coming to group.

605
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,106
But you know, I think that
she has a lot more going on

606
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:34,500
than any of us even realize.

607
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:37,292
All I say is it's gonna be okay, Candis.

608
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:48,627
Here we go. You look bodacious.

609
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:52,479
For some of the girls,
finding love, it's a challenge.

610
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:53,730
One drink. Are you buying?

611
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:54,907
- Of course you are.
- Yes, I'll buy.

612
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:56,079
- Okay, right, okay.
- Yes, I'll buy.

613
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:59,131
So we are all gonna have
cocktails at the hotel.

614
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:03,295
I'm hoping to exercise
my matchmaking skills.

615
00:31:03,301 --> 00:31:05,388
There's a lot of boys around.

616
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:07,203
All right.

617
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:09,669
I think Zackary and Candis went to mingle.

618
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,030
There's this whole
table of guys back here.

619
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:14,296
_

620
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:15,871
_

621
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,975
It's in the middle of such a public place.

622
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:20,057
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

623
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,240
Yeah.

624
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:24,879
For me, the big problem I have
in a lot of things is rejection.

625
00:31:24,902 --> 00:31:28,345
That's why, probably, one of the
reasons I didn't date that much.

626
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,594
- I'm Scott.
- Hi, nice to meet you, Patrick.

627
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:31,873
- Scott.
- Scott. Nice to meet you.

628
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:33,463
- We're staying in this hotel.
- Okay.

629
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,722
So we're just hanging out.

630
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:35,709
- Nice.
- You know?

631
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,612
- What's your name?
- I'm a friend of Taylor's. Joe.

632
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:39,898
- Okay.
- Caitlyn doesn't really know

633
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:42,773
how to talk to guys at all.

634
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:47,045
With a flirt, with something
more than just who she is.

635
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:51,770
And so she doesn't know how
to... follow. She wants to lead.

636
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:53,497
Well, Joe, it was nice meeting you.

637
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,546
What do you do for, uh,
work? What do you do?

638
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:58,574
I own, uh, a real estate
office and I'm a developer.

639
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:01,056
- Oh, so, residentials or commercial?
- Little of both.

640
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:02,007
- Whatever.
- Commercial.

641
00:32:02,061 --> 00:32:03,146
Wherever there's...

642
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,557
- wherever you can make a buck.
- That's right.

643
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,473
Sometimes, when you're talking

644
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,924
to guys, you have to take
the back seat a little bit.

645
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:11,942
I don't know if she's ready to do that.

646
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,465
I'm outta here.

647
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,166
Did Jenner leave?

648
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:17,170
Jenner's... Jenner's left the building.

649
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:26,012
- Hello?
- Oh!

650
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:27,946
Coming in the back door?

651
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:30,098
- I realized that we have adjoining rooms.
- We have adjoining rooms, I know that,

652
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:31,813
yeah. I know, I know.

653
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,291
They're gonna talk.

654
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:35,751
Now, you need any hair?

655
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:37,944
- Uh, well...
- Courtney's got the hair.

656
00:32:37,962 --> 00:32:39,707
- Oh, that's cool.
- You should, actually,

657
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:41,208
put some dark streaks in there.

658
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,172
Well, how are you doing?

659
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,267
I'm good. I was gonna say that, um,

660
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,006
you wouldn't dance with the
guys when we went dancing.

661
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:50,038
- You only wanted to dance with me.
- I just didn't feel comfortable.

662
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:52,597
Which is fine. I'm not trying
to push you into anything.

663
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:53,467
- Yeah.
- I'm just...

664
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:58,058
just, you know, trying to get you
trying new things as far as dating.

665
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:02,599
I look at you girls and I listen
to you about all the challenges

666
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:07,161
- of dating as a trans woman.
- Right.

667
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:10,616
Okay? How guys, like,

668
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:14,309
want to have sex with you, but then
they don't want to be seen with you.

669
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:16,778
Yeah. I... I would have
a hard time with that.

670
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:19,189
Yeah.

671
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:23,596
What is holding you back from...

672
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:26,539
just going on a date with someone?

673
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:30,611
You know, the other I
thought about bringing it

674
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:33,045
day, up to Kylie.

675
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,724
You know. "I was, uh...

676
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:39,830
maybe I should start dating
or doing something like that."

677
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:42,739
And I was thinking about
it, and I thought: I can't.

678
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,556
I just... I... I can't
even bring the subject up.

679
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:53,243
Hey, we all ready for a good time?

680
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:54,911
Chandi!

681
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:58,650
So much fun for me to watch
my little Chandi up there,

682
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,748
letting it go.

683
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,081
You know, the other day,

684
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:13,972
I thought about bringing it up to Kylie.

685
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:17,298
You know. "I was, uh...

686
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:20,368
maybe I should start dating
or doing something like that."

687
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:23,432
And I was thinking about
it and I thought: I can't.

688
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,534
I just... I... I can't
even bring the subject up.

689
00:34:27,562 --> 00:34:30,515
Would it be harder for
you to be dating a man,

690
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:33,167
as opposed to a woman,
on the kids or visa versa?

691
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:38,079
I think it might be a little bit tougher
on the girls if it was, um, a guy.

692
00:34:38,102 --> 00:34:39,173
Yeah. I think,

693
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:41,737
yeah, if I was dating
some guy they would go,

694
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,063
"Wow."

695
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:45,122
Yeah. Yeah.

696
00:34:45,288 --> 00:34:47,163
- Have you ever dated a woman?
- No.

697
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:48,846
No. See, okay.

698
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:52,319
I'm not looking forward to
having conversations about

699
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,730
dating with my kids.

700
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:56,159
I think if I were to date a man,

701
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:57,941
I think it would be confusing for them.

702
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:00,187
And, uh, I don't want to confuse them.

703
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:02,120
You have to get to the root of what

704
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,112
- you are going through.
- Yeah.

705
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:05,099
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

706
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:09,948
You're allowed to go out
there, have fun, experiment.

707
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:13,181
There's no one... no
one's judging, anymore.

708
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:14,815
Because you are living your truth.

709
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,940
You know?

710
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,994
Maybe if I think of it as an experiment.

711
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:20,949
Yeah.

712
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,692
I need to start new and fresh, also.

713
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:27,625
- Like going out on... on a group date...
- Yeah.

714
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,849
... with Laith and Arin

715
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:33,608
kind of showed me that I have
to broaden my horizons, too.

716
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,391
- I think we both need to.
- Yeah.

717
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:38,565
A double experiment.

718
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:40,288
That's why we call 'em experiments.

719
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:43,623
- Salsa!
- Salsa!

720
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,807
So are you going to the thing tonight?

721
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:52,763
Of course.

722
00:35:52,972 --> 00:35:56,477
We're gonna go see Candis
and Chandi perform...

723
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,356
- at a drag show!
- Are we?

724
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm feeling pulled in a lot
of different directions here.

725
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:05,223
You know, I had this kind of...

726
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:07,379
ambivalent relationship toward drag.

727
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:10,464
And I think a lot of people who come
from a different part of the community

728
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:15,000
have this unease with some aspects
of drag because there's a sense of,

729
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,407
"Here we are, pretending to be women."

730
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,850
And I know that that's not the
best way to describe drag, but

731
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:25,342
it's one way to describe
drag, and, you know, so...

732
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,655
I'm not pretending to be anything.

733
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,396
The trans community is
so diverse, you know?

734
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:35,477
And each one of us has
such a different story.

735
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,929
I want to celebrate
everybody's way of being,

736
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:40,478
but I also want to fight
for my own identity,

737
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:41,685
which was hard won.

738
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:44,984
- And, um...
- Until it...

739
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,678
isolates you from the
people that you love.

740
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:51,714
Jenny's not wrong here,
but neither is Chandi.

741
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,643
The trans community as a
whole is split on this issue.

742
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,142
So it's a complicated
thing, but bottom line,

743
00:36:58,144 --> 00:37:00,135
friends need to be there
to support each other.

744
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:03,542
I think the higher road
to take is to, you know,

745
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:05,966
go and experience it.

746
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:08,951
I'm being asked to do something here

747
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:11,159
that I probably wouldn't normally do

748
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:14,977
and I still don't think that many of
my sisters understand my resistance.

749
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:17,238
And we're not all gonna
agree on everything,

750
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,493
but I know they have good hearts.

751
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,377
You know, embracing difference is...

752
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:25,672
that's your challenge here, today.

753
00:37:42,497 --> 00:37:43,797
Hey, girl! It's good to see you.

754
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:45,556
It's good to see you, too. Oh!

755
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:46,972
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, I'm Regine.

756
00:37:46,994 --> 00:37:49,187
- How are you?
- Hi, Regine, I'm Chandi.

757
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:51,495
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, no! No, no!

758
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,374
Okay, everybody follow me.

759
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:56,277
I've come to understand that, for Chandi,

760
00:37:56,299 --> 00:37:58,113
the drag world saved her life, literally.

761
00:37:58,148 --> 00:38:01,113
So how can anyone stand in the way of that

762
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:04,113
and not celebrate that? Yeah,
don't... don't flash them, Jenner.

763
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,886
Hey... we don't want to... there we go.

764
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,828
Don't flash 'em, Jenner.

765
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:09,481
After all the controversy, for Jenny,

766
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:11,586
it was great that she
went to the drag show.

767
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,692
So I think it's going to be a fun night.

768
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,907
Thank you.

769
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,113
Oh.

770
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:21,403
I am totally nervous.

771
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:25,069
_

772
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:26,957
_

773
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,363
_

774
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,909
It has been so long
since I have performed.

775
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:37,481
So I am a little nervous,

776
00:38:37,485 --> 00:38:39,807
but I've received nothing but love

777
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:41,360
from Candis and Mimi.

778
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,209
And that does help calm anyone's nerves.

779
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:45,406
Hopefully.

780
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,540
- All right, I'll see you in a minute.
- Have fun.

781
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,464
I'll say good-bye to Chandi

782
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:53,894
and come back and say
hello to Miss Chandelier.

783
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:55,609
Oh, right!

784
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,642

816
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:55,370
taking risks all over the place.

817
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,617
Jenny Boylan, who
didn't even want to go...

818
00:40:57,737 --> 00:41:01,913
there she was, stuffing
dollar bills down Chandi's bra.

819
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:04,663
So I think she had a lot of fun.

824
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:19,361

that I hadn't experienced
in a very long time.

826
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,621
I really let go.

827
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:29,158

moment with myself,

828
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,257

you're an insult to all trans people.

You know, nobody in the trans movement
