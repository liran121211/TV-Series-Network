163
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:49,798
- Hi.
- CANDIS: Hi, how are you?

164
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:52,070
- CAITLYN: Oh, my God, look at it.
- CANDIS: I know, it's amazing.

165
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:55,367
ELLA: I need to find the
right one for you, Candis.

166
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,010
CAITLYN: You're actually
trying something on?

167
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,686
CANDIS: I'm gonna do it, why not?

168
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,948
- CAITLYN: God...
- CANDIS: I've never tried on wedding dresses.

169
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,997
- CAITLYN: Either have I!
- CANDIS: (laughs)

170
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,779
ELLA: What do you see yourself,

171
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,479
- like, rocking?
- CAITLYN: A wedding dress?

172
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:08,094
CHANDI: What type of bride
do you think you'd be?

173
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:10,806
- CAITLYN: I... I have, I haven't gone that far.
- ELLA: Well, we're gonna go there.

174
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,648
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- ELLA: We're going there today.

175
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,336
ELLA: I think epic would be

176
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:18,932
an understatement of
a bunch of trans women

177
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,046
in wedding gowns. Which one
would look great in Hawaii?

178
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,470
(chuckles) 'Cause I think
that's where the wedding is.

179
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:27,268
Let go of the fact that we're trans

180
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,677
and just kind of realize that
we're all just having fun.

181
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:32,076
CANDIS: All right, here we go.

182
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:34,741
CAITLYN: Challenge is
on. Who wore it best?

183
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,559
KATE: I would wear a rhinestone tuxedo.

184
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,591
- CHANDI: Ooh!
- KATE: With a top hat.

185
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:43,581
CHANDI: I would probably never
go inside a wedding dress store

186
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:46,499
and ever try on a wedding
dress, so this is like,

187
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:49,369
- a great moment.
- ELLA: Should I come and help?

188
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:52,519
- Oh, my gosh!
- CANDIS: I'm ready.

189
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,453
- CHANDI: Oh...
- KATE: Oh...

190
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,337
CHANDI: I love it.

191
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:57,949
- Yes!
- KATE: Oh!

192
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,172
What a glimpse of an angel!

193
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,127
CANDIS: This is crazy!

194
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:06,732
For me, trying on this wedding dress,

195
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,835
I kind of am seeing it as a
little bit of an affirmation

196
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:13,986
of what I could possibly
want have happen to me.

197
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:16,183
For almost all of existence,

198
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:17,661
that wasn't even uh, uh,

199
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:21,007
- an option for trans women.
- ELLA: Honey, come out!

200
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:23,979
ALL: Oh!

201
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,830
CAITLYN: How do they do the walk?

202
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:28,773
CANDIS: (chuckles) No.

203
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,850
- Just natural.
- CAITLYN: Want to know something...

204
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,498
Oh! Jesus Christ!

205
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:34,476
- (Candis laughs)
- Oh, my God!

206
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,044
What do you think?

207
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,702
ELLA: That is flippin' stunning, yeah.

208
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,308
- I think it looks great.
- CAITLYN: I think we need to pose.

209
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:41,235
CHANDI: Yes.

210
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:42,924
CAITLYN: Yeah, here we
go. Oh, thank you, Chandi.

211
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,146
- You can be my bridesmaid any day.
- CHANDI: Okay, babe.

212
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,393
CAITLYN: Did I ever think
this day would come? No.

213
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:49,014
I've been at three weddings,

214
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:53,736
okay, with the most boring
clothes on in life, okay?

215
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,094
Uh, finally I get to wear something...

216
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,164
- comfortable.
- KATE: Candis... Caitlyn...

217
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:01,864
I now pronounce you

218
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:05,143
trans-bride and trans-bride.

219
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,006
CAITLYN: Yay!

220
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:08,792
ELLA: Kiss her!

221
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,365
(Caitlyn laughs)

222
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,574
ELLA: Oh, here we go.

223
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:17,539
- CAITLYN: T-shirts.
- CANDIS: Oh, T-shirts?

224
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,067
CHANDI: T-shirts.

225
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:21,277
WOMAN: _

226
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,449
CAITLYN: How about an alligator head?

227
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,279
Like, we could put this on the hood...

228
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,208
- (Ella laughs)
- ... of a car or something.

229
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:27,188
- ELLA: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

230
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:29,594
ELLA: Cait, do we need Mardi Gras masks?

231
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:31,358
CAITLYN: Actually, that's not a bad idea.

232
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,109
CANDIS: Ooh, I like the teal one.

233
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,669
WOMAN: _

234
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,850
CANDIS: Wow, there's a
whole crowd of people.

235
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:42,474
(laughs) We're completely circled.

236
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:45,267
- ELLA: Yeah, I know, this isn't...
- WOMAN: _

237
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,836
_

238
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:50,924
- WOMAN: _
- CAITLYN: Hello, how are you?

239
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:53,546
- MAN: _
- CAITLYN: Thank you.

240
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,726
ELLA: That was insane.

241
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,768
Being on the bus with Caitlyn,

242
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,242
I forgot what it's like to
see her from the outside.

243
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:05,086
And every single time we were
in public, just the reaction

244
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,684
that she got from anyone
who came in her path...

245
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:11,218
that reaction shocked me, every time.

246
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,142
Because it kind of brought me back to

247
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:17,263
what she really has
done, you know, for us.

248
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,510
- CHANDI: What's your name?
- KAITLYN: Kaitlyn.

249
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,963
- I know!
- CHANDI: Kaitlyn?

250
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,806
(laughs)

251
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,338
- How are you, Kaitlyn?
- KAITLYN: I'm good,

252
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:25,394
- I just want to meet...
- CHANDI: Great to meet you.

253
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:26,789
KAITLYN: I see Candis.
I've been trying to wave.

254
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,947
CHANDI: You've been trying to wave at...

255
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,875
Candis? Kaitlyn wants to say hi.

256
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:32,381
- CANDIS: Hi, girl.
- KAITLYN: This is my sister.

257
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:34,769
- CANDIS: Nice to meet you.
- CHANDI: Hi, sweetie. Mwah!

258
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,524
- PAM: Party time!
- CANDIS: Oh, my God!

259
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:41,038
CAITLYN: Oh, no! Sister Pam is here!

260
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,694
- Oh, God...
- PAM: Look at all these.

261
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,110
CAITLYN: Oh, you got the beads going...

262
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,222
What is this? Is this the Welcome Wagon?

263
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,866
- You don't even say hi?
- PAM: Hi.

264
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,760
CAITLYN: My sister Pam is here and

265
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:54,432
I'm excited about her spending some
quality time with all the girls,

266
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,151
so, uh, it'll be fun.

267
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:57,417
- Ready?
- CHANDI: Yes, let's go.

268
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,679
- PAM: Cait, what car do you want?
- CAITLYN: We're going back in the van.

269
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,391
CANDIS: Note to self, leave
Caitlyn at home. (Laughter)

270
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,352
And we can go shopping.

271
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:07,966
(bells jingling)

272
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:14,426
PAM: Cafe Du Monde. This is a classic.

273
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,461
- (Candis gasps)
- CANDIS: Look at the size of those!

274
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:21,321
- I might need a doggy bag.
- PAM: I know.

275
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:25,019
- CAITLYN: Don't inhale when you take a bite of that.
- PAM: Oh, yeah, I know.

276
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,377
- The powdered sugar.
- CANDIS: You have a, like, a full sugar high.

277
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:29,836
- CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.
- CANDIS: Literally.

278
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:32,676
My parents have been married for 54 years.

279
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:36,145
And I always thought of that as the goal,

280
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:38,284
but then I realized, later, no...

281
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:42,193
that can't be the goal. It has
to be meeting the right person

282
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:44,392
in order to ever have that goal fulfilled.

283
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:47,706
Are there any negatives
about being married?

284
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,232
PAM: I think, many times, when you have

285
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,378
had a failed marriage, you learn so much

286
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,283
and you're a lot more tolerant

287
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:59,380
the next time. You learn
from those mistakes.

288
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:01,513
You give each other
a little wider berth...

289
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,463
- CAITLYN: Yeah.
- PAM: ... to be your own person.

290
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:07,217
CAITLYN: A very important aspect
of a long-term relationship

291
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:10,585
is you have to let the
other person live their life.

292
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,496
Now, you can enjoy everything together,

293
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,489
- a lot of things...
- CANDIS: Right.

294
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:17,118
CAITLYN: ... but like Pam just said,

295
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:20,264
we both have things we like
to do and we go do them.

296
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:21,698
CANDIS: I thought it
was really interesting,

297
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,469
hearing Cait talk about the relationships.

298
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,458
But I haven't stayed
friends with any of my exes,

299
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:30,684
so I don't know how it's
going to be with Kris.

300
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:32,510
It's just an awkward situation.

301
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,867
- CANDIS: These were really good.
- CAITLYN: You need a sugar daddy.

302
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,371
- (Candis laughs)
- Are you gonna eat this or not?

303
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,204
- PAM: You can be that.
- CANDIS: I'm not.

304
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,745
- CAITLYN: Oh, my God.
- PAM: Sugar momma.

305
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,451
CANDIS: They were really good.

306
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:44,586
CAITLYN: My ex-lover is coming into town.

307
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:47,715
JENNY: What has to happen
to improve your relationship?

308
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:50,139
- CAITLYN: I... I don't know.
- (knock at door)

309
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,028
(cheering)

310
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,534
KRIS: _

311
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,965
_

312
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,543
_

313
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:05,929
(bell rings)

314
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:08,821
JENNY: God, you've trashed the place.

315
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,231
CAITLYN: I'm trying to figure
out what the hell do I wear?

316
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:14,551
Put it this way, Jenny: my
ex-lover is coming into town.

317
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,175
JENNY: Wait, is this, is this the,
uh, this is your confessional cam?

318
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:19,301
How... how do you turn this
on? You know how to, turn it on?

319
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:20,553
- CAITLYN: Want me to show you how to do this?
- JENNY: Yeah, okay,

320
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,023
'cause we're gonna do,
we're gonna do a thing.

321
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:23,320
CAITLYN: Oh, we're gonna
do a thing, together?

322
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:24,977
- Oh, my God.
- JENNY: We're gonna do a confessional, a confessional.

323
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,109
CAITLYN: All right. There's a lot of work.

324
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:27,589
- Sit down, right here.
- JENNY: All right, all right.

325
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,480
CAITLYN: You got to get it...

326
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,311
'cause you got to get the lighting
good, 'cause there's no lighting.

327
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,099
JENNY: Yeah. Yes, I know.

328
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,378
I know how important it is for you.

329
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,828
CAITLYN: As Kim says, it's
all about the lighting.

330
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:36,887
- Ah, the red dot's on.
- JENNY: Okay.

331
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,116
- CAITLYN: It's working.
- JENNY: All right, so...

332
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,689
CAITLYN: This is the first time
I've ever done it with anybody.

333
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,705
- JENNY: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Hold on. Hold on.

334
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,188
JENNY: We're here with Caitlyn Jenner.

335
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:44,599
So, Caitlyn: how are
you feeling about your

336
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:48,195
ex-wife meeting your
new lover, Candis Cayne?

337
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:50,860
CAITLYN: Oh, what... ? Candis
is not... she's my friend.

338
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,641
JENNY (reporter voice): So I just
want to know how it feels to have your

339
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,359
ex-wife meet you new lover?

340
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,423
(Caitlyn laughing)

341
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,525
CAITLYN: This is going downhill
right from the beginning.

342
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,009
- JENNY: I'm trying my best.
- CAITLYN: Uh...

343
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:03,767
I don't know. I'll find out. Um...

344
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:07,028
no, uh... actually, I'm looking
forward to, uh, Kris coming.

345
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,984
JENNY: And when was the last time
you... you, like, really talked?

346
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,608
- CAITLYN: Oh, we really talked?
- JENNY: Yeah.

347
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:14,194
CAITLYN: I don't... How did that go?

348
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:16,502
KRIS: I was struggling and
having a really hard time...

349
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:17,487
CAITLYN: With what?

350
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,013
KRIS: Your transition.

351
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:22,602
And this, like, leaving us in the dust.

352
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,839
- CAITLYN: Nobody's leaving you guys in the dust.
- KRIS: You left us...

353
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:26,069
you left us in the dust.

354
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:28,069
- CAITLYN: What... who... ?
- KRIS: Basically, I'm just saying

355
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,892
- I went through a hard time.
- CAITLYN: Nobody's leaving anybody...

356
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:30,889
I'm not going anywhere.

357
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,064
KRIS: You know, it was
like, what happened to...

358
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,873
just... the life we had together?

359
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,993
It's like you don't,
you just threw that away.

360
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:38,597
CAITLYN: I thought it went pretty good.

361
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:40,828
But then, after it was
over with, I kind of...

362
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,685
uh, I... I kind of struggled with it a lot.

363
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:47,029
'Cause, you know, there's
a lot of emotions there.

364
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,814
- JENNY: Well, yeah.
- CAITLYN: There's 23 years of life together.

365
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,072
Mmm... that's tough stuff.

366
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:54,140
- Yeah.
- JENNY: Do you... do you feel a little on the, on the

367
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,533
defensive or self-conscious
with her at all?

368
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:59,527
CAITLYN: I always felt
on the defensive with her.

369
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,358
- JENNY: Okay, then, different question.
- CAITLYN: Um...

370
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,955
There's just another
element here that I don't

371
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:05,903
quite understand what she...

372
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,792
Hopefully, have some time
to talk to her about it.

373
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:11,508
I... I feel sometimes,
now, she gets more upset

374
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,201
than she was when we were together.

375
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:16,591
You know? Um... uh...

376
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:19,411
And I don't understand why.

377
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,165
Because she was... I was very
honest with her and open with her.

378
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,059
- Now, sure...
- JENNY: Upset about trans stuff?

379
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:27,287
- CAITLYN: About... yeah, about gender issues.
- JENNY: If I was your ex-wife and I loved you,

380
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,828
it would hurt my feelings.

381
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,273
What has to happen

382
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,226
in order to improve your relationship?

383
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,603
CAITLYN: I... I don't know.

384
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:41,928
JENNY: You know, most couples
who get divorced, they're...

385
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,607
they're kind of done with each other. So

386
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:48,544
I'm more than a little worried
about what's going to happen.

387
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:50,593
(Caitlyn sighs)

388
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,408
♪ ♪

389
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,863
KRIS: Okay. (Exhales)

390
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:03,379
I'm here in New Orleans because
Cait has been a little MIA

391
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:08,307
and I've heard all about
these shenanigans going on,

392
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:10,243
so I decided to come out.

393
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:13,285
I'm looking forward to seeing
what the excitement is all about.

394
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:16,564
COURTNEY: Are you excited
for Kris to arrive?

395
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:18,847
CAITLYN: Um, yeah. As a matter of fact,

396
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,477
she just texted me.

397
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,324
She is...

398
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,755
one floor below.

399
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,874
(giggles) I think I should
probably go down and just say hi.

400
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:31,684
- COURTNEY: Of course you should.
- CAITLYN: Yeah,

401
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,118
break the ice.

402
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,099
KRIS: I forgot how pretty New Orleans was.

KRIS: Oh, boy.

406
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:51,345
CAITLYN: A little
nervous, a little nervous.

407
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,950
JENNY: Hang on, so, hi. Welcome
once again to another episode of...

<i>I Am Jenny,</i> the new spin-off show.

409
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:07,163
KRIS: When you talk to
somebody about your view,

410
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,973
you could get a little cranky.

411
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,312
No one wants to sit around
and listen to this (bleep).

412
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:14,619
So shut the (bleep) up and relax.

413
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:23,169
CAITLYN: A little
nervous, a little nervous.

414
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:29,686
KRIS: Uh... Coming.

415
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,853
Hello!

Welcome to the view of the

- CAITLYN: You got candles? Wait a second.

418
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,406
- KRIS: Yeah, it's...
- CAITLYN: Well, hi there. Say hi.

419
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,112
- KRIS: Hi, how are you?
- CAITLYN: You went basic brown...

420
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:43,561
- I like that.
- KRIS: Are you getting taller?

421
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,301
Oh, it must be the heels.

422
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:48,114
- CAITLYN: Well, they're not big heels, yeah.
- KRIS: Where are all your girlfriends?

423
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:49,697
CAITLYN: We're gonna
meet everybody tonight.

424
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,769
KRIS: Oh, okay, for dinner or something?

425
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,796
CAITLYN: Uh, yeah, we're gonna
go to dinner and then, uh...

426
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,893
KRIS: What does that
mean? What are you... ?

427
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:58,669
- What is this?
- CAITLYN: Party time!

428
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:01,319
- KRIS: Oh, my God, do I need a nap?
- CAITLYN: Um...

429
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:05,129
- KRIS: For a person who never stayed up past 9:00?
- CAITLYN: I know, no.

430
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:08,011
- I... I've been doing... I know, I know, I know.
- KRIS: And now you're, now it's party time?

431
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,745
CAITLYN: We have been on the road
for like about a month right now,

432
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:11,514
- I...
- KRIS: Wow.

433
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,519
CAITLYN: Yeah, it's been a long trip.

434
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:15,936
- But I'm very glad you're here.
- KRIS: We were all wondering

435
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,278
why you were MIA, and we hadn't
heard from you in a bit, so...

436
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:22,369
- CAITLYN: Well, I've been on the road.
- KRIS: Somebody's got to come figure this out.

437
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:23,527
CAITLYN: Please do.

438
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,928
- KRIS: I'm gonna, um, put some things away.
- CAITLYN: Okay.

439
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,631
KRIS: And maybe take a catnap.

440
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:29,302
CAITLYN: Okay, we'll just have
a quick little glass of wine,

441
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,814
and then, uh, we'll go to dinner
and you'll meet all the girls...

442
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,022
- it'll be fun.
- KRIS: Okay, oh, I can't wait!

443
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:34,755
What are you gonna wear, Jenner?

444
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,498
CAITLYN: I've got something for you.

445
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,263
KRIS: Oh, boy. I can't wait.

446
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,051
- CAITLYN: All right. I'll see you in a bit.
- KRIS: All right.

447
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,210

- KRIS: Bye.

448
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,243
(chuckles, groans)

449
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:44,714
(knocking) JENNY: Hello?

450
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:45,978
ELLA: Jenny?

451
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:48,396
JENNY: It's time for Jenny
Boylan cam... in you go.

452
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:51,202
ELLA: Oh, oh.

453
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:52,940
JENNY: Come a little closer, you ready?

454
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,165
Hang on, so,

455
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,849
hi. Welcome to once again
to another episode of...

456
00:19:57,423 --> 00:20:00,280
<i>I Am Jenny,</i> the new spin-off show.

457
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,185
We're here with our,
with today's next guest.

458
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:04,740
- ELLA: Hello.
- JENNY: Uh, Ms. Ella Giselle.

459
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:06,116
- ELLA: Hi.
- JENNY: So, Ella,

460
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:08,471
uh, what would you like to say to
your, to your new, to your people?

461
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,543
- ELLA: Thank you for supporting me.
- (Jenny snores)

462
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:12,855
JENNY: Oh, I'm sorry. I just
dozed off there for a second.

463
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:15,456
- What do we not know about you?
- ELLA: I survive

464
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,238
off of one drink.

465
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,983
- Chocolate milk.
- JENNY: Chocolate milk.

466
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,579
What do you, how do you feel if you
can't get chocolate milk? What happens?

467
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:23,888
ELLA: Um, angry.

468
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:26,421
JENNY: What's the most amount of
chocolate milk you've had in a single day?

469
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,778
- ELLA: Six... probably more.
- JENNY: Six glasses and...

470
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:31,467
- what were you like then?
- ELLA: Uh...

471
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:33,867
- Not feeling very well.
- JENNY: Well, you know what?

472
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,621
The first step in solving the problem

473
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,064
is admitting that it is a problem.

474
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:39,531
- ELLA: Is it a problem though?
- JENNY: Well...

475
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,394
That's about all the
time we have for today on

476
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,332
- <i>I Am Ella.</i>
- ELLA: I am Ella.

477
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:47,412
- I like this. Do I get, like, a deal?
- (Jenny laughs)

478
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:49,761
(knocking)

479
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,343
- KRIS: You look nice.
- CAITLYN: Oh, thank you. I went brown.

480
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:54,903
KRIS: Yeah, well, you certainly
did. It looks good with your hair.

481
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,312
- CAITLYN: I know.
- KRIS: Yeah.

482
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,673
- CAITLYN: What is that?
- KRIS: It's a cape.

483
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:02,471
- CAITLYN: Cool.
- PRODUCER: _

484
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:03,802
_

485
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,395
_

486
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,514
KRIS: Pull our tops up?

487
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,341
Well, you can pull your top up.

488
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,711
- Mine's staying right where it is.
- CAITLYN: No, that's okay.

489
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:11,469
- Well, no, yours is staying where your... ?
- KRIS: Your boobs are a little

490
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:13,129
- fresher than mine.
- CAITLYN: Mine are staying in the exactly same place, too.

491
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:14,883
- KRIS: You just got a boob job.
- CAITLYN: Yeah, maybe throw some,

492
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:17,479
maybe throw some beads,
beads out or something,

493
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,318
- but that's as far as we go.
- KRIS: No, your boobs are perky

494
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:20,721
- and mine aren't, yeah.
- CAITLYN: Well, they are, yeah, okay.

495
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:22,191
KRIS: So let's start there.

496
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:24,029
CAITLYN: I got his number.
KRIS: All right, yeah, well,

497
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,819
- anyway.
- (indistinct chatter)

498
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,258
- CAITLYN: Oh, girls?
- KRIS: Hi, I'm Kris.

499
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,440
- How are you?
- CAITLYN: Candis.

500
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:35,736
- BOTH: Nice to see you.
- KRIS: Boy, all this glam...

501
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:36,750
I love it!

502
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:40,132
I never thought an evening
in New Orleans would

503
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,757
turn out to be me and a group
of transgender women, but

504
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,517
you know what, why not?

505
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,823
- This is so exciting.
- CAITLYN: These are everybody

506
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:49,398
that's been on the bus. Jenny?

507
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:51,703
JENNY: Jenny, I live with my wife Deirdre.

508
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:54,149
We have been married for 27 years...

509
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:57,172
12 as husband and wife,
and 15 as wife and wife.

510
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:59,767
KRIS: Oh, wow, she's a really good sport.

511
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,426
- I like that. (Laughs) That's amazing.
- CAITLYN: She's a saint...

512
00:22:03,464 --> 00:22:05,575
KRIS: She's a lot better than I am.

513
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:06,856
No, I'm kidding.

514
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:11,028
- KATE: I thought I saw it all until I met Caitlyn.
- (laughter)

515
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,010
My eyes have been opened.

516
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,600
CAITLYN: When you have an,
like an eight-hour bus ride,

517
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:17,755
the conversation gets very
interesting, doesn't it?

518
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:21,325
KRIS: So, if you spend
that much time with Caitlyn,

519
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,638
and you guys are in a closed quarters...

520
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:29,578
what is the most annoying
thing about Caitlyn

521
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:32,708
- that you could possibly... ?
- CAITLYN: That I'm a Republican... okay, let's get over it.

522
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,537
KRIS: Yeah, politics, right?
Oh, I could relate to that.

523
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:38,483
KATE: For me, it's not
that you are a Republican.

524
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:40,254
It's how

525
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:44,365
I experience you expressing
your Republican views.

526
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:45,535
JENNY: Exactly.

527
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,472
KRIS: Oh, hallelujah.

528
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:50,039
- JENNY: We went to the Democratic debates in Iowa.
- KRIS: Oh, boy.

529
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,217
CAITLYN: I went and I got a
picture with Hillary Clinton.

530
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:53,937
- KRIS: That's awesome.
- CAITLYN: I know.

531
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:55,285
KRIS: How did that feel?

532
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:57,719
CAITLYN: Um, how did it feel?

533
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,334
Uh, it was good. She was very nice.

534
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:00,737
She's a politician.

535
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,555
KRIS: Yeah, I know, but
you're not a politician,

536
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:06,145
but you think you're a
politician sometimes, I think.

537
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:10,266
- CAITLYN: That, I... I... I... I enjoy politics.
- JENNY: I am just gonna sit back.

538
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:12,092
- CAITLYN: I... I enjoy politics.
- KRIS: Yeah, you do,

539
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:15,406
but sometimes, sometimes when you talk

540
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:17,260
to somebody about your view,

541
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:20,774
not everybody's gonna always agree.

542
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:22,801
And sometimes,

543
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:24,689
you could get a little cranky.

544
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:27,797
- CAITLYN: Oh, I agree, I agree.
- KRIS: But because you're so, um...

545
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:30,504
- CAITLYN: I, I get it.
- KRIS: ... crazy about this one thing...

546
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,414
you are really crazy about this one thing,

547
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:34,753
and no one wants to sit around
and listen to this (bleep)

548
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:37,498
so shut the (bleep) up and relax!

549
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:40,718
(laughter)

550
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,074
I can't wait to see you guys again.

551
00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:45,513
Not you, Jenner, just your friends.

552
00:23:45,753 --> 00:23:47,596
Don't get excited!

553
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:49,445
(all cheering)

554
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,690
- JENNY: Did she tell you early on?
- KRIS: No.

555
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:55,173
- CAITLYN: Oh, I did, too.
- KRIS: There was no "I am transgender."

556
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:58,365
CAITLYN: I certainly told
her what was going on.

557
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,604
KRIS: I just have to share one story

558
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,335
that when it got really crazy...

559
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:04,412
when I met Bruce,

560
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,158
there was no politics ever.

561
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:09,363
And then it just got a little bit more...

562
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:10,917
CAITLYN: They're learning
way too much about me.

563
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:12,259
KRIS: ... and a little bit
more and a little bit more,

564
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:15,785
and over the years, someone got very upset

565
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,344
some certain person was

566
00:24:17,895 --> 00:24:20,173
- president of the United States.
- CHANDI: Uh-huh?

567
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:23,442
KRIS: And would wake me up
at like 5:00 in the morning

568
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,865
so upset and realizing

569
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:28,617
that I was maybe on somebody else's side.

570
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:32,427
And, but I really, I'm kind of neutral.

571
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,409
- I just go with what I... I...
- CAITLYN: You're giving away all of my secrets.

572
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:35,746
- KRIS: I'm sorry.
- CANDIS: I love it!

573
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:36,910
CHANDI: A lot of people

574
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:38,892
are having a hard time

575
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:42,452
trying to figure out how
Caitlyn can be a Republican

576
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:46,106
when, in most cases, Republicans
really don't support our community.

577
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:48,901
- KRIS: Yeah.
- CHANDI: But we've had to listen

578
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,663
to the things that Cait has had to say.

579
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,735
There's work in both areas that
need to be, that need to be done.

580
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:54,821
CAITLYN: It's an educational experience.

581
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:57,594
KRIS: But you're unwilling,
I think at times...

582
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:00,196
- CHANDI: Yes! (Laughs)
- KRIS: ... to listen to somebody else's view

583
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,312
- and meet in the middle.
- CAITLYN: No, I... don't,

584
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:04,389
don't don't everybody
start agreeing with her!

585
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:06,550
KATE: Well, part of the issue

586
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:10,461
has been that we outnumber
Caitlyn on the bus,

587
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,267
and we just don't want to

588
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:17,588
end up bullying her or
putting her on the defensive.

589
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,892
KRIS: Take it from me,

590
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,719
who was one person

591
00:25:20,914 --> 00:25:22,679
- with one person.
- CAITLYN: 23 years.

592
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:24,929
KRIS: You need that many people

593
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,555
against that with this subject matter.

594
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,178
Trust me, you guys are gonna be just fine,

595
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:33,500
- but you need...
- CAITLYN: I think we need, need to go to dinner.

596
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:35,622
Is it time to go to dinner?

597
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:38,484
KATE: God bless America,
let's go to dinner!

598
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,162
CAITLYN: I have to
admit it is kind of hard

599
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:41,927
to listen to all these people in the room

600
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,105
come up with their notes on me...

601
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,511
their likes and dislikes, okay?

602
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:50,554
I got my ex-wife and my friends
all comparing notes. Not easy.

603
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:53,756
I don't think I'm gonna come
out of this, you know, very good.

604
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,788
CANDIS: That's really
nice of you to come and,

605
00:25:57,844 --> 00:26:00,757
- like, meet all of us.
- KRIS: I wanted to see what was going on out here.

606
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:03,379
He was a little... <i>
she</i> was a little MIA.

607
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:04,348
- CAITLYN: Who?
- KRIS: You.

608
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:06,353
CAITLYN: Where did you get those earrings?

609
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,197
I don't remember them in the old days,

610
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:10,163
when I used to steal your earrings.

611
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:12,969
- (Candis laughs)
- KRIS: These are Cartier,

612
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,763
and you would have been in big trouble.

613
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,356
- CAITLYN: Oh, okay.
- (Laughter)

614
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,074
What else is new? I was in big
trouble all the time anyway.

615
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,422
KRIS: You know what we found?

616
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:23,256
You stole the key to my
closet and you hid it.

617
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:24,535
CAITLYN: I thought I hid it so well.

618
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:26,206
KRIS: Yeah, we... I found it.

619
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:28,695
- CAITLYN: Really?
- KRIS: Yeah, that was very tricky, Jenner.

620
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,589
- CAITLYN: I know, it was good.
- KRIS: Yeah.

621
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,426
- (Candis laughs)
- CAITLYN: It was good.

622
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:35,980
I had to steal yours, go
get it made and then...

623
00:26:35,986 --> 00:26:37,963
KRIS (laughing): You had one made?

624
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,773
- CAITLYN: Had one made, yeah.
- CANDIS: Oh!

625
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,872
It's nice that you guys are laughing

626
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:45,860
and are together as friends.
It's a really good thing.

627
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:47,352
KRIS: I'm going to kill him after dinner.

628
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:48,210
- (Candis laughs)
- CAITLYN: Right.

629
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:49,263
You'll kil l<i>her.</i>

630
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:50,950
- KRIS: Kill her after dinner, sorry.
- CHANDI: Right.

631
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:52,343
KRIS: Got to keep correcting me.

632
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:57,104
CAITLYN: I certainly
said I had gender issues.

633
00:26:57,143 --> 00:26:58,936
KRIS: I didn't know. Until all of this,

634
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:01,264
I couldn't have given you the
definition of "transgender."

635
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,071
- CAITLYN: Let me finish.
- KRIS: Okay, you're being stubborn; that's fine.

636
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,924
- (indistinct conversations)
- KRIS: I'm gonna have that.

637
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,152
CANDIS: You have a black napkin? (Laughs)

638
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,558
JENNY: What napkin goes
bestwith your clothes?

639
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,686
- CANDIS: Yes, of course.
- JENNY: Candis Cayne...

640
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:18,674
- (Kris laughs)
- Although I've got this

641
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:21,141
- unsightly white napkin.
- (Candis laughs)

642
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:24,327
- May I have a black napkin also, please?
- WAITER: How many more black napkins?

643
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:26,165
- JENNY: I think it's just the two of us.
- (laughter)

644
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:28,588
CAITLYN: That's amazing, that
you've gotten to the point

645
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,097
where you want a matching
napkin to your outfit.

646
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,116
CAITLYN: We have so gotten
you out of the woods of Maine.

647
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:37,117
JENNY: So Caitlyn's been
out for six months now...

648
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,021
- KRIS: Mm-hmm.
- Six months?

649
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:39,599
JENNY: Where are you now as opposed to

650
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:40,940
where you were six months ago?

651
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,859
KRIS: Probably more tolerant

652
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,673
and I have more acceptance and probably
understand it a little bit more.

653
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,983
JENNY: But did it...
did you take it per...

654
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:51,169
I mean, I know, speaking from
personal experience, my wife...

655
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:53,005
my wife, I think, in some ways took it

656
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:56,001
- personally when I first came out.
- KRIS: I definitely took it personally.

657
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,367
JENNY: I think she felt
like, "Wait, I wasn't enough?"

658
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:04,087
KRIS: No, I feel like
she was very unhappy.

659
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,386
Very, very unhappy for a very long time.

660
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:08,130
CAITLYN: I was surviving, but I was...

661
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:10,397
- KRIS: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: ... dealing with a lot of things.

662
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:12,524
- KRIS: Forever.
- JENNY: So when you look at her,

663
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:14,380
do you see Caitlyn?

664
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,379
Or do you see the person that she was?

665
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,667
KRIS: I see great eyebrows...

666
00:28:20,706 --> 00:28:22,973
- (laughter)
- ... and high cheekbones.

667
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,745
No, I see the present.

668
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:28,008
I can't see Bruce in this, right now.

669
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:31,873
But I have memories of that.

670
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:34,012
- CAITLYN: It's a million miles away.
- KRIS: Yeah.

671
00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:35,760
So I don't see that anymore.

672
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,361
You just get used to it,
it's weird, you just see...

673
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:39,815
- JENNY: The new normal.
- KRIS: Yeah.

674
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,176
How old were you when you realized that

675
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:45,735
- you were transgender?
- JENNY: I knew I was trans from a very early age.

676
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,466
Four, five, six.

677
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:48,981
It's one of my earliest memories.

678
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:51,142
And I tried everything I could

679
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:52,801
to make the boy thing work.

680
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:54,467
You come out when
you're ready to come out.

681
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,705
KRIS: So, wait, so I have a question,

682
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,715
but with no disrespect.

683
00:28:58,777 --> 00:29:00,726
So I just really want to know this.

684
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:03,973
- CHANDI: How else will you know if you don't ask?
- KRIS: No, but... so

685
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,919
if you're trans... a transgender woman...

686
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,029
what do you do with the bits and pieces

687
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,465
that are below the belt?

688
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,292
CAITLYN: Oh, my God!

689
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:17,568
KRIS: People wonder, when
they look at somebody.

690
00:29:17,608 --> 00:29:21,512
I seriously want to
know. I mean, you know,

691
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,737
- Caitlyn...
- CAITLYN: I know.

692
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:24,708
KRIS: ... but they are
asking the question like that.

693
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:29,738
Am I getting way too crazy?

694
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,020
JENNY: If you knew ten years
ago what you know now...

695
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:38,682
do you think you would still be married?

696
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:44,112
CAITLYN: There's one more
thing I really need to do

697
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:47,236
before she leaves: have a
one-on-one conversation with her.

698
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,926
Because I... I feel like
I have a lot to say to her.

699
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,978
- (knocking gently)
- KRIS: Coming.

700
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:56,203
KRIS: People wonder,
when they look at somebody

701
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:59,104
and they say, okay, well,
what happens to, like...

702
00:29:59,154 --> 00:30:02,929
I seriously want to
know. I mean, you know,

703
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:04,010
- Caitlyn...
- CAITLYN: I know.

704
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:05,926
KRIS: ... but they are
asking the question like that.

705
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:07,669
Am I getting way too crazy?

706
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:09,585
- (talking over each other)
- KRIS: I mean, I'm sorry.

707
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:10,713
I just wondered, like, what...

708
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:12,584
Does everybody do the same thing?

709
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,295
- KATE: Okay.
- CAITLYN: You're sitting next to Kate.

710
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:15,738
- There you go. Listen to Kate.
- KRIS: Okay.

711
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:18,180
- All right.
- KATE: It used to be understood

712
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:21,558
that if you have a penis, you're a man.

713
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:25,451
If you have a vulva and
vagina, you're a woman.

714
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:28,712
Genitals really have very little to do

715
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:30,753
- with who you think you are.
- KRIS: Inside.

716
00:30:30,771 --> 00:30:31,889
- KATE: Yeah.
- KRIS: Okay.

717
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,453
- KATE: So...
- KRIS: That makes sense.

718
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:37,436
KATE: ... it really doesn't matter
what a person has down there.

719
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:38,773
You're still interested.

720
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,016
KRIS: It does to me.

721
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,029
- No, I'm kidding.
- KATE: It does to you, and because you're so close...

722
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:43,598
KRIS: No, no, I mean, no,
but it's the, it's the...

723
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:46,374
I think the knee-jerk curiosity of...

724
00:30:46,374 --> 00:30:48,530
- CHANDI: Well, can I tell you something first?
- KRIS: Yes.

725
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:51,056
CHANDI: All trans people
don't choose to do that.

726
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:53,707
- KATE: Exactly.
- CHANDI: And that's the important thing for...

727
00:30:53,783 --> 00:30:56,332
for us to be able to share
with someone who is an ally.

728
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,118
KRIS: So every person

729
00:30:58,198 --> 00:31:00,306
decides what's best for them.

730
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:02,333
- KATE: That's right.
- KRIS: ... for... like a case-by-case.

731
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:03,928
- Okay, got it.
- JENNY: Having been married

732
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:05,692
- those 23 years...
- KRIS: Mm-hmm.

733
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:08,098
JENNY: ... now that she has
done the presto-change-o,

734
00:31:08,802 --> 00:31:10,709
does it in any way make you question

735
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:13,115
yourself and who you
were during that time?

736
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,346
KRIS: No.

737
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:17,378
I don't know why, but it doesn't.

738
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:19,159
- JENNY: She tell you early on?
- KRIS: No.

739
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:20,732
CAITLYN: Oh, I did, too.

740
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:22,870
KRIS: She keeps saying she
told me, but she didn't.

741
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:24,297
- (Chandi laughs)
- I think what happened was...

742
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:27,523
KRIS: ... a conversation in a driveway.

743
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,007
He says to me,

744
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:32,160
"Do you ever want to have more
kids?" And I said, "Oh, God, no."

745
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,466
So he says, "Oh, neither do
I. That's, like, that's great.

746
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,494
And I couldn't have any
more kids if I wanted to."

747
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:41,108
And I went, "Wait. What?" And he goes,

748
00:31:41,228 --> 00:31:44,021
"Oh, geez, you know, back in the '80s,

749
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:46,873
I messed around with this or
that and it kind of screwed up

750
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:48,913
my sperm count and, you
know, but whatever... "

751
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,350
It could've been, like,
steroids for all I knew,

752
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:53,796
'cause he was an athlete. Never
said estrogen, never said...

753
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,132
- He just said, "I took some (bleep) in the '80s... "
- JENNY: "Some (bleep)"?

754
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,114
KRIS: I mean, whatever word.

755
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:00,248
There was no "I am transgender."

756
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:04,651
It was "I took some stuff in the
'80s and my sperm isn't good."

757
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,809
CAITLYN: I said I had a condition

758
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:09,611
that I had been dealing with forever.

759
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:12,386
I said that I was on hormones

760
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:16,120
and that's the reason it
might be tough to get pregnant.

761
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,152
KRIS: And my friends said,
"Have a bottle of wine

762
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,990
and go have great sex." And
we did, and we had Kendall.

763
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:22,785
And then a minute later, we had Kylie.

764
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:26,394
- But none of that was "I want to be a woman."
- CAITLYN: I certainly

765
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:28,337
told her what was going on.

766
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:33,432
My version of what happened at the
beginning is obviously very different

767
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,356
than her version. I certainly
said I had gender issues

768
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:39,341
and that I was on hormones and, you know,

769
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:42,193
I had boobs and, you
know, the whole thing.

770
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:45,752
KRIS: You didn't have boobs. I
didn't know until all of this.

771
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:48,592
- I couldn't have given you the definition of "transgender"...
- CAITLYN: Let me finish.

772
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,735
- CAITLYN: Let me finish.
- KRIS: ... until six months ago.

773
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:53,358
KRIS: Okay, you're being
stubborn. That's fine.

774
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,992
JENNY: I don't know that Kris
and Caitlyn have ever really had

775
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:59,579
this conversation. It may be that Caitlyn

776
00:32:59,596 --> 00:33:02,096
really did tell Kris and

777
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:04,218
Kris just didn't want to hear it.

778
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:06,986
It might also be that Caitlyn

779
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,574
didn't say anything.

780
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,055
I... I've seen Caitlyn do this.

781
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,672
She says, like, one little thing,

782
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:14,170
and then it's like, "Oh, we're all done!

783
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:15,631
There. Thank goodness that's all over

784
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:17,062
and now we can go do something else."

785
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:19,731
I think I spilled the beans with my wife

786
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,377
a half a dozen times. We had the big talk.

787
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:24,618
And the very next time we talked
about it, she was like, "What?"

788
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:26,731
And then, you know, a little
while would go by and I would...

789
00:33:26,744 --> 00:33:28,161
the next time would
come around and I'd say,

790
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:29,408
"Remember when I was talking about

791
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,823
the whole transgender thing?"
And she was like, "The what?"

792
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,439
Maybe we're not being clear.

793
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,992
Maybe we're just kind of mumbling
in a kind of a... (mumbles)

794
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,166
KRIS: Maybe you're doing it
in your sleep or something.

795
00:33:38,202 --> 00:33:40,737
JENNY: But our loved
ones also, to be fair,

796
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,425
don't want to hear it.

797
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:47,905
KRIS: Well, I think with Caitlyn,
I kept saying, "Why are you so...

798
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:49,869
unhappy? Like, what's going on?"

799
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,288
I would sit you down on the
couch in the bedroom and go,

800
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:56,298
"Tell me what's wrong. There's
something really wrong. I can handle it.

801
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:58,556
Just tell me. Just please tell me."

802
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,816
And she would say, "You
wouldn't understand.

803
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,959
You just won't... you
just wouldn't under... "

804
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:06,042
"Well, try me." "No, you're
just not that kind of a person."

805
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:09,854
You know. So it was this back
and forth for a long time.

806
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:12,718
JENNY: You have two people
who are not communicating on,

807
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,243
oddly... (stammers) and tragically,

808
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,270
what's actually the most
important thing in their lives.

809
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,490
The reason I didn't tell my
wife before we got married

810
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:24,259
was because I wanted to
protect the people that I loved.

811
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,925
I didn't want to cause

812
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,376
harm to the people that I loved.

813
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,154
I didn't want to be a source of trouble.

814
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:31,673
I wanted to protect them.

815
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,251
I wanted to stand between them
and the trouble of the world.

816
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:38,271
- CAITLYN: And that's exactly where I was.
- KRIS: Protecting everybody, yeah.

817
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,316
CAITLYN: I never wanted to hurt anybody.

818
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:42,892
JENNY: If you knew ten
years ago what you know now,

819
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:45,071
do you think you would still be married?

820
00:34:46,523 --> 00:34:47,904
- KRIS: I don't know.
- CAITLYN: Ooh, good question.

821
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:49,321
KRIS: That's a really good question.

822
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,063
- MAN: Ma'am, your entre.
- CAITLYN: Thank you.

823
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,059
KRIS: I probably would have turned into

824
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:54,694
the world's greatest best friend.

825
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:57,078
JENNY: Is it too late for you
to be the world's best friend?

826
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,792
- KRIS: No. Never.
- JENNY: Good.

827
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:02,372
The bottom line for Kris and Caitlyn

828
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:05,790
to be able to move forward is forgiveness,

829
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:08,516
and forgiveness is no small thing.

830
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:11,492
It's clear to me, even now, they have

831
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:14,263
a relationship that goes very deep.

832
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,500
It sure feels to me
like they are going to be

833
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,483
part of each other's
lives for the long term,

834
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,495
but they each have work to
do if that's gonna be true.

835
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:24,155
CANDIS: You've decided
to change your life to... 

836
00:35:24,178 --> 00:35:26,963
to truly honor who you
are as a human being,

837
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:30,179
and have your kids stand by your side,

838
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:33,833
and have your ex-wife...
which is super rare...

839
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,078
- to be here...
- JENNY: It's amazing.

840
00:35:36,095 --> 00:35:38,435
CANDIS: ... but with
all us, your girlfriends,

841
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:41,727
so I think we all have to do a toast.

842
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:42,758
- CHANDI: We should.
- KRIS: Oh!

843
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,819
- CANDIS: To Caitlyn.
- JENNY: Let's do it to Kris Jenner.

844
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:46,157
- CANDIS: And to Kris.
- KRIS: Oh, no, no, no.

845
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:47,368
KATE: And to Kris.

846
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:48,579
- CHANDI: Yeah.
- KRIS: Thanks, guys.

847
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:51,097

855
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:13,989

to stay inconspicuous, with a camera.

856
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:15,743

- CANDIS: Oh, but they can't see

857
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,541

CHANDI: Never in a million
years would I think going out

865
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:54,001
on the dance floor to
dance with Jenny Boylan.

866
00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:56,718
That's being checked off my bucket list.

867
00:36:56,753 --> 00:36:58,861
Jenny Boylan was feeling herself.

I'm glad Kris had such a
good time with all the girls.

950
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:48,759
Um, there certainly was a little tension.

951
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:50,925
But I really feel like
there's one more thing

952
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,952
I really need to do, and that is...

953
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:56,651
before she leaves, have a
one-on-one conversation with her,

954
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:00,833
uh, because I feel like I
have a lot to say to her.

CAITLYN: There's really a lot

957
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,087
I want to get off my chest with Kris.

958
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:24,824
The girls have taught me a lot on
this trip about being more kinder,

959
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,156
gentler, softer approach.
I just hope I don't... 

960
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:33,183
kind of resort to the old habits,

961
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:36,296
uh, of being defensive and loud.

962
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:37,845
I've got a lot to say,

963
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,487
and I'm afraid if I don't have it now,

964
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:42,907
um,

965
00:41:43,448 --> 00:41:45,413
I'll probably never have the conversation.

966
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:49,033
KRIS: Coming.

967
00:41:56,173 --> 00:41:59,164
KRIS: You changed your birth certificate?

968
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,654
Does this mean that you didn't exist?

969
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,090
JENNY: I've never regretted
having surgery for one day,

970
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,017
