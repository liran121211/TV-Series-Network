1
00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:02,033
He messaged back. So we're meeting.

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,286
Yeah, I have his number.

3
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:04,810
My high school crush...

4
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:07,235
I had called him and told him my feelings.

5
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:09,022
Just thinking that he's gonna
be out there is kind of weird.

6
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,746
Ella might get lucky.

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,885
You know we're going to Lamoni,

8
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:15,154
where I went to college.

9
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,293
It is a church-affiliated school.

10
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,142
I'm quite nervous about this.

11
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,466
Caitlyn Jenner,

12
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,862
you're an insult to all trans people.

13
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:26,379
- You don't represent us.
- _

14
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,484
- _
- _

15
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:35,064
Oh. Is that Hillary Clinton?

16
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:36,395
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:39,386
- Caitlyn.
- Hillary.

18
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:49,114
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,278
You, like,
you want to pick a color

20
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:51,281
and we'll get you seated down there?

21
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:52,133
- Okay.
- Okay.

22
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:55,926
Should we all
go for the same color,

23
00:00:56,093 --> 00:00:58,204
- for solidarity?
- Oh.

24
00:00:58,243 --> 00:00:59,870
- That would be great.
- I love that idea.

25
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,973
A deep red?

26
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,446
See, she says a
deep red. Do you ever go red?

27
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,815
Never.

28
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,703
- Never, never.
- Then it's time, baby.

29
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:09,454
- Get out of your comfort zone.
- No, don't make me do it!

30
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:11,698
Oh, my gosh, look at these chairs.

31
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,363
Everybody, at the same time,

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,703
- turn on your vibrator.
- Oh, oh, yes.

33
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:17,279
- I know you will.
- Oh, yes.

34
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:18,794
_

35
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:20,872
The same color. The same color.

36
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,584
Because I... I, as far as, like...

37
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,636
I feel paralyzed by
the inability to make a decision.

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,529
I know. That's perfect.

39
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:30,044
- I feel the same way.
- Paralyzed.

40
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,239
- You know we're going to Lamoni...
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,982
... uh, where I went to college.

42
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,366
We're going to Iowa. First, Dubuque.

43
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:39,729
We're gonna meet this
wonderful lady, uh, Rachel,

44
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,814
who's really organized
her town on gender issues.

45
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,058
Then we're off to Des Moines,

46
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,089
where the Democratic debates are.

47
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,232
Should be interesting.
And then my old alma mater,

48
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:53,283
Graceland University. Iowa, here we come.

49
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:55,882
We're gonna do a presentation
to the student body.

50
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,929
Now, this is a church-affiliated school.

51
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:03,061
It's basically a branch
off of the Mormon religion.

52
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:06,626
But here's the deal:
I want to leave it open

53
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:09,070
to the student body to ask questions.

54
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,462
I mean, I've gotten a lot
of letters since coming out

55
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:19,803
and out of the religious side,
uh, about 50% are very positive.

56
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,900
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, but on the other half,

57
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:23,874
there's a lot of negative
people. We've all seen it.

58
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:26,121
So they can ask any question they want.

59
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,551
You know we gonna be ready.

60
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:30,643
If we're speaking in front
of the student body, I

61
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,617
am actually gonna know
somebody going there.

62
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,587
- Oh...
- From my high school, yeah.

63
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:39,237
- No way. Went from your high school?
- Yeah.

64
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:41,470
My high school crush...

65
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,217
I... I had called him, um, junior year,

66
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:48,220
before my transition,
and told him my feelings.

67
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,937
_

68
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:53,553
Um... yeah. I, um,

69
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,682
I had been waiting for, like,

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,699
all of high school to
have a class with him.

71
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,120
Then I have it, senior year,

72
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:03,079
after I told him liked him
and I come back as Ella,

73
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,919
so it's this whole crazy thing.

74
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:08,310
Uh, it definitely was, like,
a weird... it was like, oh...

75
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:10,747
'Cause I didn't know we
were going to be speaking

76
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,311
in front of the student
body, and just thinking

77
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:13,866
that he's going to be out
there is kind of weird.

78
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,073
Are you okay? Or are you feeling...
You sound a little worried.

79
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:18,282
I'm...

80
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,942
I'm kind of nervous, you know?

81
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,034
If I were to, let's say, run into him,

82
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,057
it would be interesting to hear how...

83
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,505
'Cause I never talked to him about it.

84
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:29,595
How long ago was this?

85
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,736
- Uh, last year.
- Last year. So it's pretty recent.

86
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:35,774
(bleep)'s best... sorry, that's his name.

87
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,667
(bleep)'s best friend, um,

88
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,756
Michael... they're both at Graceland.

89
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,912
- They're both at Graceland?
- Oh, they're both there.

90
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,943
Yeah, it's really strange. Michael, um...

91
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,181
he was probably the only
guy who wrote in my yearbook,

92
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:48,511
and he wrote,

93
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:51,020
"I hope our paths cross again."

94
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,010
Ooh.

95
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:53,686
So this is the friend of the crush.

96
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:55,257
- The friend.
- No way.

97
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:56,740
Strange.

98
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,568
We gotta stay overnight in Lamoni.

99
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,902
- Yes, we gotta stay overnight.
- We can't just go through.

100
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,032
- I think we...
- No.

101
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:03,817
- Yeah, I think...
- Ella might get lucky.

102
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,474
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

103
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,309
Let's do it.

104
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,359
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Shannon.

105
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,507
Nice to meet you, also.

106
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,682
Chicago House, they asked me to come in.

107
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:35,752
They're having a big fund-raiser.
It is really a great organization.

108
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:41,100
They provide, uh, medical services,
uh, employment opportunities

109
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:43,961
and housing for our people
who are living on the streets,

110
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:46,140
who have, basically, no place to go.

111
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:49,651
And that is a huge
problem in this community.

112
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:52,026
Thank you.

113
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,387
It is so my pleasure to
be here for Chicago House.

114
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,985
My experience is not even close

115
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,899
to being the normal
experience in this community.

116
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:08,188
Yesterday, we got the
opportunity to go visit

117
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,844
a, kind of a subdivision of Chicago House

118
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:14,943
and it's the TransLife Center,
which really spotlights, um,

119
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:17,251
homelessness in the trans community.

120
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:19,154
When I got here, I was in a dark place.

121
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:21,266
I was in a domestic relationship.

122
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,449
I was 13, he was 21.

123
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:26,447
And I dated him... he
beat the crap out of me.

124
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:30,416
I finally got away and I started
doing drugs and drinking a lot.

125
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,868
I mean, even trying to
take care of myself...

126
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,755
I started sex work. I
did get raped before,

127
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:39,747
and I just want girls
younger than me to know that

128
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,169
you don't have to do it.

129
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:44,550
You know what, everybody
needs a break in life.

130
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,390
Everybody needs a chance in life.

131
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:49,869
And hopefully, by continuing
on this conversation,

132
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:53,358
we can make it better for
the next generation coming up.

133
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,528
Because there's lives at stake, here.

134
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,678
There are so many great
people in this community

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,342
and it's a pleasure to be part of it.

136
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,351
Thank you so much for having me

137
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:05,966
and letting me tell my story.

138
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,092
Huzzah!

139
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,731
Did I do okay?

140
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:18,793
- You did great.
- Nailed it, nailed it.

141
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:20,005
Thank you.

142
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:23,752
Caitlyn Jenner,

143
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,154
you're an insult to all trans people.

144
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,168
- You don't represent us.
- _

145
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:30,378
You're a disgrace to our community.

146
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:33,143
You have no right to speak for us.

147
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:36,210
_

148
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:38,095
_

149
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,182
Caitlyn Jenner, get away from us!

150
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:45,268
We don't get jobs, we don't get any money,

151
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:46,637
but you get all these awards.

152
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:48,480
It isn't all fun and games.

153
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,830
You don't care about the
real trans women of America.

154
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:54,486
_

155
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,911
You only care about
what you look like on TV.

156
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:59,399
We don't need you, we don't
want you. We don't want you here.

157
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,536
_

158
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,918

159
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,324

- _

160
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:15,852
_

161
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:19,884
We're going to the
Democratic debate tonight.

162
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,060
It's time to address
the elephant in the room.

163
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,270
Why is everybody looking at me?

164
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,039
He messaged back. So we're meeting.

165
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:31,262
Yeah, I have his number. I don't know

166
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,210
what people would think, seeing

167
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:37,148
one of the football players
sitting at lunch with Ella.

168
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,491
We don't want you. We don't want you here.

169
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,654
_

170
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,018
_

171
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,354
- _
- _

172
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,205
_

173
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,364
Don't you (bleep) touch her!

174
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,178
- What the (bleep) is this?
- Leave!

175
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:03,875
Leave!

176
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:06,112
_

177
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:07,507
_

178
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:08,709
_

179
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:10,843
_

180
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:12,238
_

181
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,588
- I would love for you...
- _

182
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,219
_

183
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,916
_

184
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:20,083
_

185
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:21,148
Police want us to get in the car.

186
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:22,961
Have a good day.

187
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:25,322
Everybody in the van.

188
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:27,144
_

189
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,919
Baby, you can't even show your face,

190
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,716
so how are you gonna speak about
what's an insult to our community

191
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:37,160
and you can't even represent
yourself and show who you are?

192
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,597
What are you doing to
further our community?

193
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:43,032
If you're out here, willing to
invest your energy and your time

194
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:44,939
into trying to tear someone down,

195
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:48,303
you could be using that same
energy to lift someone up,

196
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:50,098
and you're not doing anything,

197
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,049
so what... what is the issue?

198
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:55,570
All trans people are convinced they have

199
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:57,432
 the truth about trans,

200
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,221
- and nobody else is trans but them.
- Yeah. Right. Yeah.

201
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:01,763
- Uh, you know?
- You're doing it wrong.

202
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,991
I... I was trying to calm her down.

203
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:06,526
"Calm down, calm down,
calm down," you know?

204
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:09,627
It was the first time for Caitlyn

205
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:13,756
that she saw, in the flesh,
people's reservations about her.

206
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,847
Um, and I think that's
actually good for her.

207
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:19,037
There are a lot of people with very, um,

208
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:22,771
reasonable objections to her privilege,

209
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,854
um, maybe her sense of
womanhood or politics.

210
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:28,764
You know, Caitlyn is a public
figure for transgender people,

211
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:30,617
but she's a problematic figure,

212
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,956
and she needs to pay attention.

213
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:40,624
Time to get out of here.

214
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:43,145
Going back to good old Iowa.

215
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,006
- The bus.
- Hey!

216
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,788
So this is it.

217
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:50,038
So Mimi is from Iowa,

218
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:52,997
and I thought it would be
really cool if she came along.

219
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:54,476
I don't get to see her very often.

220
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:58,366
So any time spent with
my sister, I'm all for.

221
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:01,155
Hi, everyone. I had this dream.

222
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:03,307
I was on this trip

223
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:05,998
with, like, two serial killers.

224
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:07,807
Stop it.

225
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,925
I had, like,
this crazy nightmare.

226
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,289
I know, I hate that.

227
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:13,888
Next on the stop,

228
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:17,167
we're going to Dubuque,
Iowa. I live in Los Angeles.

229
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:18,815
Tons of resources.

230
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,865
People to help, programs to help.

231
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:24,335
But what happens if
you're in Dubuque, Iowa,

232
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:27,694
and you're trans? What
programs are available to you?

233
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,256
Oh, my God, look at this town.

234
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:35,758
- Is this Dubuque?
- Main Street, USA.

235
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,080
I've been through this...

236
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:39,983
these roads right here many times.

237
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:43,546
Ah, the sweet smell

238
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,117
Oh, it's so cute. Gorgeous. Of Iowa.

239
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:49,999
We made it to Dubuque.

240
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,193
- I... I love it already.
- I know.

241
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:53,694
Let's go shop.

242
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,853
- "Lingerie and jammies."
- Lingerie.

243
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:58,706
Lingerie. Let's go there.

244
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,529
- This way?
- Yeah. First stop.

245
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,377
Wait, why are we buying lingerie?

246
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:03,764
- Why not?
- Why not?

247
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,889
Silly question.

248
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:10,478
Jenny, do you have any lingerie?
Like, for... for Deedie?

249
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:11,729
Um, I have... I have lots of flannel.

250
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,282
I have logs of gingham.

251
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,474
Wait, I think the pink and black
would be good for you. Yeah.

252
00:11:16,497 --> 00:11:18,038
You think... you think it would...

253
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,373
- kind of, open up a new door for me?
- Yeah, I think we need to... Yeah.

254
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,973
- Uh, it looks tremendously comfortable.
- Look-it,

255
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,619
look at how gorgeous,
these thigh-high stockings.

256
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:28,242
Oh yeah, 'cause, you know, I could
wear these when I'm shoveling snow.

257
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,554
You know, for me...

258
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,408
lingerie is... is not simple.
It's a fairly complicated thing.

259
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,230
But have you ever worn a garter?

260
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:40,801
I'm trying to think. I think...

261
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,309
I think one time when I was bear huntin'.

262
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:47,546
- Goddamn you.
- But I kind of like this.

263
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,452
And I'm sure Deedie will too.

264
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,723
_

265
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,220
I think so too.

266
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,385
Well, let's... let's participate.

267
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,595
Is it me?

268
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,999
It could be.

269
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:11,105
Jenny Boylan's got a secret.

270
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,592
- Oh, I don't know what you're t...
- She's got a naughty secret.

271
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,689
I got some candles. I got some candles

272
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:19,846
and some, uh, playing cards.

273
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,512
I think what all the
girls should sample...

274
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,877
their first time with mountain oysters.

275
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,216
Oh, what is that? Something weird.

276
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:35,993
Like, balls or something.

277
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,608
Isn't it balls?

278
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:40,243
- Bulls' testicles.
- Yes.

279
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:42,906
- Let's not and say we did.
- Yeah.

280
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:45,167
- Yeah.
- I like the way you think, Chandi.

281
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,319
Right.

282
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:50,746
Come on in! Hello, babe.

283
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:53,269
- Hi. How are you?
- Have a seat right here.

284
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:56,053
- These are all the girls.
- Hello, gang. Nice to meet you.

285
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,730
Now, you probably have never had this many

286
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:00,576
- girls like us in this town...
- Yeah, no.

287
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,865
- This... this is a first, for sure.
- Isn't that good?

288
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,558
- Yay!
- Great.

289
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:05,660
- I like firsts.
- Nice to see you all.

290
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:07,261
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I like firsts.

291
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:10,105
So what are we... what
are gonna do tonight?

292
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:11,904
Well, I was a dealer at the casino...

293
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,276
I still am... and we're gonna
have some blackjack tables.

294
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:16,073
You're gonna get to deal
to the people in Dubuque.

295
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,767
How rad is that? That's like a Bond movie.

296
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,571
One of my doctors

297
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:24,561
mentioned to me when I was going
through transition here in Dubuque,

298
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,296
uh, why didn't I move to somewhere larger

299
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:28,842
that I might be more accepted there?

300
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:32,905
I was pretty much the only one
in this area when I came out.

301
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:35,760
Um, and I said, "Because
people need to be aware

302
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,832
that there's transgender
people everywhere."

303
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,188
So I knew that's why I had
to stay here in Dubuque.

304
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:45,723
You are just a gutsy little
thing, aren't you? I love that.

305
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,948
Usually what changes a person's mind

306
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,586
about trans in general is

307
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,398
the moment they meet a trans person.

308
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,538
So Caitlyn and all of us ladies in tow

309
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:10,537
coming to Dubuque, now they got to meet...

310
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:14,961
any number of us and see that...

311
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:16,760
we're sweet.

312
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:22,596
Put your money on the table. Let's go.

313
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,867
Are you ready? I'm taking your money.

314
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:28,745
Okay, let's deal you up and you up.

315
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:29,890
And then we flip one over.

316
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:33,026
Just want you to know
I've been counting cards.

317
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:35,744
_

318
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,751
I'm Rachel. By the
way, welcome to Dubuque.

319
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,249
Nice to meet you, Rachel;
come on in the middle.

320
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:41,679
You get in the middle.

321
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,239
You got it.

322
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,758
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

323
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,744
- Hey, thank you.
- _

324
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:51,658
_

325
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,261
With... with what? With coming out?

326
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:55,249
- Yeah, and I just...
- How old are you?

327
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm 13. You're how long?

328
00:14:57,185 --> 00:14:58,212
13.

329
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,416
Surround yourself with positive people.

330
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,905
Uplifting people. People
who want to see you do well.

331
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:08,954
Anybody give you any trash in your life,

332
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,363
get them the hell out of your life.

333
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:14,457
There's a lot of great,
loving people out there.

334
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:16,667
Pick your friends wisely.

335
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,357
- Be yourself.
- That was really amazing meeting Caitlyn.

336
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:23,529
She's such an inspiration to
everyone in the LGBT community.

337
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:27,418
I just wanted to thank her
so much for being herself.

338
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,181
Look at all these people in this room.

339
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,116
You know, there's so many
good people out there.

340
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:32,925
Find the right ones.

341
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:36,823
- Life will be good.
- I'm so glad I got to meet her,

342
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:40,491
and it was just one of
the best days of my life.

343
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,317
You got it. Good luck to you.

344
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:43,725
- Thanks.
- Okay?

345
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,057
- Let's move it.
- Let's move it out.

346
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:55,522
Good-bye, Dubuque.

347
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,264
Good-bye, Dubuque.

348
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:58,993
Howdy, Des Moines.

349
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:04,534
May... may I kindly have
your attention, please.

350
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,869
We're approaching Des Moines.

351
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,061
Um, it's time to address
the elephant in the room.

352
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:13,814
- We're going to the Democratic...
- There's an elephant in the room?

353
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,151
There is an elephant in the
room, Miss Caitlyn, there is.

354
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,220
We're going to the Democratic
debate tonight, and...

355
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:23,001
there we're gonna be sitting in a room

356
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,721
with young Republicans...

357
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,095
and young Democrats.

358
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:33,284
I would like to see if we can
come to some agreed-upon guidelines

359
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:37,985
- so that the firestorm last time in Santa Fe...
- Hey! Okay...

360
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:39,938
... doesn't happen again.

361
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:43,694
I would like to suggest a safeword.

362
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:46,300
Like, if I blow up or go,

363
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:48,359
"Gah! I hate Trump!"

364
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:49,823
You're not allowed to say it like that.

365
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:52,907
Safeword: "God bless America."

366
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:56,854
- God bless America.
- God bless America.

367
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:02,011
♪ God bless America ♪

368
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:08,605
♪ Our home sweet home... ♪

369
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:13,127
Great!

370
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:15,282
So anyone of...

371
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,521
in this group says, "God bless America,"

372
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:21,536
we immediately go, "Holy
(bleep), am I being off the wall?"

373
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:25,013
- And we back... back down.
- Why is everybody looking at me?

374
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,797
In a room full of people we don't know,

375
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,255
we don't want to insult anybody there.

376
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:36,195
We don't want to get into
fights with the Republicans.

377
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:39,127
We don't want to get into fights
with the Democrats, Caitlyn.

378
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:43,515
- Let's also take into account that college students...
- We're, we have to show ourselves

379
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,132
as higher human beings.

380
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:46,780
- Exactly.
- That's right.

381
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:49,320
We've, we've been such a loving group,

382
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,707
and I would like to see us continue that

383
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:56,053
under what could be some stress.

384
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,993
I'm a little nervous,

385
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:02,857
uh, that... that Caitlyn will
not be able to meet in the middle

386
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,803
when it comes to her political beliefs,

387
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:08,618
because I think people don't

388
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:12,699
really want to hear about
Caitlyn being a Republican.

389
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,130
And so it makes me nervous that
she's gonna go off on a rant

390
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,913
and, um, I won't know how
to protect her from that.

391
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:23,758
I'm practicing right now
by keeping my mouth shut.

392
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,404
Is that Hillary Clinton?

393
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:32,581
Caitlyn.

394
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:37,017
He doesn't really appreciate this country.

395
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,056
God bless America. God bless America.

396
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:43,349
Now you're talking someone down.

397
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,992
Look at the bulldog.

398
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,306
Hi, I'm Lucille from Drake University.

399
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,361
- Welcome back.
- It's nice to meet you,

400
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,294
- thank you. Thank you.
- It's nice to meet you as well.

401
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,602
The Democratic debates
are at Drake University

402
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:04,311
in Des Moines, Iowa. In
1970, at that university,

403
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:07,307
I ran my first decathlon.

404
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:11,556
1978 inductee.

405
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,756
- _
- Holy wow...

406
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,385
This, this is where I ran
my first ever decathlon.

407
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:22,968
- This is where it all began.
- This is the old place.

408
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:25,669
Oh, my God, no!

409
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:29,139
Oh, the old, the old Drake Relays.

410
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,693
There we go, baby!

411
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:34,039
You know, even though I'm transitioned
and my life is so different today,

412
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,434
I'm proud of that aspect of my life.

413
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,962
Should we all line up like we're racing?

414
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:42,014
No. You'll be okay, don't worry.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

415
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,582
I'm not moving. I'm just getting down.

416
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:45,384
Okay, well, I'm hoping you
can get back up again...

417
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,475
- that's the problem.
- Right.

418
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:48,636
You know where the debates are?

419
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,266
They're right here. So we got to
get home, back and get changed?

420
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,016
- Yeah!
- Let's get it going!

421
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,732
Let's do it!

422
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,672
So, we'll give you a few
instructions to get started.

423
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,929
Over here on the tables,
you can make your name tags.

424
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,182
Um, we have blue if you
identify as Democrat,

425
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:11,383
red for Republicans and
white for anything else.

426
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:13,271
This will be fun tonight.

427
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,081
- It will be interesting.
- Yeah, it should be fun.

428
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:15,894
You know?

429
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:18,135
See all the free stuff
Hillary's gonna give out.

430
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:21,361
- You know, it's gonna be good.
- What do you mean "free stuff"?

431
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,126
- Well, that's all she does.
- Uh-huh.

432
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:26,053
Uh, she never says how we're
gonna pay for it, but...

433
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,075
Yeah?

434
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:31,665
Caitlyn's conservative politics
are a concern for all of us.

435
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,829
And I wonder how she'll be received.

436
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,948
All right, everyone, uh,
it's just a couple of minutes

437
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,799
until the debate starts, so
if you want to find your seats.

438
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,107
Remember if you want to
sit on the Democratic side,

439
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,852
it's over here, the Independent
side is in the middle

440
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:47,412
and the Republicans over there.

441
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:48,984
Hi!

442
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:50,486
- Hi, Cait!
- Hi!

443
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:53,881
- Hi!
- I'm a Republican tonight.

444
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:55,245
Okay,

445
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:57,557
go Auntie Kate!

446
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,772
Please welcome to Drake University,

447
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:02,196
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

448
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:09,351
_

449
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,355
_

450
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,634
_

451
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:18,406
God bless America.

452
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:19,742
God bless America.

453
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,823
Now you're talking someone down.

454
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,500
- I haven't said that all...
- I'm talking his policy,

455
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,402
_

456
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:28,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
But think about it...

457
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,278
God bless America.

458
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,049
_

459
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:35,972
_

460
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:40,865
_

461
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,584
Senator Sanders, in you said

462
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:47,606
a previous debate, the greatest
threat to national security

463
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,678
was climate change. Do
you still believe that?

464
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,988
_

465
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:52,855
_

466
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:54,268
_

467
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:55,921
He's an idiot.

468
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:57,957
No, no, no, no, no, no.

469
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,935
- Sorry, sorry.
- What he just said was stupid, I agree.

470
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:01,971
- He's misinformed.
- I agree.

471
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:04,128
_

472
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,826
- Okay, okay.
- _

473
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:07,836
- I like this. Okay, great.
- Yeah, really.

474
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:10,037
- _
- Okay.

475
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,494
_

476
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:13,842
- It is.
- Yeah.

477
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,026
I'm... I'm going yay.
I... I give her a B-plus

478
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:21,182
for really trying to listen
and... and communicate.

479
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,570
I think we really are coming to a point

480
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,486
where we can talk with each other. I mean,

481
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:28,373
you saw what happened in
Santa Fe... we could not

482
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:30,628
talk with each other.
I had to leave the room.

483
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:32,379
I have not had to leave the room

484
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:35,653
and I've only had to sing "God
Bless America" three times.

485
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:41,726
I want to ask some of
guests that are with us today

486
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:44,712
what do you think's been good so far
and what would you maybe critique?

487
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:48,000
I think people are being a little
tough on Hillary, personally.

488
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,601
I'd be happy to have any of
these people as president.

489
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,534
Okay, Caitlyn, do you, you got a red one,

490
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,603
so from the Republican side...

491
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:59,896
Coming out trans was like nothing,

492
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,457
until I said I was a Republican.

493
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:05,202
Um, it's kind of an
interesting situation for me.

494
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:07,161
They keep talking about the top 1%,

495
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:09,424
the top one... Oh, these
terrible people, okay?

496
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:11,127
I'm in the top 1%.

497
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:12,570
I don't even have Obamacare

498
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:15,087
and I had to put $450,000 in there.

499
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,258
The healthcare's going to be worse, so

500
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:19,433
I think we need a better tax structure.

501
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:23,766
Oh, I know, all my girls down here.

502
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:25,655
I got all my girls down here!

503
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:29,330
How we settle all our problems
at the end... are you ready?

504
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:34,160
♪ God bless America. ♪

505
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,595
That's it, okay. But
that's how we settle it,

506
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:38,818
- because we all love our country.
- Thank you.

507
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:47,273
- But I'm being very good!
- You are, you are,

508
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:49,038
- you are, you are.
- Aren't I doing good?

509
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:50,464
- You're doing much better.
- Thank you.

510
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:51,787
You're doing great.

511
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,287
Is that Hillary Clinton?

512
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,449
Oh, my God!

513
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:16,441
Caitlyn.

514
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:17,572
Hillary.

515
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,965
It is a church-affiliated school.

516
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,154
So, Chandi,

517
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:25,805
if we say something and
they come after you...

518
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:29,661
I can't just sit there
and... and... and take that.

519
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,341
You should sit next to 'em.

520
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:36,130
Ask good questions, 'cause I
don't think I'll be able to talk.

521
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,181
Okay.

522
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:41,302
It's just, like, that
nervous, like, why him?

523
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,307
Hi.

524
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:56,839
Oh, my God!

525
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,919
Is that Hillary Clinton?

526
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:00,603
Caitlyn.

527
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:02,394
Hillary.

528
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:05,085
Oh, my gosh!

529
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:06,582
Good to see you. What are you doing here?

530
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,674
Did you come for the debate?

531
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:08,717
- Yes.
- Of course we did.

532
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:10,258
How funny is that?

533
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:12,201
We are on the road.
These are all my girls.

534
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:13,765
- There's Candis...
- Hi, guys.

535
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,739
- How are you all?
- Great job tonight.

536
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:17,574
Thank you so much!

537
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,044
We're cheering you on.

538
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:22,395
_

539
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,116
Oh, that's great.

540
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:24,359
_

541
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,106
_

542
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,169
- Yes.
- So anything you can do to help.

543
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,344
Yeah, we're trying to figure
out a way we can do that.

544
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:33,003
- Good.
- So we're, uh, we're moving along, you know?

545
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,913
And these are the most
fun girls to be with.

546
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:37,325
_

547
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:39,720
- _
- Likewise.

548
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,332
With Hillary Clinton, we
were all so star struck,

549
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,087
and Caitlyn was, too.

550
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:46,431
You know, even though she
kind of wanted to deny it,

551
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,914
it was so palpable to me that I
was like, "Oh, she's loving this.

552
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,325
She's meeting a
presidential front-runner."

553
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:55,431
- Got it?
- Yep, we got it.

554
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,224
- Excellent.
- All right.

555
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:58,961
Thank you all. Great to see you.

556
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:01,707
- Say hello to your family, too.
- I will.

557
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,174
- Yeah!
- That was so awesome.

558
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:06,883
_

559
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:08,390
_

560
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:09,894
- _
- Not me.

561
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,620
_

562
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,725
You know, Hillary
Clinton, she's very sweet.

563
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:17,228
Very nice. And who, like, two
minutes later comes by but...

564
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:18,425
Bill.

565
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:19,534
_

566
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:24,435
_

567
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,529
He volunteered for a picture.

568
00:26:26,562 --> 00:26:28,801
- Overall, I thought it was great.
- _

569
00:26:30,901 --> 00:26:33,491
Wow, that was pretty monumental.

570
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,716
I'm gonna have a Strawberry Bitch.

571
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:58,033
Come on. Boom.

572
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,319
I mean, if anything, it's fun to order.

573
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:01,386
We also have a Jackass.

574
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:03,753
Every bar has one of those.

575
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:08,637
So I just got the guts to message Michael.

576
00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:11,405
And I said, "Hey,
Michael, long time no talk,

577
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,917
uh, but I'm actually going
to be in Graceland tomorrow

578
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,913
with Caitlyn and, um, I was
wondering if you'd want to meet."

579
00:27:16,946 --> 00:27:19,319
And, like, he, like... he messaged back.

580
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:21,496
He gave me his number and he said, "Yeah,

581
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,997
it would be totally awesome. "
He's like, " (bleep) is sleeping,

582
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:25,506
but I'll ask him when he wakes up."

583
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,383
- Ooh.
- So we're meeting.

584
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,449
- Yeah, I have his number.
- Bravo.

585
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:33,832
So, Cait, we're gonna be on your
old stomping grounds tomorrow.

586
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:36,807
No idea of what we're
gonna be up against, or... ?

587
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:41,629
Well, I heard they're also gonna open
it up to questions from the student body.

588
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:43,910
It is a church-affiliated school.

589
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:47,568
So, Chandi, if we say something
and they come after you,

590
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,273
- you gotta...
- I don't know, Cait.

591
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:53,307
I can't say that I
won't say it and mean it.

592
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:54,314
Don't scare me like this.

593
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,108
I really can't say that,
in... in... in order...

594
00:27:57,326 --> 00:28:00,566
I can't just sit there
and... and take that.

595
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:02,317
You gotta realize that that's the college

596
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,196
where I graduated and those...
those people were very good.

597
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,878
To be honest with you, going
back to Graceland, I'm... I'm

598
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,500
quite nervous about this.

599
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:11,352
I can see where the girls are coming from.

600
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,388
You know, if somebody would
come after 'em, they're gonna...

601
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,842
you know, they're fighters,
all of these girls are fighters.

602
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,629
But what they have to realize

603
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:21,074
is also that I have a
relationship, uh, with this school.

604
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,637
I was very good

605
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,525
and treated Hillary Clinton
with a lot of respect and I...

606
00:28:26,552 --> 00:28:28,441
I want them to treat the student body

607
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:30,887
and the teachers here
with this same respect,

608
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:33,194
uh, in the way they handle these issues.

609
00:28:33,235 --> 00:28:35,881
As long as they don't
tell me that I'm a sinner

610
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,933
for being who I am, I'll be okay.

611
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:40,238
But if they do...

612
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:43,089
If they do, that's another problem.

613
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,266
Guys, hold it. This is big.

614
00:28:48,297 --> 00:28:49,554
The coaches while I was there...

615
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:52,811
I was really wondering what
their reaction is going to be.

616
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:55,924
Are you ready?

617
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:57,252
- We're ready!
- Ready.

618
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:58,312
Let's do it.

619
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,233
This conservative school...

620
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,211
What are people gonna think?

621
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:07,504
I see you're getting nervous.

622
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,152
I'm nervous for them,

623
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,267
because they're gonna be so overwhelmed
with all these beautiful trans women

624
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:15,658
and, like, so much to, you know, take in.

625
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,203
And how sweet are you,
to be worrying about them

626
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,310
when you should be worrying about you?

627
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:21,887
I wasn't necessarily the...

628
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:24,257
the coolest person in high
school. I don't know what

629
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:26,213
people would think, seeing

630
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,896
one of the football players
sitting at lunch with Ella.

631
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:31,749
Men in general, when it comes to

632
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,946
putting yourself in that
situation, where you're

633
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:37,675
publically viewed either
intimately with a trans woman

634
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,518
or just friendly with a trans woman.

635
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:42,772
This conservative school...

636
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:44,595
What are people gonna think?

637
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:46,202
Oh, you're coming with your posse, girl,

638
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,543
- you gotta get over it.
- Yeah.

639
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:48,916
- With your girl gang.
- You right.

640
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,796
You coming with your
posse and you're all good

641
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:53,233
and that's the zone you
need to focus and be in.

642
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,381
Out of anyone that I went to school with,

643
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:57,007
it had to be him

644
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,005
and his best friend at Graceland.

645
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:01,894
- They're gonna be so excited.
- Like Zackary said,

646
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:04,862
you should be looking at it
as an opportunity to shine.

647
00:30:09,332 --> 00:30:11,613
Everybody on their best behavior.

648
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:13,976
- (bleep) A.
- (bleep) A.

649
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:15,994
I like that attitude, girls!

650
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:18,203
Actually, I was doing pretty
good on the whole ride down here.

651
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,696
Now I'm actually kind of nervous.

652
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:21,776
Yeah, I never wore heels at Graceland.

653
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:28,210
- I'm John Sellars.
- Caitlyn. How are you doing?

654
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:29,435
Caitlyn, great to have you here.

655
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:31,075
- My pleasure.
- We've been looking forward to it.

656
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:33,919
Yeah, this is pretty cool.
Guys, hold it. This is big.

657
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:36,996
- This is Jerry Hampton.
- Oh, God, it's good to see you.

658
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,019
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good, really.

659
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:40,522
You're still here!

660
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:42,222
And Bill Dudek. How are you doing?

661
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:45,068
Hey, good to see you. Good to see you.

662
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:46,460
When I was at Graceland,

663
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:49,796
as far as my identity, I
had my diversions in life

664
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:53,271
and I found sports and I
could be "the guy" in sports.

665
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,239
And Jerry Hampton was one of
the coaches while I was there,

666
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,141
and Bill Dudek, one of the other
coaches. I was really wondering

667
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,912
what their reaction is going to be.

668
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,458
They were sure bragging
on you in my office.

669
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:04,995
- Oh, really?
- They were talking about you

670
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,235
as a student and how
proud they are of you.

671
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:08,977
I know they're gonna be telling you that.

672
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:10,515
Yeah, well, I appreciate that.

673
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,776
Should I sit on the other
side, or sit here, next to them?

674
00:31:13,803 --> 00:31:15,394
No, you should sit next to 'em.

675
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,920
Ask good questions, 'cause
I don't think I'll be able to talk.

676
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:19,025
Okay.

677
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,589
I'm... I don't even
have feelings anymore,

678
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:22,896
it's just like that nervous, like,

679
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:27,650
"Why him?" You know? But I need to
remember that high school's over,

680
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:32,462
we're all adults here, and, um, I hope
that we'll have a nice conversation.

681
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,178
Thank you.

682
00:31:34,223 --> 00:31:35,805
Hi.

683
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,942
- Michael. Hello, Michael, how are you?
- Hey, Ella, how you doing?

684
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,136
I'm doing good. How are you?

685
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,981
Good, I'm doing awesome. This is Jenny.

686
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,669
- Hi, Jenny, nice to meet you.
- Hi. What's your name?

687
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:45,741
- Michael. Nice to meet you.
- Michael, it's a pleasure to meet you.

688
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:48,306
- Pleasure meetin' you.
- Now, did you have another friend that was coming?

689
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:51,937
We had a class together
today and he didn't go.

690
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:56,648
And when I went back to
the room, after my class,

691
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,895
he wasn't there. And I texted
him, like, "Hey, where are you?"

692
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:03,677
No reply and... I haven't
gotten a reply. Yeah.

693
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:10,006
How did you go about, like,
keeping on to your transformation

694
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,214
and still acknowledging God in your life?

695
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,260
Chandi.

696
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,593
- How?
- I got this one.

697
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,071
Now, did you have another
friend that was coming?

698
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:26,593
We had a class together
today and he didn't go.

699
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:31,088
And when I went back to
the room, after my class,

700
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,011
he wasn't there. And I texted
him, like, "Hey, where are you?"

701
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,033
No reply and...

702
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,891
I haven't gotten a reply. Yeah.

703
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:44,307
The fact that (bleep) didn't
come kind of showed me that...

704
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:46,592
I mean, it didn't... I don't even
know if it really showed me anything.

705
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:49,863
He might have just been
nervous, you know? Um...

706
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:52,156
you can't blame him for that.

707
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:55,253
Uh, I definitely do want to give

708
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:58,277
full kudos to Michael though,

709
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,065
for him to kind of come in there,

710
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,053
knowing that he was going to
be in front of a camera alone.

711
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:07,884
What was it like for you when
Ella went through her transition?

712
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:10,751
Um, I think my first time I saw her,

713
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:12,344
uh, at the Ventura County Fair.

714
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:16,386
I came in my high-waisted shorts
and a little crop top. No, terrible.

715
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:18,102
First thing I thought was,

716
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:20,486
"Oh, maybe she transferred
from a different school, like,

717
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,727
out of state or something like that,

718
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,710
and everybody just happens
to know her but me."

719
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:26,077
I was like, "Okay." Then when
I made eye contact with her,

720
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:28,444
I was like, "Wow." I was
kind of, like, in awe,

721
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,793
like, that she, like, came out like that.

722
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:32,558
- I thought that was very bold.
- Mike.

723
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:34,046
- Yes.
- You're a gentleman.

724
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,779
- Thank you.
- Gentleman, yes.

725
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:36,620
You are.

726
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,460
- Ready to go do this, babe?
- Let's do it.

727
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:44,016
I hope that the girls respect
that this is my school,

728
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:45,648
this is where I went to college,

729
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:49,207
this is where my name is
on the whole sports complex.

730
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,202
I just don't want to do
anything to upset anybody.

731
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,263
I want this to be informative

732
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:56,663
for the students and the faculty

733
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,657
to learn something about our community.

734
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:00,439
- Are you ready?
- We're ready.

735
00:34:00,478 --> 00:34:01,999
- We're ready.
- Let's do it.

736
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:04,054
- All right.
- We got your back.

737
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,956
Today Graceland students have

738
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:29,528
a great opportunity to
have a discussion about

739
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:32,247
gender identity, so
I'm very, very excited.

740
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,154
There are no wrong questions.

741
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:38,706
I, I thought I was nervous

742
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,354
before we got to Graceland College, but

743
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:45,100
my stomach is just dropping.

744
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,642
You know, after having the
lunch with Michael and, um,

745
00:34:49,182 --> 00:34:51,197
the other boy not showing up,

746
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,946
I don't know what to expect.

747
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:56,037
You ask what you feel you should ask.

748
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:58,025
It's very nerve-racking.

749
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,997
My question is,

750
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:02,949
how did you go about keeping
onto your journey of, like,

751
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:06,104
your transformation and still
acknowledging God in your life?

752
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:09,975
Because, like, religion and everything.

753
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:13,498
How?

754
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:15,865
- Chandi?
- I got this one.

755
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:21,858
- Chandi?
- I got this one.

756
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,685
Well, it actually was hard.

757
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,058
I grew up in a very religious family.

758
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:34,514
Many years I heard that
my life was an abomination.

759
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:37,744
So I lost touch with God for many years.

760
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:43,368
I had to recognize the fact that
God knew who I was before I did.

761
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:48,429
So how can I be falling out of touch
with God when he knew before I did.

762
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:50,539
It's a connection that I've made

763
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,818
that now that I have,
I'll never let it go again.

764
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:01,970
My daughter is a high-ranking

765
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,396
executive in the Church of Scientology.

766
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:10,840
And to Scientologists, my trans-ness

767
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,365
is proof that I am an evil person

768
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:18,595
and should not be talked with. So

769
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,635
I haven't seen her since she was nine.

770
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:23,712
She's now 42, 43 years old.

771
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:30,053
I haven't completely given up hope.

772
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:32,420
I haven't, and especially

773
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:36,520
getting some strength from the
women I'm traveling with now.

774
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,982
And just being able to say this to you.

775
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,144
Look for the heart of the
doctrine you're following.

776
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,943
And if it's at all mean,

777
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:51,793
think twice before
following it any further.

778
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,028
Thank you.

779
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:00,550
So, my question is

780
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:03,899
what kind of pronouns should we
be using when referring to you?

781
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:05,955
Uh, for me the pronoun thing changed

782
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:08,807
immediately when Vanity Fair came out.

783
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:13,697
- Now I go by, uh, "she."
- I prefer the pronoun "they."

784
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:15,340
I don't mind "she."

785
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:18,576
I go by Beyonc pronouns.

786
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:21,801
Boom!

787
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:24,124
Boom!

788
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:27,504
Okay, so my question is

789
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,609
how has living as a woman

790
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:32,138
and facing the woes in life,

791
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,409
living as a woman, affected you?

792
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,242
I, I don't know. I feel

793
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:39,367
ten times more powerful as a woman.

794
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,149
I do.

795
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,712
I always felt

796
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,009
nothing made sense before,
and as soon as I transitioned,

797
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:50,378
I had a light inside me that
nobody's gonna (bleep) with me.

798
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,235
I'm sorry.

799
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:58,810
I think that the... the
power is... is great,

800
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,633
but I think in relationships,

801
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:02,519
it allows me to think like he's thinking.

802
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,524
I still can recognize game.

803
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:05,914
- And I love that part.
- Yeah!

804
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:10,266
Can I get a witness?

805
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:13,599
Um, I honestly think being a woman

806
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:17,284
has nothing to do with the
physicality of our beings.

807
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:19,907
Um, I am the same exact person

808
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:22,853
I was, uh, before my transition.

809
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:25,049
Your life is always evolving and

810
00:38:25,077 --> 00:38:28,140
not every day is going to be the best day.

811
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,267
- Right.
- But you know,

812
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:32,857
you can make it the best
day as possible, so...

813
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:42,047
I totally love Ella,

814
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,581
and before we left on the trip,

815
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:47,935
I told her, "Ella, we
want you to be a sponge

816
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:52,506
and we want you to absorb all
this knowledge that is around you."

817
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,842
And in that moment, she
was just so poised and

818
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:58,844
just being able to see her grow around us

819
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,448
and see how we're all
individually rubbing off on her

820
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,313
makes that so beautiful.

821
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:06,107
I just want to get your input

822
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:08,407
on how happy you guys are right now?

823
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,688
'Cause you guys look happy.

824
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:11,543
Honestly, for years
and years, I struggled.

825
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,266
I would literally go to my house,

826
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:17,068
uh, never really coming
out. That was really,

827
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,000
really tough times for me.

828
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,284
And I had lost that spirit for life,

829
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:23,689
because I just didn't know who I was.

830
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,778
I have to admit today...

831
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:29,298
I can't wait...

832
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:36,053
I can't wait for the day to get started.

833
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:38,270
I'm excited about life.

834
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:39,857
I got things to do.

835
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:41,807
I love myself.

836
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,535
That was a long struggle.

837
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:01,487
In Graceland College,

838
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:03,170
I think in some ways
the tables were turned.

839
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:06,144
I think that it was Caitlyn's turn to be

840
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:08,199
a little bit afraid of what we might say.

841
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:12,587
But everybody on that stage
was remarkably eloquent.

842
00:40:12,604 --> 00:40:15,316
We didn't know how we were gonna
be received when we got there.

843
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,655
And people were not just respectful,

844
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,106
but interested and
supportive, which I think

845
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:22,851
- caught us all by surprise.
- What a privilege it has been

846
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,998
to talk to all my little
brothers and sisters of Graceland.

847
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,802
Go out there, be your true self.

848
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:30,119
And kick butt and work hard.

849
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,730
_

850
00:40:34,758 --> 00:40:37,236
_

851
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,202
- I figured.
- It's always about the bad stuff,

852
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:40,901
so thank you for that.

853
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,076
Did I do okay, buddy?

854
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:44,448
_

855
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:46,536
- Thank you.
- _

856
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:47,889
_

857
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:50,156
- No, there's, there's mostly great...
- _

858
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,370
_

859
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:53,497
Those girls I got with me
are just phenomenally good.

860
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:56,667
I think probably the most
important thing of of my story

861
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:01,868
is that no matter what your situation is,

862
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:04,391
that... that they can live
their lives authentically.

863
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:06,725
They can overcome the obstacles
that they have in life.

864
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:08,150
'Cause everybody has them.

865
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:11,296
That's my mission. Team
Caitlyn, you guys did good!

866
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,111
- You guys did so good!
- You were really great.

867
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:15,606
I'm so proud of you!

868
00:41:15,628 --> 00:41:17,885
It's not just trans issues.

869
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:21,688
It's about dealing with all
of our stuff that we have.

870
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:25,175
Thank you for bringing me there.

871
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:28,148
I was a little nervous and I was a
little hard on you and I... I'm sorry.

872
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:29,580
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

873
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:31,689
And I'm gonna be more open to...

874
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,672
Say it.

875
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:37,272
I'll be a little bit more open

876
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:39,038
to your conservative views.

877
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,921
Ooh, I like that.

878
00:41:41,962 --> 00:41:43,405
I love that.

879
00:41:43,454 --> 00:41:46,362
- We still got a long ways to go.
- We do.

880
00:41:46,389 --> 00:41:48,879
- We're only in Lamoni.
- I know!

881
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,452
We have plenty of time to discuss.

882
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:58,085
Pick it up. Squat down.

883
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:00,602
This trainer, he's really yummy.

884
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,453
And he seems like he's flirting back.

885
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,804
This is the longest I've
been without a relationship.

886
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:07,603
I think it might be
just around the corner.

887
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:10,387
- Disick is in the house.
- Hello!

888
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,787
Scott is kind of unpredictable.

889
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:14,681
I... I hope we see the good side.

890
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,217
I haven't talked to you all night.

891
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:17,053
I know.

892
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:18,217
_

893
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,725
No, I'm not ignoring him...

894
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:22,149
- he's over there.
- I'm gonna put myself to bed.

895
