1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,736
CAITLYN: Here we go.

2
00:00:03,107 --> 00:00:06,148
Well, a month ago...

3
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:09,201
I left on a trip with the girls,

4
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:13,194
hoping to meet a bunch of trans people,

5
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:16,394
learn about their stories,
and what happened is I...

6
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:20,838
is, honestly, I... I wound up
learning probably more about myself

7
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,228
than anything.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,656
CHANDI: Would you consider
yourself to be lesbian?

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,498
CAITLYN: Uh...

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,722
I am slowly coming into my womanhood,

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,070
but it's a work in
progress. Old Bruce...

12
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:34,473
did a lot of good things in his life.

13
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:37,556
Not that that old person was a
bad person, he just wasn't me.

14
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:39,465
I thought I knew a lot more

15
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,447
than I actually turned out to know.

16
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:42,558
What did I say now?

17
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:44,551
CANDIS: That if you look
like a man in a dress

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,449
it makes other people uncomfortable.

19
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,994
JENNY: People need to know that
you're fighting for everybody,

20
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,334
not just the pretty ones.

21
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:54,653
WOMAN: Caitlyn Jenner, you're
an insult to all trans people.

22
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,287
CAITLYN: I've made mistakes along
the way, I've been criticized for 'em.

23
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:00,358
CHANDI: How can you focus
on trying to get a job

24
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,211
when you don't where
you're gonna sleep at night?

25
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:04,394
JENNY: It's not about the
issues. We're telling you,

26
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:06,018
we were scared.

27
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:10,199
CAITLYN: Sometimes it got pretty heated.

28
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:11,784
JENNY: You're telling me Republicans

29
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,419
support rights for transgender people.

30
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:16,472
CAITLYN: Every conservative guy out
there believes in everybody's rights.

31
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:18,035
JENNY: That is a lie.

32
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,540
CAITLYN: I have to keep
an open mind politically,

33
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,541
socially, on trans issues, on womanhood.

34
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:26,340
I have to learn from my
girls, learn from society.

35
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,934
I don't want to hurt anybody.

36
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:30,681
CANDIS: Don't you really mean you
don't want to get hurt yourself?

37
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:31,981
CAITLYN: Hey!

38
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,883
- CANDIS: Hey!
- CAITLYN: But also we had somuch fun

39
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:35,920
on this trip that I
never, ever expected.

40
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:38,728
- You're voted in, I know.
- KRIS: Aw, thanks, guys.

41
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:42,019
- (cheering)
- CAITLYN: It was a growing process for me,

42
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:44,421
and we all still loved each
other when it was all over,

43
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,640
and that was by far the
most important thing.

44
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,759

45
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:04,208

46

CAITLYN: Oh, my God!

47
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:08,336
Jenny Boylan is in the house!

48
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,561
- Look at you, you look so nice.
- JENNY: Hi, sweetie.

CAITLYN: Baby doll.

50
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:13,911
How are you doing?

00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,537

- CAITLYN: I know, good. I am too, s...

52
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:17,974
JENNY: So, what, so you think
I've just been goofing off

53
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:19,314
these last six months?

54
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,385
CAITLYN: Today's a big
day. I'm getting ready to

55
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,667
start this next chapter.

56
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:25,343
- It's so good to have you with us.
- KATE: So good to see you.

57
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,970
- CAITLYN: I was so excited. Jenny.
- JENNY: Auntie K.

58
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,974
- KATE: Miss Jenny.
- JENNY: Auntie K.

59
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,553
- Hi, darling.
- CAITLYN: All of the girls have come to town

60
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:34,657
because we came up with this idea:

61
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:35,638
let's go on the road.

62
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,743
- CHANDI: I... I want to say thank you, first of all.
- CAITLYN: You got it, baby, you got it.

63
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,066
CAITLYN: I have this platform,

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,897
but I still have to learn so much more

65
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:46,393
to be a great representative,
uh, for our community.

66
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:48,693
I really want to kind of
get out of my comfort zone

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,515
and immerse myself in trans issues,

68
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,765
find out more about the
people that are out there

69
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:56,046
in these small towns across America.

70
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,974
I think it's just going to be wonderful.

71
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:00,368
I'll learn a lot and I hope
everybody else learns a lot.

72
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:01,238
CANDIS: Hi, gorge.

73
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:03,069
JENNY: Scarecrow, I've
missed you most of all.

74
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,677
CAITLYN: Our newest arrival is here.

75
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:08,476
- Ella, baby.
- ELLA: Hi, how are you?

76
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,923
- CAITLYN: Here we go.
- KATE: Hello.

77
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:13,696
- ELLA: Hey, how are you?
- KATE: My baby girl.

78
00:03:13,884 --> 00:03:17,042
ELLA: I already... I already have
you as "Auntie Kate" in my phone.

79
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:19,152
CAITLYN: Right after I transitioned

80
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:21,318
I had a friend from many years ago

81
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,841
calls and says, "You'll never guess...

82
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:28,605
you knew my son very little,
well, now is my daughter."

83
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:30,511
ELLA: My name is Ella Giselle.

84
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:34,253
I was 16 when I started
transitioning and I'm 18 now.

85
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,093
Junior year, school ended,

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,657
and then I just kind of
explored myself that summer.

87
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:46,033
And then senior year came and
I came back myself, um, as Ella.

88
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:47,841
- KYLIE: Hey.
- CAITLYN: My little Kylie.

89
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:50,198
Mm, baby doll.

90
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,011
- JENNY: What a pleasure to meet you.
- KATE: Hi.

91
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,439
- CAITLYN: And Kate Bornstein.
- KYLIE: How are you?

92
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:55,332
KATE: Hello, baby, say your name again.

93
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:56,024
KYLIE: Kylie.

94
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:59,780
CAITLYN: This is my other
daughter, everybody, Kendall.

95
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:01,990
- KENDALL: I'm Kendall. How are you?
- CAITLYN: That's Ella.

96
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,138
My girls... all my kids, but
especially Kendall and Kylie...

97
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:09,166
have to deal with, you
know, a father transitioning.

98
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:11,613
It's a very, very difficult process,

99
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,368
with all this history
you have in your life.

100
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,904
Am I doing it right?

101
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,860
You can never do this right.

102
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:19,374
Okay?

103
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:21,147
The last thing in the world I want to do

104
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,657
is hurt any one of you.

105
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,305
CHANDI: Can I say... I know this has not
been the easiest thing for you guys to

106
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:33,020
wrap your heads around, but you
guys are being real troopers,

107
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,467
real troopers about it.

108
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:38,565
And we appreciate all
the love you give to Cait

109
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:41,672
and to our full community,
because we need it.

110
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,994
- We totally need it.
- KENDALL: Of course.

111
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:44,696
- KYLIE: Thank you.
- KENDALL: She got pretty lucky...

112
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:47,156
we're all very, like,
open, accepting, like,

113
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,486
non-judgmental people.

114
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:49,692
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.
- KENDALL: Like, our whole family.

115
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:51,586
- CAITLYN: I agree...
- KENDALL: You're welcome.

116
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,319
JENNY: It's a thing that... it's
a thing that people need to learn...

117
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:57,265
that transgender people have families.

118
00:04:57,305 --> 00:05:00,260
KATE: Miss Kylie,
Kendall, I wanted to know

119
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,636
when did you know you were a girl?

120
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,704
KENDALL: Um...

121
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,677
I mean, I've al... I feel
like I've always known.

122
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,218
I feel like that's just, like, a...

123
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:10,128
like, I mean...

124
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,819
KYLIE: You know, I feel
like it was never a question,

125
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:15,202
'cause I had so many sisters and
I wanted to be exactly like that.

126
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:17,670
ELLA: And I think that's something
that people don't even realize

127
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,720
that they have a gender.

128
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,503
- Some people...
- CAITLYN: First... Yeah, like,

129
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:22,130
I would look at guys...

130
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:23,938
and think,

131
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:25,809
"Wouldn't it be nice

132
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:29,313
to be just, like, a guy
and not have this issue?"

133
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,109
CANDIS: I remember thinking that too.

134
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:33,381
- CAITLYN: Yeah, you remember thinking that too?
- CANDIS: Totally.

135
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,589
CAITLYN: For people in my community,

136
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:39,559
that question of gender is in
your head every day, all the time.

137
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:42,141
I want all my kids, but
especially Kendall and Kylie,

138
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:43,709
to think about their gender.

139
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:46,055
When did I know? You
know? When was that?

140
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:50,641
KYLIE: Well, you know what's so interesting
is I feel like a year before her transition...

141
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,754
I feel like there was
just a lot on her mind,

142
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:57,268
and we didn't really connect.
Like, I feel like my whole life,

143
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,014
it just wasn't genuine or...

144
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:00,903
Now I feel like we connect a lot more

145
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:02,627
and we spend a lot more time together.

146
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,230
So I actually almost like it more.

147
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:08,395
The only thing... when
I post photos of my dad

148
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:11,660
or if I say "Dad", people
will be like, "You mean Mom?"

149
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,066
And I just want to be like,

150
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:16,004
- "Absolutely not", like...
- CHANDI: Absolutely not.

151
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:18,863
KYLIE: That... Like, that
is not my mom, you know?

152
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:21,220
JENNY: I think that Caitlyn
is cool with that, but for me,

153
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:23,864
it made me a little crazy
when my kids would say "Dad"

154
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:26,275
in, like, a public place,
and I'd be like, "Oh... "

155
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:29,655
But... but it's... but
it's... In the end, we let them

156
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:32,373
pick a name, and they came up
with... with Maddie, you know?

157
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:34,021
KENDALL: Yeah, her name
in my phone is "Mad".

158
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,123
- CHANDI: Mm-hmm.
- KYLIE: Yeah.

159
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,730
KENDALL: 'Cause she...
she's a little mad.

160
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,405
- Bye.
- CHANDI: Bye-bye.

161
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,125
KENDALL: Hope to see you guys soon.

162
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:45,997
CAITLYN: I'm glad you had a
chance to meet all the girls.

163
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,524
Really one of the most interesting group
of girls you'll ever meet, you know?

164
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,774
- Love you.
- KENDALL: Bye, love you.

165
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,841
CAITLYN: I'll be calling
you from the road.

166
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,011
JENNY: Are you psyched?

167
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:58,154
CHANDI: Yeah, what's going on?
You... you just seem like...

168
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,124
CANDIS: No, I mean, I...
the idea of it is so amazing.

169
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:04,483
Um, I just... it's just,
like, overwhelming, you know?

170
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,801
CHANDI: Yeah.

171
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:08,158
CANDIS: I do have a
little apprehension because

172
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,466
I know that it's not gonna all be,

173
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,944
you know, rainbows and unicorns.

174
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:16,184
We've seen the reaction, mostly

175
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,551
within our community, at Caitlyn.

176
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:20,931
- Me and the girls have talked about
- _

177
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,074
- giving Caitlyn a reality check...
- _

178
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,459
educating her about certain things.

179
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,130
So we're... we're gonna be hard on
her, we're gonna tell her the truth, um,

180
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:30,546
even though she might not like it.

181
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,674
JENNY: It's up to us, her friends,

182
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,074
to push her... to push her
out of her comfort zone,

183
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,823
- to encourage her to look within.
- CANDIS: Right.

184
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:40,112
CAITLYN: Candis, where's the map?

185
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,724
- You have the map.
- CANDIS: I have the map for the trip.

186
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:46,504
CAITLYN: Okay, put it right there.

187
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:49,860
Um, we have, starting
here to the Grand Canyon,

188
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,672
which will be tomorrow.
And then off to Santa Fe.

189
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,865
- CHANDI: Cool.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

190
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,574
CANDIS: We could go to Des Moines.

191
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,597
- CAITLYN: Ugh, no, we don't.
- CANDIS: Yeah, we do.

192
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:00,360
The Democratic debates
are going to be there.

193
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:03,213
- CHANDI: Yay! (Whoops)
- CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah, right, right, right.

194
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,062
They're all Democrats, I'm the only

195
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,930
conservative Republican on the bus,

196
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,604
and we are in an election year,

197
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,569
so I think it's going to
be kind of interesting,

198
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:12,674
from that standpoint.

199
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,226
KATE: How many months
we gonna be on the road?

200
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,236
CAITLYN: A long time, yeah.

201
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:18,552
All right, early morning tomorrow.

202
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,183
- (birds chirping)
- JENNY: Careful.

203
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,400
(laughs)

204
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,888
CAITLYN: It is 6:30 in the morning...

205
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,595
unbelievably, we're on time.

206
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:34,995
I've got a lot of stuff.

207
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:37,629
We go pick up some more people,

208
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,282
then we hop on the bus

209
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,593
and we're off to the Grand Canyon.

210
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:42,832
Should be fun.

211
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,215
ELLA: No, no, no, this is not...

212
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:49,586
This looks very bad, but my bags
are only... these ones. So don't...

213
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,053
CAITLYN: Do you have your wallet?

214
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,901
COURTNEY: Kipsy, shut the door, and
I was like, "Kipsy, I'm in here."

215
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,367
- CAITLYN: There they are.
- KIP: Double trouble.

216
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:01,441
- JENNY: All aboard. Ready?
- (Imitates train whistle)

217
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,635
- CAITLYN: Oh, no!
- JENNY: Here, blow in there.

218
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:06,163
- Just go...
- (imitates train whistle)

219
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,530
(laughing)

220
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,791
- You want to blow?
- CAITLYN: Well, I can see it's gonna be tough.

221
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:10,924
- KIP: I do have...
- JENNY: I didn't mean this.

222
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,609
(laughter)

223
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,747
KIP: Oh, my paws and whiskers!

224
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,923
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Candis Cayne.

225
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,597
CAITLYN: Candis Cayne! Yay!

226
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,746
Next... Chandi...

227
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:24,581
- Zackary...
- KIP: And then we are out of town!

228
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:27,233
- ZACKARY: I love you.
- MAN: I love you, too.

229
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,924
ZACKARY: I feel so fortunate to have

230
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,056
a boyfriend who loves me and whom I love

231
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,496
and who treats me amazing.

232
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,617
But I know that that's the exception.

233
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:40,831
Men who love transwomen
come forward very rarely.

234
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:44,146
- CAITLYN: We have everybody!
- (Cheering, whooping)

235
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,744
Let's go get the big bus,
and we're out of town!

236
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:50,263
WOMAN: To the bus, to the bus!

237
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:53,299
- WOMAN 2: To... the... bus.
- CAITLYN: Let's go do it.

238
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:55,024
ZACKARY: Wow!

239
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,753
WOMAN: Oh, my God,
there<i> are</i> sparkles.

240
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,723
WOMAN 2: It's the glam!

241
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:02,096
CHANDI: The bus is totally amazing,

242
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:05,396
and being in that type of confinement,

243
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:08,884
there's never gonna be anyplace
for Cait to run on this trip.

244
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:12,262
Being around so many girls
for that length of time

245
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,745
is going to make her or break her.

246
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,874
- (whooping, clapping)
- WOMAN 2: Grand Canyon!

247
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:24,411
- ZACKARY: You look stunning, honey.
- CHANDI: As usual.

248
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,036
(Shutter clicks)

249
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,028
CAITLYN: Oh, Zackary, no way you can put

250
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,902
individual lashes on in a bus.

251
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,515
ZACKARY: You've got to be able
to paint yourself out of a box.

252
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:36,635
It's a necessary survival strategy.

253
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,801
- (laughing)
- (train whistle blows)

254
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,014
_

255
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:46,375
ZACKARY: Okay. I can't
imagine actually being

256
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:50,298
18 years old and having,
like, your first romance.

257
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:53,000
ELLA: My boyfriend is amazing.

258
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,254
It's really nice to
have someone, like...

259
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,051
understand.

260
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:00,311
CANDIS: Everybody has
a boyfriend but me.

261
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,665
(laughing): I'm the old
battle-ax that has no boyfriend.

262
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,422
- (fake snoring)
- JENNY: We're approaching lunch.

263
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:07,957
CAITLYN: I'd like to stop somewhere,

264
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,168
- like in the middle of nowhere...
- WOMAN: Yeah, let's do it.

265
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:12,908
- CAITLYN: ... and take over some restaurant.
- WOMAN: Let's take over!

266
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:16,508
CAITLYN: Let's go do it!

267
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:20,472
- It's the River Cafe, guys.
- WOMAN: Juicy's Famous.

268
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:28,860
CHANDI: Oh, my goodness.

269
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:33,828
- WOMAN: I'll follow you.
- (Knocking)

270
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,233
CHANDI: Hey!

271
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,627
CANDIS: Oh! We're in Needles.

272
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,218
WOMAN: Isn't that
better? You're in Needles.

273
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:45,243
(knocking) (laughs)

274
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,198
- WOMAN: Where is Chandi?
- WOMAN 2: Where is Chandi?

275
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,040
JENNY: Did she not get off the bus?

276
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,294
WOMAN: Oh, sorry, sorry... I
trapped you in there for so long.

277
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:59,471
CHANDI: Oh, my goodness! (Laughs)

278
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,128
I'm off the bus! Yay!

279
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:04,557
- WOMAN: There she is!
- (Happy shouts)

280
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:07,728
CHANDI: I could not get off
the bus. I was freaking out.

281
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:09,898
CAITLYN: You were locked on the bus?

282
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,003
CHANDI: People were moving
around, and I'm like,

283
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,984
"Hey... !"

284
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:15,251
Nobody could hear me.

285
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:17,528
Everybody was just
waving. So then I'm like...

286
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,655
- COURTNEY: A soundproof bus!
- CHANDI: Damn.

287
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,072
CANDIS: Damn.

288
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,163
CAITLYN: On the bus! Load 'em up!

289
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,567
- WOMAN: On the road again.
- WOMAN 2: Home sweet home.

290
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:32,095
CAITLYN: We got wine, beer...

291
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,333
CHANDI: That's just
what the doctor ordered.

292
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:36,236
CAITLYN: Let the conversation begin.

293
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:41,388
(Cheering, whooping, shouting)

294
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:44,324
JENNY: This bus trip was Caitlyn's idea.

295
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:48,426
I think part of her motivation was
she thought it was gonna be fun.

296
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:49,637
And, of course, it is fun,

297
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,395
but it's about more than having fun.

298
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:54,517
She needs to realize she's
not gonna get a pass anymore,

299
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,852
that some of the hardest
work for her lies ahead.

300
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,977
CAITLYN: Uh-oh.

301
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,678
- When she gets this close...
- COURTNEY: Scoot over.

302
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:04,231
CAITLYN: Yeah, when she gets
this close, this is not good.

303
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:05,236
COURTNEY: Are you getting nervous?

304
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:07,830
- CAITLYN: I'm getting nervous.
- JENNY: Cait, there's something I wanted to ask you

305
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:10,749
about, and I don't quite
know how to get in here.

306
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,107
- CAITLYN: All right.
- JENNY: I think you said...

307
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:14,259
- CAITLYN: Uh-oh.
- JENNY: ... um, the other day

308
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:17,017
that you consider yourself heterosexual.

309
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:22,862
When you were a straight
guy, so to speak...

310
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,335
- CAITLYN: So to speak.
- JENNY (laughs): So to speak.

311
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:27,202
Um, did you ever appreciate what

312
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,055
was beautiful about other men?

313
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,828
- Was that on your radar?
- CAITLYN: Other men?

314
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:33,561
JENNY: Yeah. Was on that your
radar? Did you... could you see men?

315
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,580
I'm not asking you to
make you uncomfortable.

316
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,741
Six months in,

317
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,764
I remember feeling like I was
seeing men for the first time.

318
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,259
Whing! You know,
something in me suddenly

319
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,997
was... was... thrilled by men.

320
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:49,368
- CAITLYN: Have you ever been with a guy?
- JENNY: No.

321
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:50,542
WOMAN: Have you?

322
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:51,962
CAITLYN: You didn't have the guts to...

323
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:54,319
oh, don't go like this
with me. (Laughter)

324
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:57,440
- COURTNEY: Oh, well, I'm so sorry!
- CAITLYN: My question's to her.

325
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,355
- No, I never have.
- CHANDI: If you were to date

326
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,476
someone female, because that's
what you're attracted to,

327
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,839
would you consider
yourself to be lesbian?

328
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,058
CAITLYN: Uh...

329
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,308
- Boy, this gets heavy.
- WOMAN: It does.

330
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:12,706
CAITLYN: Um, I'm trying
to think all this out.

331
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:15,238
Talking about my sexuality's
really difficult for me,

332
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,913
and I want to literally shrivel
up and just kind of hide inside me.

333
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:20,971
I really don't want to go there,

334
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:23,401
but I am totally
outnumbered in this bus.

335
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,892
To be honest with you, I can't...

336
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:29,812
see myself dating, like,
women in the future.

337
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,196
WOMAN: Wow.

338
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:36,516
CAITLYN: Do you know
your way around men?

339
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:39,615
- CANDIS: I do a little bit.
- CAITLYN: If we go on, like, a double date,

340
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,135
what about<i> our</i> affair?

341
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,817
Like, would it be over?

342
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:47,146
WOMAN: You're telling me Republicans
support rights for transgender people?

343
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:49,387
CAITLYN: Every
conservative guy out there

344
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:52,760
- believes in everybody's rights.
- JENNY: That is never gonna happen.

345
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,867
CAITLYN: To be honest
with you, I can't...

346
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:02,651
see myself dating, like,
women in the future.

347
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,281
- WOMAN: Wow.
- WOMAN 2: Wow.

348
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,143
CAITLYN: I just... I've
been there, done that.

349
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,633
- CHANDI: Right.
- CAITLYN: Got three very strong ex-wives.

350
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:10,145
I just don't see it.

351
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:12,190
JENNY: So now you can
have an ex-husband.

352
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:13,973
CAITLYN: That's right, now
I can have an ex-husband.

353
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,742
- JENNY: That's something to look forward to.
- CAITLYN: Um...

354
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:17,864
COURTNEY: Well, maybe now you are that,

355
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,806
so you don't need to <i>be</i>
that or be around, you know?

356
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:22,271
CAITLYN: Yeah. And I don't see a woman

357
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:23,869
being attracted to me, so... you know...

358
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:26,276
- COURTNEY: Oh, they're attracted to you.
- WOMAN: Oh, you'd be surprised.

359
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:28,254
JENNY: I beg your pardon.

360
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,982
WOMAN: There might be
women in this<i> room</i>

361
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,569
- who are attracted to you, Caitlyn.
- CAITLYN: Oh, they're in here!

362
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:34,472
(laughter)

363
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,301
COURTNEY: That's big. You have never...

364
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,546
that's big, 'cause you've
never said that before.

365
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,694
But this morning my
boyfriend dropped me off and

366
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:42,200
he, like, goes around and he's like,

367
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:44,250
"Cait needs to roll
her window up in her car

368
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:46,634
before she leaves, it's
gonna rain," and she goes,

369
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,123
"I'd like that, I got
to get me one of those."

370
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:52,760
She said, " I got to get me
one of those," and I was like...

371
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,991
I think you were attracted to, like,

372
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,996
that, like somebody who's just doing...

373
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:58,913
- taking care of it and, like...
- CAITLYN: Yeah, right, yeah,

374
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:01,930
yeah, there is factors of that.

375
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:05,330
To be honest, if I was in
a relationship with a guy,

376
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,312
I would enjoy being treated like that...

377
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:08,979
opening doors for you,

378
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:11,801
uh, doing all what you would
think the traditional stuff

379
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:13,676
in a guy-and-a-girl relationship.

380
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:16,087
It'd have to be a very special
guy to be able to do that,

381
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:19,095
but, uh... yeah, I
would be open to that.

382
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,871
KATE: What tickles us
isn't always the gender

383
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:24,000
of our partner. It
might be, you know, like,

384
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:28,039
sapiosexuals are all into
people who are smart, you know?

385
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,187
There are people who are into power.

386
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,386
Like, there's a powerful person,

387
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:33,841
I don't care what gender they are.

388
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:37,644
CAITLYN: In most cases, I've
been attracted to powerful girls.

389
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,628
KATE: Okay.

390
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,776
CAITLYN: I've always been
with very strong women.

391
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,892
If there was a female in my life,

392
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,412
it would be more like a
friendship than it would be...

393
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,626
a real, you know, a
serious relationship.

394
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,496
You would never have these conversations

395
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:53,654
anywhere else but in this bus.

396
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,777
Yeah. With everybody being so open.

397
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,375
WOMAN: Are we, like, here?

398
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,445
- CHANDI: We should be.
- WOMAN: All right, let's go.

399
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:09,485
- WOMAN 2: Is it cold out?
- CAITLYN: I think I got everything.

400
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,352
(indistinct chatter)

401
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,490
CAITLYN: A little chilly.

402
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:15,019
CANDIS: Welcome to the Grand Canyon.

403
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:16,484
Are you gonna stay in for the night?

404
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,050
CAITLYN: I am, uh, not going anywhere.

405
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:19,441
- CANDIS: Thank you.
- CAITLYN: Thank you.

406
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,072
- CANDIS: All right.
- CAITLYN: I will see you in a bit.

407
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,388
ZACKARY: Sweet dreams, Mama.

408
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,335
CAITLYN: All right.

409
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,304
Okay, I said what everybody wants to
hear, that, yeah, I would date a man.

410
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,337
I, you know... And it's kind of nice
just to get that kind of off your chest.

411
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,220
Maybe now they might
leave me alone for a while.

412
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:38,990
(Crickets chirping)

413
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,892
CANDIS: Have this whole
piece, 'cause I'm done.

414
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:44,211
So you need to eat that
whole gorgeous piece.

415
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:47,033
Right there. It's all...
No, take the piece,

416
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,413
(bleep) damn it. Take the (bleep) piece.

417
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:51,662
Thank you.

418
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:55,043
JENNY: So, can I just say?
That was kind of an amazing

419
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,515
bus ride, an amazing
conversation we had.

420
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:58,660
CANDIS: Yeah, it was fun.

421
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,005
JENNY: W... was I the only one who was

422
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:02,292
caught a little off guard by Caitlyn

423
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,917
allowing us how she
sees men in her future?

424
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:07,709
CANDIS: Yeah, that was interesting.

425
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:10,430
'Cause I always just assumed
because she's been with women

426
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:11,946
that that's who she would...

427
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,575
ELLA: I was definitely kind of like...

428
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,053
JENNY: Boy, it was like...

429
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:16,843
ELLA: "Wow."

430
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:19,116
JENNY: She did not want
to go there, and I felt bad

431
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,657
pushing her so hard. I really
don't like doing that with her.

432
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:22,932
On the other hand, I feel like

433
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:24,781
this is the journey that we're on.

434
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:30,352
ELLA: But, see, you got her to
say something she hasn't said.

435
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,943
You know? I... I would
have never guessed.

436
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:35,600
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- JENNY: Maybe it sounds like I'm harshing on her,

437
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,960
but Caitlyn often
gives us that, you know,

438
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,407
"I don't want to go
there. Don't go there.

439
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,333
I don't want to talk about it." And
then she'll just kind of, you know,

440
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:44,136
flit away. Well, she
can't do that anymore,

441
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:46,589
and it's up to us, her friends,

442
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,151
to keep pushing to...

443
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,742
find some answers to questions
she may not have asked herself yet.

444
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:58,004
CAITLYN: The Democratic National Debate.

445
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,212
CANDIS: Great. Front row! (Chuckles)

446
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:01,792
CAITLYN: The last place I want to be.

447
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:03,368
CHANDI: I know. I know.

448
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:06,352
CAITLYN: And if we're unfortunate enough
to get Hillary as our next president,

449
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,098
- we need her on our side.
- CHANDI: Right.

450
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:09,443
CAITLYN: Although she won't be.

451
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,840
JENNY: Which Republican would?

452
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:12,679
CAITLYN: She could
care less about women.

453
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:14,125
She cares about herself.

454
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,664
JENNY: I think we're
at a tipping point now

455
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:20,986
where the religious right and
some socialist conservatives

456
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:26,030
are using fear of people like us
to repeal and to prevent equality.

457
00:19:26,113 --> 00:19:27,902
CAITLYN: Oh, please. It's
not... Don't go there.

458
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,198
Just as much the Democrats. With me...

459
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:32,286
JENNY: You need to look
at it, Cait. CAITLYN:

460
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,718
No, I'm not gonna identify that.

461
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:37,173
I'm not blaming it on
Republicans and conservatives.

462
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,689
- CANDIS: Good morning!
- CAITLYN: Morning!

463
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,125
CANDIS: I'm so excited about
seeing the Grand Canyon.

464
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:44,659
CAITLYN: Of course.
Who wouldn't be excited?

465
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,447
CANDIS: I have never seen it.

466
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,382
CAITLYN: I am. I'm...
I've never seen it either.

467
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,347
- Yeah.
- CANDIS: I think it'll be good.

468
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,398
- CAITLYN: Yeah, no, I'm actually very excited.
- CANDIS: We made it here.

469
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:53,648
- The bus ride was fun.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

470
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:57,604
CANDIS: And I'm super proud of you
for opening up and... and, like...

471
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,972
- CAITLYN: Jesus Christ, I have no choice.
- CANDIS: Well, just a little bit.

472
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,413
I know. But you're
with all these girls,

473
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:03,719
and everybody was kind
of like... (growls)

474
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:06,112
Which, you know, you
handled it really well.

475
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:08,588
And now maybe you and I
can go out on a double date.

476
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,588
(laughs)

477
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,865
- CAITLYN: At this point, what the hell?
- CANDIS: Why not?

478
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:15,615
CAITLYN: Why not? D... double date, yes.

479
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,436
- Do you know your way around men?
- CANDIS: I do, a little bit.

480
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,467
CAITLYN: Okay, good.

481
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,319
- But here's the big question.
- CANDIS: What?

482
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,050
CAITLYN: If we go on,
like, a double date

483
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,511
- with, like, guys...
- CANDIS: Yeah.

484
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,198
CAITLYN: ... what about our affair?

485
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:29,648
Like, would it be over?

486
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:32,161
- CANDIS: Well, I mean...
- CAITLYN: I mean, the tabloids have been running

487
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,385
wild with this stuff.

488
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,371
Everybody has been pushing
right from the beginning

489
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,020
Candis and I getting together.

490
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:38,204
And I love her to death,

491
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,917
but I don't see the relationship,

492
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,196
from my standpoint,
going any farther than

493
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:44,117
what it's, you know...
where it is right now.

494
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,089
- CANDIS: To the end of our affair.
- CAITLYN: No.

495
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,845
(Candis laughs)

496
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,293
All girls have girlfriends, right?

497
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:52,474
You know, Candis will
always be in my life.

498
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:57,255
ZACKARY: Good morning. Oh, my God,
everybody looks so fresh and so beautiful.

499
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,513
CAITLYN: I know. Isn't that great?

500
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:03,436
We just got a... a court ruling.

501
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:06,387
Kind of on the bathroom and
changing and this and that.

502
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,912
This girl in Chicago
identifies as female,

503
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:12,878
but they just had a big article
in<i> The New York Times</i> today.

504
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:15,989
JENNY: "Federal education authorities
found that an Illinois school district

505
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:18,838
violated antidiscrimination
laws when it did not allow

506
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,029
a transgender girl who
identifies as a girl

507
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:23,058
and participates on a girls' sports team

508
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:25,378
to change and shower in
the girls' locker room

509
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,000
without restrictions.

510
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,405
Education officials say the
decision is the first of its kind

511
00:21:30,474 --> 00:21:32,355
on the rights of transgender students,

512
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:34,581
which are emerging as a
new cultural battleground."

513
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:36,910
- CAITLYN: Yay!
- (cheering)

514
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:40,297
- JENNY: Ah, love that.
- CAITLYN: That's good, it's all good.

515
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,973
That's progress for us.

516
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:44,441
And it starts small and
hopefully will spread.

517
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:47,531
My goal is to make a difference

518
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,116
for the next generation.

519
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:50,751
This is part of humanity,

520
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:52,783
and I want it to be treated that way.

521
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,894
Did you guys get your orders in?

522
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,175
- ZACKARY: Yeah.
- CAITLYN: Now, Ella, what are you doing about...

523
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,277
Are you continuing on in school or what?

524
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:01,472
ELLA: I think if I'm
going to pursue school,

525
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:03,915
I definitely need some
time to just, like,

526
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,754
- you know, take off...
- CAITLYN: Live your life.

527
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,996
- ELLA: Yeah.
- JENNY: I don't know what your experience

528
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,431
with high school is like. I
know for a lot of trans people

529
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,291
school, including for me,
school was really horrible.

530
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,176
ELLA: I was very lucky to
have the school behind my back.

531
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,402
In a little cute town

532
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:23,100
right outside L.A. that is kind of familiar
to difference in one way or another.

533
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,036
I was definitely one of the
fir... I think the first person

534
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,428
to kind of bring this up.

535
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:30,782
CAITLYN: Wore a dress for the
first time to school at the prom.

536
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,212
ZACKARY: At the prom. I
wore a dress to my prom

537
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:35,909
- I wasn't, like...
- CAITLYN: Yay!

538
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,254
JENNY: The experiences
people have in schools now

539
00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:41,993
are so all over the place.
Was it St. Louis where...

540
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:45,162
where a school board
allowed a trans girl to

541
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:50,225
play on the women's team,
and the students protested.

542
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:52,567
It's just so different,
depending on where you are.

543
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,770
And... and being able to live your life

544
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,579
with dignity should not
be a matter of geography.

545
00:22:57,897 --> 00:22:59,062
- CHANDI: Right.
- JENNY: Right?

546
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,083
ELLA: It's sad.

547
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,706
JENNY: Laws are different
from state to state

548
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:05,233
regarding transgender
people, and a lot of

549
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:08,398
how you live in this
world as a trans person

550
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:11,008
is dependent upon the
community you find yourself in.

551
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:13,549
I think it's one reason we need to pass

552
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:15,674
nationwide laws protecting our people.

553
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:18,158
We've made tremendous progress
over the last five years,

554
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:21,535
but there are many, many people
who still just don't get it

555
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:24,164
and still wish we'd go away.

556
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:28,039
CANDIS: I think that we need to
stop and maybe talk to Hillary.

557
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:29,776
CAITLYN: Democratic National Debate.

558
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,033
- CHANDI: Right.
- CANDIS: Can't wait.

559
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,672
Front row! (Laughter)

560
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:36,598
CHANDI: We're so excited
that Cait's even gonna go.

561
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,272
- CANDIS: I'm excited for Cait.
- CHANDI: Right.

562
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:39,963
And sit and listen to the Democrats.

563
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:42,938
- CAITLYN: It's the last place I want to be.
- CHANDI: I know. I know.

564
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:48,518
One of those things you're... you're
being open to and listening to...

565
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:50,208
CAITLYN: We need both sides.

566
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:51,811
CHANDI: Right. We need both sides.

567
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:54,708
CAITLYN: And if we're unfortunate enough
to get Hillary as our next president,

568
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:57,037
- we need her on our side.
- CHANDI: Right.

569
00:23:58,386 --> 00:23:59,735
CAITLYN: Although she won't be.

570
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:01,190
JENNY: Which Republican would?

571
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:03,996
CAITLYN: She could care less about
women. She cares about herself.

572
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:05,949
JENNY: Which... which
Republican candidate do you think

573
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,783
would be most supportive
of transgendered people?

574
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:10,279
CAITLYN: Um... all of them.

575
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:11,919
(Chandi laughs)

576
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,871
Yeah. They don't... The Republi...

577
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:17,193
"Oh, I hate trans
people" or "I hate gays."

578
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,601
And you don't... nothing of that.

579
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:22,308
They do more, "I want every...
I want a thriving economy so

580
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,566
every trans person has a job."

581
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:28,418
CANDIS: (sighs) Caitlyn,

582
00:24:28,695 --> 00:24:30,520
what am I gonna do?

583
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,603
I... I don't understand
why she thinks that.

584
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,434
That doesn't make sense to me.

585
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:40,117
Democrats are more open
to transgendered views.

586
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:44,621
And, in general, Republicans
are more conservative about that

587
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,780
and they don't want to give
LGBT rights to our community.

588
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,833
- CAITLYN: Another adventure.
- CANDIS: Yes.

589
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:54,418
CHANDI: We're off to the races.

590
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,444
- ELLA: Oh, my gosh.
- CHANDI: Let's do this.

591
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:58,246
(Squealing, laughing)

592
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:01,906
- CANDIS: Like a Disney ride!
- ZACKARY: Oh, my God.

593
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:04,556
CAITLYN: One day, this guy
comes running up behind me

594
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:06,821
and he goes, "Oh, I
just love trans women."

595
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:08,842
KATE: This whole notion of chasers

596
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:12,185
has got to get out of the
field of being perverted.

597
00:25:16,654 --> 00:25:18,092
(wind blowing)

598
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:19,945
- MAN: Hello.
- CAITLYN: How you doing today?

599
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:22,030
- Are you freezing?
- MAN: I'm not.

600
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,953
- I want to shake your hand.
- CAITLYN: Well, nice to meet you.

601
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:25,333
- How are you?
- MAN: You were an idol of mine

602
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:27,770
- back in the '70s.
- CAITLYN: Back in the old days, huh?

603
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,424
So much fun on this trip to
just be out meeting people,

604
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:34,595
shaking hands. Well, we're
open to people's minds now.

605
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:37,580
- MAN: There you go.
- CAITLYN: There you go. These people are just nice,

606
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:41,033
fun. I'm having a great
time. Nice meeting you.

607
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:42,174
I love it.

608
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:43,675
ELLA: I'm impressed.

609
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,110
- They have Ella.
- JENNY: Caitlyn.

610
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,403
CAITLYN: Oh, here we go.

611
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,322
ELLA: You're gonna love that.

612
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,110
JENNY: "Someone who is held
in high-esteem by her peers... "

613
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:51,089
- ELLA: Oh.
- CAITLYN: Like that.

614
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:53,945
- ELLA: Like that.
- JENNY: "... makes some mistakes

615
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:55,437
and learns from them."

616
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,899
- CAITLYN: Yeah, well, that's true.
- JENNY: And finally, "Caitlyn

617
00:25:58,218 --> 00:26:00,874
- encourages others."
- CAITLYN: I like that.

618
00:26:01,234 --> 00:26:03,276
- Perfect name.
- (Laughter)

619
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:06,403
MAN: Ready to go flying
and have some fun today?

620
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:08,108
CHANDI: Oh, I'm thinking about it.

621
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:10,496
MAN: 'Cause today, of course, we're
gonna fly over the Grand Canyon.

622
00:26:10,497 --> 00:26:12,847
This is a site-seeing tour.
It's not a thrill ride,

623
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,866
so it is a very smooth, steady flight.

624
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:17,272
KATE: Thank you. That's
what I needed to hear.

625
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,029
ELLA: Oh, my gosh.

626
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,551
MAN: All right, are we finally
ready to go? We are ready.

627
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:28,822
Let's do this.

628
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:34,101
- (laughter, sighing, gasping)
- CANDIS: Oh, my God.

629
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:36,597
It's like a Disney ride!

630
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:40,505
CAITLYN: Okay, guys, out in
front of us is the big hole.

631
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,945
- MAN: Is everybody ready?
- CANDIS: I'm ready!

632
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,137
- CAITLYN: All right.
- MAN: That's good because it's happening.

633
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:45,464
- CAITLYN: It's happening!
- MAN: Welcome to the Grand Canyon, everybody.

634
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,688
ALL: Whoa!

635
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,063
CHANDI: Wow.

636
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:51,799
- ZACKARY: Oh, my gosh.
- CAITLYN: There it is... the Grand Canyon.

637
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,485
ZACKARY: Oh, my God.

638
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:55,097
MAN: How is that view?

639
00:26:55,152 --> 00:26:57,416
- CAITLYN: Not a bad view.
- CHANDI: Not a bad view at all.

640
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,098
JENNY: The canyon
takes your breath away.

641
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:03,380
It makes you think about
the meaning of our lives and

642
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,881
how insignificant we are.

643
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,752
It was very emotional up there.

644
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:20,217
(birds singing)

645
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:26,518
CANDIS: So, you guys, I
think our table's ready.

646
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,513
CAITLYN: Let's go get something to eat.

647
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,422
Am I at the head of the table?

648
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:32,464
- Scary.
- JENNY: You are at the head of the table.

649
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,880
CANDIS: Hi, honey. You look gorge.

650
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:36,954
- (overlapping chatter)
- I love it.

651
00:27:37,134 --> 00:27:39,744
- Yay!
- JENNY: The memo I got was casual dinner.

652
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,186
Cait and I might be the only two

653
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:42,692
- who got the memo.
- (Laughter)

654
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,895
KATE: You are rocking Moschino.

655
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:46,655
CAITLYN: I am rocking
the Moschino tonight.

656
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:49,159
KATE: Moschino. See, I don't
even know how to pronounce this.

657
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:51,802
COURTNEY: She's trying to look like
a designer school teacher right now.

658
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,940
- CAITLYN: She's right.
- (Laughter)

659
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:55,247
KATE: If you were my school teacher,

660
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:58,689
- I would be so crushed out on you.
- (Laughter)

661
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,114
- But you went to an all-boy school, too, right?
- CAITLYN: I did.

662
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:04,671
KATE: Cross-dressing was really
difficult until my senior year.

663
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,574
I got my own room. I was a hall monitor.

664
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,233
And then I could lock my door,

665
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,699
- and that's when I dressed up.
- CAITLYN: But you never went out?

666
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:11,798
KATE: Oh, no.

667
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:15,439
Stared at the door, wouldn't
do it. That took a long time.

668
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:16,737
- JENNY: How long did it take?
- CAITLYN: You're telling me?

669
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,501
- (Kate chuckles)
- CAITLYN: Yeah, well, as time went on,

670
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:19,725
I got more and more daring.

671
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,078
I never used to get caught,

672
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:24,270
and then, one day, when
I was at the Marriott

673
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,640
years ago in Orlando,

674
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:30,270
went through the lobby, went down, got in
the car, drove around for while, came back.

675
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:32,054
- COURTNEY: What, as Caitlyn?
- CAITLYN: Yes.

676
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:33,375
Was walking through the lobby,

677
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:35,209
and this guy comes running up behind me.

678
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:36,502
"Hello! Hello! Hello!"

679
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:39,038
And he goes, "Oh, I
just love trans women."

680
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:41,154
And I went, "(Bleep)!"

681
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,891
I'm going, "Just keep walking."

682
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:44,600
And he stayed out of the elevator.

683
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:47,958
That was the closest I
ever got to anybody ever.

684
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,383
He goes, "I date 'em all the
time. I love trans women."

685
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:52,194
- And this and that. And I'm going,
- CANDIS: He was chasing.

686
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:54,966
"Oh, (bleep), on the
wrong guy." (laughter)

687
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:56,523
Yeah. Scared me to death.

688
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,235
Got into the room, locked the
door. I didn't go out again.

689
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:02,676
KATE: You know what's gonna have
to happen for more acceptance

690
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,847
is, this whole notion of chasers

691
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:07,568
has got to get out of the
field of being perverted.

692
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:11,502
It's got to become as
beautiful to love a trans person

693
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:13,503
as it is to love a cis person.

694
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:15,868
There's the natural leap.

695
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:17,729
When our desirability

696
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:21,088
- is natural, you know?
- JENNY: But the men who...

697
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,281
and women... but the men who

698
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,755
love us need to be the ones to stand up

699
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:29,504
- and take responsibility and testify to that.
- KATE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

700
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:30,968
JENNY: Rather than it being

701
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,892
some shameful thing, you know?

702
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:37,577
CAITLYN: I can't even imagine
some guy going out with me,

703
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:43,042
and then being absolutely
scrutinized by the tabloids.

704
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,079
Can you imagine if I
actually had a date and, like,

705
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:46,936
walked out of a movie theatre on a

706
00:29:47,193 --> 00:29:50,027
quiet Wednesday night
holding hands with somebody?

707
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,216
I think they would
be really tough on me,

708
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:54,331
and certainly would be
tough on the guy. Like,

709
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:56,234
"Why are you dating her?"

710
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,664
You know? "What are your motivation?"

711
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:01,102
It just gets so complicated,

712
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:02,136
because of the media,

713
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,250
that I don't know any
guy that would ever

714
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:06,546
even want to go through
something like that.

715
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,604
JENNY: There is a
faction of people who uses

716
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:16,561
fear of trans people, fear of gay people

717
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,810
to bring people to
the polls, and it's...

718
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,856
- CAITLYN: We're not going there, and...
- JENNY: We are going there.

719
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:24,176
- That's why we're on this trip!
- CAITLYN: Oh, God.

720
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:28,085
Every conservative guy out there
believes in everybody's rights.

721
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:33,083
WOMAN: Well, do you
think... ? Did you say... Whoa.

722
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,713
CHANDI: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

723
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,499
ZACKARY: You know I
have a great boyfriend...

724
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:40,224
- CHANDI: Oh, amaze balls.
- ZACKARY: ... who just worships me.

725
00:30:40,228 --> 00:30:41,522
CHANDI: She's got a good man.

726
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:43,262
CANDIS: They all start out that way.

727
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:45,434
- (laughter and groaning)
- KATE: Well, well, well.

728
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,522
- (overlapping chatter)
- COURTNEY: Don't be a man hater.

729
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,324
- ZACKARY: Bitter party of three?
- (Laughter)

730
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:52,935
KATE: The world is changing, honey.

731
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:56,502
There are more guys
going, "Oh. Oh, okay."

732
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:58,837
- You know that.
- CANDIS: Yeah. No.

733
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:02,030
I've never had a
problem finding someone.

734
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:04,732
It's finding the right
person and, you know...

735
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,755
- CAITLYN: Oh, that's tough in any relationship.
- CANDIS: Yeah.

736
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,890
- CHANDI: Right. Not only at night.
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

737
00:31:08,913 --> 00:31:11,694
ZACKARY: And I think sometimes,
like, well, we're really rare.

738
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:14,902
- We're not like all the other girls.
- CHANDI: Right.

739
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,281
ZACKARY: There's only so many of us.

740
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:18,803
CANDIS: Yeah. No. Yeah, no, for sure.

741
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,755
CAITLYN: We just have to
create understanding with them.

742
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,065
We have to explain this issue

743
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:25,830
in a way that they understand.

744
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,151
- COURTNEY: I...
- JENNY: And maybe we'll get there.

745
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,231
Maybe we'll get there
because we are being visible,

746
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,915
and we're, um... and
we're doing this work.

747
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,978
- (birds singing)
- (rooster crows)

748
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:42,049
(crow caws)

749
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,859
JENNY: What day is
today? Thursday, isn't it?

750
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:47,896
- ZACKARY: No, it's Wednesday.
- JENNY: Today's Wednesday?

751
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,848
ZACKARY: Yeah.

752
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:52,105
JENNY: This is not what I need.

753
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,707
- Ugh.
- ZACKARY: What?

754
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:56,230
JENNY: So, news broke
that something really

755
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:58,212
disturbing had happened in Houston.

756
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,667
An act called "The Hero Act,"

757
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:02,707
which guaranteed, um, equality,

758
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:07,320
not just for LGBT people, but for
all people, was, in fact, repealed.

759
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,792
There was a campaign for
the repeal that was run

760
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,049
by a group of ministers and
conservative Republicans.

761
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:16,881
The tactic that was used
against our community

762
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:21,597
to have this equality act repealed
was the threat that there would be

763
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:25,861
sick men in dresses
preying upon our children

764
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:28,406
in restrooms. It scared people.

765
00:32:28,475 --> 00:32:31,357
Um, it was a lie, and
it happened to work.

766
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:35,034
While we were enjoying each
others' company, something

767
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,453
rather discouraging happened.

768
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,394
Yesterday in Houston, an
ordinance protecting LGBT people

769
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:44,377
was repealed. The lead slogan was,

770
00:32:44,432 --> 00:32:46,925
"No men in women's bathrooms."

771
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:49,891
CAITLYN: Well, I'm all for that, too.

772
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,988
- It's how you define men and women.
- CHANDI: Right.

773
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,666
- CAITLYN: That's all we're arguing over here.
- JENNY: Well,

774
00:32:55,686 --> 00:32:58,054
what the people behind this repeal

775
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:00,853
managed to convince people
was that people like you

776
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:03,843
and you and you and you and you and me

777
00:33:04,124 --> 00:33:06,628
are men in the ladies room.

778
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:09,058
CAITLYN: They just passed
this ordinance in Santa Fe.

779
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:11,478
It'd be very interesting
to talk to the mayor...

780
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,005
who's all for this... um,

781
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:17,376
you know, some of the obstacles that he
had to go through to get this through.

782
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:20,235
JENNY: If I understand correctly, the
thing in Santa Fe was the mayor just did it.

783
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:22,942
Whereas in Houston, it
was a popular referendum.

784
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:24,615
- CAITLYN: Right.
- JENNY: And, um,

785
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:27,863
I think we're at a tipping point
now where the religious right

786
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:31,730
and some social conservatives
are using fear of people like us,

787
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:34,779
telling lies about
people like us, to repeal

788
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:36,733
and to prevent equality,

789
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:38,817
and we have to push back on it.

790
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:40,710
- I mean, I'm just seeing this real division...
- CAITLYN: Yeah.

791
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,772
JENNY: ... because there's all
this support and love for you.

792
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:45,077
You're being celebrated
by <i>Glamour</i> magazine

793
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:48,523
as one of the most
influential women in the world.

794
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:51,789
And meanwhile, voters are pushing back.

795
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,405
CANDIS: And it takes one group saying
that... that trans people are molesters,

796
00:33:56,622 --> 00:34:01,224
uh, to spook the rest of the community.

797
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:03,874
I mean, I don't even think about

798
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,797
ever<i> not</i> going
into the ladies room.

799
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:08,711
I've always been a strong believer
that you just hold your head up high

800
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:10,477
and live your life the
way you're supposed to.

801
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,172
ZACKARY: You hold your
head up high and pee.

802
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:14,537
- CANDIS: Yeah.
- (laughter)

803
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:17,966
JENNY: So, Caitlyn, I want to
come back to you on this because

804
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:21,513
it's worth asking you how you
feel, as a conservative, about this.

805
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,589
CAITLYN: I don't think it was
presented well to the public.

806
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:26,784
JENNY: But it was Republicans
and conservatives who said...

807
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:28,359
CAITLYN: Oh, please,
it's not, don't go there.

808
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:30,341
Just as much the Democrats.
It was not, please, please,

809
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:32,078
- please, please.
- JENNY: Caity, no, Caity, it... it's true.

810
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,672
- Caity, why are you insisting that?
- CAITLYN: No, it's not!

811
00:34:33,713 --> 00:34:34,951
No, it's not.

812
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:37,178
- JENNY: It's not the truth?
- CAITLYN: Republicans and the conservatives

813
00:34:37,215 --> 00:34:38,800
are not these horrible people out there

814
00:34:38,804 --> 00:34:40,334
- trying to oppress people.
- JENNY: I didn't say they were terrible people.

815
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:42,036
- In this particular,
- CAITLYN: They're... they're

816
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:44,366
- they're not.
- in this... No, I know that.

817
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:46,231
I... I come from a Republican family.

818
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:48,898
CAITLYN: Sometimes these girls
think now that I've transitioned

819
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:50,515
that I, everything has to change.

820
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:52,274
You can't be conservative anymore.

821
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:53,816
You have to be a liberal.

822
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:55,941
Um, no, I don't believe that. I think,

823
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:58,177
uh, I can keep, um,

824
00:34:58,468 --> 00:35:00,427
all of my views the same,

825
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:03,337
uh, 'cause I feel in my heart
that that's the best way to go.

826
00:35:03,693 --> 00:35:05,648
I don't know anything of
what they said down there,

827
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:08,839
but I'm not blaming it on
Republicans and conservatives, okay?

828
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:10,535
JENNY: Well, I think you
need to take a look at that.

829
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,091
CAITLYN: Yeah. Oh, please.

830
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,969
- JENNY: No, you, please.
- CAITLYN: That's why you

831
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:18,009
- all need to go with me...
- JENNY: No, you... you, please!

832
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,973
- You need to look at it, Caity.
- CAITLYN: This is why you all need... No.

833
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:21,830
No, I'm not gonna identify that.

834
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:24,370
- We're not going there.
- JENNY: We are going there.

835
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,493
- That's why we're on this trip.
- CAITLYN: And... Oh, God.

836
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,007
JENNY: You're telling me Republicans
support rights for transgender people?

837
00:35:38,197 --> 00:35:39,781
- You're telling me that the people...
- CAITLYN: I think they believe

838
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,833
in the Constitution and the
freedom of the Constitution.

839
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:43,722
- JENNY: So who overturned... ?
- CAITLYN: The... the public!

840
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:45,380
Because they're uninformed!

841
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:47,261
The politicians didn't even vote on it.

842
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,498
They just put it on the ballot.

843
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:51,113
KATE: Wait, there was an
ad that was put forward

844
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,587
by the former head of
the Republican party

845
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:57,040
in some county in Texas,

846
00:35:57,137 --> 00:36:00,786
and it's a horrible ad about a man

847
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:02,851
who's standing outside the bathroom

848
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,243
- waiting for a little girl to go in.
- CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, I know, yeah, they, they use

849
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:06,916
the fear factor big time.

850
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,264
Now, he may have been Republican,

851
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:09,831
I don't know, he might've been
a Democrat. I don't know and so...

852
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,331
JENNY: No, it was not a Democrat.

853
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,844
"No men in women's bathrooms."

854
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:16,815
CAITLYN: Yeah, I agree. It just so
happens he happened to be a Republican.

855
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,494
I wish he was a damn Democrat.

856
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:20,572
That would've made my
argument much easier.

857
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:23,495
- CHANDI: It would've made your argument a lot easier.
- CAITLYN: A lot easier.

858
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:25,180
- If the guy was a...
- CANDIS: Yeah, but there's never been a Democrat

859
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,686
who's really stuck
her neck out like that

860
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:29,416
to take a stand against trans people.

861
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:30,823
It might not be a coincidence.

862
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,674
CAITLYN: This is not a
Democrat or Republican issue.

863
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:36,228
- This is a humanity issue
- JENNY: It is, but so far,

864
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,951
it's been a Republican issue to...

865
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,263
- to turn people...
- CAITLYN: It has not.

866
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,720
JENNY: We have 15 Republicans
running for president,

867
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:43,489
none of whom had stated publicly

868
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,683
that they're for trans rights
and many whom have stated

869
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:47,591
- that they are against us.
- CAITLYN: They're just not talking about it.

870
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,433
For the Republicans,
it's not a big issue.

871
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,778
The economy's the big issue.

872
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:56,317
They're just worried
about $18 trillion of debt.

873
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,751
Those are all those, much bigger issues.

874
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:01,366
JENNY: There is a
faction of people who uses

875
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:04,189
fear of trans people, fear of gay people

876
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:06,508
to bring people to the polls and...

877
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:08,997
- and it's generally...
- CAITLYN: But the Republicans, I don't feel like

878
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:11,049
they're out to get us.

879
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:15,622
CAITLYN: Every conservative guy out
there believes in everybody's rights.

880
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,064
JENNY: That has never
happened! That is a lie!

881
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:21,310
That has never happened!

882
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:25,153
CANDIS: I mean, it is
frustrating to me that Cait

883
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:28,636
doesn't see the obvious.

884
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:33,395
I mean, it's not like we're
saying, "No, the sky's pink.

885
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,257
No, really the sky is pink."

886
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:39,004
I don't know how to show
her without demeaning her

887
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:41,577
or making her feel less than,

888
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:44,575
because her party that she represents

889
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:48,575
doesn't believe in who
we are as trans people.

890
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:50,797
JENNY: You said you
wanted to know what is, uh,

891
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:52,751
your life as a woman gonna be like?

892
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:55,476
What does it mean to be a
woman besides hair and make-up?

893
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:59,671
It means support for a woman's life.

894
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,422
It means women's health care.

895
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:03,621
CAITLYN: No, uh, the
Republicans just look at it very

896
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:05,508
much differently. They're
just worried about much

897
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:07,575
bigger issues than the trans issues.

898
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:12,534
JENNY: The stakes are
very high. If she doesn't

899
00:38:12,973 --> 00:38:14,733
listen to the rest of the community,

900
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:18,348
I think she's gonna find
herself isolated and irrelevant.

901
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:21,344
As a leader, you need to embrace

902
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:24,278
the fight for women's,
for women's lives.

903
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,517
CAITLYN: Yes, but we're 18 and
a half trillion dollars in debt...

904
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:31,826
our economy is going to collapse.

905
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:33,050
(Candis sighs)

906
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:35,279
The Democrats are
destroying the country.

907
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,317
- They should be really careful.
- KATE: Oh, dear.

908
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:38,558
CAITLYN: Okay?

909
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:47,833
CAITLYN: Our economy
is going to collapse.

910
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:51,009
The Democrats are
destroying the country.

911
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:52,770
- They should be really careful.
- KATE: Oh, dear.

912
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,844
CAITLYN: Okay?

913
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:56,096
ZACKARY: I really believe
the feminist slogan

914
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,691
"The personal is political."

915
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:00,411
And the thing that's
most important to me

916
00:39:00,446 --> 00:39:04,014
is advocating for my
trans brothers and sisters.

917
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,607
ZACKARY: And from what I've
seen, the Democratic party

918
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,275
has advocated for trans people

919
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,816
- in a way that the Republicans have not.
- CAITLYN: No!

920
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:15,027
People look at the Democrats

921
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:18,821
as they are this
open-minded liberal group

922
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,489
who's gonna sit around
and help everybody.

923
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,939
Free education, free health
care, social programs, welfare,

924
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,581
disability, insurance...
free this, free that.

925
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:30,457
Well, right now, all those things
are just killing our economy.

926
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:32,332
I think what they don't
realize is this country

927
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:34,901
could collapse over this at some point.

928
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:36,600
And if our country collapses,

929
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:38,898
it doesn't make any difference
if you're gay, trans...

930
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,016
whatever issue... you're on
social programs, it's over.

931
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:44,516
JENNY: I do not want to argue about

932
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:47,351
the government from here
to San Francisco, okay?

933
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:50,406
CANDIS: I just think that
she's been living in this

934
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:54,639
conservative bubble for so long that
she doesn't really have any desire to...

935
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,208
- COURTNEY: To bring in any new information.
- CANDIS: ... to bring in any new information or ideas.

936
00:39:58,225 --> 00:40:02,423
When it comes to debating politics
with Caitlyn, it's not a debate.

937
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,767
She just talks

938
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:08,799
what she believes in and she
doesn't listen to the other side,

939
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:11,536
which worries me. I'm at a loss.

940
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,309
You know?

941
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,935
WOMAN: Caitlyn Jenner,
you don't speak for us!

942
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:23,454
We didn't ask for your help!

943
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:26,173
CAITLYN: I had no idea how
difficult this trip would be.

944
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:29,401
JENNY: "No one wants to see a man in a
dress" sounds like you are putting down

945
00:40:29,442 --> 00:40:31,988
people who look that way.
Did she tell you early on?

946
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,686
- KRIS: No.
- CAITLYN: Oh, I did, too.

947
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,361
KRIS: I didn't know until all of this.

948
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:36,914
- CAITLYN: Wait, let me finish.
- KRIS: I couldn't have given you the definition

949
00:40:36,943 --> 00:40:38,567
of transgender.

950
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:41,073
CAITLYN: Besides the hair and
the make-up and the clothes,

951
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:42,990
what does it mean to be a woman?

952
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,551
(Paparazzi clamoring)

953
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:47,456
- CANDIS: We're all married!
- CAITLYN: We're all married!

954
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:52,242
KIM: Do you understand how
important a DMV photo is?

955
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:53,637
KOURTNEY: Yeah, baby.

956
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,737
CAITLYN: The fun part for me
is dragging all the girls along.

957
00:40:56,751 --> 00:41:01,009
To see them broaden their horizons
and have some fun with this.

958
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:06,377
CHANDI: Oh.. Uh, uh...
(laughs) Okay, okay.

959
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,502
KYLIE: I wouldn't want
to be on a red carpet

960
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:10,155
with my vagina out.

961
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:12,756
- CAITLYN: Uh...
- KYLIE: My vagina.

962
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:14,742
(Crowd cheering)

963
00:41:16,355 --> 00:41:19,039
KRIS: You guys have all
gotten a major ten from me.

964
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:20,739
Not you, Jenner, just your friends.

965
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:23,847
- (laughter)
- CAITLYN: I agree, I agree.

966
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:25,588
CANDIS: I could totally kiss you.

967
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:27,201
MAN: I don't think I
could really go there.

968
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:28,642
CANDIS: 'Cause of the trans thing?

969
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,102
MAN: It's a big issue, yes.

970
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,307
Candis.

971
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:34,052
CAITLYN: This is about
life and who you are.

972
00:41:34,985 --> 00:41:38,209
It's almost like throwing old Bruce

973
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:39,950
out the door.

974
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,488
KATE: I know life is hard,

975
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,819
but that's what happens. You
