1
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,513
[indistinct chatter]

2
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,640
What the hell is
going on out there?

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,851
- Somebody stole the rig.
- Again?

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,686
Hey, where do you guys
think you're going?

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,312
We'll be back in
two minutes max.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,689
Antoine is going to show
us his new motorcycle.

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,649
Great.
We always need organ donors.

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,234
Yeah, someone stole your rig.

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,652
Yeah, you weren't
watching the screens?

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,821
- How'd you miss it?
- Oh, I saw it pull out.

11
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,281
But I figured you were in it.
Why'd you leave the keys in it?

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,950
- It's protocol.
- No, it's not.

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:34,951
That's what I said.

14
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,745
Yes, it is.

15
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,956
And I... who steals a fucking
ambulance at 10:00 a.m.?

16
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,374
Easy... junkies, meth heads,

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,876
thinking they just stole
the candy store.

18
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,461
Or a psych patient
kicked loose last night.

19
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,670
Y'all don't know.
That thing is getting

20
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,047
stripped, chopped, and shipped.

21
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,215
- That's a pro job.
- Shut the fuck up.

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,677
Maybe another driver took it.
Did you call your dispatch?

23
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,887
Of course we called
our dispatch.

24
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,597
- Did you call the cops?
- I can,

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,348
but there are two having
breakfast in the cafeteria.

26
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,600
Help yourself.

27
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,768
Hey.

28
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,852
I'm good. Thanks.

29
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,187
Protocol.

30
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,813
Come on.

31
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,355
I'd put $20
on the psych patient.

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,275
Oh, I'll take that action.

33
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,693
Hey, do we have crutches?

34
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,986
Yeah, ortho locker
just restocked.

35
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,362
Okay, great.

36
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,864
Can you bring back
Sherry Davis next?

37
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,199
Sterno mom with the hand burn?

38
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,825
- Mm-hmm.
- She split.

39
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,243
Shit.
When?

40
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,745
I gave the kids
two breakfasts each

41
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,163
off the boarders' cart,
and they left.

42
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,998
In school probably?

43
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,833
Did she say anything about
coming back for wound care?

44
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,835
Not to me.

45
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,212
Fuck.

46
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,338
I need rooms cleared
and cleaned,

47
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,964
so I'm shuffling the deck.

48
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,382
Yeah, but why are you
moving him into Pedes?

49
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,051
I'm just about to extubate him.

50
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,636
There's no kids
in there at the moment.

51
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,054
The family can have
some privacy.

52
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,639
There's nice pictures
on the wall.

53
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,681
What's the problem?

54
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,723
There's no problem.

55
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,351
There's no problem.

56
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,228
Mrs. Smith does not
need a cardiac monitor.

57
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,604
She can get her Vanco
in the hall.

58
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,356
We've got one
tele-bed available.

59
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,066
Let's give it to Otis before
someone else snags it.

60
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,567
- Yep.
- Leave the family

61
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,110
in Central 7 alone
until nuclear medicine

62
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,570
is ready to take the kid.

63
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,863
There's no sense in
moving them twice.

64
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,240
Aye-aye, Cap.

65
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,533
[chuckles]

66
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,033
Hey, Robby.

67
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,703
- You're going to extubate?
- Yes.

68
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,080
Good.
You shouldn't have intubated.

69
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,373
Yeah, I remember
you saying that,

70
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,416
just like it was this morning.

71
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,835
You want me to do it?

72
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,544
No, why?

73
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,213
- Adamson.
- [woman screaming in distance]

74
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,714
- Jesus!
- Okay.

75
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,216
There's something
moving in there!

76
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,759
- Ma'am, hold still.
- Get it out!

77
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,594
I can't help you if you
keep moving your head.

78
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,263
Get it fucking out!

79
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,472
I can feel it!

80
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,266
Arthropod in the EAC.

81
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,767
Oh, my God.

82
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,436
[sighs] I better get in there.

83
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,896
Yeah.

84
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,359
[monitor beeping]

85
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,112
How long will he live
without the oxygen?

86
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,239
It's difficult to say.

87
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,575
Once the tube comes out,
it could be anywhere

88
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,786
from 30 minutes
to several hours.

89
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,122
When I extubate, we're gonna
suction the back of his throat.

90
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,291
We're going to give him some
glycopyrrolate drops,

91
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,585
which will cut down
on his secretions.

92
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,128
He'll get morphine for any pain.

93
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,671
[monitor beeping rapidly]

94
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,298
And we'll give him
some oxygen in his nose

95
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,049
as a comfort measure.

96
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,303
[beeping stops]

97
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,138
Jesus.

98
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,432
I don't... I don't think that
I can go through with this.

99
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,059
I mean, this...
this is happening?

100
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,979
Like, now?
Like... like, today?

101
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,565
We... we just decided
that Dad is gonna

102
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,317
die in this room,

103
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,696
in a room with cartoon
forest animals all over it?

104
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,785
If you think about it,
it's kind of perfect.

105
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,495
[chuckles softly]

106
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,290
Our... our dad worked on
"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"

107
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,708
the whole time
that we were growing up.

108
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,627
Oh, no kidding.
That's very cool.

109
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,503
"Mister Rogers,"
the television program?

110
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,922
- That's right.
- Here in Pittsburgh?

111
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:38,343
At WQED on Fifth Ave
for 33 years.

112
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,012
Dad worked with Jack Guest,
the art director.

113
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,805
So he helped, um,

114
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,559
paint and build all those sets.

115
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,816
I don't think
that I can do this.

116
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,655
[crying]

117
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,783
Okay.

118
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,953
Just to be clear,
your father is dying,

119
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,872
and you're choosing to allow
that to occur naturally,

120
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,041
rather than subject him
to a torturous amount

121
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,503
of procedures, which would
only delay the inevitable.

122
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,630
I just thought that
it would be different.

123
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,214
And I thought that there'd...

124
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,548
we'd have more time.

125
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:20,051
Is your family religious?

126
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,052
Oh.

127
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,512
God, no.

128
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,555
No God.
[chuckles]

129
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,020
I had a teacher, mentor,

130
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,399
who told me about
a Hawaiian ritual

131
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,860
called ho'oponopono,

132
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,863
or "the four things
that matter most."

133
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,074
It's basically just
a few key things

134
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,575
that we can say when
we're saying goodbye

135
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,828
to a loved one that
can really help

136
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,455
at the early stages of loss.

137
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,957
What are they?

138
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,293
They're gonna sound
really simple,

139
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,794
but I swear I've seen them work.

140
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,587
Okay.

141
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,632
I love you.

142
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,426
Thank you.

143
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,261
I forgive you.

144
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,013
Please forgive me.

145
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,182
That's... that's it?

146
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,267
Yep.

147
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,768
Told you it was simple.

148
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,270
[sighs]

149
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,981
Okay.

150
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,568
Mr. Spencer, I'm gonna
take this tube out

151
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,194
of your throat now.

152
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,782
What I want you to do is
to take a very deep breath.

153
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,492
- Breathe in.
- [inhales]

154
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,952
And now blow it out.

155
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,120
[exhales]

156
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,455
There we go.

157
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,956
[choking]

158
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,876
[coughing]

159
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,213
[suction hissing]

160
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,883
Okay.

161
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,801
Okay.

162
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,054
I'm gonna give you
some oxygen in your nose.

163
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,723
[labored breathing]

164
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,601
A couple drops
under your tongue.

165
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,688
- [sighs]
- You okay?

166
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,023
Tired.

167
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,691
You can rest.

168
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,651
Close your eyes if you want.

169
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,112
Your children are here.

170
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:07,075
Uh, Dad, you just...
you just rest, okay?

171
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,160
We're right here.

172
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,245
I'm right here.

173
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,165
[cries softly]

174
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,126
[labored breathing]

175
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,801
Come find me.

176
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,552
Okay, take a deep breath for me.

177
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,555
Jesus, everybody's going
to this concert tonight.

178
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,682
I wonder if there's
any decent passes left.

179
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,142
Another deep breath.

180
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:34,352
[phone dings]

181
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,895
Oh, my God, Jenna.

182
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,772
You're never gonna
believe who DM'd me.

183
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,482
I fucking told you
this would happen.

184
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,192
I'm sure Jenna is happy
you're here to support her,

185
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,319
but perhaps you could wait
outside until we finished.

186
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,946
Excuse me?

187
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,697
Excuse me, I'm in the
middle of an examination.

188
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,199
Yeah, and I'm gonna stay
with my friend for as long

189
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,492
as she needs me.

190
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,827
I'm the one who
brought her here.

191
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,203
Gold star for you.

192
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,705
Hey. It's fine.
I'm fine.

193
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,957
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

194
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,337
[phone buzzing and dinging]

195
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,550
Thank you.

196
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,010
I wanted her to leave.

197
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,679
How are you doing?

198
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,892
I called Nick's dad an asshole

199
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,562
and told him to go ask his son.

200
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,982
Why would I say that?

201
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,068
Uh, why don't you
tell me about school?

202
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,445
What are you studying?

203
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,571
What?

204
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,698
Do you do any sports?

205
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,617
Are you into any
extracurricular activities?

206
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,077
I don't...

207
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,912
I don't know why
you're asking me that.

208
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,914
Well, it's important that
you focus on the good things

209
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,292
in your life right now.

210
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,169
How?

211
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,713
A boy... a very sweet boy

212
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,840
that I barely even knew is dead.

213
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,383
And I just fucking
made it worse.

214
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,843
You just need to...

215
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,344
And his father thinks
I killed him,

216
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,388
and you're asking me
if I play sports?

217
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,558
Jenna, Jenna, I can tell
how upset you are right now.

218
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,268
I see how painful this is.

219
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,146
We don't even do drugs.

220
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,107
We were studying.
I mean, how does that happen?

221
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,276
I can't imagine how hard
this must be for you.

222
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,906
I just really want to go home.

223
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,118
Well, your vitals are excellent.

224
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,829
When your parents arrive,
they can take you.

225
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,041
Thank you.

226
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,918
We're here if you need anything.

227
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,007
Oh, well, that went south.

228
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,675
A couple of observations?

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,801
Please.

230
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,260
How thin is your skin?

231
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,804
- Rhino.
- Good.

232
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,264
Distraction is
a terrible strategy.

233
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,640
When a patient says,
"I'm hurting,"

234
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,308
we don't respond,
"What's your major?"

235
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,977
Oh, I wasn't
trying to diminish...

236
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,312
Additionally,
"I" statements work better

237
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,938
than "you" statements.

238
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,482
"I can see how painful this is"
acknowledges

239
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,108
the reality of the
situation and invites

240
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,652
further examination.

241
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,779
"You need to move on"
has the opposite effect.

242
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,822
Understood, but in
my personal experience...

243
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,158
Your personal experience
isn't germane here.

244
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,660
Germane?

245
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,246
Relevant, pertinent,
appropriate.

246
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,248
Well, I respectfully disagree.

247
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,083
My life gives me
a perspective that's...

248
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,460
Are you aware you have an
aggressive energy, Trinity?

249
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,130
Even this conversation
feels confrontational.

250
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,509
We bring our education
to the job, not our baggage.

251
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,843
Got it.

252
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,929
Thank you. Will do.

253
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,765
Good news or bad news first?

254
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,975
What's the good news?

255
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,518
Ear canal is numb.

256
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,104
Simple flush with saline
will fix the problem.

257
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,689
What's the bad news?

258
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,857
You've got a dead bug
in your ear.

259
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,859
[liquid squirting]

260
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,361
A cockroach.

261
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,197
[screaming]

262
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,825
We were in here for maybe
35, 40 minutes, tops.

263
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,535
I go outside, it's gone.

264
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
Seriously, there's
nothing on the radio?

265
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,163
Not yet.
The keys were inside?

266
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,874
Yes, I leave them in there in
case somebody needs to move it.

267
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,084
You're not supposed
to leave the keys.

268
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,586
That's what I said.

269
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,212
You take the keys
so nobody steals it.

270
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,839
So what the fuck
is security for?

271
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,048
Oh, I'm about to show you.

272
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,216
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey, guys,

273
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,010
can we congregate
somewhere else?

274
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,052
Give a little room.
We got a new guest checking in.

275
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,887
Guys, Ahmad, we got to
keep this area clear.

276
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,849
- Everybody, please.
- Hey, 5 bucks on "Chop Shop."

277
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,726
Wendell Stone, 52,
chief rigger from Pitfest.

278
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,810
- Isolated trauma...
- Get Cecil and Tony.

279
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,061
To the left chest...

280
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,479
Tell them to bring their guys.

281
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,856
When a speaker tower
came down on him.

282
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,982
Looks like multiple
rib fractures.

283
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,317
Pulse 110, BP 130 over 85...

284
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,568
They gotta go back
over everything.

285
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,736
Decent sats at 96.

286
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,070
- 50 of fent in the field.
- Got it?

287
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,572
How we doing, Mr. Stone?

288
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,823
Mr. Stone was my dad.

289
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,033
Just Stone.

290
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,659
[man screaming]

291
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,827
Damn.

292
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,495
They woke the Kraken.

293
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,205
When's he due
for his next round?

294
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,249
[indistinct yelling]

295
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,918
40 minutes ago.

296
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,379
- Perfect.
- [muffled yelling]

297
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,547
Mr. Driscoll?

298
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,299
Mr. Doug Driscoll?

299
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,259
About fucking time.

300
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,054
See you later, suckers.

301
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,265
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

302
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,767
"Jiya" Yi Chen?

303
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,393
I have some Tylenol
for "Jiya" Yi Chen.

304
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,478
Yes, please.

305
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,104
Over here.

306
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,439
Jia Yi.

307
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,107
Jia Yi Chen.
Here you go.

308
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,776
How much longer until
we can see the doctor?

309
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,277
Uh, we have to wait
for a bed to open up.

310
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,445
Might be a little while.

311
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,988
Pretty popular today.

312
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,908
The medicine should help.

313
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,117
Four of morphine.

314
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,619
No abdominal tenderness.

315
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,745
- What have we got?
- What have we got?

316
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,205
Jinx, you owe me a Coke.

317
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,623
- Isolated chest trauma with...
- Stop.

318
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,458
I want to hear from Dr. Santos.

319
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,919
Isolated chest trauma
with obvious flail chest.

320
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,462
No hemopneumo on POCUS.

321
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,922
Good sats and vitals.

322
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,298
Excellent presentation.

323
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,592
Sir, I'm Dr. Garcia
from Surgery.

324
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,635
I need surgery?

325
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,803
Not necessarily.

326
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,054
No blood in the belly on FAST.

327
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,806
- [groans]
- You got this?

328
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,307
Abdomen is benign.

329
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,810
CT chest, abdomen,
pelvis with contrast,

330
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,270
which I trust way more than
your ultrasound skills.

331
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,647
[exclaims and groans]

332
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,440
And more morphine,
for God's sake.

333
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,484
No, no, no, no.
Don't knock me out.

334
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,277
I gotta stay on top of
the crew doing the put in.

335
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,987
- The what?
- The festival.

336
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,658
We'll block all the nerves
going to the broken ribs.

337
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,159
Roll to the right.

338
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,495
You'll be awake and pain-free.

339
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,706
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about. [groans]

340
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,998
That's a ton of
intercostal blocks.

341
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,333
Nope, one shot.

342
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,043
Serratus anterior
blocks down to T-9.

343
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,170
You kids and your
crazy regional blocks.

344
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,506
Dr. Santos, call me
with the CT results.

345
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,466
Extension 1121.

346
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,512
Gabe's the same age that I was

347
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,347
when we made our first layout.

348
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,974
You remember that, Dad?

349
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,350
The... the two level track
in the basement

350
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,685
of the Clovis house?

351
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,186
- [weakly] O.
- That's right.

352
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,688
Yeah, it was an O gauge.

353
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,441
It limited the cars
we could use, but...

354
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,817
[sighs]
That layout was a beauty.

355
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,193
Hmm.

356
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,946
Doctor, does that
sound he's making

357
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,990
mean it could be any minute?

358
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,868
No, no.

359

00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,615
Why don't you go check on our
students, and I'll handle this?

543
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,908
Mm-hmm.

544
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,118
Oh.

545
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,246
[crying continues]

546
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,292
So why are you
sticking me again?

547
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,586
You came in an hour
after the chest pain.

548
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,296
If it's a heart attack,
it can take

549
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,089
more time for the heart damage
to show up in the blood...

550
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,632
put your finger on that...

551
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,801
even with the normal EKG.

552
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,386
That's why we repeat the test.

553
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,638
Lift your arm up.

554
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,223
Thank you.

555
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,394
All right, let's get you back
to the waiting room.

556
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,979
- What? No.
- Yeah.

557
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,272
No, all I've been
doing is waiting.

558
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,273
I'm supposed to
see a doctor now.

559
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,316
Soon.

560
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,817
I'll let you know.

561
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,779
[laughs incredulously]

562
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,531
This is a fucking joke.

563
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,325
Yeah, it's good to laugh.

564
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,621
Laughing our way to being
a third world country.

565
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,333
Remind you of home?

566
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,878
Okay, I know we're not supposed

567
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,379
to pick favorites here.

568
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,340
I'ma keep my eye on you.

569
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,841
Yeah.

570
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,180
You do that.

571
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,556
Oh, yeah.

572
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,355
So, Tasha, it was a decanter?

573
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,774
A beautiful Baccarat carafe.

574
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,152
I was, uh, showing a
colleague how to polish it,

575
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,863
and the neck broke
with my arm still inside...

576
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,199
- Mm.
- So not my finest.

577
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,659
Did it shatter?

578
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,495
No, no, it cracked
cleanly in two.

579
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,206
But as a reflex,
I jerked my arm back,

580
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,458
and that's what did it.

581
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,378
Reflexes, I have
regretted a few of my own.

582
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,589
Good.
Now inject to other side.

583
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,925
Single layer, straight edges,

584
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,760
about as straightforward
as it gets.

585
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,888
Oh, good.
That's a relief.

586
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,182
- [monitors beeping rapidly]
- What's going on?

587
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,558
Hypoxic to 78.

588
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,685
BP's crashing.

589
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,019
Systolic's 82.

590
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,187
Pulse is thready.

591
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,730
I should intubate.

592
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,232
Does he need a massive
transfusion protocol?

593
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,693
No. Absent breath sounds
on the left,

594
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,278
tracheal deviation to the right.

595
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,238
14 gauge angiocath now.

596
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,282
Put him on a non-rebreather.

597
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,200
What are you doing?

598
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,412
Tension pneumothorax from
the BiPAP's positive pressure.

599
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,871
[groans]

600
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,331
[grunts]

601
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,833
[hissing]

602
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,251
You hear that?

603
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,378
Who the hell ordered BiPAP?
Garcia?

604
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,046
No, his... his sats were down.

605
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,256
I did.

606
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,424
You did?

607
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,718
Without running it by me?

608
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,052
Can I put in a chest tube?

609
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,178
He doesn't need a chest tube.

610
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,513
He needs a pigtail catheter.

611
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,265
And I'll be doing it.

612
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,059
Sats and pressure
both coming up.

613
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,270
Draw up 75 of ketamine.

614
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,231
[monitor beeping steadily]

615
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,404
Why is she still crying?

616
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,072
Fontanelle soft and flat.

617
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,825
Pupils equal and reactive,
tracking across midline.

618
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,493
Dr. Mohan,
keep it focused, please.

619
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,412
Mucous membranes nice and moist.

620
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,581
[baby wailing]

621
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:16,793
Hard to hear over the crying,
but lungs are clear.

622
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,962
Heart rate's tachy but normal.

623
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,758
Soft abdomen, no obvious
signs of tenderness.

624
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,135
- So basically a normal exam.
- Then what's wrong?

625
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,970
Give us a little time
to finish our exam.

626
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,638
Yeah, I know. I know.

627
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,808
What am I looking for,
Dr. King?

628
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,143
Uh, cellulitis?

629
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,479
Edema from nephrotic syndrome?

630
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,482
- Diagnosis made.
- What is it?

631
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,400
Hair tourniquet.

632
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,402
Mother's wet hair can wrap
around the toe multiple times.

633
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,321
When it dries, it tightens
and cuts off circulation.

634
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,655
My hair?

635
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,283
I... I showered
before nursing her.

636
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,785
Easy to miss, Mom.

637
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,495
But we caught it early,
so there won't be

638
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,829
any permanent damage to the toe.

639
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,247
Treatment, Dr. Mohan?

640
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,499
Uh, it's too tight for scissors.

641
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,000
- Do we have Nair?
- We do indeed.

642
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,336
Nair?
Like from the drugstore?

643
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,962
10 minutes,
should dissolve it right off

644
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,006
and stop the crying.

645
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,841
[baby crying]

646
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,218
Hey, you're okay.

647
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,677
- [indistinct shouting]
- What's up?

648
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,012
We're gonna give
the wild one a shot.

649
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,389
Have the order, meds on the way,

650
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,681
but we need bodies.

651
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,058
I call the head.

652
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,559
- I got kicked last time.
- Right arm.

653
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,144
- Left arm.
- Right leg.

654
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,896
- Need one more.
- Uh, two more.

655
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,523
I'm just here to observe
and speak with the patient

656
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,358
- once he's under control.
- Oh.

657
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,859
Hey, Robby!

658
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,861
Can... can you help us
with Mr. Krakozhia?

659
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,239
- No.
- Coward!

660
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,075
Whitaker...
just the man we need.

661
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,535
Come over here, please.

662
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,120
Whoa, what did I miss?

663
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,955
A little drama
from a tension pneumo.

664
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,331
You could have called me.

665
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,208
- We got it under control.
- Good.

666
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,669
And Dr. Santos learned
what can happen

667
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,338
when you put a patient
with a small pneumothorax

668
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,340
- on BiPAP.
- Ah.

669
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,883
Thumb scalpel.

670
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,718
He was hypoxic.
I thought it would help.

671
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,387
But you didn't discuss it
with me,

672
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,056
and he almost died.
Dilator.

673
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,643
You need to run every order by
a senior resident or attending.

674
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,061
That's why it's
a four-year program.

675
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,230
Now, when you do this procedure,

676
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,900
you want to make sure to never,
ever lose this guidewire.

677
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,736
That gets sucked in the chest,
you're screwed.

678
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,405
Now, ready for the pigtail.

679
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,075
What the hell are you doing?

680
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,077
Pneumo is tiny.
It'll resolve spontaneously.

681
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,538
Yeah, it was tiny until
the patient went on BiPAP.

682
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,956
Are you fucking kidding me?

683
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,249
Guidewire out.

684
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,542
His sats were down.

685
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,751
I... I gave the order.

686
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,588
Without clearing it with me.

687
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,715
Honest mistake from the rookie.

688
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,633
That's how we learn.

689
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,889
If she knew everything,
she'd be your attending,

690
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,266
not an intern.

691
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,934
That is very true.

692
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,269
Besides, it could
have happened on its own

693
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,021
without the BiPAP.

694
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,023
Wow.
Beautiful moment.

695
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,608
A lot of love in the room.

696
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,443
If you'll excuse me.

697
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,195
Nice save.

698
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,283
It's Wheeler.

699
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,285
Dr. Abbot said
to come back at 6:30,

700
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,288
and he'd still be here,
but we overslept.

701
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,081
I forgot to charge my phone.

702
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,416
I'm really sorry.

703
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,043
Okay, let's see.

704
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,669
Wheeler, Kristin?

705
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,296
It... it's Kristi, and...

706
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,964
and I'm her mom.

707
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,925
Dr. Abbot went off duty
at 7:00,

708
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,259
but that's no problem.

709
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,636
We'll get you back.

710
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,970
Have a seat until
we call your name.

711
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,472
- Okay.
- Thank you.

712
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,640
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

713
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,142
Next.

714
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,144
[man coughing]

715
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,272
[indistinct chatter]

716
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,317
- How you guys doing?
- Good, thanks.

717
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,819
We missed our appointment,
but otherwise, we're fine.

718
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,947
Oh, no.
[chuckles]

719
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,490
Have you been here long?

720
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,492
I've been here about four hours.

721
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,910
Oh.

722
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,161
We were here two nights ago.

723
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,621
We waited seven hours.

724
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,830
Hmm.

725
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,624
It's all bullshit.

726
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,335
Can't believe somebody
hasn't died out here.

727
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,173
[sighs]

728
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,927
How we doing?

729
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,304
- No change.
- [raspy breathing]

730
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,265
I... I've been doing
all the talking.

731
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,475
Do you want to...

732
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,269
say some things?

733
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,358
What is there to say?

734
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,484
I'm sad.

735
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,194
I'm angry.

736
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,238
I don't want him to go.

737
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,865
There's so much that
I wish were different.

738
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,076
- [raspy breathing]
- It's not fair.

739
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,373
Tell him.

740
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,916
I am telling him.

741
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,377
I'm telling both of you.

742
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,462
It's not fair.

743
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,925
I wanted what you had.

744
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,803
[rasping]

745
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,974
I love you, Dad.

746
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:46,688
And I'm thankful for everything
you did to provide for us.

747
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,817
But you weren't the dad
I wanted, because I didn't...

748
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,572
I didn't play baseball
or build models or fish.

749
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,035
My friends' dads all
had grown-up jobs.

750
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,163
They didn't tell silly jokes
or talk in character voices

751
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,082
or make up stories.

752
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,546
I was embarrassed, and I...

753
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,257
I didn't want my
friends to meet you.

754
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,885
- Helen.
- It's true.

755
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,973
I'm ashamed to admit it,
but it's true.

756
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,894
I left for college, and I...

757
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,480
I stayed away.

758
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,654
[crying]
I could have gone fishing.

759
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,531
I should have gone fishing.

760
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,079
And I'm... I'm curious now.

761
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,462
And I forgive you, Dad,
for not being the man

762
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,047
that I wanted you to be.

763
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,382
But I am...

764
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,385
I am so grateful
that you weren't.

765
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:03,139
The world needed you
to be exactly as you are.

766
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,475
It got... it got serious, and...

767
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,102
and it turned ugly.

768
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:11,147
And you and your friends built

769
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,651
the Neighborhood
of Make-Believe.

770
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,988
What an incredible gift.

771
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,619
[sniffles]

772
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,705
Oh, Daddy.

773
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,333
I am so sorry.

774
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,170
Please, please forgive me.

775
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,047
[sniffles]

776
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,758
[crying]

777
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,225
[whispering]
Come find me when it's time.

778
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,480
[Krakozhia shouting]

779
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,815
No news chopper coverage.

780
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,191
No eye in the sky.

781
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,317
Not even a damn drone.

782
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,360
No mystery here.

783
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,987
The cop said east on 376.

784
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,155
They're headed to Swissvale.

785
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,489
I have a cousin in Swissvale.

786
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,032
Says it's crazy.

787
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,659
Fellas, they are not
going to Swissvale.

788
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,661
They're crossing the line.
Canada, baby.

789
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,038
That's the other way, genius.
See, I'm taking all your money.

790
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,206
- No, you're not.
- You're taking his money.

791
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,541
You think so?

792
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,876
I'm breaking up
this sewing circle.

793
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,502
Antoine, you're supposed
to be in triage.

794
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,837
Dennison needs a knee
immobilizer and crutches.

795
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,547
Go on.

796
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,215
Paolo, take postural vitals
on Thorpe in North 5,

797
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,885
and a repeat potassium draw
on Fontaine in South 18.

798
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,720
Larry, you're coming with me.

799
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,221
Okay, we have a quorum.

800
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,015
- Meds finally here?
- Yep.

801
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,892
- Guy's got some energy.
- Let's do this.

802
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,393
Donahue, right leg.
Larry, left leg.

803
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,770
Kim, right arm.

804
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,354
I call left arm.
Perlah takes the head.

805
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,898
And our young man here
will inject. Clear?

806
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,357
- Yeah.
- Pulse ox?

807
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,901
- Right here.
- Good luck.

808
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,904
IM injection to
the mid-anterior left thigh.

809
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,405
Everybody ready?

810
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,532
Yo, Whitaker.

811
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,700
You play any ball?

812
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,327
What, football?

813
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,995
No, dodgeball.

814
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,330
Of course football.

815
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,873
Yeah, some peewee.

816
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,416
You know, I was actually
a pretty good kicker.

817
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,001
Not helpful.

818
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,377
Look, Larry and I are
gonna block for you.

819
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,754
Come in right behind us.

820
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,088
When we split
and go for his legs,

821
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,882
you go right up the middle.

822
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,258
- End zone, baby.
- Okay, yeah.

823
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,385
- Got it.
- Okay.

824
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,179
You ready?

825
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,933
One, two, three.
[Krakozhia shouting]

826
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,018
Okay, Mr. Krakozhia,
we're here to help you.

827
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,270
We're here to help you...
oh, God!

828
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,272
What do I do? Ahh!

829
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,399
- [shouting]
- Shit.

830
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,235
Ahh!

831
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,153
Oh.
[sighs]

832
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,321
That's it.

833
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,323
[sighs] Congrats, kid.

834
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,075
You just earned
your yellow wings.

835
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,827
Okay, midazolam will take
him down in a minute.

836
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,411
We'll monitor him for 20.

837
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,579
After that, the Haldol
will have kicked in.

838
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,164
Yeah, he's settling down now.

839
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,457
Do I really need to be here
for 20 minutes?

840
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,959
Why?
You got a date?

841
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,168
- I mean, I'm covered in...
- I'm kidding.

842
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,419
Thanks for your help.

843
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,963
[laughs]
Go get cleaned up.

844
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,506
Okay. Thanks, everyone.
Good work.

845
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,132
I know I don't need to say it,
but let's try

846
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,634
to stay on top of
Mr. Krakozhia's med schedule.

847
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,010
- Ugh.
- Sorry.

848
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,303
Yeah, thanks.

849
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,638
Can I help you get new scrubs?

850
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,474
Oh, no, it's good.
I'm gonna...

851
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,310
Uh, thank you for
the offer, though.

852
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,398
[grunting]

853
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,316
So, Tasha, you work
in a restaurant?

854
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,485
No, take it in two bites.

855
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,112
- Okay.
- Rotate your wrist.

856
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,989
Follow the curve of the needle.

857
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,284
Exit at 90 degrees,
same distance from the wound.

858
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,743
Good.

859
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,954
Yes, I'm the sommelier
at Altius.

860
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,456
Oh, Altius is supposed
to be amazing.

861
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,000
Sorry.
What... what is it you do?

862
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,335
I'm the sommelier,
the wine steward.

863
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,712
Ah.

864
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,171
We have the best cellar
in the city.

865
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,506
I don't mind bragging.

866
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,049
Ah, it sounds like a great gig.

867
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,342
Do you have to go
to school for that?

868
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,677
Oh, my.
Yeah.

869
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,970
Yeah, I have a degree.

870
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,221
- Mm, cool.
- Okay.

871
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,556
How's that?

872
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,807
Really good.

873
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,517
First tie is a surgeon's knot.

874
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,894
Wrap the suture twice.

875
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,312
Grab the short end.

876
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,563
Pull with just enough tension.

877
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,189
Bring the wound edges together.

878
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,901
Not too tight or she'll
have railroad tracks.

879
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,029
So, Tasha, what's your favorite
wine you've ever tasted...

880
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,864
or most expensive?

881
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,117
Same answer for both...

882
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,329
a 2011 Domaine
de la Romanée-Conti.

883
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,497
[chuckles]
Three more instrument ties.

884
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,041
Great.

885
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,460
Square knots, single wrap
around the needle driver.

886
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,961
Is that French?

887
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,296
As French as it gets,

888
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,714
- a burgundy.
- Ah.

889
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,299
And how much does that cost?

890
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,135
I sold that bottle for $18,000.

891
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,845
- [laughs]
- Not here.

892
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,138
That was in New York.

893
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,348
Are you kidding?

894
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,225
18 grand for a bottle of wine?

895
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,852
I mean, was it really that good?

896
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,562
Life changing.

897
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,731
And I know something
about life changing.

898
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,525
[chuckles] Maybe one day.

899
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,404
I'm still not old enough
to drink... legally.

900
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,741
That's a little scary.
[chuckles]

901
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,035
And I'm about 18 grand short
and a friend of Bill's,

902
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,705
so I'll have to take
your word for it too.

903
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,582
My only extravagance
these days is moisturizer.

904
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,460
[laughs] I hear you.

905
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,921
Jenna, I have some
people here to see you.

906
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,965
- Jenna, oh.
- Oh, my God.

907
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,424
Hi.

908
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,717
Oh, my God.
I'm glad you're okay.

909
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,260
I'm so sorry.

910
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,595
I have no idea how
this happened, I swear.

911
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,389
Is she, um...

912
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,099
Yes, she's cleared medically.
You may take her home.

913
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,101
Here's some discharge
instructions,

914
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,769
but no more pills unless they're

915
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,229
from a doctor or pharmacy.

916
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,855
Yeah. I won't.

917
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,273
We're giving you some
fentanyl test strips.

918
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,025
These work on pills and liquids.

919
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,027
And this is a Narcan spray.

920
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,446
Please, just keep it in
your purse just in case

921
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,115
if you're at a party,
and someone's out of it.

922
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,616
Yeah, thank you.

923
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,951
You realize how lucky you are?

924
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,119
Yes?

925
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,870
Yeah, I... I do.

926
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,794
Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, I just
spoke to nuclear medicine,

927
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,587
and they are ready to take Nick

928
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,965
for the cerebral perfusion
study test in a few minutes.

929
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,133
Can we stay with him?

930
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,634
Absolutely.

931
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,511
The test itself involves
radiation imaging,

932
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,179
so you'll have to wait
just outside the door.

933
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,472
But Dave will take you down.

934
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,849
I'll show you where you can be.

935
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,308
He'll also bring you back here.

936
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,019
The results take
about an hour or so,

937
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,147
and I'll come find you
when I get them.

938
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,649
And we'll take it from there.

939
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,942
Thank you, Doctor.

940
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,694
Okay.

941
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,949
So sorry to keep you waiting.

942
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,826
I'm Dr. Heather Collins.

943
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,620
You must be Kristi
and Lynette Wheeler?

944
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,955
- Yes.
- Yes.

945
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,623
We were supposed
to see Dr. Abbot.

946
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,792
Yes, Dr. Abbot is
an amazing physician,

947
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,295
but even he needs sleep
occasionally.

948
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,755
I guess I just got tired.

949
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,505
And I forgot to charge my phone,

950
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,300
- and we overslept.
- Mm.

951
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,260
I use an old-fashioned alarm
clock since med school.

952
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:15,594
Never fails.

953
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,679
That's what I have at home.

954
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,431
I just forgot to bring it.

955
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,141
Okay.

956
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,976
I see we're doing a medication
abortion today, correct?

957
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:24,603
Yep.

958
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,647
Well, since I didn't
initially assess you,

959
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,690
do you mind if I
ask a few questions?

960
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,025
Get up to speed?

961
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,360
No.

962
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,029
Thanks.

963
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,406
Is this your first pregnancy?

964
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,741
Yes.

965
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,367
And you're 17?

966
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,829
When did your last
menstrual cycle start?

967
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,748
Um, I'm not exactly sure.

968
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,375
End of June...

969
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,210
23rd maybe?

970
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:49,837
Any allergies to medication?

971
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,922
No.

972
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,380
Any surgeries in the past?

973
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:54,550
No.

974
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,469
I need to do another
quick ultrasound

975
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,513
to make sure everything
is okay for the medication.

976
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,389
Do you want to put on a gown

977
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,475
to make sure you don't get gel
all over your clothes?

978
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,893
Okay.

979
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,729
I'll be right back.

980
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,481
Thank you.

981
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,024
Joyce, our sickler,
is doing well

982
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,400
on the exchange transfusion.

983
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,819
Awaiting a telemetry bed.

984
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,403
Quinn, the midnight vaper,

985
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,572
is still in sinus
after cardioversion.

986
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,741
Uh, four hours of cardiac
monitoring starting now,

987
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,159
and you can discharge him.

988
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,369
Our Good Samaritan's hanging in,

989
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,079
stable vitals and neuro checks.

990
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,039
Yeah, I want to get
a repeat head CT in an hour,

991
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,749
rule out any increased bleeding.

992
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,751
And Mr. Gold was stool
positive for campylobacter,

993
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,545
has gone home on azithromycin.

994
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,421
Well, I hope he loads up
on water and electrolytes.

995
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,132
The guy filled up
half a dozen bedpans.

996
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,633
Must be a record.

997
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,426
Without sounding
like a broken record,

998
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,803
everything okay with you?

999
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,138
That's your third cup
before 11:00.

1000
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,556
Yeah, I'm not sleeping great.

1001
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,932
It's fucking with me
a little bit.

1002
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,809
But I've got four days off
next week.

1003
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,394
I think I'm gonna get out of
Dodge and head for the hills.

1004
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,937
I wish you would.
What'd Shakespeare say...

1005
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,438
"Physician, heal thyself"?

1006
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,232
What? Have you been
talking to Collins?

1007
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,775
Not Shakespeare.

1008
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,318
Luke, the disciple,

1009
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,070
who probably heard it
from Paul the Apostle.

1010
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,280
But what do I know?
I'm Jewish.

1011
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,906
It's not my book.

1012
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,032
Shakespeare had nothing
to do with it, though.

1013
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,450
Yeah.

1014
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,119
Maybe a little time off
would be good.

1015
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,412
Oh.
You have everything?

1016
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,205
Yeah, I think so.

1017
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,957
[sighs]

1018
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,796
[indistinct chatter]

1019
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,967
Is that...

1020
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,594
Yeah.

1021
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,388
Let's go, sweetheart.

1022
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,975
Wait.
Um, Mr. Bradley?

1023
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,644
I just wanted to apologize
for the way I spoke to you.

1024
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,854
Please wait. Please.

1025
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,772
There's no excuse.

1026
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,441
I was gonna ask a nurse
to give you this,

1027
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,611
but it's my number and email.

1028
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:41,199
If I can ever be of any help
in any way, please.

1029
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,451
I don't know who you are.

1030
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,660
- Oh.
- Oh.

1031
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,038
I'm sorry.
I'm Jenna.

1032
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,084
I met Nick at orientation,
and he was really sweet.

1033
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,881
We were in the same econ class,

1034
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,799
and we had this really
big test coming up.

1035
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,344
So some of us made this
kind of study group.

1036
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,639
And we'd stay up way
too late drinking coffee

1037
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,849
and then have a really
hard time falling asleep.

1038
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,685
And one girl said

1039
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,813
she knew how to get Xanax,

1040
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,192
but was too afraid
to go pick it up.

1041
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,737
Nick was just being nice
when he said he'd do it.

1042
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,701
I am so sorry.

1043
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,703
I really hope
he pulls through this.

1044
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,539
I'm praying he pulls
through this.

1045
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,875
He will.

1046
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,335
Uh, yeah.

1047
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,795
Thank you.

1048
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,548
You should go.

1049
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,260
I'm sure your parents
want to take you home.

1050
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,894
All right.
Come on.

1051
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,437
[clears throat]

1052
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,856
Sorry about earlier.

1053
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,776
I think I still have
a lot to learn.

1054
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,403
You do.

1055
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,073
Looks good.

1056
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,574
Nice job, Doc.

1057
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,493
Thank you for the trust.

1058
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,161
Now keep it clean and dry,

1059
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,913
and we'll see you for
a wound check in two days.

1060
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,873
You did great.
I didn't feel a thing.

1061
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,667
Sutures out in a week,
but come back sooner

1062
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,252
for any redness,
fever, or drainage.

1063
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,586
- Okay?
- Okay.

1064
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,547
Thank you.

1065
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,257
Um, I couldn't help but notice.

1066
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,676
There's a misgendering error
on your chart.

1067
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,052
I'm really sorry about that.

1068
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,429
I've gone ahead
and fixed it here

1069
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,763
and on your insurance data file,

1070
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,599
but it shouldn't happen again.

1071
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,101
Wow.

1072
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,770
I am...

1073
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,272
Thank you.

1074
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,440
Truly.

1075
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,733
Thank you both.

1076
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,484
Yeah, of course.

1077
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,155
That was cool.

1078
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,281
Didn't think to check that.

1079
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,283
Good catch.

1080
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,243
Oh, any other medications?

1081
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:53,122
The only medicine is Tylenol,
and she has no allergies.

1082
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,498
Hi, I'm Dr. Mohan.

1083
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,417
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

1084
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,085
Oh, let me catch her up.

1085
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,421
Jia Yi is a 12-year-old
with six weeks

1086
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,590
of constant pain
in the suprapubic area.

1087
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,176
There's no fever, no dysuria,

1088
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,303
no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

1089
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,804
no vaginal discharge.

1090
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,973
And the urine pregnancy test
is negative.

1091
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,725
A... a pregnancy test?

1092
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,268
Of course it's negative.

1093
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,936
She has a stomachache.

1094
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,813
Tell me a little bit
more about your pain.

1095
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,399
Can you give me a number from
1 to 10, 10 being the worst?

1096
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,069
It was like a two
the first few weeks.

1097
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,278
Then it went up to a five.

1098
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,989
Now it's worse, like a seven.

1099
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,824
And when was your
last menstrual period?

1100
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,326
- Haven't had it.
- This month?

1101
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,994
No, never.

1102
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,580
A few of my friends got theirs.
I'm still waiting.

1103
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,791
She's only 12.

1104
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,876
Okay.
We'll be back for an exam.

1105
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,754
Why don't you change into
a gown open in the back?

1106
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,716
It's weird.

1107
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,177
I mean, no period,

1108
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,347
but she has early secondary
sexual characteristics...

1109
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,725
you know, breast development,
widening hips.

1110
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,811
Yeah, it's primary amenorrhea.

1111
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,187
What are you thinking?

1112
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,314
Could be a pituitary
dysfunction or...

1113
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,690
Okay, how are we doing?

1114
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,317
Are we moving
anybody out of here?

1115
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,902
We're trying.
Asthma cleared after two nebs,

1116
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,237
went home with steroids
and albuterol.

1117
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,696
I like that.
Who else?

1118
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,532
Uh...

1119
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,700
Hire scabs that don't know
zip ties from airline cable?

1120
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,286
[scoffs]
Fuck around and find out.

1121
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,871
Come Monday,
that promoter is gonna have

1122
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,456
my lawyer's shoe
so far up his ass,

1123
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,999
he's gonna be flossing
with the laces.

1124
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,209
How are we doing in here?

1125
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,460
Vitals are perfect.

1126
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,171
Satting 98 on 4 liters.

1127
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,381
Nice.

1128
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,007
So I can go back to work now?

1129
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,384
With six rib fractures,
a bruised lung,

1130
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,510
and a catheter in your chest?

1131
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,803
Not the best idea.

1132
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,471
But I do respect the work ethic.

1133
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,890
[exhales] Ritchie,
get Cecil on FaceTime again.

1134
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,392
I need to see this shit myself.

1135
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,726
Do me a favor.

1136
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,520
Call Dr. Gregorian
in thoracic

1137
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,938
and see if he'll take Stone
as a personal favor to me,

1138
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,440
and make sure he knows
he doesn't need

1139
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,941
any real babysitting.
He's stable.

1140
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,568
- We just need a bed.
- Copy that.

1141
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,237
Projectile vomiting is
better with ondansetron.

1142
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,239
Labs normal,
awaiting a PO challenge.

1143
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,574
What about Minu, the fall lady?

1144
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,950
Antibiotics on board, pain free,

1145
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,452
on the OR schedule at 3:00 p.m.

1146
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,744
We parked her in the hall
for a few hours.

1147
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,121
Okay, good.

1148
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,915
A little jelly on the belly.

1149
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,208
Sorry.

1150
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,710
It's cold.

1151
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,422
And just to be sure,
you're not being

1152
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:10,092
treated for any blood clots,
taking any anticoagulants?

1153
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,969
No, I don't take any medicines.

1154
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,931
[beeps]

1155
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,775
Is everything okay?

1156
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,277
Yeah.

1157
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,196
There it is. There it is.

1158
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,864
Chopper 7, I knew
you wouldn't let me down.

1159
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,115
Here we go.

1160
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,617
Wait, where is it?

1161
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,076
Well, it sure as shit
ain't Swissvale.

1162
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,453
- Hmm.
- They're out in Monroeville...

1163
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,787
- Mm-hmm.
- Trailing PPD.

1164
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,289
What are they doing out there?

1165
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,624
They're driving till
the wheels fall off.

1166
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,501
And it's almost
outside our catch.

1167
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,920
I got $10 that say they don't
make it to the county line.

1168
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,338
- They coming back.
- I don't know.

1169
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,964
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll take that.

1170
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,591
They're Westmoreland's
problem now.

1171
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,800
- Mm.
- Yep.

1172
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,010
- Uh-oh.
- It's on the news?

1173
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,261
[clears throat] Yes, ma'am.

1174
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,804
Where are they?

1175
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,640
They're headed east
toward Monroeville.

1176
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,558
Let me see.

1177
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,482
[static buzzing]

1178
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,152
Give me $20 on junkies,
caught, outside our zone.

1179
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,029
Well, damn.

1180
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,615
- [laughing]
- All right.

1181
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,829
- Soft, non-tender.
- Okay.

1182
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,998
Jia Yi, we're going
to check below the waist.

1183
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,792
You'll be all covered up.
Would you like Dad to stay?

1184
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,669
Yes, please.
Don't go.

1185
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,004
Okay, I'm here.
I'm here.

1186
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,800
All right, knees up,
but keep your feet on the bed.

1187
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,469
And let the knees flop apart.

1188
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,763
We're just gonna take
a quick look.

1189
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,476
You'll feel me
touch your upper leg

1190
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,353
so we can see where you pee.

1191
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,729
Any pain?

1192
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,648
No, it's okay.

1193
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,986
Okay.

1194
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,654
You can put your legs back down.

1195
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,990
You did great, and we know
how we can help you.

1196
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,366
Thank you.

1197
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,743
Dad, can we step out
for a minute?

1198
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,915
Yay. Good job.

1199
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,004
What's... what's wrong
with her?

1200
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,547
Her mother died of colon cancer.

1201
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,923
Is it...

1202
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,883
No, that has nothing
to do with this.

1203
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,386
Do you know what a hymen is?

1204
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,180
I... not really.

1205
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,725
When the baby is
developing in the womb,

1206
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,351
there's a membrane
called the hymen

1207
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,145
which blocks
the vaginal passage.

1208
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,896
Before birth,
most of it goes away,

1209
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,566
but sometimes it doesn't.

1210
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,735
- Is that dangerous?
- No, not at all.

1211
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,403
The good news is
that your daughter

1212
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,239
has an imperforate hymen
totally blocking the vagina.

1213
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,200
We saw what looks to be
about three months of

1214
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,662
violaceous menstrual blood
bulging from behind it.

1215
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,039
Oh, my God.

1216
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,750
It's totally curable
and an easy fix.

1217
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,209
Your daughter needs
minor surgery

1218
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,753
best done under anesthesia

1219
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,921
in an operating room
by a gynecologist.

1220
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,965
Then she'll be okay?

1221
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,426
Yes, totally back to normal.

1222
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,596
Thank you.

1223
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,389
We, uh...

1224
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,310
we lost Jia Yi's mother
when Jia Yi was six.

1225
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:11,273
And I do my best
to fill her place.

1226
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,692
But as she gets older...

1227
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,571
Her mother would have
known what to do.

1228
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,908
I'm sure you do great.
She's going to be fine.

1229
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,328
Thank you.

1230
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,123
[sighs]

1231
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,792
We should let her know.

1232
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,461
I'll do the talking this time.

1233
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,924
Housekeeping is
turning over South 20.

1234
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,258
Damn, we're good.

1235
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,426
What's it like
when I'm not here?

1236
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,969
I hate to break it to you,

1237
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,471
but I run a tight ship
with or without you.

1238
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,722
More fun with me, though, right?

1239
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,474
- Jokes are better.
- Always.

1240
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,810
But your tell is
the hairier it gets,

1241
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,979
the funnier you get,
and you are on fire today.

1242
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,941
Dr. Robby, it's time.

1243
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,991
Hey.

1244
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,828
[raspy breathing]

1245
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,914
[sighs]

1246
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,837
Is he still with us?

1247
