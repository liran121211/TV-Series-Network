1
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,469
You sent labs?

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,804
No indication.

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,139
Normal vitals,
normal neuro exam.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,807
Dude just dropped... no warning.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,268
- What's open?
- Trauma 1.

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,979
Grab Langdon
or whoever else is avail.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,440
[tense music]

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,774
What have we got?

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,318
Seizure in chairs.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,444
Thank you.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,778
How is it out there?

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,157
Chaos.
We're never gonna catch up.

13
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,326
Lorazepam's on board.

14
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,120
Okay, draw up another 4.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,539
Yeah, no history.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,666
Doesn't look like
he's been here before.

17
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,168
Satting low 90s on 5 liters.

18
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,711
Another 4 milligrams.

19
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:49,380
I can't get the top off.

20
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,341
It's... it's just the plastic,
not the metal.

21
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,800
No, I know.
I know, I know.

22
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:53,843
Here, give it to me.

23
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,178
No, I got it.

24
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,013
- Okay.
- [monitors beeping rapidly]

25
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,349
Ordering CBC, CMP,

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,851
and a straight cath
for a urine tox.

27
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:05,313
All right.
Pushing the second 4.

28
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:07,190
If this doesn't work,
we need to prep Keppra.

29
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,150
No, we'll give more lorazepam.

30
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,443
It's already ordered.

31
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,028
He's already had 8 milligrams.

32
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,529
- He'll stop breathing.
- Then we'll intubate.

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,198
Sometimes a patient
needs a little more.

34
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,367
- How long has he been seizing?
- About four minutes ago.

35
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,868
He started seizing in chairs.

36
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,662
He's already had 8 of lorazepam.

37
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,081
I want to move on to Keppra,
but Dr. Langdon disagrees.

38
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,166
I just want us to try another
2 milligrams before moving on.

39
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,127
Dr. Langdon's patient,
Dr. Langdon's call.

40
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:31,215
[gurney thudding]

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,052
Dennis Whitaker,
meet Bob Chazen,

42
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:38,638
a 53-year-old cyclist
who injured his leg

43
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,890
about ten days ago
on a trip to Utah.

44
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:43,726
I was in Moab,
coming downhill fast,

45
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:46,521
and jammed my pedal into my leg.

46
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:47,772
Ooh, ouch.

47
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,732
That's some gnarly road rash.

48
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,566
White Rim Trail.

49
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:54,069
I've been putting Neosporin
on it a couple times a day,

50
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,697
but now it hurts to walk.

51
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,240
What do you see, Whitaker?

52
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:00,993
Um, outside of the
wound looks cellulitic.

53
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:02,160
What's that?

54
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,704
It's a bacterial infection.

55
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:05,747
We'll need to get you
on oral antibiotics.

56
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:07,207
Figured.

57
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,500
What about the center
of the wound?

58
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:12,087
Uh, it's a simple hematoma.

59
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:14,256
Which you can now debride.

60
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:15,799
Whitaker will take off the
dead skin covering the blister

61
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,092
to help it heal better.

62
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,593
I'll be right back.

63
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,429
Yeah, uh, quick question.

64
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,306
Get some Iris scissors,
toothed forceps, sterile gauze.

65
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:24,266
No, it's just, um...

66
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,977
[sighs]

67
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,770
Blister guy? Really?

68
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,522
Mr. Chazen was
the next patient on deck.

69
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:32,024
I know I screwed up earlier.

70
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,108
You didn't screw up.

71
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,609
The patient died.

72
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,111
It happens.

73
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:39,574
Just don't amputate
Mr. Chazen's leg.

74
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,579
Okay. Hey.

75
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,080
Another 2 of lorazepam.

76
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,458
- For a total of 10.
- I'm well aware.

77
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,002
He's still seizing. [sighs]

78
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:53,253
Call respiratory.

79
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,463
I'm setting up an
intubation tray.

80
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:55,963
Which we won't need.

81
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,590
Dr. Santos,
what is the definition

82
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,258
of status epilepticus?

83
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,135
A seizure lasting
more than five minutes

84
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,470
or at least two seizures

85
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,804
without full recovery
in between.

86
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:06,599
- Excellent.
- [patient rasping softly]

87
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,100
Seizure activity has stopped.

88
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,935
Also excellent.

89
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:13,481
Spontaneous breathing,
good tidal volume.

90
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:15,316
Sats up to 98.

91
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:16,984
Welcome back, Mr. Marino.

92
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,820
Now we can do a Keppra load
slowly and safely.

93
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,489
Nice work, Dr. Langdon.

94
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,699
I will be at Central
if you need me.

95
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,159
This must have been a bad vial.

96
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,869
8 milligrams should have worked.

97
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,454
According to your textbook
of emergency medicine.

98
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:29,705
But sometimes they
need a little bit more.

99
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,082
You'll learn that with time.

100
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,291
Well, why couldn't
I open the vial?

101
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:34,085
Because you're an intern

102
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,128
who also needs to learn
to trust her senior resident,

103
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,423
especially in front
of an attending.

104
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,801
Now check his labs,

105
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,677
babysit him until he goes to CT,

106
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:46,680
and get some blankets
on these side rails

107
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:48,391
as a seizure precaution.

108
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,059
[monitor beeping]

109
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,686
[door clicks]

110
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,401
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Oh, no.

111
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,527
Skin's dead.
You won't feel a thing.

112
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:01,903
First time in Moab?

113
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:03,279
No, no.

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,324
I belong to a club,
Gears and Beers.

115
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:09,369
We started riding to Frick Park
during the pandemic...

116
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,788
you know, just something
to do to get out of the house.

117
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,708
But we all stuck with it,
and now we go on biking trips.

118
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,461
Huh.

119
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:20,755
Ahh! Ahh!

120
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:21,923
Oh! Whoa, oh!

121
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:23,174
Help!
Do something, man!

122
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,175
- Um...
- Oh!

123
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:25,176
- Uh...
- Dude!

124
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:26,344
Oh, ow!

125
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:27,429
I need a little help here!

126
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,430
Jesus!

127
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:30,932
[grunting]

128
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,559
Hey. What's up?

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,727
Arterial pumper
under a blood blister.

130
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:36,354
- Let's see.
- Oh.

131
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,231
- Jesus!
- Oh, God.

132
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:39,732
Noob.

133
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,860
Hi, I'm Dr. King.
Um, we can fix this.

134
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,028
- Did you cut an artery?
- No, no.

135
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,905
I-I punctured the top
of the blood blister,

136
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,490
but there was an artery
hiding under there.

137
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,950
Hiding?

138
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:50,785
Like... like you didn't
know it was there?

139
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:53,204
Don't you have to know basic
anatomy to become a doctor?

140
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,456
He's a student doctor.

141
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:56,207
What the fuck?

142
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,459
Student?

143
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,043
Oh, hell, no.
No, no, no.

144
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,295
Can... can you help me?

145
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,255
- Can you fix it?
- Oh, absolutely.

146
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:05,674
First, we are going
to put this BP cuff on

147
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,092
to stop the bleeding.

148
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,343
A little forward.

149
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,721
There we go.

150
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:15,267
All right, you can let go.

151
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,394
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,688
- Thank God.
- Oh, thank God.

153
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,649
All right, Whitaker, 10 ccs
of 1% lidocaine with epi.

154
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,067
Yep.

155
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:25,819
Uh, the shot is
gonna numb the area

156
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,113
and also constrict
any blood vessels

157
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,200
so that we can put
a little stitch in there.

158
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:34,661
What happened in here?

159
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:38,624
Uh, hidden laceration of
an arteriole under the vesicle.

160
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,959
Uh, bleeding stopped at 180
on the BP cuff,

161
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,212
and we are now injecting
lidocaine with epi.

162
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,755
Thank you, Dr. King.

163
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:47,049
Let's set up a suture tray
with 3-0 nylon.

164
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay. A pinprick
and some burning...

165
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,803
Doc, Doc, can you
step in here, please?

166
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,890
You got this, Whitaker.

167
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:58,852
That ambulance chase
is on live TV.

168
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,354
- What channel?
- Every channel.

169
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:01,939
Ooh, what do you think
the over-under

170
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,607
on clipped cars should be?

171
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:04,816
- both: 15.
- Mm!

172
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,360
- Come on.
- [laughs]

173
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,986
Can I put it on the TVs
in the waiting room?

174
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:09,321
Fine by me.

175
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,488
I just hope wherever it ends up,

176
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,407
it's out of our catchment zone.

177
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:17,286
Got a second?

178
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,247
It's never a second, but shoot.

179
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,749
I think there was an issue
with a vial of lorazepam used

180
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,501
on our last patient
and it should be reported

181
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:24,835
to the drug manufacturer.

182
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:26,337
What kind of issue?

183
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:28,339
The cap was really hard
to take off,

184
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,550
almost like it was
super-sealed shut.

185
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,176
I'm worried it could be
a bigger issue.

186
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:33,970
Like?

187
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:36,055
Like maybe
the temperature wasn't

188
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:37,932
properly controlled
during transportation

189
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:40,309
and the seal on the vial
melted shut,

190
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,019
which could mean the medication
is compromised.

191
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,522
Any other vials affected?

192
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:47,775
Uh, just this one.

193
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,277
Okay.

194
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:50,945
Check the manufacturer's
website,

195
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:52,697
see if there's been
a recall of the lot number.

196
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,907
And what if this is
the first irregular vial?

197
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,242
Then hold on to the vial in case

198
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:58,035
there are any other issues.

199
00:06:58,036 --> 00:06:59,870
Hey, look who's in the house!

200
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:01,581
Hey.

201
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:04,208
Jake the Snake!
It's 11:00 a.m.

202
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,710
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

203
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:06,752
Mom let me ditch for Pittfest.

204
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,087
How's your mama?

205
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:10,047
Oh, she's restoring some house

206
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:11,674
in Squirrel Hill, so, you know,
she's pretty busy.

207
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,384
That's cool. You, uh...
you looking for Robby?

208
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:14,718
Yeah, he's got
our festival passes.

209
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:16,136
Oh, you going together?

210
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:17,804
We were supposed to,
but, you know,

211
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,807
- I decided to go with a friend.
- What's her name?

212
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,392
- Leah.
- Okay. Okay.

213
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:24,060
- Okay, okay.
- Don't hold out on us.

214
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,229
We need details.
Where'd you meet?

215
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,231
How long have you been together?

216
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:29,899
We met at junior
lifeguards this summer.

217
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,901
And we've been dating
for two months.

218
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,279
- Yeah, she's pretty great.
- That's sweet.

219
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,905
I'm happy for you, kiddo.

220
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:38,575
I'm gonna go find Robby,
let him know you're here.

221
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,577
Hey.

222
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:42,996
A little advice, man-to-man...

223
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:45,206
always compliment her outfit,

224
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:48,752
hold her hand
in front of your friends,

225
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:51,046
and always wrap it
before you tap it.

226
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,673
[laughs] Okay.

227
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,884
Slowly letting down
the cuff pressure

228
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:58,637
until we can identify
the exact spot.

229
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,263
Oh, I see it.
I see it.

230
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:01,598
Right... right there.

231
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,224
Okay.

232
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:04,976
Now you can place
a figure-of-eight suture.

233
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:06,896
Uh, I've never done
one of those before.

234
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,398
Look, maybe you
should just do it.

235
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,025
You should definitely do it.

236
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,443
Whitaker's got this.

237
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,445
It's easy,
just two stitches in one.

238
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,781
Take a big bite,
a simple interrupted suture

239
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:19,032
anterior to the bleeder.

240
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,492
Okay.

241
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:24,371
Okay.

242
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,213
Now instead of tying,
throw another one posterior.

243
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,632
Looks good.

244
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:38,300
Now a normal tie
for a figure-of-eight.

245
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:40,636
What did I miss in here?

246
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:42,346
I am so sorry.
I-I just...

247
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,640
Made an excellent catch
and saved Mr. Chazen's life.

248
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,266
- Really?
- Really?

249
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,476
Really?

250
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:48,936
There was a cut arteriole

251
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:50,604
under a ballotable vesicle.

252
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:52,523
If Mr. Chazen had gone home
without debridement,

253
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:55,359
the blister could have eroded
with uncontrollable hemorrhage.

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,319
Nice work.

255
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,656
Jackson Pollock here might want
to go hit the scrubs exchange.

256
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,283
Yeah.

257
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,538
[indistinct chatter]

258
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,458
[scoffs]

259
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,754
[baby crying]

260
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,256
All right.

261
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,967
Next up is an ingrown toenail.

262
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,677
It should be pretty quick, though.

263
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:24,429
And... ah.

264
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,347
Sherry, you're back.

265
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:27,849
The kids get to school okay?

266
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,559
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Hey, cool.

267
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,144
Well, come with me,

268
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,812
and we'll finish up
your wound care, okay?

269
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,856
Earl, what are you
doing out here?

270
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,524
I'm hungry.

271
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:37,900
Head back inside,
and we'll get you a sandwich.

272
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:40,361
- No egg salad.
- Sure. Come on.

273
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:41,904
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

274
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,364
I've been here
for over five hours,

275
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,032
okay, way longer
than that chick.

276
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,868
Can you check the list?
Driscoll?

277
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,620
Doug Driscoll.

278
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,206
E-everybody is seen
as quickly as possible

279
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,500
and in order
of medical care needed.

280
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:55,877
Unless they die waiting.

281
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,336
Would you look at that,
Mr. Driscoll?

282
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:58,546
It's actually time
to bring you back.

283
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,881
Thank God.

284
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,215
Would you take care
of Mr. Driscoll?

285
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,050
- Yeah, absolutely.
- [chuckles]

286
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,470
Sherry, you're with me.

287
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,221
Oh, yeah.

288
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:09,099
Yeah, let's take care of this.

289
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,231
Hey, I need a minute.

290
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:20,318
I already put $20
on disgruntled ex-EMT

291
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,236
caught outside of our catchment.

292
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,697
And I will gladly take your
money when that mess is over,

293
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:26,532
but this is about a patient.

294
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,868
Kristi Wheeler,
17 years old, pregnant.

295
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:31,244
These are Abbot's fetal
measurements from yesterday,

296
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,914
and these are mine.

297
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,916
10-5 and 11-2.

298
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,460
Well, ultrasound is an art,
not a science.

299
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,962
Even in the very best hands,
the EGA differential can be

300
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,923
within three to five days
in the first trimester.

301
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,466
Definitely room for error.

302
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,092
Not if you're here
for a medication abortion

303
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:48,720
and you're past
the mandated 11-week cutoff.

304
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:51,973
[sighs] There can also be
inter-operator variability.

305
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:54,142
I measured
the gestational sac, 11-3,

306
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,603
and the biparietal diameter,
11-1.

307
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:58,814
I didn't get a single
measurement under 11 weeks.

308
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,565
So what are you saying,

309
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,484
that Abbot lowballed his
measurements to help a teen

310
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:05,362
get the abortion that she wants?

311
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,531
[sighs] Maybe.

312
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,949
Well, then you've
got two choices.

313
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,367
You can go with
Abbot's measurements,

314
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,244
or you can redo
your measurements,

315
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:14,788
go back in, and pick an angle
that shows 11 weeks or less.

316
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,206
Please tell me you're joking.

317
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,958
You were ready
to roll up your sleeves

318
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,459
and arm-wrestle the Ethics
Committee a couple hours ago

319
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,127
to override
Mr. Spencer's children.

320
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,713
- What changed?
- Apples and oranges.

321
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:25,715
There was a clear,
bright line that Mr. Spencer

322
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,592
was never going to make it.

323
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:30,470
Falsifying medical records
for Kristi is flat-out illegal.

324
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,764
She's 17.
She deserves a life.

325
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,431
Of course she does.

326
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,934
But I will not jeopardize
my future in the process.

327
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:39,144
- You'll be fine.
- [scoffs]

328
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,523
Someone finds out
I falsified medical records,

329
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:44,483
I'll get booted
from the residency program.

330
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,151
You've got tenure.

331
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:49,989
Worst case, you have
to take a job in Youngstown.

332
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,827
The risks are not the same
for you as they are for me.

333
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:58,330
You're right.

334
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:00,207
I'll do it.

335
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,876
- What?
- Erase your history, physical,

336
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:03,335
and impression
from Kristi's chart.

337
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,503
It'll be like you never
saw the patient.

338
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,171
I will take over.

339
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:07,798
I will complete a new chart
and upload my own image.

340
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,341
Robby, I'm not asking you to...

341
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,759
As your attending,
it is my decision.

342
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,344
I am a certified provider
for Mifepristone.

343
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:13,846
You are not.

344
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,514
And as a prudent physician,
I should examine

345
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:16,765
every patient before
I order medication...

346
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,267
- Robby.
- Yeah.

347
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:20,185
- Jake's here.
- Hey. Great.

348
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,146
Uh, any word back
on Nick Bradley's

349
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:23,772
- perfusion study results?
- Still waiting.

350
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:25,316
Will you come find me
when the imaging's back?

351
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:28,110
These people have already
been through enough.

352
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:30,988
- Is that Mr. Spencer?
- Yeah.

353
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,490
- Robby?
- Excuse me for one second.

354
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,034
I want to go see if I can find
Mr. Spencer's children

355
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:36,410
before they leave.

356
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:38,370
You look a little peaked.
You okay?

357
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,330
I just need
a good night's sleep.

358
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,040
I'm gonna grab you
a grilled cheese

359
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,374
before the noon lunch rush;
it'll help some color

360
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,084
- back to your cheeks.
- Thank you.

361
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:46,462
I got you.

362
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:50,548
Uh, can someone please help?

363
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:51,841
It's my mother.

364
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,051
She fell.

365
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,510
What happened?

366
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:55,887
I fell in the yard.

367
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,222
I hurt my arm.
That's all.

368
00:12:58,223 --> 00:13:00,099
Yo, we've been hugging
this wall for almost an hour.

369
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,018
Relax. We're just gonna
take her vitals.

370
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,561
Oh, Mom,
you've got cuts all over.

371
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:05,605
I fell in the rose bush.

372
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,691
I'll be fine.

373
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:13,154
I'm Dr. King.
This is Perlah.

374
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,239
- What's your name?
- Ginger Kitajima.

375
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,367
Uh, I'm her daughter, Rita.

376
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:18,910
Ginger, did you hit your head?

377
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,244
No.

378
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:21,913
Any chance she
could have fainted?

379
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,415
- I told you. I tripped.
- I don't know.

380
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,417
I was taking a shower,
and she went outside.

381
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,878
She's not supposed to go
outside anywhere without me.

382
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,506
[sighs] She needs 24-7
assistance with ADLs.

383
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:32,882
Are you the primary caregiver?

384
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,093
I'm her only caregiver.

385
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:37,887
Ma'am, what medications
are you on?

386
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:40,556
Oh, uh, just one.

387
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:42,266
Risperidone.

388
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,977
My mom has schizophrenia.

389
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,395
BP 132 over 78.

390
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:47,938
Pulse 84.
Sats 98.

391
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,606
I haven't seen this
young lady around before.

392
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:50,983
Somebody new?

393
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,901
Flattery will
get you everywhere.

394
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:55,153
Ground-level fall.
Good vitals.

395
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:56,613
No head trauma, no AMS,

396
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:58,323
and just an isolated
shoulder injury.

397
00:13:58,324 --> 00:13:59,908
You have any pain in your belly?

398
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,451
No, but next time,

399
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:03,286
buy me dinner
before you do that.

400
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,621
[chuckles]

401
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,999
Okay, let's order
some basic labs

402
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,251
and get some pain meds on board.

403
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,627
And call me when
the X-rays are back.

404
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:12,129
Your mom's in very good hands.

405
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,422
You're leaving so soon?

406
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:15,132
Oh, I'm never far away.

407
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,758
I'll save a dance for you.

408
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,802
I'll be counting on it.

409
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:20,971
Looks like more
than just vitals to me.

410
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,889
That's it.
You're on the list, Harley.

411
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,725
Aw, shit. No.

412
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:26,309
Perlah, I'm sorry!

413
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,602
- I take it back!
- Too late!

414
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:29,146
You're on the list.

415
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:30,606
[sighs]

416
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:37,112
[sighs]

417
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:38,613
[machine whirring]

418
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:39,907
Mm.

419
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:43,202
[card reader beeps]

420
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:45,954
Okay.

421
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,957
[machine whirs, clicks]

422
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,294
What?

423
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,005
Oh.

424
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:01,135
I like big butts,
and I cannot lie.

425
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,344
Whoa. [laughs]

426
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:03,846
You scared me there.

427
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,639
Want a pony ride, big boy?

428
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,516
- What?
- Excuse me, Myrna.

429
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,018
I need to discuss
a confidential patient issue

430
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:10,227
with my colleague here.

431
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:11,562
We need a little privacy.

432
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,189
Catch you later, sweet cheeks.

433
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,940
Don't mind Myrna.
She's harmless.

434
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,150
She's handcuffed.

435
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:17,986
That's why she's harmless.

436
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:24,784
You gotta stay on top
of Ozzie's ear infection.

437
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,619
His meds are in the fridge.

438
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,370
Our dog has really bad
allergies.

439
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,955
[laughs]

440
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:31,874
And I changed Ruby's
food order to Monday.

441
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,876
[clears throat]
Bougie bitch.

442
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,711
- She only likes the good stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:37,213
Like mother, like daughter.

444
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:38,547
[laughter]

445
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:40,883
[coughing]

446
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:42,468
[both chuckle]

447
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:44,553
Nice to know you still
make each other laugh.

448
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,055
Make each other laugh.

449
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:48,141
Make each other
deliriously happy.

450
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:56,564
Sorry. Didn't mean to get
all mushy in front of you.

451
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,732
Are you kidding me?

452
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,734
You two are the sweetest.

453
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,570
I never got to see this kind of
love between a married couple.

454
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,365
Your parents weren't
the lovey-dovey type?

455
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:07,367
My dad died when I was 13.

456
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:08,409
Aw.

457
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,744
I'm so sorry.

458
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:11,246
Yeah, me too.

459
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,581
He's the reason why
I got into medicine

460
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:15,834
and the reason why
I'm conducting research

461
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:17,710
on racial disparity in the ER.

462
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,254
I'm doing
a retrospective chart review

463
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,589
on our past five years
of patients of color.

464
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,384
Is that how you knew
what was going on with me?

465
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:26,177
We don't treat sickle cell here

466
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:27,720
as well as they do
in other hospitals,

467
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,430
but I'm hoping to change that.

468
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,391
Status, Dr. Mohan?

469
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:33,768
Still on exchange transfusion
and high flow nasal oxygen,

470
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:35,103
but oxygen sats are dropping.

471
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:36,563
She's at 84.

472
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,773
- That's really low.
- Yes, it is.

473
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:40,942
The goal of
exchange transfusion is

474
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:44,112
to reduce the percentage of
sickle hemoglobin to under 30%.

475
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:45,530
That is not happening
at the rate

476
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,948
that your wife needs,
which is causing

477
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,658
your blood to be unable
to carry oxygen,

478
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:50,118
causing further
blocked blood cells.

479
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,996
- What does that mean?
- Dr. Mohan.

480
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:55,290
To prevent stroke
or heart attack,

481
00:16:55,291 --> 00:17:00,336
we need to get you more oxygen,
but we will need to intubate.

482
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:05,465
How long can we wait to see
if that's really necessary?

483
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,968
Acute chest syndrome
can progress very quickly.

484
00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:09,636
It is the most common
cause of death

485
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:10,971
for patients with sickle cell.

486
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:14,141
It is imperative
that we intubate.

487
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:15,934
I-I...[coughs]

488
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,645
I-I-I don't know.

489
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,731
Why don't we give you and Ondine

490
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:22,817
some privacy so you can talk?

491
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,323
Look, you want to be
their friend, but right now,

492
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,657
you need to be Joyce's doctor.

493
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:31,909
So get her to sign
the consent form

494
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,536
and prep for the intubation.

495
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:39,333
- 43, 44, 45...
- [breathing heavily]

496
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,418
- Whoa!
- 46, 47.

497
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,003
[laughs] Ugh.

498
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:44,421
You're not gonna beat my record.

499
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:45,839
Ohh.

500
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,799
How the hell did you
stay on for 80?

501
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,428
I'm 17,
and I'm more fit than you.

502
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,848
That kid looks my age.

503
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,391
Yeah, he is.

504
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:58,560
What happened to him?

505
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,896
Stressed-out 18-year-old took
some pills off the internet

506
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:02,522
to help him sleep.

507
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:04,982
They were laced with fentanyl.

508
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,361
- Is he gonna make it?
- Mm.

509
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,411
[snickering]

510
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:19,038
Poor Huckleberry.

511
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,208
Not even 11:30 and you've
already been demoted.

512
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,543
They had only morgue scrubs
left in my size.

513
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:25,878
Then I guess you better not

514
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,673
fuck anything else up today, huh?

515
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,887
- Yo, Donahue.
- Yo.

516
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,847
You get in on that
ambulance-chase action?

517
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:40,142
Yeah, $20 on catch,
chop shop, out of our zone.

518
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:41,686
Bold.

519
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,562
I like it.

520
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:46,315
What can I do you for?

521
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:48,234
Hypothetical question...

522
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:50,319
would you ever go over
a resident's head

523
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,697
to the attending?

524
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,074
Hypothetically,
I wouldn't recommend it

525
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,576
unless it's a behavioral issue
or harassment.

526
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:00,579
And in that case, you can make
a confidential report to HR.

527
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,623
What if it's more
patient care related?

528
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:04,083
Depends.

529
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:05,626
If it's something minor,
leave it alone.

530
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,795
If it's something
that endangers the patient,

531
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,629
then definitely yes.

532
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,256
Pick your battles.

533
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:13,509
You don't want to be
the intern who cried wolf.

534
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,137
- Ahh!
- Yeah?

535
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:19,306
- Okay, still pretty raw.
- Yeah.

536
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,057
Let me put some more
anesthetic on there,

537
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,726
numb you up some more.

538
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:24,936
It's my own fault.

539
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:26,771
I should have known better
than to try to make

540
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:28,940
s'mores over a Sterno,

541
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:30,900
but they kept asking.

542
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:33,069
Yeah.
The things we do for our kids.

543
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,362
Yeah.

544
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:36,239
- You have a kid, right?
- Yeah.

545
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,367
He's 11.

546
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:41,369
And when he, um...
when he turned 8,

547
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,288
he begged me
to go camping for his birthday.

548
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,873
[chuckles]

549
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:47,917
We drove four hours
to New River Gorge.

550
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:51,212
Took me an hour
to set up the tent.

551
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,798
Guess how long we lasted.

552
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,633
Three hours?

553
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,635
- 37 minutes.
- [laughs]

554
00:19:57,636 --> 00:19:59,095
A thunderstorm came
out of nowhere,

555
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:00,680
filled the tent
with water so fast,

556
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:03,350
I felt like I was being
flushed down a toilet.

557
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,643
I'm so sorry.

558
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:08,688
Ran out of there like
a couple of gutter rats.

559
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,148
Ended up celebrating
his birthday

560
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:11,983
at 2:00 a.m. with a Happy Meal.

561
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,526
Oh, what my kids wouldn't
give for a Happy Meal.

562
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,154
[both chuckle]

563
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:21,700
Yeah, they must, um, have
some pretty fancy McDonald's

564
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,328
up there in Shadyside.

565
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,163
Yeah.

566
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:28,123
That's, uh... that's
where you live?

567
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:30,125
It's the address
on your patient file.

568
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:34,171
Um, technically, no.

569
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:38,634
I just use the address so my
kids can go to a decent school.

570
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:40,177
Right.

571
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:41,845
I know it's illegal,
but it's just temporary.

572
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:43,013
- Oh, God.
- I promise.

573
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:44,848
No judgment here.

574
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,683
My son always comes first,
no matter what.

575
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:48,185
Yeah.

576
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:50,146
Even If it means
I have to do without.

577
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:54,483
[chuckles]

578
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:56,318
I know, I'm a doctor, right?

579
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,862
How bad could it be?

580
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:02,032
But I, uh...
I used to be an addict.

581
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:04,077
I even lost custody of my kid.

582
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:07,579
Huh, I never would have guessed.

583
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,915
Mm. Yeah.

584
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,542
I went through some
really dark times

585
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:13,919
before I finally got help.

586
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,088
And I've been sober now 9 years,

587
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:18,757
5 months, and 11 days.

588
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,592
And your son?

589
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:22,927
He's good.

590
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:25,888
- Okay.
- You know, we're good.

591
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,057
He gets to stay with me
every other weekend.

592
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:29,977
And, um...

593
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:34,689
We'll be back to joint custody

594
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,527
just as soon as I get this
stupid thing off next week.

595
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,574
- [chuckles]
- Oh.

596
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:47,201
Don't worry.
I only killed three people.

597
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:48,536
Oh, God, I'm kidding.
[laughs]

598
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:49,912
- Oh.
- I'm kidding.

599
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:51,957
I'm sorry.
It was a bad joke.

600
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:58,045
The whole thing was just this...

601
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,174
giant misunderstanding.

602
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:07,555
I guess I'm oversharing
because I want you to know,

603
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:10,641
not everybody has it
all figured out all the time.

604
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:12,686
[sniffles] Yeah.

605
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,232
[crying softly]

606
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:22,321
Um, I'm struggling.

607
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:26,324
And I feel like such a bad mom.

608
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:33,872
And every day is so hard.

609
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:36,291
And I don't know what's
gonna happen tomorrow

610
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,169
or the next day.

611
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,215
Sometimes I wonder if they would

612
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:45,384
just be better off without me.

613
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:50,555
Yeah?

614
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,140
Do you...

615
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:53,725
Not like that.

616
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:55,143
I just...[sniffles]

617
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:56,978
I've just messed up so much.

618
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:59,314
- Yeah.
- And I don't know.

619
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:01,442
[sighs, sniffles]

620
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,697
You're their mom.

621
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:10,825
You love them, and nothing
and no one can replace that.

622
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:13,495
Yeah. [chuckles]

623
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:15,163
[sniffles]

624
00:23:15,164 --> 00:23:19,042
You deserve a little grace,
you know.

625
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:21,504
Be kind to yourself.

626
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:27,342
Well, you had a normal EKG
and chest X-ray.

627
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:30,511
But it looks like you sustained

628
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:34,682
a proximal humerus fracture
on the left upper arm.

629
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:37,811
There goes my backhand.

630
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,438
That was a joke, dear.

631
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:44,692
Okay, um, because
the fracture isn't displaced,

632
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:46,986
the good news is,
you don't need surgery.

633
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:49,446
Oh, that's a relief.

634
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,865
The bad news is,
you do need to wear a sling

635
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:53,867
for at least six weeks.

636
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:56,704
And I have to insist,
absolutely no shoulder mobility

637
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:58,497
for the first few weeks.

638
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:01,208
And that means you're gonna
have to step up even more,

639
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:03,085
because on top
of your usual ADLs,

640
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:05,087
you're also gonna have
to help your mom bathe,

641
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:07,715
dress, and use the toilet.

642
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,717
I'm so sorry, Mom.

643
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:12,720
This would never have happened
if I was more on top of things.

644
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:17,516
Any more on top,
you'd be back in my womb.

645
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:20,519
It's going to be fine.

646
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,105
I know how hard it can be.

647
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,940
I was my sister's
primary caregiver

648
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,359
until a few weeks ago.

649
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,028
Where is she now?

650
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,698
Um, she's in an amazing
facility in North Hills.

651
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:37,410
I know I can be a burden,

652
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:41,247
but I like being in my own home,

653
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:44,042
just me and my girl.

654
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:46,252
You're not a burden.

655
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:48,588
You're my mom.

656
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,673
I'll refer you to Ortho.

657
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:54,260
They'll get you set up
with PT and exercises.

658
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,555
You're very lucky to have
such a caring daughter.

659
00:24:57,556 --> 00:25:00,058
Don't I know it.

660
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,060
Park a red Subaru
in the ambulance bay?

661
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,936
Oh.
Yes, that's me.

662
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,897
Gonna need to move that to
open the space for ambulances.

663
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:07,440
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

664
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:08,941
- Okay.
- Um...

665
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,568
I'll walk Rita out.

666
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,111
Perlah, would you stay
with Ginger for a minute?

667
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,946
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, no problem.

668
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,699
Okay.
Um, after you.

669
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:22,288
Look, I-I put
your mom's prescription in

670
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:25,583
at the pharmacy,
and, uh, by the time

671
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:27,126
you get back from parking,

672
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:28,628
she should be ready
to be discharged.

673
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:31,255
Just don't worry.

674
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:34,509
Things will be back to normal
in a few weeks.

675
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,260
[chuckles]

676
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:38,762
I'm not sure
what normal is anymore.

677
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:41,306
I can't even remember the last
time I slept through the night.

678
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:42,933
It's just...

679
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,476
[sniffles] It's a lot.

680
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,061
[crying]

681
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,647
Um, do you have
any support at home?

682
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,982
[sighs] I wish.

683
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,235
It's just us.

684
00:25:53,236 --> 00:25:56,071
You know, I hired
a part-time aide for my sister

685
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:57,489
to cover me when I was at work.

686
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,325
It was really helpful.

687
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,244
It's out of our price range.

688
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:03,829
I mean, I already
work from home.

689
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,831
And then there's
the cooking and the cleaning

690
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:08,291
and the doctor's appointments.

691
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,377
It never ends.

692
00:26:10,378 --> 00:26:14,297
You know, caretaker's fatigue
is a real thing.

693
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:16,007
You have to take care
of yourself.

694
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,886
Otherwise, you're gonna
end up in here, too.

695
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:23,015
[sighs]

696
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,353
I still don't understand
why Kristi needs

697
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,897
to go through this a third time
with a third doctor.

698
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:32,357
Yeah, that's our bad.

699
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,067
Our computerized medical records

700
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:36,236
have been glitching lately,
and Dr. Collins' image

701
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:38,196
didn't upload properly.

702
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,698
Okay, crown to rump...
that's top of the head

703
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,032
to the bottom of the butt...

704
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,367
is how you measure
gestational age.

705
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:45,619
And we are at
10 weeks and 6 days.

706
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,621
I made it by one day?

707
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,123
I will order the medication.

708
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:51,000
Dr. Collins will go
over instructions

709
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,127
on taking the pills when they
come back from the pharmacy.

710
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:54,628
Thank you so much, Dr. Robby.

711
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,380
Oh, I'm glad I could help.

712
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,216
Even more glad to see you have
such a supportive mom.

713
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,178
Okay, take care.

714
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,851
Appreciate you stepping up.

715
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:10,604
All good.
I got you.

716
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,607
Robby, I have Emma Isaacs
on line 3 for you.

717
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,108
She's the organ donation
counselor coming

718
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,777
- to speak to Nick's parents.
- Thank you.

719
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:19,361
What was that all about?

720
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:20,946
- Oh, nothing.
- Didn't look like nothing.

721
00:27:20,947 --> 00:27:22,281
- Please.
- What?

722
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:23,741
You two were once a thing.

723
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,410
We dated briefly
a million years ago.

724
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,537
- Never again.
- Never say never.

725
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:30,414
Settle down, Jane Austen.

726
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,458
The lady doth protest too much.

727
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:33,835
- Mm.
- Mm.

728
00:27:35,796 --> 00:27:37,588
Jake!

729
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,799
There he is...
the man, the myth, the legend.

730
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,425
And there's the kid
who stole my concert pass

731
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,927
- and gave it to a girl.
- [chuckles]

732
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:43,928
Where is she?
Do I get to meet her?

733
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,179
Need an assist!

734
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,722
- Hold that thought.
- Okay.

735
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:48,098
Travis Johnson, 17,
had a tonsillectomy

736
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,599
ten days ago at St. Michael's.

737
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,351
Started spitting blood
about an hour ago.

738
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,436
- Good vitals.
- Hey, Travis. I'm Dr. Robby.

739
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:55,104
- How much blood?
- Couple mouthfuls.

740
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,315
Can you open up for me?

741
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:00,360
Hey, Whitaker, Jesse.

742
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:01,778
Got a post-tonsillectomy
hemorrhage.

743
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,696
Nebulized TXA, quick as you can.

744
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:05,532
- I'm on it. Let's go.
- Let's go, Trauma 2.

745
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,283
So this can go south
pretty quickly.

746
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:08,618
- You up for it?
- Well, I can...

747
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:09,703
Of course you are.

748
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:17,502
Ready?
Here we go.

749
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,754
One, two, three.

750
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,340
[grunts]

751
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:26,803
Take long, slow,
deep breaths on that.

752
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,638
The TXA is gonna
help your blood clot.

753
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,306
Uh, any medical problems?

754
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:31,599
No, just a ton of strep.

755
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,767
That's why I had the surgery.

756
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:33,977
You take aspirin?

757
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,354
- Any other medications?
- Mm-mm.

758
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:38,648
Lungs are clear bilaterally,
no stridor.

759
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:40,275
Okay, sure.

760
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:42,443
You feel like throwing up?
Any pain in your belly?

761
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,237
No.

762
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:45,405
Labs?

763
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:48,408
Uh, CBC, BMP, maybe coags?

764
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:49,951
Add a type and screen,
just in case.

765
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:50,994
Yeah.

766
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,579
Good sats at 98%.

767
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,663
BP is 115 over 80.

768
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:55,831
Okay, good.

769
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:57,165
Four by four on a ring forceps.

770
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,501
- Let's take a look.
- Okay.

771
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:02,088
Head back, open wide for me.

772
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,841
- What do you see?
- No active bleeding,

773
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:07,509
but there's some white
and dark brown stuff

774
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,177
- where the tonsils used to be.
- Oh, that's good.

775
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:11,263
That's a fibrinous clot.
That means the TXA is working.

776
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:12,681
Your parents on the way?

777
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:14,016
They're in Baltimore
for a wedding.

778
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:15,350
I didn't want to bother them.

779
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,810
Trust me.
They're your parents,

780
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,520
and you are in
an emergency room.

781
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,063
It is never a bother.

782
00:29:20,064 --> 00:29:21,481
Write their numbers down,
and I will call them.

783
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,983
Call Head and Neck.

784
00:29:22,984 --> 00:29:24,318
Stay with him until
they get here, okay?

785
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,360
Good.

786
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:26,987
Pen.

787
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:28,990
Can I get the...

788
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:35,913
[sighs]

789
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,998
Sam Wallace,
our Good Samaritan who saved

790
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:40,751
a Nepali lady, is in line
for a repeat head CT

791
00:29:40,752 --> 00:29:43,378
to be sure there's no extension
of the intraparenchymal bleed.

792
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:45,047
Okay, so we can dial down
the sedation, and,

793
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:46,882
if he's alert,
check extubation parameters.

794
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:48,133
- Copy.
- Did you get the consent form

795
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,384
signed by Joyce the sickler

796
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:50,719
- for the intubation?
- Not yet.

797
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,387
- Jesus fucking...
- She's scared.

798
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:53,889
I just wanted to give her
some time to talk to her...

799
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,307
To do what,
make funeral arrangements?

800
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:57,309
Joyce is hypoxic at 84.

801
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,644
84.
This goes on much longer,

802
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,562
she runs the risk
of permanent lung damage,

803
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:02,813
- heart attack...
- I know.

804
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:04,315
- Stroke, death.
- I know.

805
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:05,399
Then move!

806
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,902
Now.

807
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,914
Just have a seat,
and we'll be with you shortly.

808
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:22,376
Oh, I've heard that load
of bullshit before.

809
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:28,048
[sighs] My fucking God.

810
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:36,014
[scoffs]

811
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,314
Took me all the way
back there just to

812
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:48,442
stick a goddamn thermometer
in my mouth, you know.

813
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:51,446
Repeat vitals every four hours.

814
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:58,077
- [people exclaiming]
- Oh, dang!

815
00:30:58,078 --> 00:31:00,079
Saw how it swerved
and almost hit the taxi?

816
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,622
- Mm-hmm.
- [sighs]

817
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:03,123
I gotta get out of here;
I mean, this thing is

818
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:04,916
totally gonna screw up
the traffic to Pittfest.

819
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,918
Nice score.
You going with Robby?

820
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,420
Well, I was supposed to.

821
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:10,088
But I have this new girlfriend,

822
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:11,798
and she's super excited
about the lineup, so...

823
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,634
So you ditched the old man
for a hot piece of ass.

824
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:17,303
Been there, done that.

825
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:19,931
Senior year, Lollapalooza,
I met this guy.

826
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:21,349
Think his name was Rich...

827
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,517
or was it Rick?

828
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:23,935
Doesn't matter.

829
00:31:23,936 --> 00:31:26,105
But he looked like Dave Navarro.

830
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,651
Warm breeze, cool grass,

831
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:34,405
a million stars in the sky.

832
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,532
Best sex of my life.

833
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:39,492
You had sex in public?

834
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:41,202
We were under a blanket.

835
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:43,204
Oh!
It's turning around.

836
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:44,706
It's turning around, baby.

837
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:47,292
- Come home to Papa.
- Shit.

838
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:50,087
I had money on it crashing
in Beaver County.

839
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,717
[knocking]
[buzzer blares]

840
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:02,849
Better safe than sorry.

841
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,311
- Okay.
- [buzzer blares]

842
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:09,064
- Jake, what's up?
- Hey, how are you?

843
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,861
Where's Rita?

844
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,529
Um, she went to park the car.

845
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,156
Shouldn't have been
more than five minutes.

846
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:21,993
Why don't you dial
her number for me?

847
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,086
- Did she pick up?
- Straight to voicemail.

848
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:34,130
- That's weird.
- Yo.

849
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,385
Sole caretaker, overwhelmed,

850
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:42,222
exhausted.

851
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,601
I told her to take a break,
but you don't...

852
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:50,062
you don't think she ditched
her mom, do you?

853
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:52,107
[sighs] I mean, it happens.

854
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:57,736
You're gonna need to use the
antibiotic ointment twice a day

855
00:32:57,737 --> 00:33:01,073
and come in for a wound check
in two days, okay?

856
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,658
Mateo, can you grab me
enough samples

857
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:03,909
- to last a couple weeks?
- Yeah, I'm on it.

858
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,245
Thank you.

859
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:07,746
Thanks.

860
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:09,498
I really appreciate it.

861
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:11,583
Yeah. No problem.

862
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:14,210
Has Kiara been here yet?

863
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:16,212
No, who's Kiara?

864
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:18,005
Oh, she's the hospital
social worker.

865
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:19,757
She can help you out with,
like, housing and childcare

866
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,175
- and food and security...
- You told her?

867
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:23,427
- No, I-I...
- No, no, it's all free.

868
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:24,762
The system works if you use it.

869
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:25,973
- You just have to...
- Enough!

870
00:33:27,182 --> 00:33:29,059
I don't need your help.

871
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,061
Nice speech.

872
00:33:32,062 --> 00:33:34,231
Next time,
mind your own business.

873
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:42,406
You ever heard
of impact over intent?

874
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,576
I would never intentionally
embarrass anybody.

875
00:33:46,577 --> 00:33:48,494
But you did.

876
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:50,955
You didn't have
a conversation with Sherry

877
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:52,623
or ask her what she needed.

878
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:54,709
Instead, you walked in here
and told her what to do.

879
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,629
You gotta slow down,
take a beat, and listen

880
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,507
instead of judging people.

881
00:34:01,884 --> 00:34:03,259
- I don't judge.
- Please.

882
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,554
