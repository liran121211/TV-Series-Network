1
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:30,280
Can you... can you just put him
on the phone for a second?

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,575
I just want to hear his voice.

3
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:36,703
There's my guy.

4
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,456
How you doing, buddy?

5
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,459
I would love to hear
your... your song.

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,385
[waves crashing]

7
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,479
You should go home.

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,647
Oh, that is the last place
I want to be.

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,067
Are you sure
you shouldn't see your OB?

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,652
I checked myself.

11
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,780
Uterus is empty,
barely spotting now.

12
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,198
I'm fine.

13
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,492
- [sobbing]
- Oh, honey.

14
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,786
I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,789
Oh, I shouldn't have bought
that fucking stroller.

16
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,164
Oh.

17
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,000
Fuck that fucking stroller.

18
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,718
Losing a kid
is hard on everybody.

19
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,357
That's as hard as it gets.

20
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,484
We do these debriefs

21
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,696
to try to give
a sense of closure, meaning,

22
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,533
to difficult cases
so that they won't linger.

23
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:01,329
But trust me, the kids
you'll lose will linger.

24
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,040
So what do you do?

25
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,127
I did my residency
at Big Charity in New Orleans.

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,172
And day one, I got a kid,
five-year-old boy,

27
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,674
accidentally shot by his brother

28
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,884
playing with Dad's gun,

29
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,679
worried he was gonna
get in trouble

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,597
right up until he coded
and died.

31
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,351
[exhales sharply]

32
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,603
That night,
I asked myself, like,

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,065
what do I do with this kid?

34
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,151
Where do I put this feeling?

35
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,902
And I found myself
walking all night.

36
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,320
I was walking
and walking and walking.

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,738
Then I found myself
back at the gates

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,198
of Big Charity Cemetery,
and I'm looking

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,908
at all those mausoleums
and those crypts

40
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,743
and I'm thinking to myself,
OK, that's what I need.

41
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,871
I just need a safe place where
I can put these feelings...

42
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,747
Yo, we got patients
throwing punches in chairs.

43
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,751
Uh, OK, everybody.
Let's get back to it.

44
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,753
Just remember,
the Employee Assistance Program

45
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,589
is available,
as are Kiara and myself,

46
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,591
if anybody needs to talk.

47
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,134
- Where's McKay?
- In Central 11

48
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,052
with our UTI
accounting assistant

49
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,388
while we keep her boss on ice
in North 2.

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,182
Robby, critical case
flying in...

51
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,184
possible MDMA overdose,
high temp,

52
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,894
en route from PittFest.
Five minutes out.

53
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,270
Stay here. Set up for that.

54
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,730
- Ahmad and I got chairs.
- Hey, hey.

55
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,273
Is everything all right
with Collins?

56
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,858
Something's bothering her.
I asked her about it.

57
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,193
She said she doesn't want
to talk to me about it.

58
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,527
Oh. Imagine that.

59
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,112
She probably learned it
from you.

60
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,448
Seriously?
You just gave a speech titled

61
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,116
"How to Literally Bury
your Feelings."

62
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,244
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta break up a fight.

63
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,662
[indistinct shouting]

64
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,914
Yo, you need to control
your wife, man!

65
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,123
Shut it, man!

66
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,291
[indistinct shouting]

67
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,126
Hey, hey, Olsen!

68
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,961
- Olsen, what the fuck, man?
- Took you long enough!

69
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,087
- Calm down.
- No.

70
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,589
Don't tell me to calm down.

71
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,132
How hard is it
to put a mask on your kid?

72
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,593
He has allergies,
you fucking Fauci zombie.

73
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,762
- What?
- Allergies! Fuck you.

74
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,138
[screaming and shouting]

75
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
- You fucking bitch!
- Hey!

76
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,974
Hey! That's enough!

77
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,477
Jesus almighty, I don't believe
what I'm seeing.

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,978
Where do you people
think you are, huh?

79
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,481
This ain't Philly.

80
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,316
This is a hospital,
for Christ's sakes.

81
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,985
What's the matter with you?

82
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,488
You call yourselves adults?
Huh?

83
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,323
There are children in here.

84
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,326
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

85
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,828
Olsen, you catch any shrapnel?

86
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,831
Craziest shit I've seen since
I've been here, but I'm good.

87
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,667
- I'm good, seriously.
- Jack-offs.

88
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,671
Ladies, are we finished
with the craziness?

89
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,255
[lisping]
This is fucking ridiculous.

90
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,216
All I did was offer
to put a mask on her child

91
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,968
who's been coughing
for over an hour.

92
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,678
And... and now I'm missing
half my goddamn tooth

93
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,137
and talking like this.

94
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,514
First of all,
masks are bullshit.

95
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,307
- Oh, my God.
- And B, it's an allergy.

96
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,685
He's allergic to cat dander,
like I fucking told you.

97
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,228
My sister brought
her two Persians...

98
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,313
Shut up.
Shut up right now, please.

99
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,524
And only answer
the questions I ask.

100
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,652
What happened to the tooth?
Did you swallow it?

101
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,861
I don't think so.

102
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,988
I think it's still in my hand.

103
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,364
It sure is.

104
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,949
I hope you both have
all your shots.

105
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,492
What do you mean,
like, vaccines?

106
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,119
Jesus,
please don't stir this pot.

107
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,370
Let's take these ladies back

108
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,871
and get them treated,
separately.

109
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,665
- Stick with me.
- Come on.

110
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,832
Ma'am, it's time to go.

111
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,210
Guess that makes us a team.

112
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,878
I guess it does.

113
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,548
Ma'am, come with Mateo and I...

114
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,008
Mateo and me.

115
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,718
Yes, with us both.

116
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,428
OK, Earl,
let's take a look at you.

117
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,887
Oof, she really tagged you.

118
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,515
Red's got a left hook
like Billy Conn.

119
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,725
Well, let's get you cleaned up.

120
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,686
Come on, baby.

121
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,854
Excuse me, sir.

122
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,148
You're not allowed back there.

123
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,400
Unless, what, I start a fight?

124
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,818
Become homeless?

125
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,944
Apparently,
that's what it takes.

126
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,070
I understand your frustration.

127
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,405
I promise you'll be seen

128
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,906
as soon as a provider
is available.

129
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,616
But how can they
become available

130
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,368
if new people keep cutting
the fucking line?

131
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,703
There's no line.

132
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,455
We see patients
by severity of need.

133
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,416
As soon as we have your tests
and labs, you will be seen.

134
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,585
This place is
fucking unbelievable.

135
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,212
Runaround after runaround.

136
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,381
Hey. What's up, Erik Estrada?

137
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,758
Still keeping your eye on me?

138
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,718
Always, my friend.

139
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,386
Always.

140
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,056
- Who's Erik Estrada?
- Shame on you. "CHiPs."

141
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,349
Know your television history.

142
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,933
- And thank you.
- Yeah.

143
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,937
Crazy people.

144
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,606
If you do get my tooth out,
I don't want it

145
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,649
after it's been inside
that woman.

146
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,485
Reattachment
wouldn't be possible.

147
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,236
A type two fracture
into the dentin.

148
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,488
Seal with dental cement.

149
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,448
Prescription for Pen VK,
soft diet.

150
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,575
Follow up with the dentist in
one to three days for a crown.

151
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,912
You handle Spinks
while I check on Ali.

152
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,954
You got this.

153
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,873
Don't worry, partner.

154
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,416
Yes.

155
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,918
I totally got this.

156
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,881
How are we doing in here?

157
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,633
You should write that bitch
a script for calcium

158
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,510
because I didn't even hit her
that hard.

159
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,971
Too much almond milk
in your soy lattes.

160
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,807
That doesn't even make sense.

161
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,142
You know, most commercial
almond and soy milks

162
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,186
are fortified with calcium,
so they end up having

163
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,814
a higher percentage of calcium
than cows' milk.

164
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,649
Prepped with Betadine
and draped.

165
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,817
Very nice.

166
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,151
Let's have a closer look.

167
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,070
Dr. King,
can you please grab me

168
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,656
a 10 cc syringe,
a 20 gauge needle,

169
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,241
and some sterile saline, please?

170
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,159
Pluck it out, stitch me up,
and send me home.

171
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,786
I've got to get back out there
to my kid,

172
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,663
who is still waiting
to be seen, by the way.

173
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,498
Afraid it's a little more
complicated than that.

174
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,167
You got yourself a fight bite,
which means a couple things.

175
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,710
First, we need to determine

176
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,671
if the bite extended
into the joint space.

177
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,548
If it did, you're gonna need
IV antibiotics

178
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,633
and a trip to the OR
to see a hand surgeon.

179
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,511
- Pinprick and a little burning.
- An operation?

180
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,139
Well, you were just shouting
a minute ago about infection,

181
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,015
and with good reason.

182
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,769
While I am sure you are in
the clear for rabies and HIV,

183
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,522
human mouths are filthy,
some more than others.

184
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,857
How can you tell if it's bad?

185
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,608
Good question. Dr. K?

186
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,570
I'm sorry?

187
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,531
I am going to inject
some sterile saline

188
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,032
into your knuckle joint,
which you won't feel

189
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,868
'cause of the anesthetic.

190
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,703
If it comes spraying back out
of the bite wound, we'll know.

191
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,121
- Ready?
- I guess.

192
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,832
There she blows.

193
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,376
Ah, shit.

194
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,711
Are you serious?

195
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,838
You hear that,
you fucking bitch?

196
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,048
I've got to have surgery,
thanks to you.

197
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,886
- Good. You assaulted me!
- Damn right.

198
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,804
And I'll bet next time,
you keep your masks

199
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,015
and opinions to yourself.

200
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,349
You OK?

201
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,726
Yes.

202
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,021
3 grams Unasyn IV.
Call the OR.

203
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,398
Tell them we have a fight bite
that needs to be washed out.

204
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,733
Then go take 20 minutes
in the lounge.

205
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,234
I'll come find you
if I need you.

206
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,153
- I don't need a break.
- Yes, you do.

207
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,990
OK.

208
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,993
Oh, did you want me
to tell the surgeons

209
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,829
- to go no masks for surgery?
- What?

210
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,040
Well, those of us
who save lives for a living

211
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,417
believe strongly
that masks minimize risk

212
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
when it comes to spreading
disease and infection.

213
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,338
But I... I want to respect
your beliefs,

214
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,215
so what do you think?

215
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,758
With or without for surgery?
Without?

216
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,595
Um... I want with.

217
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,640
Good call.

218
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:37,558
Helicopter's here.
Cafeteria send the ice?

219
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,268
- Yeah, everything they got.
- Hey.

220
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,727
I hear they're gonna start you

221
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,104
working on the Middle East
peace plan.

222
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:43,898
Not since the Dalai Lama
or Gandhi.

223
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,066
They'd be fucking-A right to.

224
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,275
You should have seen me.

225
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,985
I was inspiring,
also terrifying,

226
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,278
and a little bit shaming.

227
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,905
Holy Trinity of crowd control.

228
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,240
Hey, can we pick it up
in here, please?

229
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,117
Overdose is here.

230
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,744
PittFest OD.

231
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,287
Keely Ralston,
brought to the first aid tent

232
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,581
at PittFest with altered
mental status and fever.

233
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,124
Temp too high
for a field thermometer.

234
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,417
Intubated en route.

235
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,919
We got to cool this lady down.

236
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,420
Get some ice packs,
head, neck, groin.

237
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,881
- Send off for a rainbow.
- On it.

238
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,467
Heart rate 132, BP 210 over 120.

239
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,053
- Jesus, that's high.
- Four of Ativan in the field.

240
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,222
Pupils are dilated.
Definitely MDMA overdose.

241
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,974
Dr. Mohan, how do you want
to treat the BP?

242
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,392
- Beta blockers?
- No.

243
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,476
Unopposed alpha could kill her.

244
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,477
Four more of Ativan, please.

245
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,895
Seriously?

246
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,480
She might need another 40.

247
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,399
Hypertension and tachycardia
from MDMA

248
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,984
is centrally mediated.

249
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,110
Ativan is the drug of choice.
[thermometer beeps]

250
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,153
Damn. Core temp, 107.3.

251
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,613
OK, can we get
another hose in here

252
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,948
before she fries her brain,
please?

253
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,158
Let's go. Come on.
[monitors beeping]

254
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,997
I'll be right back.

255
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,499
Hi. You look lost.

256
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,001
No, it's my assistant

257
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,502
who actually seems
to have been misplaced.

258
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,337
I mean, how long does a CT take?

259
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,630
Certainly not this long.

260
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,007
They can get pretty backed up.

261
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,174
Can I get you a cup
of bad coffee?

262
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,176
- Dry sandwich?
- No, thank you.

263
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,845
How about a cold LaCroix from
my secret stash in the lounge?

264
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,638
I'm going for one myself.
I'm freaking addicted.

265
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,849
I'm good on drinks.
Can you take me to radiology?

266
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,268
Yeah, right this way.
Right this way.

267
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,108
Piper, while we still have
a few minutes,

268
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,526
there are some things
I want to say.

269
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,278
Yeah, use protection.

270
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,363
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Totally.

271
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,116
- It was a mistake.
- Totally.

272
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,368
I'm a part
of the street team here.

273
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,370
It's a group
of doctors and nurses

274
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,040
who go out into the community
and help people

275
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,001
who can't or won't ask
for help...

276
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,713
addicts, unhoused, runaways.

277
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,882
And I'll be honest
with you, Piper.

278
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,843
I think you need some help.

279
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,720
What are you talking about?

280
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,222
If you're in trouble,
we can help you.

281
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,059
I'm not. OK?

282
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,729
And if we're done here,
I think I'd like to go.

283
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,275
Will you at least
take a look at this?

284
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,110
There's a list of resources
on the back.

285
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,404
I don't need that.

286
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,907
I know you don't have a phone,

287
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:02,203
but if you could just
take my number, OK?

288
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,080
You never know.

289
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,332
Where's Laura?

290
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,167
How about taking the pen?

291
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,212
If you ever feel unsafe
or in danger, call this number.

292
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,755
It's a national hotline.

293
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,174
There's somebody
on the other end 24/7,

294
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,093
a trained professional
who can help with anything.

295
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,427
I have all the help I need.

296
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,763
I want to go. Now.

297
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,057
OK, on my count.
One, two, three.

298
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,767
Gentle, gentle, gentle.

299
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,936
Houston, we have splashdown.

300
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,229
Good luck.
See you on the next one.

301
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,272
- Yep.
- Temp's down to 107.1.

302
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,066
How long does she need
to stay in the ice, Dr. Santos?

303
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,609
My PB in the ice is 13 minutes.

304
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,569
- Dr. Santos.
- Until her temp is normal.

305
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,154
Wrong.
You pull her out at 102.

306
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,281
Otherwise we could overshoot
and cause hypothermia.

307
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,992
Heart rate 120.
Pressure 198 over 116.

308
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,120
More Ativan?
Another four, please.

309
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,788
Why is she on the ice,
Dr. Santos?

310
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,456
- To bring her temp down.
- Wow, state the obvious,

311
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,165
yet still don't answer
the question.

312
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,668
The quicker we bring it down,
the less of a chance

313
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,961
for permanent damage
to the brain,

314
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,462
- liver, or kidneys.
- Exactly.

315
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,423
- Was she sweating?
- Profusely.

316
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,632
What if she wasn't,
Dr. Santos?

317
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,259
What if she was dry as a bone?

318
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,844
Then we'd have to think
anticholinergic overdose,

319
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,011
not sympathetic.

320
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,433
Very good.

321
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,734
Hey.

322
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,153
I found you scrubs
that should fit.

323
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,487
Oh.
[laughs]

324
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,156
Thank you. That's great.

325
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,492
- I appreciate that.
- But they come with a catch.

326
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,578
Mr. Krakozhia is asking
to see you.

327
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,621
The guy who peed on me?

328
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,665
- Why me?
- I didn't ask.

329
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,917
But maybe you should wait
to put these scrubs on

330
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,794
until after you've...

331
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,920
That's a good idea.

332
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,338
Oh, God.

333
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,340
[rat squeaking]

334
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,301
Oh, man.
We got a load of the...

335
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,344
Oh, my God.

336
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,512
Whoa! Hey!

337
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,432
[rat squeaking]

338
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,685
Yeah, I see you.

339
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,062
[rat squeaking]

340
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,564
Your days are numbered, buddy.

341
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,024
Trauma to ER Two.
ETA now.

342
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,567
That's another four of Ativan.

343
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,194
Rectal temp's down to 105.

344
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,361
OK, moving
in the right direction.

345
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,696
We might get lucky here.

346
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,364
Double trauma at the back door.

347
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,366
Auto versus pedestrian before
hitting a telephone pole.

348
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,368
- You got this?
- Yep.

349
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,454
Dr. Robby,
I finished with Dr. Ozeki,

350
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,538
the therapist upstairs.

351
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,165
Yes, yes, yes.
How did that go?

352
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,000
- Well.
- Excellent.

353
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,379
Have you heard from David?

354
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,714
No.

355
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,216
Has David seen the therapist?

356
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,973
Do you think that he's still
gonna pick you up today?

357
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,558
- I think so.
- OK, well...

358
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,644
- Robby, here they come.
- OK.

359
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,687
Well, you're medically cleared,
so why don't you stay here

360
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,190
for a little while longer
in the hopes that he does?

361
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,733
I still would like him
to talk to somebody.

362
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,568
Perlah, this is Theresa.
She's a friend of mine,

363
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,570
so I expect concierge service,
yes?

364
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,780
- VIP treatment.
- Thank you.

365
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,240
You're in good hands.

366
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,367
Just let me know if David
shows up or if he calls.

367
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,536
Good boy.
Good boy.

368
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,120
Walter Pernell, 52,

369
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,622
walking his dog
in the crosswalk,

370
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,749
got struck by a Chevy Impala
at low velocity.

371
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,086
Ambulatory on scene, no KO,
no neck, chest, or belly pain.

372
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,630
- Good vitals.
- Whoa. Major road rash.

373
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,299
Yeah, the car didn't hit me
so much as throw me.

374
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,426
But I slid for a good 10 feet.

375
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,636
Of course, this is the first day

376
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,263
I've worn shorts
all effin' year.

377
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,139
No deformity
at the knee or ankle.

378
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,599
Distal pulse is intact.

379
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,934
Four of morphine so far.

380
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,352
Yeah, feel free
to be more generous.

381
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,770
Don't worry.
We will patch you up.

382
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,230
We will get you right.
Who's your friend?

383
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,565
Oh, this is Crosby,

384
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,441
who thankfully barked
and warned me

385
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,402
so I had half a second
to try to move out of the way.

386
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,945
Crosby, you're a hero.

387
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,613
Donahue, you think
you could find a Milk-Bone

388
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,532
for our little lifesaver here
in the doctor's lounge?

389
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,242
Absolutely.
I'll take good care of him.

390
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,952
Can't he stay with me?
He's a very good boy.

391
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,412
No doubt.
Let's get you settled first.

392
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,788
- You're going to South 20.
- Got it.

393
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,290
Is that the driver?

394
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,790
28-year-old lady,
had her seat belt on.

395
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,084
Clipped the guy with the dog
and went

396
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,586
straight into a telephone pole.

397
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,879
Blood's from a scalp lac.

398
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,088
Also complained of chest pain.

399
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,298
Sleepy but arousable.

400
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,008
- What's your name?
- Paula.

401
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,677
Heart rate's a bit tachy.
112. BP's fine.

402
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,345
Paula, are you in
any pain right now?

403
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,264
[sluggishly] Yeah, I got hurt.

404
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,641
Witnesses say she was driving
erratically before the crash.

405
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,644
No ETOH on her breath.
Maybe drugs?

406
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,314
- Core temp's 104.2.
- Heart rate 116.

407
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,316
BP 180 over 110.

408
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,692
Better, but still too high.

409
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,985
Another four of Ativan.

410
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
That'll make 20.

411
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,362
Good counting.

412
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,822
Pedestrian in South 20
needs a doctor.

413
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,949
- You got this?
- Yep. Keep chilling.

414
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,993
- All hands on deck. You ready?
- all: Ready.

415
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,287
OK, here we go.
One, two, three.

416
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,081
[groans]

417
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,666
[speaking Spanish]

418
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,585
I heard motor vehicle collision
with chest pain

419
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,669
and altered mental status.

420
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,004
- Qué más?
- Meet Paula.

421
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,340
Restrained driver
versus telephone pole.

422
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,800
Altered before the crash.
Good BP, but tachy.

423
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,761
Second line and run a liter
of LR wide open.

424
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,513
Still tachy at 115.
BP's 180 over 72.

425
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,806
Airway's patent.

426
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,099
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

427
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,768
Pupils are equal and reactive.

428
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,519
Paula, do you know
what today's date is?

429
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,438
It's, uh...

430
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,814
Sats 94%.

431
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,107
How about the city we're in?

432
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,317
Pittsburgh?

433
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,860
Bruising on the chest.

434
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,071
- [shouts]
- Possible sternal fracture.

435
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,822
- Pericardium's clear.
- Good. Good.

436
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,574
No marked tenderness.

437
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,868
Nothing in Morrison's pouch.

438
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,370
She's a little tachypneic.

439
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,746
I don't think
she needs intubation.

440
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,247
Might just be concussed.

441
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,874
I worry about her crumping
in the scanner.

442
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,876
She's protecting her airway.
I see lung sliding.

443
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,503
- No pneumo.
- With a head injury?

444
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,088
You guys are supposed to be
the airway experts.

445
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,923
Stop fighting.
Make a decision.

446
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,549
Call me when she goes to CT.

447
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,219
Paula, can you raise
your right arm for me?

448
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,429
Good sign.
Follows commands.

449
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,390
You want to intubate
with a GCS of 13?

450
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,891
OK.
We can hold off and monitor.

451
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,060
- What's your plan?
- Pan scan, head to pelvis.

452
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,728
EKG, troponin.

453
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,897
Straight cath urine
for UA and tox screen.

454
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,566
- Agreed. [groans]
- I'm on it.

455
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,902
- Gotta bend those knees.
- I gotta quit showing off.

456
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,571
- Is that what you were doing?
- Always.

457
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,158
It's a ten-day course
of doxycycline,

458
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,035
one pill twice a day.

459
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,664
I'll make sure she takes it
on a full stomach.

460
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,417
I can give you your first
dose now, Piper, if you like.

461
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,876
- Get you started.
- That'd be great.

462
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,088
Actually, I need Piper
to answer that one.

463
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,881
Sure. That'd be great.

464
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,758
OK.

465
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,927
Hello, everyone.

466
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,637
Looks like
we're finishing up here.

467
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,139
I come bearing gifts.

468
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,765
Everything you always
wanted to know about STIs

469
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,100
but never wanted to read.

470
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,102
No gross pictures, I promise.

471
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,311
I think we're good.

472
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,480
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

473
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,273
Yeah.
I learned my lesson.

474
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,900
It won't happen again.

475
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,948
I guess that's it, then.

476
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,950
Well, if you change your mind,

477
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,578
it comes with a free pen.

478
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,538
Thank you both so much
for your help.

479
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,330
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

480
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,294
OK.

481
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,046
Good luck to you both.

482
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,676
Fuck.

483
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,721
Fuck.

484
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,140
That sums it up.

485
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,641
She'll be back.

486
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,435
Only she'll have slipped
a little further.

487
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,146
Sometimes it takes a few visits.

488
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,564
How can I keep her here?

489
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,107
You got anything?

490
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,693
Maybe Kiara has
a social services card to play.

491
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,487
She was by Trauma One
last I saw her.

492
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,655
Brilliant.
Brilliant. Thank you.

493
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,784
That's why I'm here,
to be brilliant

494
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,660
and bring peace.

495
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,828
Heart rate's 84.

496
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,789
BP 126 over 78.

497
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,791
Pulse ox, 99 on room air.

498
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,167
Good news, Mr. Pernell.

499
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,544
Your heart, lungs,
and belly all look good.

500
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,838
Yeah, just the leg.

501
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,673
Whoo, this might be
a road rash record.

502
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,175
We might have to bust out
the tape.

503
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,968
I'm getting a little worried
about Crosby.

504
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,011
Who's Crosby?

505
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,179
- His dog.
- My dog.

506
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,847
Where is Crosby?

507
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,016
- He's in the break room.
- Your break room, I think.

508
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,351
I'm sure he's fine.

509
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,311
We got a lot of dog lovers
around here.

510
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,313
I'm the new owner of
a nine-week-old Goldendoodle.

511
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,689
Oh, nice.

512
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,857
Crosby's a terrier.

513
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,151
[sighs] Great dogs.

514
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,278
Determined, courageous,
love to dig.

515
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,030
Who's he named for,
Sidney or David?

516
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,365
David.

517
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,366
Still my Sunday morning
soundtrack.

518
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,368
- Ow. Ow.
- Oh. Sorry.

519
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,036
Yeah, anyways, great name.

520
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,830
So the knee looks stable.

521
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,374
There's no laxity
to suggest a torn ligament.

522
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,626
I think the pain's probably
just from the road rash,

523

the last one out too long

00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,434
Really?
[laughs]

700
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,770
Oh, there's plenty of both
where I come from.

701
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,980
They're... you know,
they're pretty harmless.

702
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,899
Let's hope
Mr. Krakozhia is now too.

703
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,901
Yeah, no kidding.

704
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,444
OK.

705
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,074
[sniffs]

706
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,537
Is this the guy?

707
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,455
Yes.

708
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,581
Hey, man.

709
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,124
It's Dennis Whitaker.

710
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,794
I just wanted
to say sorry for earlier.

711
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,421
Heard I got you pretty good.

712
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,131
Yeah.

713
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,426
I kind of go out of my head
when I'm off my meds.

714
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,137
Then I guess I piss on people.

715
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,807
I'm pretty sure
the meth doesn't help.

716
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,976
I'm not using anymore.

717
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,395
I take antipsychotics
for the schizophrenia

718
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,272
I got from doing meth.

719
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,483
But I've been clean a year.

720
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,486
Why aren't you taking your meds?

721
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,113
Why don't I take my meds?

722
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,699
Well, Doc, I'm kind of
in between houses right now

723
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:19,286
living in an encampment
on Liberty Avenue.

724
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,453
Meds cost money.

725
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,831
I don't have insurance.

726
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,332
- Should I go on?
- No. No.

727
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,626
That's fine.

728
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,961
I'm sorry.

729
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,926
Life isn't always easy.

730
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,014
Have you talked
to a social worker yet?

731
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,515
- No.
- OK.

732
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,517
Do you think
you could go grab...

733
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,810
- Kiara?
- Kiara in here?

734
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,103
Yeah.

735
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,149
I really am sorry.

736
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,692
It's OK, honestly.

737
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,486
Really, it's OK.

738
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,655
I appreciate the apology.

739
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,617
[door clicks]

740
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,372
This must be Crosby.

741
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,790
[dog whines]

742
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,710
I've heard a lot
about you, buddy.

743
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,920
How's my least problematic
trainee?

744
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,673
Well, technically,
you're all pretty green,

745
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,216
but you're growing on me.

746
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,926
Thank you.

747
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,137
So how you doing?

748
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,432
Um, good.

749
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,767
Better.

750
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,560
Yeah?

751
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,438
It's... I mean, it's just...

752
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:32,359
it's the... the little girl
and the sister's

753
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,902
too close to home.

754
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,196
The things we do are hard.

755
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,906
Yeah.

756
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:43,662
You're sitting here
feeling like...

757
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,414
like maybe you're not up to it?

758
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,541
Yeah.

759
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,502
Been there.

760
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,380
We all been there.

761
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,050
Mel, you're a sensitive person.

762
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:02,514
This... this is a tough place
for sensitive people.

763
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,350
But we need them badly.

764
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:12,774
Now, if you're ready,
I need you.

765
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,234
It's a perfect job.

766
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,277
It's practically a zen exercise.

767
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,406
I've got 1,000 pieces of gravel

768
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:23,118
that need to be plucked
out of a 2-foot-long road rash.

769
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,286
- 1,000?
- Yeah.

770
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,622
Give or take 100.

771
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,290
South 20.

772
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,793
Make sure you close the door
behind you.

773
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,962
- Don't want Crosby getting out.
- Yeah.

774
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,465
Thank you. No problem.
I'll be right there.

775
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,758
[sighs]

776
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,802
That's a lot of gravel.
[chuckles]

777
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,804
It looks clean to me.
You feel that, Earl?

778
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,888
Feel what?

779
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,306
- That's a no.
- [laughs]

780
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,891
All right.
Now just apply the Dermabond.

781
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,811
Cool.

782
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,147
Can I ask you something?

783
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,815
That's why I'm here.

784
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,150
Yeah, I was just wondering

785
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,111
what the nurses do
after their shifts.

786
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,988
In terms of what?

787
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,407
You know, do they ever,
like, go out together,

788
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,577
like, hang out to decompress
after a shift or anything?

789
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,120
Yeah, sometimes.

790
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,288
I mean, most of us
are just happy

791
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,789
to get the hell out of here.

792
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,836
Personally, I'm all about
a long, long, hot shower,

793
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,504
comfy sweats,

794
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,214
eating some takeout
in front of the TV,

795
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,885
ideally watching something
that makes me laugh, so...

796
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,970
Yeah, I can see that.

797
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,513
I'm not imagining it
in my mind, of course.

798
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,309
I just mean that I can...
I can see the appeal.

799
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,019
I was just asking because...

800
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,562
you know,
since we work together,

801
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:36,691
maybe we could grab
a coffee together sometime.

802
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,694
And you could, like, help me
get the lay of the land,

803
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,529
so to speak?

804
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,573
You asking him out?

805
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,366
No. What? No. No.

806
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,119
It's just... I'm... I'm new here,
so I just thought...

807
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,622
I... I don't date people
in the workplace.

808
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,626
It's nothing personal.
Just it's never a good idea.

809
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,795
No. No, of course not.
No. No.

810
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,172
I just... no, it's not
a good... no, of course.

811
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,965
I just thought
that since you know

812
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,717
how everything operates here
and you, like, have everything

813
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,552
so dialed in, that you would
be, like, a valuable resource.

814
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,888
But no. No.

815
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,891
I should probably
just figure it out on my own.

816
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,810
Mm-hmm.

817
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,729
No shortcuts here.

818
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,731
How are they treating you, Earl?

819
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,233
Huh?

820
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,901
I see you wrangled yourself
another sandwich.

821
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,945
I feel like
I'm watching a rom-com.

822
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,571
[chuckles]

823
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,906
Just came by to see
if I could take Dr. Javadi

824
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,199
on a reconnaissance
through chairs.

825
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,534
Yes.

826
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,785
I mean, sorry,
if you think that's...

827
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,286
Of course.
Of course.

828
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,913
I can finish up my man here.

829
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,081
Great.

830
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,923
Are you OK?

831
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,092
I feel ridiculous.

832
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,762
I've spoken, like,
two complete sentences

833
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,055
in the last half hour.

834
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,515
And both of them
have made me sound

835
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,685
even more imbecilic
than the incomplete ones.

836
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,229
And you attribute that to...

837
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,356
It's like,
my parents once took me skiing

838
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,108
for Christmas in Utah,
and from the moment

839
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,111
I got off the plane,
I could not catch my breath.

840
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,613
No matter how hard I tried,
the altitude made me feel,

841
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,032
like, awkward and uncoordinated.

842
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,784
I couldn't concentrate.
I couldn't get my bearings.

843
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,078
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm a very good skier,

844
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,288
but I spent the whole vacation
just, like,

845
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:18,042
on my butt, dizzy and panting.

846
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,169
Mateo is like a human Utah.

847
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,671
[laughs]

848
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,464
Oh, honey.

849
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,341
I've worked with a few Utahs.

850
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,303
I wish you many, many Utahs
in your life.

851
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,639
Jesse, where are you going?

852
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,141
- Trauma Two.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

853
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,018
Stop.
Not back in there.

854
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,186
I'm not even gonna tell you why.

855
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,438
How's she doing?

856
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,647
Still with some pleuritic pain.

857
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,983
Oh. Hey, Paula.
I'm Dr. Collins.

858
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,485
Your CT shows that you have
a broken sternum.

859
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,362
That's your breastbone
right here.

860
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,656
Probably from the shoulder belt
when you crashed your car.

861
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,949
I crashed my car?

862
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,492
Mm-hmm, and hit your head.

863
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,661
With a concussion,
sometimes you don't remember.

864
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,915
But your head CT doesn't show
anything serious.

865
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,501
So I saw in your chart
you're a new mom.

866
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,503
How's your baby doing?

867
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,256
He's good.
He's with my mom.

868
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,675
South 15's open.
Oh. Hey, Dr. McKay?

869
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,927
Just get the bed out of 15.

870
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,261
A patient you saw this morning

871
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,930
came back as an MVC.

872
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,848
Sternal fracture.
Slightly concussed.

873
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,516
Oh, no.
Paula, do you remember me?

874
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,809
You look familiar.

875
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,186
I was your doctor this morning

876
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,646
- for your bladder infection.
- Oh, yeah.

877
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,689
Sorry. I'm a little out of it.

878
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,191
Still tachycardic, 115.

879
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,485
BP's 124 over 78.

880
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,236
There's no bleeding
anywhere on the CT.

881
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,864
Chest and abdomen clear apart
from the sternal fracture.

882
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,075
Well, probably still tachy
from the fracture pain.

883
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,534
It hurts when I breathe.

884
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,078
Let's try four of morphine.

885
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,246
Paula, we're gonna
give you some pain meds.

886
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,832
Let me know if it helps, OK?

887
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,709
Mr. Pernell, you are in luck.

888
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,087
If I had to have gravel
meticulously picked out

889
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,547
of my leg,
this is the person I'd call,

890
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,341
Dr. Mel King,
detail specialist.

891
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,384
- Hello.
- Hi.

892
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,760
- I love your dog.
- Crosby?

893
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,512
- How is he?
- Oh, he's great.

894
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,347
Here.
Something to help see up close.

895
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,724
Hey, I don't want to be
one of those people

896
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,352
who say they need
an emotional support animal,

897
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,396
but is it possible
he could be with me?

898
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,147
We could tie his leash
to the bed.

899
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,732
He wouldn't be in any trouble.
I swear.

900
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,901
- What do you think?
- I'm happy to go get him.

901
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,569
- Any pain here?
- No.

902
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,821
OK.

903
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,990
You go get the dog.
You get to work.

904
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,075
I'm gonna get
some more gauze from triage.

905
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,910
And just in case,
if anybody asks,

906
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,246
just say you need him
for anxiety.

907
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,414
OK.

908
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,999
Thanks.

909
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,251
I know you hear me.

910
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:27,088
You can pretend you don't,
but I know you do.

911
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,589
This glass might be bulletproof,

912
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,882
but it ain't soundproof.

913
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,050
Huh?

914
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,218
Hello?

915
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,761
Can you hear me now?
Huh?

916
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,888
- Hello!
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, sir.

917
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,306
Sir, what is the issue?

918
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,391
Oh, same issue.

919
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,976
I've been here all day,

920
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,936
and you people have done
nothing to fucking help me.

921
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,604
We're still waiting
on your second troponin.

922
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,773
We can't clear you medically
until it comes back.

923
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,567
For instance,
if it comes back elevated,

924
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,610
that could indicate
a silent heart attack.

925
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,987
And you'd need to be
admitted for monitoring

926
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,405
in a cardiology consult.

927
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,115
That's all I'm asking for.

928
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,784
I'm afraid I've had
a silent heart attack.

929
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,120
I just want someone who knows
something about hearts

930
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,455
to tell me
what's happening to me.

931
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,457
You know,
unlike most of these losers,

932
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,625
I have insurance,
good insurance.

933
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,627
And I pay my taxes,
which pays for them

934
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,962
to not have any insurance.

935
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,547
Sir, you've got
about five seconds

936
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,299
to change your whole attitude
before security

937
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,884
and the police get involved.

938
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,552
Fuck it.

939
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,971
I'm leaving.

940
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,097
Hey.

941
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,431
Hey!

942
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,975
You are absolutely free to go.

943
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:23,478
But if you do,
you will be leaving AMA,

944
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,063
against medical advice.

945
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,648
This form states that I have
advised you to stay

946
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,777
and complete your evaluation,
but you are choosing to leave,

947
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,487
understanding and accepting
all risks of heart attack,

948
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,239
stroke, disability, and death.

949
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,788
Sounds like a CYA form

950
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,331
in case I drop dead on the curb.

951
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,333
That's exactly what it is.

952
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,378
I just want
to be treated fairly.

953
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,880
I assure you
that is our intention.

954
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,716
We are not back here
playing Go Fish.

955
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,135
We're doing our best to help
some very sick people.

956
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,845
You will be seen, OK?

957
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,646
Robby's gonna love that
patient satisfaction score.

958
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,481
Crazy people.

959
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,320
- [rapid beeping]
- What's going on?

960
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,863
Car crash victim Paula
just went south.

961
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,116
BP's crashing.
84 over 62.

962
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,117
Much less responsive.

963
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,451
Liter of LR wide open.

964
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,786
Putting her
in a 100% non-rebreather.

965
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,162
Paula, open your eyes.

966
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,497
Paula.

967
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,790
Was it the morphine?

968
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,833
She only got a small dose.

969
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,709
Pulse ox is down to 89.

970
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,877
Set up for intubation.

971
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,339
And, McKay, get Robby in here.

972
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,590
I'll call ICU and get her bumped

973
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,551
ahead of Joyce, our sickler.

974
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,094
She should get the next bed.

975
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,846
Between the hyperthermia
and the seizure,

976
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,389
she's gonna be out of it
for a while.

977
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,558
A similar thing happened
to a friend of mine.

978
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,726
Is that what made you
think of hyponatremia?

979
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,728
Look, I know you value
evidence-based medicine.

980
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,107
But sometimes experience
counts for something.

981
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,613
- May I ask why you did that?
- What?

982
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,824
Took the blame
for a delay in care

983
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,993
which didn't belong to you

984
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,745
and gave me credit for a save
that did belong to you?

985
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,249
You know, I've been
on Langdon's shit list all day.

986
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,084
It seemed like he was gonna be
more upset about us

987
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,712
not calling him in than glad
that we stopped the seizure,

988
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:16,215
so no reason for him
to be pissed at both of us.

989
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,593
Why have you been
on his shit list?

990
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,845
Well, I think he made it
very clear

991
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,890
that he thinks I don't have
what it takes to make it here.

992
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,392
Whether you do or do not,
it was completely inappropriate

993
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,102
for him to speak to you
that way.

994
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,937
Eh, I've heard worse.

995
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,190
Well, for what it's worth,
he's wrong.

996
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,193
You're very good at this.

997
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,613
Thank you.

998
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,490
That's actually worth a lot.

999
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,284
I thought the CTs were normal.

1000
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,619
They were.
Systolic's down to 70.

1001
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,912
Heart rate's up to 130.

1002
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,121
100 of ketamine, 100 of rock.

1003
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,122
Could she have delayed bleeding?

1004
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,123
It's not the chest.

1005
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,291
Pericardium's still clear.

1006
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,459
No tamponade, good EF.

1007
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,501
Lungs are up.

1008
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,628
She feels warm.

1009
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,754
We'll check a temp.

1010
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,130
Meds are on board.

1011
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,798
Belly's clear.
No bleeding here.

1012
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,884
- She's loose.
- OK. Go for it.

1013
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,639
I see cords.

1014
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,806
Looks good.

1015
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,974
I'm in.

1016
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,977
- Connect the bag.
- Nice.

1017
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,729
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

1018
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,105
Temp is 102.4.

1019
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,649
What?
Is this septic shock?

1020
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,108
OK, we need to assume
the worst here.

1021
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,818
Code sepsis.
Two sets of blood cultures,

1022
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,654
lactate, 30 per kilo of LR

1023
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,489
and for antibiotics,
ceftriaxone?

1024
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,990
No, no, she was just
in the hospital.

1025
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,450
- Pip-tazo and vanco.
- Got it.

1026
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,827
If this is sepsis,
where is it coming from?

1027
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,412
- What's the source?
- Her urinary tract infection.

1028
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,997
- She doesn't have one.
- She did when I saw her.

1029
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,457
It's not a UTI.

1030
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,667
We catheterized urine
a half an hour ago.

1031
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,336
There's no nitrates, zero WBCs.

1032
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,505
Your specimen could have been
contaminated this morning.

1033
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,840
- Is it pneumonia?
- Chest CT negative.

1034
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,885
Abdominal CT negative
for an infectious source.

1035
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,470
She was altered.
Meningitis?

1036
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,513
She's postpartum.

1037
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,682
[sighs] Endometritis.

1038
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,643
The CT of the uterus shows
a thickened endometrium,

1039
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,186
but that's normal postpartum.

1040
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,229
No retained POCs.

1041
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,522
It still could be the source.

1042
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,525
We'll do a pelvic
after she's stable.

1043
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,194
Mr. Krakozhia,
here's my obvious concern.

1044
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:04,782
I write you a script
for 30 days' worth of pills.

1045
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,117
Then what?

1046
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,827
What do you mean?
I'll take them.

1047
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,204
Well, you come back
for 30 more, right?

1048
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,706
I mean, that's the question.

1049
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,833
Even if I could give you
your dose

1050
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,501
in a once-a-month shot,

1051
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,379
you still have to come back
when the month is over.

1052
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,797
What if he didn't have to?

1053
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,007
Oh, no.
He has to.

1054
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,675
If he doesn't, he...

1055
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,051
well, he pees.

1056
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,845
We have a street team here.

1057
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,179
Mr. Krakozhia,
are you pretty much

1058
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,889
in one spot these days?

1059
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,559
Yeah, I'm over on Liberty
near the Benedum.

1060
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,560
The alley?

1061
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,978
I know it well.

1062
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,896
So we could bring
the meds to him?

1063
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,023
Absolutely.

1064
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,399
The once-a-month injection

1065
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,775
sounds like the easier option.

1066
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,403
We could just put you
on our schedule.

1067
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,364
I'd be interested
in joining that.

1068
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,283
Maybe I can bring out
the medicine myself.

1069
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,576
That'd be amazing.

1070
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,703
We could use
all the help we can get.

1071
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,371
Thanks, Doc.

1072
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,960
Yeah, purulent drainage
from the cervix.

1073
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,920
- Got the culture. Oof.
- [whistles]

1074
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,922
Looks like we have our source.

1075
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,217
The positive urine this morning
was contaminated.

1076
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,427
Maybe.

1077
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,512
Definitely.

1078
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,390
Not-so-clean catch specimen.

1079
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,768
This infection's been brewing
for a while.

1080
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,519
So the car crash
was a coincidence.

1081
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,271
Not necessarily.

1082
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,607
She was probably already septic
as the disease progressed,

1083
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,233
dropped her BP,
and passed out while driving.

1084
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,777
She wasn't hypotensive
when she arrived.

1085
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,195
Adrenaline rush
from the car crash

1086
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,738
and the sternal fracture
raised her BP

1087
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,073
- but not for long.
- Oh.

1088
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,949
No history of fever.

1089
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,118
Bet she was taking Tylenol
for the pain.

1090
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,578
Let's call ICU for an admit.

1091
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,121
Also want gyn to see her.

1092
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,794
She had mild
lower abdominal pain

1093
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,670
and a positive urine dip.

1094
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,674
No fever, no back pain
to indicate pyelonephritis.

1095
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,843
She was alert, walking, talking.

1096
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,096
It just seemed
like a simple UTI.

1097
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,931
I saw no reason to have her
wait eight hours

1098
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,225
for a bed for a pelvic exam.

1099
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,939
McKay.

1100
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,445
Every postpartum patient
needs a pelvic exam

1101
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,781
to rule out endometritis.

1102
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,826
Wait, you're saying that
with 20/20 hindsight.

1103
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,329
Did you ask about Tylenol
or ibuprofen use?

1104
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,747
Because that can mask a fever.

1105
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,165
There was no fever.

1106
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,292
Did you do
a careful abdominal exam?

1107
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,961
It was a quick chair exam,

1108
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,505
and there was only mild
tenderness over the bladder.

1109
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,633
Perhaps there was something
about the patient

1110
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,261
that made you overlook
proper treatment.

1111
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,515
Like what,

1112
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,934
other than the obvious
health risk factors?

1113
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,146
Her size doesn't inherently
make her unhealthy.

1114
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,356
Are you saying I was biased
against the patient

1115
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,024
because of her weight?

1116
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,027
I raise it as a possibility,
not as an accusation.

1117
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,029
Wow.

1118
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,158
I mean, I really don't think
that's the case here,

1119
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,369
but I will look out for it.

1120
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,371
Yeah.

1121
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,081
You were good with him.

1122
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,041
Do you get a lot of homeless
in Pittsburgh?

1123
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,334
We call them unhoused.

1124
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,836
It's not as bad
as Philly or D.C.,

1125
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,588
- but it's still pretty bad.
- Yeah.

1126

that you want to help out.

more information.

1130
