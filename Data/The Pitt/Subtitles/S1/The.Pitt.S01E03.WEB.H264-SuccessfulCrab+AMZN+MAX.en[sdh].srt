00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,930
Pittsburgh Trauma
Medical Center.

177
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,265
Why?

178
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,641
Your friend couldn't wake you.

179
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,934
I'm right here, Jenna.

180
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,269
Came to with one spray
of Narcan.

181
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,438
- What'd you take, Jenna?
- Nothing.

182
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,607
You had to have taken
something to cause this.

183
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,609
No, I was just up late studying,

184
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,110
and I just couldn't fall asleep.

185
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,029
So you took something
to help you sleep?

186
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,115
We need to know in order
to treat you properly, OK?

187
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,910
- Do you know what she took?
- No.

188
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,745
This could be a sign
of something really serious,

189
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,205
and we're gonna have to do
a lot of tests that you...

190
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,581
OK, I took, like, half a Xanax.

191
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,875
That's not nothing.

192
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,461
It's OK.
OK?

193
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,464
- Have you taken Xanax before?
- First time.

194
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,133
OK.

195
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,720
Take a deep breath for me.

196
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,016
Come on, man.
You heard Dr. Robby.

197
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,310
Let's take a break.
Grab a coffee.

198
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,813
No, I'm fine, thank you.

199
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,321
[humming melody]

200
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,123
Did you know him?

201
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,918
No, I didn't.
Did you?

202
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,170
I just met him.

203
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,839
He was my first patient to die.

204
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,093
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,180
[humming melody]

206
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,684
- Are you OK?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

207
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,687
- You sure?
- Yeah. Just I...

208
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,650
I just remember
the first time that...

209
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,653
on occasion, I have
an emotional response to death.

210
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,154
It's...

211
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,407
Got to be kind of tough
for a doctor.

212
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,160
At times, it can be.

213
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,125
At least I'm not a pathologist.
[chuckles]

214
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,710
I was joking.
I...

215
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,086
Oh.

216
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,256
I have nothing
against pathologists.

217
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,884
Yeah, no.

218
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,429
New radiodensity
in the right middle lobe.

219
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,097
Is it pneumonia?

220
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,974
Possibly, or just changes
from vaso-occlusion

221
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,392
of the sickle cells.

222
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,727
It's called
acute chest syndrome.

223
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,228
We're gonna cover you
with antibiotics

224
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,563
just to be on the safe side.

225
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,231
We've been through this before.

226
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,067
Third generation
cephalosporin and a macrolide.

227
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,487
Perfect.
You're in good hands.

228
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,365
- Can I do a chest tube?
- Which patient?

229
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,867
Any.

230
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,493
I've just never done
a chest tube before.

231
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,704
Are you really
asking me to reserve

232
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,333
any incoming injury requiring
a chest tube for you?

233
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,751
Not all of them.

234
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,753
I'd be more than happy
just doing one,

235
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,463
but, hey, if you wanted
to give me more,

236
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,590
I'd be fine with that, too,
but that's up to you.

237
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,133
I'm down for anything.

238
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,219
Confidence and ambition
are great attributes,

239
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,432
especially when paired
with respect and humility.

240
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,144
OK, what else?
What else went well?

241
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,480
We checked for reversible causes

242
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,065
of cardiac arrest on ultrasound.

243
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,067
OK, good.

244
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,985
Does anybody have anything that
they wish had gone differently?

245
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,404
In the hall, he should have
been on a cardiac monitor.

246
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,906
We would have caught
the arrest right away.

247
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,449
That's true,

248
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,284
but there was no indication
for monitoring.

249
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,370
And we now know
that his abdominal pain

250
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,747
was not from his gallstones
but from unstable angina

251
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,624
due to coronary artery disease.

252
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,542
Then we should have
admitted to cardiology.

253
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,462
Mm, we did an EKG.
We did a troponin.

254
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,381
He had a HEART score of three.

255
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,799
Who can tell me what that means?

256
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,884
1% chance of
an adverse cardiac event

257
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,302
in the next 30 days.

258
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,262
Standard of care is to discharge

259
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,973
with outpatient follow-up.

260
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,934
He was your patient,
Dr. Whitaker.

261
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,644
Would you like
to say something before

262
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,398
we all take a brief moment
of silent reflection?

263
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,109
Um... [chuckles]

264
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,444
He liked Kentucky bourbon.

265
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,196
[chuckles] OK, good.

266
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,698
[chuckles]
Me too.

267
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,658
- Anything else?
- I don't know.

268
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,369
I just met him.

269
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,663
No, he seemed nice.

270
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,957
He was married.

271
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,127
Um, that's it.
That's all I got. I...

272
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,256
- [claps]
- Mm.

273
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,050
I spoke with his wife.
She's on her way here.

274
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,553
If anyone needs to talk
about this some more,

275
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,847
I'm available.

276
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,765
For now, let's harness
some good thoughts

277
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,601
here for Mr. Milton.

278
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,864
OK, that's it.

279
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,450
Let's go save some lives.

280
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,080
Hey, Whitaker.
[clears throat]

281
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,710
- How are you feeling on this?
- [chuckles]

282
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,421
I mean, not good.
I was just talking to him.

283
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,881
Now he's dead.

284
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,257
That's the hardest way
to lose a patient.

285
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,508
It always hurts.

286
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,093
Especially when it's your fault.

287
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,512
This was not your fault.
This was nobody's fault.

288
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,723
No doctor on the planet
could have caught this.

289
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,683
Listen, it sucks,

290
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:53,021
but today, today was this guy's
day to leave this mortal coil.

291
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,231
150,000 people die
every day in the world,

292
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,234
and you got one of them,
but you learn to live with it,

293
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,278
and you learn to accept it
as much as your own mortality

294
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,905
and find balance if you can.

295
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,740
You've found balance?

296
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,617
No, not even close.

297
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,997
But, you know, you keep trying,
which is all you can do.

298
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,750
You're doing great, Whitaker.

299
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,419
- Just, you know, hang in there.
- Yeah, thanks.

300
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,670
OK.

301
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,422
- I'm just gonna go.
- Yeah.

302
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,424
But, you know,
our social worker, Kiara,

303
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,677
is here if you want to talk.

304
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,555
OK, yeah.

305
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,767
OK.

306
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,269
You're gonna recover, OK?

307
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,896
Good luck.

308
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,106
Wait, what happens now?

309
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,441
We monitor her heart
and breathing

310
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,609
for the next few hours
to make sure

311
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,819
she doesn't need more Narcan.

312
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,946
- That's it?
- Yeah.

313
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,114
You should text your friends.

314
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,492
Hell, you should text
your whole college.

315
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,077
Tell anyone who will listen

316
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,620
to not take pills
without a real prescription

317
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,623
unless they want to end up here.

318
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,834
Seriously,
fentanyl is everywhere.

319
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,378
It's in everything
on the street these days.

320
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,464
How long would I monitor
her pupils for?

321
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,799
You know what, actually,
I should go to the bathroom.

322
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,300
Are you OK on your own
till I get back?

323
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,426
Absolutely.
Take your time.

324
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,762
OK, great.
Thanks.

325
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,432
Sometimes I come on too strong.

326
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,059
Excuse me?

327
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,312
It's a defense mechanism
against insecurity.

328
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,440
- You're kidding, right?
- Yeah.

329
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,150
But I am sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

330
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,069
I really...
I want us to get along.

331
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,446
I want us to be friends.

332
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,781
And if I'm really being honest,

333
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,408
I want your mother to write me

334
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,826
a kickass recommendation letter.

335
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,494
You're going
into general surgery.

336
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,456
I might.
I'm keeping my options open.

337
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,958
You want me
to pimp out my mother

338
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,460
for something you might do?

339
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,630
OK, well, when you put it
like that, it sounds dirty,

340
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,133
and a little hot, but yes.

341
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,219
In full disclosure,
so we can be friends.

342
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,055
- Friends?
- You've heard of the concept?

343
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,183
Buddies, compatriots,
confidants, pals.

344
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,728
- They even made a show about it.
- Yeah.

345
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,231
Boom.
Come on.

346
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,859
Don't leave me hanging, Crash.
Pound that shit.

347
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,572
I can call you that
now that we're friends, right?

348
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,701
- OK.
- We'll work on that.

349
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,164
So for the apnea test,
we keep him on 100% oxygen,

350
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,291
but the ventilator
won't be giving him breaths.

351
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,543
- For how long?
- For 10 minutes.

352
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,629
We'll monitor his
carbon dioxide levels,

353
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,380
and if they come back
way too high,

354
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,007
then we'll know
that his brain stem

355
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,344
- is not telling him to breathe.
- And that means?

356
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,221
That would mean that
there's no brain function

357
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,183
at the most fundamental level.

358
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,645
Princess will monitor him,
and I will come back as soon

359
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,647
as we know the test results.

360
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,565
- OK.
- Yeah.

361
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,234
OK.

362
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,364
[indistinct chatter]

363
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,575
<i>I hate this fucking hospital.</i>

364
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,035
This is Hank.

365
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,204
- What happened?
- Nothing.

366
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,582
We were just framing, and
then my buddy Joey comes in.

367
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,418
He says, "A guy walks into
a bar with a nail in his head,"

368
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,879
and then he points his
fucking nail gun at my head.

369
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,422
So what would you do?

370
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,717
So I freaked out,
and then in the ensuing melee,

371
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,054
- he fucking shoots me.
- Melee?

372
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,057
Yeah, you know, like
a scuffle, like a donnybrook.

373
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,767
What, you think because
I work construction,

374
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,936
not a hospital, I don't have
a fucking vocabulary?

375
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,604
Tier one trauma now.

376
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,689
- No, sir, I...
- Whoa.

377
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,399
Definitely intracardiac.

378
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,359
And I got to tell you,
this fucking hurts.

379
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,695
Let's just try and relax
and dial down the F bombs.

380
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,030
- We have children in here.
- You want me to stop swearing?

381
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,865
Take the fucking nail
out of my heart.

382
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,409
And, please,
something for the pain!

383
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,952
Stabilize the nail.

384
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,953
Hank, we need to cut
your shirt off.

385
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,621
Fuck that.

386
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,289
You cut the shirt,
you're gonna buy me a new one.

387
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,709
You can have your pick
out of our lost and found.

388
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,544
Whew, how did this happen?

389
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,504
Framing nail incident
with deep penetration

390
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,673
- of the left chest.
- The fuck does it look like?

391
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,174
Hank, do you take
medicine every day?

392
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,135
- [grunts]
- Any allergies to medication?

393
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,095
No. Can you give me something
for the fucking pain already?

394
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,930
Is this a hospital
or a vet clinic?

395
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,473
Very soon, Hank.
Very soon.

396
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,434
I bet you say that
to the beagles too.

397
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,353
Pulse 120.
BP 100 over 65.

398
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,147
Two milligrams of morphine.

399
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,441
Liver GSW is in recovery.
He's good as new.

400
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,859
Whoa, that looks intracardiac.

401
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,445
- Nailed it.
- Whoa, you got jokes now.

402
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,447
No jokes, just pushing
your pain meds, buddy.

403
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,533
Small pericardial effusion,
but no evidence of tamponade.

404
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,410
- Not yet.
- Somebody talk to me.

405
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,953
Do I need a priest here?

406
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,413
He's tachycardic
with borderline BP.

407
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,748
He could decompensate.

408
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,166
Standby with two units
whole blood.

409
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,334
Garcia here.
Stat cardiac case.

410
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,462
Am I dying here
and nobody's telling me?

411
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,505
Hank, there is blood collecting

412
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,965
in the sac around your heart.

413
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,759
You need surgery
before your heart stops

414
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,135
from the pressure around it.

415
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,678
Just pull the fucking nail out!

416
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,346
That would definitely kill you.

417
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,600
I want a second opinion.
Where's my fucking phone?

418
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,144
I can Uber to Presby
and find a real hospital.

419
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,520
OR can take him in 10 minutes.

420
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,355
Mind if we intubate him first?

421
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,149
The sooner the better
for all of us.

422
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,860
Great.
120 of sux, 100 of ketamine.

423
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,196
- Javadi, you're up for this one.
- Really?

424
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,989
Now. Let's go.
Move.

425
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,033
<i>Code STEMI, ETA five minutes.</i>

426
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,994
<i>Code STEMI, ETA five minutes.</i>

427
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,662
I can start the STEMI with Mel.

428
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,539
- Sounds good.
- This place sucks.

429
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,750
I will destroy you on Yelp.

430
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,877
Nobody's ever coming
to this shithole again.

431
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,212
I swear to God.

432
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,672
From your mouth to God's ear.

433
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,050
Kiara? Hi.
I'm Dr. Melissa King.

434
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,679
- Everyone calls me Mel.
- Yes, we met.

435
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,725
Right, um, I wanted to ask you

436
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,354
about Tyler, the little boy
who ate the marijuana gummy.

437
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,731
He's been admitted
to pediatrics for observation.

438
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,567
- And his parents?
- They're upstairs with him.

439
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,403
CYF is going to follow up with
a home visit just to be safe,

440
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,864
but no police were involved.
Don't worry.

441
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,574
No one is taking
their child away from them.

442
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,076
Good.
That's a relief.

443
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,577
Yeah, the parents,
on the other hand,

444
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,663
may need couples counseling
after this,

445
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,082
but I think little Tyler's
going to be fine.

446
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,751
- STEMI with me, Mel.
- Right behind you.

447
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,754
- Dana, what's open?
- Trauma two.

448
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,589
All right, keep it that way.

449
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,135
Our target door to balloon time
for STEMIs is 51 minutes.

450
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,719
Ambitious.

451
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,556
But doable,
as you're about to find out.

452
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,642
Let's go.

453
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,437
Good view of the glottis.

454
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,940
Eyes off the screen.

455
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,443
Now look down
the mouth and insert

456
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,572
the tube around the bend.

457
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,283
You stole my med student
from triage?

458
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,535
- How's she doing over here?
- She's doing pretty good.

459
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,288
Now look back at the screen.

460
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,041
And advance through the cords.

461
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,795
Good.
Good job.

462
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,797
Thanks.

463
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,257
[vitals monitor beeping rapidly]

464
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,927
Pressure's down.
72/38.

465
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,432
Effusion has grown,
now with the RV collapse.

466
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,100
Pericardiocentesis?

467
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,977
Let's get another unit
on that infuser.

468
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,104
Prep for thoracotomy.
Coming through.

469
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,480
We should get back to triage.

470
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,982
You don't want to stay for this?

471
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,358
There are like 30 patients
still waiting

472
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,154
- to be assessed out there.
- OK.

473
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,698
- Did someone say thoracotomy?
- Crashing from tamponade.

474
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,325
Dr. Garcia, do you think I...

475
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,535
Trauma Surgery gets
left sided thoracotomies.

476
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,538
ED gets the right
if we need to extend.

477
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,998
[vitals monitor beeping rapidly]

478
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,125
Glove up, girl.
You're on suction.

479
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,003
Let's advance that ET tube
to the right main stem please.

480
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,881
Ten blade.

481
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,848
Metz.

482
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,934
Dr. Santos, how do we cut
through the intercostals?

483
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,853
Through the superior rib to
avoid the neurovascular bundle.

484
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,523
- That is correct.
- Finochietto retractor.

485
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,945
Full suction.

486
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,280
And get rid of this nail
before I get poked.

487
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,659
On it.

488
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,206
Nail's intact in one piece.

489
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:54,043
Toothed forceps.
Opening the pericardium.

490
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,711
This is so fucking cool.

491
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,755
Dr. Santos,
you and this patient

492
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,757
share a common vocabulary.

493
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,759
Yeah, I swear a lot.
I know. I'm sorry.

494
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,761
They say it's a sign
of intelligence.

495
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,389
I think it shows
a lack of self-control.

496
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,057
But what the fuck do I know?

497
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,059
Single puncture wound
to the left ventricle.

498
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,436
We've got a finger on it.

499
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,064
First unit is in.
Pressure's up.

500
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,899
Heart is filling well.

501
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,859
Throw in a horizontal mattress,
and we're out of here.

502
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,570
- Stop the bleed while I sew.
- STEMI's arrived.

503
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,072
You got this?

504
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,865
Just wrapping him up
for OR delivery.

505
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,575
2-0 Prolene on a tapered needle.

506
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,370
Mr. Ed Gellin
is 52 years young

507
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,497
with a history of hypertension
and hyperlipidemia.

508
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,541
20 minutes of
substernal chest pain.

509
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,710
10 out of 10 with
dyspnea and diaphoresis.

510
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,087
BP is 152 over 95.

511
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,089
Currently chewing
324 mgs of baby aspirin.

512
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,424
OK.

513
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,883
Blood's drawn.
Second IV started.

514
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,343
BP stable.

515
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,053
Seven millimeters
ST elevation...

516
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,722
- One nitro spray, sublingual.
- In the anterior leads.

517
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,265
Those are sometimes
called tombstones.

518
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,391
- Open up, sir.
- Tombstones?

519
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,434
Lift your tongue.

520
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,852
Mr. Gellin, you're having

521
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,395
a very big heart attack
right now.

522
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,230
Major artery that carries
oxygen to your heart

523
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,232
- is almost totally blocked.
- That doesn't sound too good.

524
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,608
No, it's not very good.

525
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,402
We're gonna send you up
to the cath lab.

526
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,737
A cardiologist is gonna
unblock that with a balloon

527
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,155
and leave it open with a stent.

528
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,489
But I'm still having
a heart attack?

529
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,116
If everything goes as planned,

530
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,909
it'll be like you never
had a heart attack.

531
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,286
We're gonna put a catheter
in this artery right here.

532
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,662
We're gonna shave
the hair with a clipper.

533
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,414
Long as you stop short
of a Brazilian.

534
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,791
It's an option we offer.
Costs a little bit more.

535
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,460
A lot of people's insurance
won't cover it.

536
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,461
[chuckles]
Don't make me laugh.

537
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,462
- It hurts.
- Deal.

538
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,921
Anybody we can call?

539
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,965
- My wife.
- Already have her number.

540
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,842
OK, we'll call her.
You hang in there.

541
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,970
I'll be right back.

542
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,806
[razor buzzing]

543
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,225
I think they finished
the apnea test on Nick.

544
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,061
- Can you check the results?
- Not just yet.

545
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,479
The blood test needs
to go to the lab.

546
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,272
It takes a few minutes
to run the test.

547
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,359
I'll come find you in the room
as soon as it's done.

548
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,946
Horizontal mattress in place
with excellent hemostasis.

549
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,324
Cut here.

550
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,620
Moist, sterile towel.
And away we go.

551
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,456
I spoke to cardiothoracic.
They can meet you in the OR.

552
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,250
Good job.

553
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,087
Coming through.

554
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,173
Well done.
Well done.

555
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,717
- Good luck, Mr. Gellin.
- Thank you so much.

556
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,470
You're very welcome.

557
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,559
Two saves.
Totally awesome.

558
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,853
I just held a beating
human heart in my hands.

559
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,522
We should celebrate.

560
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,898
We should clean these rooms

561
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,525
and bring
some more patients back.

562
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,402
- Sounds like a plan.
- No rest for the wicked.

563
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,696
- Code STEMI was fast.
- Time is myocardium.

564
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,533
And our statistics
for door to balloon time

565
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,284
get reviewed, critiqued,
and published online.

566
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,869
Door to balloon time?

567
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,830
That's the time from
when they hit our door

568
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,124
to when the angioplasty balloon
gets inflated in the cath lab.

569
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,376
We keep it to under 51 minutes,
we can reverse a heart attack

570
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,836
and save a life.

571
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,880
Kind of wish
Mr. Milton had a STEMI.

572
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,550
Thank you for letting me
go the distance on him.

573
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,718
I really thought
we'd get him back, you know?

574
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,345
Yeah, well, you know,
even though

575
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,555
you do everything right,
you don't always

576
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,683
get what you hope for.

577
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,228
My parents both had
sickle cell trait,

578
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,523
and I was screened as a newborn
with the hemoglobin FS pattern.

579
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,109
- Did you take penicillin?
- Mm-hmm, until I was five.

580
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,027
Then the vaccines kicked in.

581
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,405
She has her entire medical
history on her phone.

582
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,906
It's extremely long.

583
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,241
Dr. Mohan,
do you have a minute?

584
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,369
Yep.
Excuse me.

585
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,916
Is there a problem over there?

586
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,585
No, her pain is well controlled.

587
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,295
You understand that's
my polite way of asking

588
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,088
why are you spending
so much time with one patient?

589
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,048
You're an R3.

590
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,050
As an R3, you should be seeing
at least two patients an hour.

591
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,219
I have two,
Joyce and Mr. Wallace,

592
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,346
- our Good Samaritan.
- Who's comatose and stable.

593
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,098
You should have four by now.

594
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,933
I have the highest patient
satisfaction of anyone.

595
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,226
I don't doubt it,

596
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,603
but we just had
this conversation

597
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,854
a couple of hours ago.

598
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,439
I know people call me Slow-Mo.

599
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,274
You don't have to
confirm or deny.

600
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,611
It used to hurt my feelings
a lot, but I can't help it.

601
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,071
I work at the speed
I'm comfortable at.

602
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,200
Because you're afraid
of making a mistake?

603
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,618
I'm always afraid
of making a mistake.

604
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,619
- Aren't you?
- Yeah, of course I am.

605
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,078
But you know what I mean.

606
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,705
You make a mistake once,
and somebody dies,

607
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,081
and you feel so badly about it,

608
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,082
you'll never let it
happen again...

609
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,292
How is that wrong?

610
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,753
Because you waste time and money

611
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,588
on unnecessary tests.

612
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,174
You keep sick patients
waiting too long.

613
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,009
You miss out on cases
you could be learning from.

614
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,761
You shortchange
your own education.

615
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,429
I'm not saying this
to be a hard-ass.

616
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,931
I'm saying this because
I know you could do this,

617
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,641
but you need to do it at a level

618
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,685
- I also know you're capable of.
- And what if I'm not?

619
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,937
Then you should look
into a specialty

620
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,146
that better suits you.

621
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,981
Have you thought
about psychiatry?

622
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,107
I don't want to go
into psychiatry.

623
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,108
I want to be here.

624
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,152
Being here means

625
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,112
no matter how good you are
or how hard you try,

626
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,447
you're gonna make
another mistake,

627
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,157
and someone else might even die.

628
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:39,078
That's called being
an emergency medicine doctor.

629
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,579
And if you can't accept that,

630
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,914
then maybe this isn't
the place for you.

631
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,458
- I can accept that.
- You sure?

632
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,169
- Yes.
- OK, good.

633
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,505
Go save some lives.

634
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,342
Clear some beds
while you're at it.

635
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:57,137
I would fancy a spot of tea
at some point.

636
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,598
You want some tea, darling?
I'll get you some tea.

637
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,185
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
- Is Dr. Robby available?

638
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,937
He's with a patient.
Can I help?

639
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,690
- My father's starting to move.
- OK, I'll let him know.

640
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,025
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

641
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,485
Is it good or bad?

642
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,404
If there's no
spontaneous breathing,

643
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,532
then carbon dioxide levels
rise above 60.

644
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,994
So 82 definitely means
that Nick's brainstem

645
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,412
is not triggering him
to breathe.

646
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,997
Well, how can you fix that?

647
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,082
We can't.
I'm sorry.

648
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,042
But with rest and time...

649
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,712
This is not something
that heals on its own.

650
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,381
There's got to be
something else that we can do.

651
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,091
Nick is our only child.

652
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,219
- Is that test 100% accurate?
- It is.

653
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,888
Isn't there anything else?

654
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,057
We can do an imaging test called

655
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,143
- a cerebral perfusion study.
- Then let's do it.

656
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,728
But you have to understand
that will be the last test

657
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,688
that we would do.

658
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,232
If it comes back that there's
no blood flow to Nick's brain,

659
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,320
it would confirm beyond
a shadow of a doubt

660
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,698
that there's been brain death,

661
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,910
which would mean that he's gone.

662
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,958
Then we wait and see.

663
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,419
- Call Nuclear Medicine.
- See how soon they can take him.

664
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,795
You got it.

665
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,088
I'll be back in a few minutes.

666
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,175
- Thank you.
- [clears throat]

667
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,224
Hey, Mr. Spencer in Central 9
tried to pull out his ET tube

668
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,894
- and is now in soft restraints.
- No surprise there.

669
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,729
We need to up the propofol.

670
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,231
And the sister of the dead
MVC vet in the viewing room

671
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,400
- just arrived in Chairs.
- Can you, um...

672
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,611
- Park her in the family room?
- Please.

673
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,113
No problem, I'll have Perlah
and Princess prep the body

674
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,948
as best they can for viewing.

675
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,241
Any progress in there?

676
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,910
No.

677
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,121
Can you also keep an extra eye
on Whitaker today?

678
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,456
Oh, I'm already on it.

679
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,291
I know he lost
his first patient.

680
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,918
Yeah, I just don't want it
to throw him off his game.

681
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,296
- You think this kid has game?
- Not sure yet.

682
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,756
I want to give him
a chance to find out.

683
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,300
Copy that.

684
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,387
- Hey, fruitcake.
- [sighs] Myrna.

685
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,597
What brings you
in here today, anyway?

686
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,141
- I murdered my husband.
- Ah.

687
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,768
How did you do it this time?

688
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,021
I put him through
a meat grinder.

689
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,108
Best just to grab one
and jump back in.

690
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,859
Yeah, right.

691
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,322
Mr. Fulton in Central 14
just needs a shot of Mylanta

692
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,658
for his GERD,
and to avoid eating foods

693
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,326
with the words
"flaming hot" in their title

694
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,536
for at least a few days.

695
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,164
- OK, thanks.
- Central 14.

696
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,291
Yeah.

697
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:35,671
Could I get some Mylanta
for Mr. Fulton in Central 14?

698
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,172
It'll be a while.

699
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,966
If you want it fast,
go check out the employee

700
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,301
- first aid cabinet.
- Where is that?

701
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,846
In the lounge.
I'll show you.

702
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,182
- How's it going?
- Not so great.

703
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,476
- I lost a patient.
- So I heard.

704
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,145
I also heard
it wasn't your fault.

705
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,646
Doesn't make it feel any better.

706
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,189
Yeah, it doesn't.
I'm sorry.

707
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,191
Unfortunately,
it comes with the job.

708
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,611
If it's any consolation, I just
got scolded for going too slow.

709
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,697
If you hear someone talking
about a Slow-Mo, that's me.

710
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,949
Guaranteed you're going
faster than me.

711
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,535
I like to say it gets easier.
Some days it does.

712
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,203
I'm sure the rest of your shift
will be better.

713
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,705
- Shake it first.
- Mm-hmm.

714
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,166
Oh, but make sure
the lid is...[gasps]

715
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,710
Screwed down tight.

716
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:19,007
- OK.
- Oh.

717
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:23,510
Everyone seems
to get along like family.

718
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,347
You see a family,
I see every man for himself.

719
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,724
Actually,
that's not entirely true.

720
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,100
There is some family here.

721
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,019
Javadi's mom is
a surgeon upstairs.

722
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,604
- Really?
- Yeah.

723
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,356
- Oh, that must be so nice.
- Are you kidding?

724
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,108
I don't know about your mom,

725
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,903
but I would not want mine
working within 100 miles of me.

726
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,406
- No way.
- My mother passed.

727
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:49,495
She had a very aggressive,
malignant pheochromocytoma,

728
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,581
- so...
- Sorry.

729
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,211
Unfortunately, my mother
is gonna live forever.

730
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,214
No, she was definitely dead.
Like, I'm still shaking.

731
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,050
No, she was, like, dead.
Like dead-dead.

732
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,593
I mean, I think
her heart stopped.

733
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,220
No, she was, like,
literally dead.

734
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,847
- Think she was dead?
- Who?

735
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,891
Who she was just talking about.

736
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,434
Oh.

737
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,102
In case you didn't realize,
I use sarcasm

738
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,105
and comedy as a shield.
Or so I've been told.

739
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,149
Thank you for opening up to me.

740
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,318
- Mel, right?
- Yes.

741
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,945
Well, it was nice
talking to you, Mel.

742
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,780
It was nice talking to you too.

743
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,448
You know, I really hope
we can be fri...

744
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,576
friends.

745
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,961
Is there anything I can
assist you with, Dr. Robby?

746
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,796
I think we're best on
our own right now, thank you.

747
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,673
He keeps trying to pull away.

748
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,424
We're giving him
some more sedation.

749
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,260
Why is he so agitated?

750
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,387
He could have some awareness
of the tube in his throat

751
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,722
or that he's in a strange place,

752
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,559
or it could be lack
of oxygen to his brain.

753
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,727
- Does he need more oxygen?
- He's on 100%.

754
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,979
That's as high as it goes.

755
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,397
[vitals monitor beeping rapidly]

756
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,482
That is his blood
pressure dropping.

757
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,818
Oh, is that even fixable?

758
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,487
Normally, yes, with IV fluids,

759
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,948
but we now know that that
will just fill up his lungs,

760
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,491
drop his oxygen even more.

761
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,493
Well, isn't there
something else we can do?

762
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:15,956
We can place a long, large
IV catheter in his jugular vein

763
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,501
down into his heart
and administer Levophed,

764
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,211
which is
a very powerful medicine

765
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,131
to constrict his arteries,
raise his blood pressure.

766
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:30,053
But that could cause other
organ damage, organ failure.

767
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:35,142
I'm really sorry, but each
new step is even more invasive,

768
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:40,064
could cause more suffering
with minimal benefit.

769
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,364
Uh, hi.

770
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,658
Dr. Robby said he'd be back
in a few minutes.

771
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,662
Yeah, he's with a patient,
but I'll let him know.

772
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,206
My son is dead, isn't he?

773
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,876
I'm not a doctor,
Mr. Bradley,

774
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,463
but I do believe in God,
and I am praying for your boy

775
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,214
with every beat of my heart.

776
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,383
Thought she'd taken Xanax,
but it was actually fent.

777
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,344
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

778
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,387
Oh, one second.
Yeah?

779
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,514
- She was legitimately dead?
- Yeah, like, 100%.

780
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,977
- Mr. Bradley?
- Vince?

781
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,688
No, my dad's gonna freak out.

782
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,690
No, I know.
I know.

783
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,235
I just needed to sleep.
I thought I was.

784
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,237
Where did you get
the fucking drugs?

785
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,698
- Who are you?
- Did you give them to my son?

786
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,575
Did you give my son drugs?

787
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,077
Mr. Bradley,
you can't come in here.

788
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,870
- Mr. Bradley, please.
- Who is this?

789
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,413
- Tell me the fucking truth.
- Security!

790
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,082
It's Nick's dad.

791
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,959
- Did you drug my son?
- Where the hell's security?

792
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,627
Your son gave me
the drugs, asshole.

793
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,712
- Ask him.
- He's dead.

794
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,048
And you are a fucking liar!

795
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,220
You killed my son!
You killed my fucking son!

[drawer rattling]

799
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,065
Hey, there's no scrubs in here.

800
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,234
Yeah, you have to put
your old ones in before

801
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,194
it'll give you a new pair.

802
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,407
What?

803
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,761
Forgive me, Mr. Milton.

804
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,642
Hey, you missed
the best action of the day.

805
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,519
I heard.
What happened?

806
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,187
Father of the brain-dead son

807
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,314
goes after another patient
he thinks gave his son

808
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,191
- the drugs that killed him.
- Jesus.

809
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,945
- How do you deal with that?
- No fucking idea.

810
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,823
Whoa, what happened here?
Did we have an accident?

811
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,158
Do you think
I'm wearing this by choice?

812
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,951
Was it number one or number two?

813
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,786
I just got some stuff
spilled on me.

814
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,455
Was it a bodily fluid,
and was it yours?

815
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,998
No and no.

816
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,499
Oh, is it from when
you killed that guy?

817
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,917
I did not...

818
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,919
that guy had a massive MI
in his sleep.

819
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,838
Relax, Huckleberry,
I'm just fucking with you.

820
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,174
Truth is, you're not
a real doctor until

821
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,342
you've lost
at least one patient.

822
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,762
You got off easy.
It wasn't your fault.

823
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,599
Not all of us can take comfort
in saying that.

824
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,935
But try not
to kill anybody else.

825
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,481
- What am I looking at?
- Mr. Bill Philbin, 46.

826
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,357
He tripped while
walking his dog.

827
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,194
He saw a squirrel.
And it's my wife's dog.

828
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,862
Damn thing doesn't even like me.

829
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,864
Clearly.
Where's the dog now?

830
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,574
Hopefully in a kill shelter.

831
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,703
[keycard pad beeps]

832
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,215
Come on, baby.

Oh, yes.

836
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,190
I'm sorry.

837
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,361
I just want to understand how
this could happen to our son.

838
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:19,241
I can't stop wondering,
why Nick and not her?

839
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,159
I can't help it.

840
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,577
I think it would
be helpful for you

841
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,830
to speak with our
department social worker.

842
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,748
Would you two be open to that?

843
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:30,293
- None of this is fair.
- No.

844
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,131
- No, it's not.
- But he's still breathing.

845
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,091
The ventilator
is breathing for him.

846
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,552
Brain death is
the same as death.

847
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,428
What about that last test
that we're waiting for?

848
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,306
I can almost guarantee
it'll stay the same.

849
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,059
I'm so sorry.

850
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,438
I wish I could have done more
to save your son.

851
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,400
Our social worker, Kiara,
is here to help you

852
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,110
with anything you might need.
She's amazing.

853
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,196
I'm gonna go find her
and have her come see you.

854
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,116
Go back to the dorm,

855
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,412
and within
a couple of minutes...

856
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,916
Get dad sorted out?

857
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,793
I think so.

858
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,461
He and his wife are dealing
with a lot right now.

859
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,464
No shit.
That's a tough one.

860
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,466
Yeah.
Do you know where Kiara is?

861
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,135
Not offhand, but I can page her.

862
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,803
No, it's OK.
I'll find her.

863
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,722
I got to hit
the restroom anyway.

864
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,265
I'll tell her you're looking
for her if she comes this way.

865
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,641
- Thank you.
- Yep.

866
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,310
Now I got to pee.

867
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,855
Kevin, take Myrna to pee.

868
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,524
Ask Dana what's open,
four of morphine,

869
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,360
- and order an X-ray, OK?
- Copy.

870
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,654
Hey, closed injury,
forklift versus foot.

871
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,489
- Forklift won.
- Got it.

872
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,617
Hey, any news on
our incel kid, David?

873
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,327
Uh, I don't think
we've heard from him yet,

874
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,329
and I don't know that you
should refer to him that way.

875
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,332
Well, he did have a list of
girls' names he wanted to hurt.

876
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,168
They could be at risk.
Are the cops looking for him?

877
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,170
- Not sure we're there yet.
- OK.

878
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,838
I trust your judgment,

879
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,340
and I'm the last person
who wants to involve

880
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,883
the police in anything,

881
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,676
but you don't want to be
wrong about this one.

882
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,511
I know.
I know.

883
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,138
So what's the issue?

884
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,099
Maybe I don't want
to ruin this kid's life.

885
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,517
Well, you don't want him ruining

886
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,103
anyone else's life either.

887
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,359
Look, I've personally
been on the wrong side

888
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,444
of someone who hates women.

889
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,197
It's not a safe place to be.

890
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,450
OK?

891
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,749
- Any luck reaching David?
- Not yet.

892
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,084
Did you try calling the school?

893
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,754
He didn't show up for class.

894
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,839
Any idea where
he might have gone?

895
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,383
Friends, relatives.

896
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,551
We don't have
any family in state.

897
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:48,474
And David, he doesn't
associate with anyone.

898
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,062
Theresa, do you think that David

899
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,440
would try to hurt any of the
girls that are on that list?

900
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,025
No.

901
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,070
Do you remember some
of the names on that list?

902
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,738
Not really.

903
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,741
Maybe you could try.

904
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,416
How's she doing?

905
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,543
She's worried sick
about her son.

906
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,253
What are you going to do?

907
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,755
I thought he would come back
after mom called him.

908
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,173
Hey, what are the ethics
about me reaching out

909
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,425
to him under the guise

910
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,926
of a medical emergency with mom?

911
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,761
If he's a danger
to himself or others,

912
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,264
I'd argue you have
a professional responsibility

913
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,267
to do whatever is necessary.

914
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,436
Right.
OK.

915
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,479
Hey, can you come talk
to the parents of the OD'd kid

916
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,106
that we brought in earlier?

917
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,317
18-year-old brain-dead
from a fentanyl overdose.

918
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,444
- Oh, jeez.
- Yeah, only child.

919
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,820
And I just think
that the parents

920
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,946
could use a little help
processing

921
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,573
what they're going through.

922
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,283
What about donation?
Is he a candidate?

923
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,076
If the transplant counselor
could get him there,

924
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,619
but I think we're a ways away
from calling them in.

925
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,621
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

926
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,248
They're in Central 7.

927
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,458
I would introduce you,
but I really have to pee.

928
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,960
- No worries.
- Thank you.

929
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,337
[loud banging]

930
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,299
[metal clatters]

931
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,051
What the hell?
[laughs]

932
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,552
I just saw one of those rats.

933
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,304
And you thought
you'd start an IV?

934
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,972
It's not funny.

935
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,891
You're not the one
who's gonna have nightmares.

936
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,643
I forgot about
your phobia with rats.

937
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,896
It is not a phobia.
Nobody likes rats.

938
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,647
Some people keep them as pets.

939
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:23,318
If you are purposely
keeping a rat in your house,

940
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,153
that is not a pet.

941
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,155
That is a sign of an underlying
mental health problem.

942
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,740
OK, if it makes you
feel any better,

943
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,283
just think of them
as cute little Disney mice

944
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,659
with a pituitary condition.

945
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,495
Mm-hmm, joke all you want,

946
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,998
but if one of those disgusting
things bites a patient

947
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,833
and we get a case of hantavirus,

948
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,628
guess who's gonna have to
answer for that one, Chief.

949
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,505
Point taken.

950
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,173
What was the name of that cop
you were talking to earlier?

951
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,008
What cop?

952
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,718
The good-looking one that
you were talking to earlier.

953
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,845
- How would I know?
- It seemed like you guys had...

954
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,807
- Stay in your own lane.
- What?

955
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,517
I'm not even asking like that.

956
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,019
I really did want to talk
to him about something.

957
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,688
- Uh-huh.
- [both chuckle]

958
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,857
Hey, did the exterminator
come yet?

959
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,984
Yeah. Right.
Sometimes you can be so cute.

960
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,903
Anything like that has
to go through facilities.

961
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,031
- They said they'd handle it.
- What does that mean?

962
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,117
It means nothing's gonna
happen until next week

963
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,369
at the earliest unless
we get a patient in here

964
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,704
with a service cat.

965
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,832
Oh, don't forget,
you still have the sister

966
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,542
of Abbot's deceased veteran
waiting for you.

967
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,793
Oh, shit, yes, yes, yes.
I'll be there.

968
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,879
- I'll be there.
- Yeah, go.

969
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,549
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you.

970
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,843
We need a cardiovert
unstable AFib in North 1.

971
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,303
- OK, just give me a sec.
- Systolic's 90.

972
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,098
Fuck me.

973
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,393
35-year-old architect
working on a deadline,

974
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,396
vaping nicotine all night.
Palpitations this morning.

975
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,691
AFib at 147.
Mr. Quinn, this is Dr. Robby.

976
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,859
Hello, sir.
How are you feeling?

977
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,235
Like crap.

978
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,778
When did your
palpitations start?

979
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,071
A little while ago.

980
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,739
We interrogated his smartwatch.

981
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,074
His heart rate has only
been up for 92 minutes.

982
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,742
You understand we need to shock

983
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,411
- your heart back to normal?
- Is it gonna hurt?

984
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,247
- You'll be sedated.
- So it's really gonna hurt.

985
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,874
Mel, 75 of propofol,
slow IV push.

986
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,417
How much did you vape
last night?

987
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,794
- A couple of pods.
- You vape every day?

988
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,880
I do, but not that much.

989
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,923
- You want to cut back?
- I've tried.

990
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,592
It's just really fucking hard.

991
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,093
How much nicotine is in a pod?

992
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,887
- Anybody know?
- No idea.

993
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,597
40 milligrams,
same as a pack of cigarettes.

994
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,265
Wow, two packs in one night.

995
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,434
Mel, what's the safe window
for cardioversion?

996
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,895
- 12 hours.
- What happens after that?

997
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,938
Increased risk of embolic stroke

998
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,523
from left atrial blood clot.

999
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,901
Which he does not have.

1000
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,111
Mr. Quinn.
Mr. Quinn.

1001
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,529
OK, he's out.

1002
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,239
Sync cardioversion
at 200 joules.

1003
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,783
- Charged.
- Clear.

[vitals monitor beeping]

1005
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,456
- Bingo.
- Sinus rhythm.

1006

Cycle BP.

1007
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,459
We'll monitor for a few hours.

1008
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,127
Yeah, let's get addiction
services on the case too.

1009
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,629
He's gonna need a daily patch

1010
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,422
and nicotine gum
for breakthrough cravings.

1011
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,965
This one's a bitch to kick.

1012
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,759
Hey, the sister of Abbot...

00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,470
Shit, yes.
Shit, yes, yes.

Go get 'em, tiger.

1015
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,523
Are you Mr. Orser's sister?

1016
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,025
- Fiona.
- Hi, Fiona.

1017
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,318
I'm Dr. Robinavitch.

1018
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,861
Everybody calls me Dr. Robby.

1019
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,322
Have a seat, please,
and I will tell you

1020

everything that's happened.

1021
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,246
Are you looking for
something in particular?

1022
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,415
Anything with a very low
potential for mortality.

1023
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,501
Mm-mm.
You're not playing that game.

1024
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,461
Only thing I'm playing is
let's keep the patients alive.

1025

Uh-huh, well, now we're
playing face your fears.

1026
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,592
That sounds like
a terrible game.

1027
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,177
What up there
scares you the most?

Oh, I'm sorry.

1053
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,437
That's an inappropriate request.

No, not at all, not at all.

1055
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,400

or you can use my first name

Always, in case
somebody needs to move it.

1097

Yeah, you probably
shouldn't have done that.

Why don't you come on
inside, Ziggler?

It happens.

1103
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,404
What can you do to make him
more comfortable?

1104
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,781
We can take the tube out.

1105
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,116
But he needs that to breathe.

1106
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,954
If we extubate, we would
keep him on oxygen for comfort.

1107
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,915
We would decrease his sedation.

1108
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,292
He might regain consciousness.
He could recognize you.

1109
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,961
Maybe even speak.

1110
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,796
Well, I don't want to do
anything to jeopardize

1111

- him getting better.
- That's just the point, Helen.

1112
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,260
He's never getting better.

1113
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,470
- You don't know that.
- I do know that, OK?

1114
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,430
He knows that.

1115
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,308
And Dad probably even knows it.

1116
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,769
It's time to let him go.

1117
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,646
I'm sorry if you've
had your fill of Dad,

1118
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:43,234
but I haven't, and I am
not giving up on him.

1119
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,445
Even if it's hurting him?

1120
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,324
I'm sorry, but if there was
anything I could do

1121
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,326
to heal your father,
I would do it.

1122
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,495
But the most humane thing
that I can do for him

1123
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:58,457
is to allow him a painless,
peaceful passing,

1124
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,044
and that requires removing
the breathing tube.

1125
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,966
How long will it take
once the tube's out?

1126
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,843
From minutes to hours,

1127
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,513
but we would ensure that he'd
be in no physical discomfort.

1128
