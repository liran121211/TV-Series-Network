1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,053
[sighs]

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,098
[inhales sharply]

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,600
[grunts]

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,103
[sobs]

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,232
[sighing]

6
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,738
[door opening]

7
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,825
[indistinct chatter]

8
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,841
[breathing shakily]

9
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,437
16 is open.

10
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,314
How come nobody's been...

11
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,066
my bad, it's taken.

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,650
Sorry.

13
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,652
Mr. Louie was
found unresponsive

14
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,197
and on the sidewalk next
to Fine Wine and Good Spirits.

15
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,948
Decent vitals, no head trauma.

16
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,825
Didn't we just discharge him
a couple hours ago?

17
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,119
Yeah.
Stone-cold sober at 7:00 a.m.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,537
[sniffs] Oh, God.

19
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,663
Don't light any matches.

20
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,998
Hey, Doc, how you doing?

21
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,291
Not as good as you, Louie.

22
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,834
Hey, you know it, Doc.

23
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,336
How much did you have
to drink, Louie?

24
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,922
Uh, just a couple
of shots of vodka.

25
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,006
So like a half-gallon?

26
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,091
Oh, hell no.

27
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,675
Just... just a quart.

28
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,010
If you overexaggerate
with your question,

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,136
you usually get
a truthful answer.

30
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,846
Learned from the best.

31
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,807
Uh, he's got Librium
from this morning.

32
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,266
That's what I prescribed him.

33
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,186
All right, Louie,
let's scoot it on over.

34
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,897
You want to guess
the blood alcohol level?

35
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,482
Why would I want to do that?

36
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,691
I don't know, because it's fun?

37
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,485
You prescribed 20 Librium.

38
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,903
There's only 10 left.

39
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,655
See you next time.

40
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,240
Uh, shouldn't we be
concerned about an overdose?

41
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,533
Oh, no.

42
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,368
Vodka is Louie's drug of choice.

43
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,536
Quickest way to kill the shakes.

44
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,954
Oh, true that.

45
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,955
Where did the other 10 pills go?

46
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,956
I don't know.

47
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,374
Maybe, uh, lost, stolen.

48
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,376
Maybe he sold them
to buy the vodka.

49
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,169
What'd you do with
the other pills, Louie?

50
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,170
In my pocket.

51
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,463
I didn't need them.

52
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,176
[groans]
Come on, give it a rest.

53
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,559
Is everything OK with Collins?

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,562
She seems fine to me,
unlike our patient board.

55
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,604
How's the Kraken?

56
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,064
Sleeping like a baby.

57
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,482
What's the story
with beds upstairs?

58
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,192
A ladder fall took
the last ICU bed.

59
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,570
One tele bed's open,
no med-surge, no pedes.

60
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,654
So which one of our 21 boarders

61
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,239
is going to win the lottery?

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,491
CHF exacerbation's been
with us for two days.

63
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,909
Sounds like a winner.

64
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,161
The rest will receive our lovely

65
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,579
consolation prize package.

66
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,080
- Tell them what they won, Dana.
- Stop.

67
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,957
It's another 24 hours
of bright lights,

68
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,208
screaming trauma patients,
hard gurneys,

69
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,626
and sleep deprivation,

70
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,128
all while you wait
for a bed upstairs.

71
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,421
Hey, uh, Nandi,

72
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,755
the influencer in Central Eight,

73
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,756
still waiting for psych?

74
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,924
Nope. She's a keeper.

75
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,967
Her mercury levels are sky high

76
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,135
from that face cream.

77
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,179
I ordered chelation TID,

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,889
10 per kilo of DMSO.

79
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,724
I'll make sure it comes up
from pharmacy.

80
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,766
Great pickup.

81
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,560
Hey. You OK?

82
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,437
Excuse me.

83
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,855
I'm sorry, Dr. Robinavitch?

84
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,607
- Yes, that is me.
- Father McGill.

85
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,941
Here to see
John and Lily Bradley.

86
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,359
Oh, yes.
Thank you for coming.

87
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,736
No problem.

88
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,738
I will take you
to the family room.

89
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,906
Dana, I need some help.

90
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,657
What's up?

91
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,992
I've been trying to check
the nursing notes on Louie

92
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,952
from 7:00 a.m. this morning.

93
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,788
Uh, Langdon ordered lorazepam,
but I don't think it was given.

94
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,624
Yeah, lorazepam ordered,
dispensed,

95
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,210
and then returned unused
to the PDS per Dr. Langdon,

96
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,128
as patient's tremor
had resolved.

97
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,254
Is that unusual?

98
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,797
No, it happens all the time.

99
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,466
You think that could be
the vial I couldn't open

100
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,759
on our seizure patient?

101
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,469
Possibly.

102
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,970
Can we check
the other vials in the PDS?

103
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,222
Make sure they're OK?

104
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,765
- If you really want to.
- I do.

105
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,308
All right, come on.

106
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,268
Dysuria in North Two's
been waiting a long time.

107
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,353
I'll take it.

108
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,021
Oh, Dr. King.

109
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,022
Rita!

110
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,023
We were so worried.

111
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,107
Oh, I'm so sorry.

112
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,817
My phone was on silent.

113
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,486
I missed 10 calls
from the hospital.

114
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,654
Is my mom OK?

115
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,197
Oh, yeah, she's fine.

116
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,325
[sighs]
Uh, I went to move my car,

117
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,661
and it was so peaceful
and quiet when I parked

118
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:10,082
in the garage, I dozed off.

119
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,959
I'm just really glad
you're back.

120
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,460
Oh, your mom is
going to be so happy.

121
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,795
She's... she's waiting
in the hall.

122
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,171
OK.

123
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,049
So if I order
lorazepam for Louie,

124
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,635
the log shows me
we have five vials left.

125
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,304
[clanging, whirring]

126
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,307
Take one out, and now
we have four left.

127
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:31,353
But if I click that I want
to return one unused,

128
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,481
you put it back,
and the computer count

129
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,316
goes back up to five.

130
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,317
Yeah.

131
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,318
Same lot numbers.

132
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,611
Everything looks good.

133
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,696
No way of knowing which vial

134
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,281
was returned by Dr. Langdon.

135
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,824
Yeah, I guess.

136
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,617
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

137
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,828
Old man coming in
with a heart rate of 30.

138
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,329
Sounds like pacemaker failure.

139
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,914
Could be a good case.

140
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,916
Putting an amputation in 15.

141
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,543
Ooh, that one sounds
even better.

142
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,045
Yeah.

143
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,673
Rocco DeJulio.

144
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,049
Amputation
of the fourth fingertip

145
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,510
at the base of the nail,
bone exposed.

146
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,220
Uh, how'd this happen?

147
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,515
I, uh... I crushed it
under an air conditioning unit

148
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,683
we were installing.

149
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,143
We'll numb up your finger.

150
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,312
One shot will help
with the pain.

151
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,521
Amazing.

152
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,647
Digital block,

153
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,566
three ccs of marcaine.

154
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,736
Pulse 110,
BP 135 over 88 in triage.

155
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,112
Any drug allergies, sir?

156
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,238
Uh-uh.

157
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,364
Two grams of Cefazolin?

158
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,199
Uh-huh.

159
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,870
[inhales sharply] Oh, wow.

160
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,081
Go with the block.

161
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,082
Are you ready?

162
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,709
Mm-hmm.

163
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,211
Pinprick and some burning.

164
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,589
Uh, where's the missing
piece of skin?

165
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,426
It's, um, under
a thousand-pound unit.

166
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,428
It's flat as a pancake.

167
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,221
Well, then we have
nothing to reattach.

168
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,890
Plan, Dr. McKay?

169
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,100
Bone rongeur, V-Y flap.

170
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,894
- Exactly.
- Awesome.

171
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,480
I picked the right case.

172
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,815
Can somebody translate?

173
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,108
To close the wound,

174
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,651
we're going to trim down
the bone,

175
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,278
then use a plastic
surgery trick so the skin

176
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,404
will cover everything.

177
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,947
OK.

178
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,783
Your finger is going to be
a little shorter.

179
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,076
No nail.

180
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,619
Great.

181
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,287
10% off manicures.

182
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,498
[laughs]

183
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,958
Looks like they found
you guys a new rig.

184
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,293
Nah, we Ubered.

185
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,045
Willie Alexander,
81, near syncope

186
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,546
from the Memory Day Center.

187
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,672
They said he's more
altered than usual.

188
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,633
Pulse is 30, BP's 80 over 40.

189
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,676
No change with
a mig of atropine.

190
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,929
He's got a pacer in his chest,
but there's no capture.

191
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,639
How are you feeling,
Mr. Alexander?

192
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,140
Call me Willie.

193
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,350
I'm fine, I'm fine.

194
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,476
Any chest pain?

195
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,602
No, ma'am.

196
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,145
Do you take beta blockers?

197
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,731
I take walks every day.

198
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,982
Only med is Namenda.

199
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,983
On my count.

200
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,151
One, two, three.

201
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,112
[grunts]

202
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,489
Pacemaker patient with dementia.

203
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,949
Heart rate of 30.

204
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,659
A little altered
with a systolic of 80.

205
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,244
What's your plan,
Dr. Langdon?

206
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,329
Second mig of atropine now.

207
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,290
Push dose epi, 0.1 milligram.

208
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,333
Portable chest.

209
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,043
31 on the monitor.

210
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,962
Dr. Javadi, what do you think
of that heart rate?

211
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,463
Uh, it's not beta blockers,
so junctional escape rhythm?

212
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,548
Exactly... common with

213
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,007
a non-functioning pacemaker.

214
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,217
Etiology, Dr. Mohan?

215
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,177
Dead battery or lead failure?

216
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,595
Indeed.

217
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,681
Good squeeze,
even if it is slow.

218
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,182
Atropine and epi on board.

219
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,600
What's next, Dr. Langdon?

220
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,185
We can try percutaneous pacing,

221
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,937
but eventually,
he'll need transvenous.

222
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,105
Agreed.

223
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,273
Systolic's up to 95 with epi.

224
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,024
[wheezes] It's too low.

225
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,651
Let's start a drip.

226
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,403
Two mikes per minute.
Check the mental status.

227
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,737
Um, he knows his name.

228
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,489
Sir, do you know
what year it is?

229
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,867
Um, it's 20-something.

230
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,909
Uh...

231
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,202
Do you know where you are?

232
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,371
It looks like a hospital to me.

233
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,581
Pittsburgh Trauma
Medical Center.

234
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,582
Yep.

235
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,459
Yep, I know this place.

236
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,211
It's Dr. Adamson's place.

237
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,212
Where's he at?

238
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,715
He working today?

239
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,134
Are you feeling any pain?

240
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,469
No, that shot worked great.

241
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,470
OK.

242
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,346
Just like this.

243
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,849
[snips]

244
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,517
Uh, how far down?

245
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,394
Just so the sub-Q will cover.

246
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,104
You'll need to take
a few days off work, sir.

247
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,564
Good.
More time to study.

248
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,565
Oh, yeah?

249
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,566
For what?

250
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,775
Uh, master's degree.

251
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,903
- Psychology.
- Oh, no kidding.

252
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,071
Yeah.
HVAC's just my day job.

253
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,908
I went to trade school because
I couldn't afford college.

254
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,743
Now I can.

255
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,746
Good on the rongeur.

256
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,915
Marking the surgical borders.

257
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,459
Two incisions.

258
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,254
Advance the triangle
to cover the tip.

259
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,964
Until the V becomes a Y?

260
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,842
Exactly.

261
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,428
I guess you're the boss here?

262
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,096
Something like that.

263
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,599
You're very good at teaching.

264
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,975
Seriously.

265
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,602
You step back,
and with a few words,

266
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,271
you impart wisdom.

267
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,106
If you say so.

268
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,652
Do you mind if I ask what
you do when you don't work?

269
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,237
Sleep.

270
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,866
Now a blunt dissect
to undermine the tissue.

271
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,203
What do you think,
Dr. Javadi?

272
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,538
Third degree.

273
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,580
- Complete heart block.
- Because?

274
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,957
AV dissociation.

275
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,542
No relationship
between the P waves

276
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,793
and the QRS complexes.

277
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,794
Clear.

278
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,462
Heart rate is 30.

279
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,381
His low BP is going to make
him a lot more confused.

280
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,967
Could cause a heart attack
or a stroke if we don't fix it.

281
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,968
Oh.

282
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,427
Well, mystery solved.

283
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,595
The wires aren't even touching.

284
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,972
They're totally disconnected.

285
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,098
Shit happens.

286
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,307
Heart rate still in low 30s.

287
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,600
No change with atropine.

288
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,643
Pacing pads are on.

289
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,061
We can try.

290
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,647
Willie, your pacemaker
isn't working.

291
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,482
Well, you better fix it.

292
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,276
We're going to try to pace
your heart from the outside.

293
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,777
You might feel it in your chest.

294
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,612
Let's start at 10 milliamps,
rate of 60.

295
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,240
Pacer on.

296
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,951
I'm twitching.

297
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,536
No capture.

298
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,037
Increase to 20 milliamps.

299
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,622
Now it's more like a shock.

300
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,623
Still no capture.

301
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,624
Up to 30.

302
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,625
[beeps]

303
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,168
Whoa!

304
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,712
- Y'all trying to electrocute me?
- Pacer off.

305
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,796
- Can't tolerate it.
- Get rid of this shit!

306
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,797
Dr. Langdon?

307
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,881
One of versed.

308
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,300
Can we set up for transvenous?

309
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,052
I was set up
before you got here.

310
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,472
Versed's on board.

311
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,850
Willie, we need to float
a temporary pacemaker

312
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,185
from your neck into your heart.

313
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,520
Why is that?

314
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,355
Because your heart rate
is only 30.

315
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:11,276
Then, uh, hit me with,
uh, a shot of atropine.

316
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,361
You've already had three.

317
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,988
Wait, are you a doctor?

318
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,491
[wheezing, snoring]

319
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,328
He's out.

320
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:27,709
Ginger, what do you think
about having some help at home?

321
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,755
I think Rita could use
a little break

322
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,091
every now and then.

323
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,885
We can't afford it.

324
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,555
Oh, um, Kiara told me
about DHS senior phone line.

325
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:45,393
It's part of AAA,
the Area Agency on Aging.

326
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,229
They make referrals
for in-home services.

327
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,065
Uh, what's that going to cost?

328
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,900
Medicare will cover
short-term home care,

329
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,403
at least 10 hours a week.

330
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,614
Ginger, have you ever
been to a senior center?

331
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,740
I went once.

332
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,784
Nothing but old people.

333
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,744
AAA also has senior companions

334
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,245
for a few hours a day.

335
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,914
And if Rita needs to be away
at lunchtime,

336
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,209
the OPTIONS program
can deliver a meal.

337
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,341
Uh, is everything all right?

338
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,593
Yeah.

339
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,595
Did I say something
that upset you?

340
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,098
[sniffles] No, it's all good.

341
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,435
This is...[sniffles]

342
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,314
This is way more
than I expected, so...

343
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,488
Bam.

344
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,657
Internal jugular accessed.

345
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,784
Pulse ox 99 on five liters.

346
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,327
Systolic's 95 on epi.

347
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,745
That's good enough
to perfuse the brain.

348
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,747
Guidewire.

349
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,833
You doing OK
under there, Willie?

350
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,251
I guess.

351
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,919
So this is just
like a triple lumen?

352
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,588
Except you need a big seven
French introducer

353
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,631
to fit the pacing wire.

354
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,926
[machinery beeping]

355
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,929
I could use some air.

356
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,681
Is that any better?

357
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,475
[sighs] What y'all doing?

358
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,770
We're putting a temporary
wire into an external pacemaker

359
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,315
until you can have surgery to
repair the one in your chest.

360
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,109
Heart rate's still 31.

361
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,487
Bradycardia.

362
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,489
Are you a doctor, Willie?

363
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,617
[chuckling]

364
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,578
Yeah, right.

365
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,081
No mention of any medical
career in his past records.

366
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,458
Just mild dementia.

367
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,668
"Are you a doctor?"

368
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,753
That's a good one.

369
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,837
[laughs]

370
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,547
OK, last one.

371
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,675
How's it look?

372
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,843
Perfect.

373
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,052
Uh, Xeroform and tube gauze?

374
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,179
Mm-hmm.

375
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,847
What's up, party people?

376
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,724
Uh, V-Y flap.

377
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,893
Nicely done.
Can I borrow Dr. Santos?

378
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,353
As long as Dr. McKay
can finish the dressing.

379
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,814
Sure.

380
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,694
[sighs]

381
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,698
I can't stop thinking
about your foot.

382
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,200
Uh, you know what I mean.

383
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,994
- I'm... I'm sorry, but...
- I know. Move on.

384
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,455
- I already did.
- OK.

385
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,373
There's a high-maintenance
surgery clinic patient

386
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,335
down here...
as in total pain in the ass.

387
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,670
I could use your help
distracting her.

388
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,381
So we're... we're good?

389
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,009
Every hero needs a sidekick.

390
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,844
I need to find
a tube gauze cage.

391
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,554
I'll be right back.

392
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,682
You'll need to elevate,
antibiotics three times a day

393
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,061
for a week,
a couple of painkiller tablets,

394
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,064
but try to get by
on Tylenol and ibuprofen.

395
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,149
Are you OK?

396
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,359
Is today a bad day?

397
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Drowning victim.

398
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,112
ETA three minutes.

399
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,949
Sorry, I got to go.

400
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,036
20 centimeters
clears the cordis.

401
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,248
Pacing box rate of 80,
five milliamps.

402
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,249
Confirmed.

403
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,750
On ventricular setting.

404
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,628
Passing to 30,
just outside the heart.

405
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,213
Why do we inflate
the balloon now?

406
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,589
So it'll float
into the right ventricle.

407
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,716
Exactly.
And we're looking for?

408
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,969
An injury pattern,
since it's below the AV node.

409
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,136
Looking good.

410
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,931
Check the pulse.

411
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,516
Strong radial. Really strong.

412
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,685
Man, I feel like I just woke up.

413
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,270
Nice work, Dr. Langdon.

414
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,771
Systolic's up to 130.

415
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,606
How do you feel?

416
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,733
Feel like a million bucks.

417
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,278
Widened QRS on the scope.

418
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,572
Willie, did you used
to work at this hospital?

419
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,573
Hell, no.

420
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,199
I just brought the mail.

421
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,534
Can we steal Javadi?

422
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,119
Absolutely.

423
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,413
Time to shine, Crash.

424
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,623
Do you have time
to write the procedure note?

425
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,041
No problem.

426
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,251
I'll be at Central
if you need me.

427
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,878
Oh, jeez.

428
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,796
I still need to tell Nandi
about her mercury level.

429
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,674
The average emergency doctor
gets pulled from task A

430
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,634
to task B every
three to five minutes.

431
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,636
Remind me again why
we picked this specialty?

432
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,138
Because we all have ADHD,

433
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,433
and anything else would be
boring as hell.

434
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,813
[indistinct chatter]

435
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,525
Another ICU admission.

436
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,319
I'll call to confirm.

437
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,154
Dr. Collins, do you think
that we might be able to...

438
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,196
Drowning victim here.

439
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,490
Not right now.

440
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,327
Amber Phillips, six years old.

441
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,287
Found at the bottom of a home
pool with an unknown downtime.

442
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,997
Asystole on the monitor.

443
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,500
Intubated with a cuffed 4.5,
22-gauge left AC,

444
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,169
0.25 epi three minutes ago.

445
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,796
One, two, three.

446
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,215
OK.

447
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,302
Whitaker, take over
compressions.

448
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,012
- Any family coming in?
- Grandma and little sister.

449
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,723
Fast and deep.

450
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,099
Ready?

451
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Yeah.

452
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,186
Go.

453
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,187
She's really cold.

454
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,188
OK.

455
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,732
Get a core temp.

456
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,485
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

457
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,861
Should we use the Lucas?

458
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,404
No, she's way too small
for that.

459
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,907
- Rectal temp only 85.
- What do you think, Mel?

460
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,201
Uh, she's cold.
Moderate hypothermia.

461
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,702
We need to get her up to 90
if we have any chance

462
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,703
of restarting her heart.

463
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,747
250 ccs heated saline.

464
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,082
Set up the Arctic Sun.

465
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,375
Continuous core temp monitoring,

466
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,709
and prep another epi 0.25.

467
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,253
Yep.

468
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,757
Preemptive orders done.
Let's go.

469
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,676
I just... I don't understand
why you need me.

470
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,928
Crohn's disease status
post colectomy 10 years ago,

471
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,846
now with severe abdominal pain.

472
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,391
Could be perforation,
fistula, obstruction.

473
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,184
Great teaching case.

474
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,354
[groaning] Someone give me
something for the pain!

475
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,480
[moans]

476
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,564
Good afternoon, Ms. Walker.

477
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,066
I'm Dr. Garcia from surgery.

478
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,693
This is Dr. Santos and Javadi.

479
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,069
It looks like you're in
a lot of pain.

480
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,362
No shit!

481
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,488
We ordered you some morphine.

482
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,489
Did you read my chart?

483
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,907
I'm allergic to morphine!

484
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,701
I'll puke my guts out.

485
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,869
That's a side effect,
not an allergy.

486
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,204
Oh, give me some Dilaudid.

487
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,205
OK.

488
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,581
One milligram Dilaudid.

489
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,582
I'll grab it from the PDS.

490
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,709
One is never enough.

491
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,710
I need two, sometimes four.

492
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,752
Got it.

493
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,462
Pertinent history, Javadi?

494
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,297
Um, have you had
any fever or vomiting?

495
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,217
[groans]
Shut up with your questions!

496
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,885
Ma'am, we can't help you
if we don't know your...

497
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,303
If you want to help me,
get me my doctor.

498
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,596
Dr. Shamsi.

499
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,390
10 years,
no one knows me better.

500
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,100
I don't want to talk
to anybody else.

501
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,269
I'm very sorry,
but she's in surgery right now.

502
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,937
- How long?
- Unknown.

503
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,272
[moans]

504
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,066
But ma'am, right here we have

505
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,318
Dr. Shamsi's daughter,
Victoria.

506
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,613
She's the next best thing.

507
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,616
[groaning]

508
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,911
Time for another epi.

509
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,621
Dr. Robby?

510
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,499
I'll be right back.

511
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,130
Uh, my wife and I decided.

512
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,798
We're on board
with organ donation.

513
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,092
Oh, I'm really glad to hear it.

514
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,595
Uh, the church supports
their decision.

515
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,722
The OPO is sending an ambulance.

516
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,600
I'll be staying with the family.

517
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,269
[sighs]

518
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,312
How's it going in there?

519
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,647
Oh, not good. Not good.

520
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,024
- Robby.
- Yeah?

521
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,609
For the little girl
in Trauma One,

522
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,487
this is grandmother Frances
and sister Bella.

523
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,988
Hi, I'm Dr. Robinavitch.

524
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,490
How is she?

525
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,866
Um...

526
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,659
Bella, would you like to color?

527
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,786
Maybe get a snack?

528
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,329
Yes, please.

529
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,830
My name is Kiara.

530
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,499
Let's find you some crayons.

531
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,833
I like to draw.

532
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,834
Let's do it.

533
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,504
Come on.

534
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,715
They are still doing CPR.

535
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,841
Can I please see her?

536
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,885
Yes, of course.

537
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,220
Got Grandma coming in.

538
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,097
You can sit right
by the bedside.

539
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,306
Ready to switch?

540
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,642
Go.

541
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,978
Here you go, ma'am.

542
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,188
You can hold her hand.

543
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,523
She wasn't breathing,

544
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,982
so the medics put a tube
in her throat.

545
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,192
She's so cold.

546
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,610
We're warming her up.

547
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,986
That way,
she'll have a better chance

548
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,364
to respond to the medicines.

549
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,617
They moved a bench
next to the pool fence

550
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,286
so they could go over,

551
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,789
because their soccer ball
went in the water.

552
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,208
Amber couldn't make it
out of the deep end.

553
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,709
The gate was locked.

554
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,836
I was vacuuming.

555
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,671
I didn't hear them.

556
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,758
[sniffles, sighs]

557
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,760
My mercury level is 94?

558
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,096
That's high enough to cause
all your symptoms...

559
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,724
insomnia, tremors,
imbalance, psychosis.

560
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,893
From a stupid face cream?

561
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,728
We're going to start
chelation therapy.

562
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,106
It's a medication that binds
with the mercury

563
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,941
and helps your body excrete it.

564
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,860
And then I'll be back to normal?

565
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,403
I don't know.

566
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,405
Are any of us normal?

567
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,240
Where's my phone?

568
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,867
They locked it away
with all your valuables.

569
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,076
I... I need my phone.

570
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,578
OK.

571
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,037
But when you post,
you have to tell everyone

572
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,873
- not to use the cream.
- Definitely.

573
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,915
Can I borrow your phone?

574
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,417
Just the camera.

575
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,002
I was wearing a wig
when I left my apartment

576
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,753
and I had a wig
when I came in, right?

577
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,673
Not when you came in.

578
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,468
Oh my God.

579
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,181
I look like shit.

580
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,062
- How is he doing?
- Stable.

581
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,106
Scheduled for a new pacer
tomorrow with cardiology.

582
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,816
- Great.
- Robby.

583
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,818
Parents of T1.

584
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,944
This is Dr. Robby.

585
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,404
Where's Amber?
Is she OK?

586
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,780
What have you heard?

587
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,616
That she got pulled
from the pool.

588
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,950
She wasn't breathing,

589
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,619
so we're doing that for her now.

590
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,329
And we're trying to get
her heart started again.

591
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,581
Wait, her heart stopped?

592
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,832
I have to be with her.

593
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,125
Of course.

594
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,418
There are a lot
of people in here

595
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,794
right now trying to help her.

596
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,922
We understand.

597
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,923
Amber.

598
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,966
Oh my God, Amber!

599
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,635
I'm here.
I love you.

600
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,677
I love you so much.

601
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,262
Gina, I am so sorry.

602
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,430
Where's Bella?

603
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,057
She's with our social worker.

604
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,767
Oh, I should be with her.

605
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,768
I'll go with you, Mom.

606
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,228
I'll be right back.

607
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,064
OK. Come on.
She's just down the hall.

608
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,817
- Hang on. We got it.
- Oh.

609
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,362
[sobs]

610
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,322
Rhythm check.

611
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,990
Hold compressions.

612
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,284
[machinery flatlines]

613
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,285
Asystole.

614
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,121
Resume compressions.

615
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,498
Three minutes
since the last epi.

616
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,582
Push another.

617
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,167
Did you shock the heart?

618
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,627
Uh, no.

619
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,337
Why didn't you shock the heart?

620
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,130
We've got to save her.
You've got to shock the heart.

621
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,507
Heart rhythm right
now is flatlining.

622
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,300
That's not treatable
with a shock.

623
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,635
We're trying to get the rhythm
to change to something

624
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,178
we can shock by warming her up.

625
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,055
OK.
So we've got to warm up.

626
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,515
You've got to get some more
blankets in here or something.

627
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,683
We are giving her
warm IV fluids,

628
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,184
and you can feel
these blue pads.

629
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,477
They have warm water
running through them

630
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,980
like a hot tub.

631
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,194
Are you sure
you're doing everything?

632
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,738
Yes, we are.

633
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,491
[sniffles]

634
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,869
Amber, honey, I'm here.

635
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,496
It's going to be OK.

636
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,709
I promise you,
everything's going to be OK.

637
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,377
I can't take much longer!

638
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,838
I've got Dr. Shamsi
on speakerphone from the OR.

639
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,881
Eileen, how soon
can you get here?

640
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,383
<i>I'm finishing a lap chole.</i>

641
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,384
<i>Shouldn't be long.</i>

642
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,052
Your daughter is here.

643
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,013
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

644
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,889
Minimal relief
with two of Dilaudid.

645
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,349
<i>She needs four.</i>

646
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,726
That's what
I've been telling them!

647
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,185
We're titrating.

648
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,729
We didn't want her
to stop breathing.

649
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,689
- <i>Is Dr. Garcia with you?</i>
- Right here.

650
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,690
<i>How's the exam?</i>

651
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,066
Rigidity with guarding.

652
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,901
<i>Sounds like peritonitis.</i>

653
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,362
<i>Two sets of blood cultures
and 3.375 of Zosyn.</i>

654
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,573
<i>Make sure she's next
in line for a CT scan.</i>

655
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,866
<i>Bump everyone else.</i>

656
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,242
<i>Do you understand? Victoria?</i>

657
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,910
- Got it.
- <i>See you soon.</i>

658
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,911
Thank you, Eileen.

659
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,079
[dial tone]

660
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,748
Ready for some more Dilaudid?

661
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,416
God, yes.

662
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,542
Victoria will make sure
all of Dr. Shamsi's

663
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,752
orders are followed.

664
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,794
Call if you need us.

665
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,047
Yeah.

666
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,966
Great move bringing in Javadi.

667
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,428
Is this patient payback
for dropping the scalpel?

668
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,597
Look at the bright side...
if she goes to the OR for perf,

669
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,681
you can scrub in.

670
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,433
I'll coach you.

671
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,851
You'll make a brilliant first
impression on Dr. Shamsi.

672
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,562
- Really? You'd do that?
- Mm-hmm.

673
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,356
Thanks.

674
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,611
I, um... I have something
unusual to ask.

675
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,696
OK.

676
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,115
I've been on two cases
with Langdon,

677
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,534
and there have been
irregularities

678
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,120
with benzos...
Lorazepam with a seizure,

679
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,747
Librium with an alcoholic.

680
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,790
And?

681
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,250
And I'm concerned.

682
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,252
Concerned about what?

683
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:04,340
[sighs]
That he could be stealing.

684
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,633
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

685
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,301
I insult the shit
out of Langdon,

686
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,969
but he's a great doctor.

687
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,846
I've never seen him impaired.

688
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,681
What do I do?

689
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,809
You've been here
for, what, seven hours?

690
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,686
Just do your job.

691
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,732
[scoffs]

692
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,072
[sighs]

693
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,284
Kind of a weird vibe out here.

694
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:36,330
Yeah, pediatric drowning
will do that.

695
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,790
Glad I didn't end up in there.

696
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,668
Yeah, you and me both.

697
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,421
Uh, what's with the scarf?

698
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,964
Oh, it's from
the lost and found,

699
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,340
for my patient in Central Eight.

700
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,341
Cool.

701
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,343
I'm off to North Two.

702
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,262
Dysuria.

703
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,682
What happened to
two visitors a patient?

704
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,934
It's the fentanyl overdose.

705
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,769
There's going to be
an honor walk.

706
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,522
He's an organ donor.

707
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,815
Well, see you later.

708
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,984
See you.

709
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,243
Myrna?

710
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,164
Myrna!

711
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,416
Oh, no. No, not today.

712
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,543
- Myrna!
- [gasps]

713
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,378
What the fuck?

714
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,380
What do you think you're doing?

715
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,550
I... I was just
checking on you, ma'am.

716
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,761
You can't even take a nap
in this hellhole.

717
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,180
Fuck off!

718
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,307
Sorry.

719
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,518
Hi, I'm Dr. McKay.

720
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,728
Uh, Piper.

721
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,729
Laura.

722
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,314
And you guys are?

723
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,356
She's my boss.

724
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,025
Oh, what kind of work?

725
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,027
I'm an accountant,
and she's my assistant.

726
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,029
Oh, cool.

727
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,866
Um, Piper, are you OK with your
boss being here while we talk?

728
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,075
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.

729
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,994
Are you sure?

730
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,496
I'm going to be asking you
some pretty personal questions.

731
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,538
She doesn't mind.

732
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,708
We... we have no secrets.

733
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,794
OK.

734
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,921
So burning with urination.

735
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,922
Mm-hmm.

736
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,048
When did that start?

737
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,133
About two days ago.

738
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,260
Why don't we let Piper
answer the questions?

739
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,014
I'm sorry, it's just,
we've been waiting so long.

740
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,475
About two days ago.

741
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,769
Any blood in the urine?

742
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,270
I don't think so.

743
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,607
No, she would have
definitely noticed that.

744
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,984
OK.

745
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,736
I'm going to get you a gown
and I'll be right back, OK?

746
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,863
OK.

747
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,117
[groans]

748
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,119
Any change with
the extra Dilaudid?

749
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,579
Not really.

750
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,249
The pain is still there.

751
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,459
[groaning]

752
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,129
Sorry. Sorry.

753
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,633
Just to review, no fever,
no vomiting,

754
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,052
no diarrhea, no constipation.

755
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,637
Correct.

756
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,306
When exactly did the pain start?

757
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:03,477
10:15 this morning,
all of a sudden.

758
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,812
That's very strange.

759
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,231
I agree.

760
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,651
Will you tell me everything
you did this morning?

761
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,152
Took a shower.

762
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:17,324
I had breakfast,
some coffee, toast with jam.

763
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,867
Yard work.

764
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,661
Moved some firewood.

765
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,831
Did the pain start before
or after the firewood?

766
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,874
A little bit after.

767
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,459
I might have got
a splinter in my foot.

768
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,711
I wasn't wearing socks.

769
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:34,341
[groaning] Other one.

770
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,013
[machinery beeping]

771
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,267
Two small puncture wounds,
one millimeter apart.

772
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:48,022
[groans] Two splinters?

773
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,815
Whoa.

774
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,985
What?

775
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,195
There's a dead black widow
spider in your shoe.

776
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,031
[gasps] You're shitting me.

777
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,532
Red hourglass marking.

778
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,367
We need IV diazepam.
Start with five.

779
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,702
Might need 10.

780
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,831
[groaning]

781
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,209
What does a spider bite have
to do with my Crohn's disease?

782
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,086
Oh, nothing.

783
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,422
Um, black widow venom can cause
muscle spasms in the belly.

784
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,383
People have had surgery
thinking it was appendicitis.

785
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,093
Hi, Dolores.

786
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,845
Why didn't you get her
to CT yet?

787
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,388
I... I don't think
she needs it.

788
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,223
The abdomen is rigid.
She's perfed.

789
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,224
Maybe not.

790
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,559
What are you giving?

791
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,061
- Diazepam.
- I didn't order that.

792
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,354
I did.

793
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,730
She has a rigid abdomen

794
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,939
but no other GI signs
or symptoms.

795
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,775
It didn't make any sense.

796
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,860
There's a black widow spider
and a bite mark on the foot.

797
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,072
The venom is causing spasm of
the abdominal wall musculature.

798
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,075
Whatever you guys gave me,
it's working.

799
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,076
Possibly.

800
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,538
No, definitely.

801
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,708
I'm much better.

802
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,005
Take a deep breath.

803
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,093
[breathing deeply]

804
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,178
Good, good.

805
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,680
Are you from Pittsburgh?

806
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,848
Uh, two hours north.

807
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,266
Like, Mill Village.

808
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,685
OK.

809
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,228
You have any family
you want to call?

810
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,604
I don't have a phone.

811
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,774
She can use mine
if she needs to.

812
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,111
OK.

813
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,279
Lay down.

814
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,116
[clears throat]

815
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,993
I've, uh, never heard
of Mill Village.

816
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,787
Yeah, nobody has.

817
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,080
Population 400.

818
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,248
Wow, that's small.

819
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,791
Tell me about it.

820
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,584
After high school,
I had to get out of there.

821
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,919
Mm.

822
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,796
Well, you're lucky
you found a job.

823
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,464
Any pain around here?

824
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,967
Mm-hmm, a little.

825
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:40,968
OK.

826
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,470
Sit up for me.

827
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,930
All right.

828
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,265
You gave us a urine specimen?

829
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,308
Hours ago, in the waiting room.

830
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,435
OK.

831
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,894
Well, I'll find the results,

832
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,563
and then you might need
a pelvic exam.

833
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,399
Is that really necessary?

834
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,734
It could be.

835
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,901
If there's no bladder infection,

836
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,445
it's important to check.

837
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,821
OK.

838
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,406
And if we do a pelvic, Laura,

839
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,949
we'll have you step outside
for a minute.

840
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,245
I'd prefer to stay with her,
for support.

841
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,167
Piper, do you want some privacy?

842
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,461
No, it's cool.

843
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,213
She... she can stay.

844
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,924
OK.

845
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,301
All right.

846
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,803
I'll be back.

847
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,516
Core temp is 88.

848
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,310
Is... is that good?

849
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,979
It's up from 85 on her arrival,

850
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,523
so we're headed in
the right direction.

851
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,858
[breathes deeply]

852
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,027
You hear that, Amber?

853
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,195
It's better.

854
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,531
You're getting better.

855
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,367
I need to step out for a second.

856
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,703
You're in good hands.

857
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,290
Come find me when it's over 90.

858
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,629
[sighs]

859
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,715
Parents are going to need
the family room.

860
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,967
It's available now.

861
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,721
Last rites for Nick.

862
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,223
Just one of those days.

863
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,224
Yeah.

864
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,642
Anyone else dying?

865
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,977
Not at the moment.

866
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,607
What the hell is that?

867
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,194
You asked for better
patient satisfaction scores.

868
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,195
[scoffs]

869
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,446
What do you want, man?

870
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,697
[laughs] Oh, jeez.

871
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,032
Excuse me, Dr. Robby.

872
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,700
This is Eli,
son of Willie Alexander.

873
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,077
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

874
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,745
- How's he doing?
- He's doing better.

875
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,913
He's going to need
to stay with us,

876
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,289
though, for a new pacemaker.

877
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,749
He got a new one at Presby

878
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,417
about, uh, a year ago.

879
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,961
They said it'd be good
for 10 years.

880
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,296
Yes, but the wires
separated from the box.

881
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,298
It happens sometimes.

882
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,466
Can he have a visitor?

883
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,927
Of course. Right this way.

884
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,096
Hey, Eli, what did your dad
do for a living?

885
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,349
Uh, postal worker, 40 years.

886
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,601
Did he ever do any
volunteer work at the hospital?

887
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,061
No.

888
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,896
But when he was a kid,
he was a medic

889
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,899
for the Freedom House
Ambulance Service.

890
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,193
That's incredible.

891
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,028
Uh, I will be in
as soon as I can.

892
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,530
Thank you.

893
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,574
That guy's a legend.

894
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,117
I know.

895
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,243
Sorry, can I get your help
with something?

896
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,703
Yeah.

897
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,080
Um, 18-year-old woman
with dysuria,

898
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,374
moved here two months ago
from rural Pennsylvania.

899
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,167
She's with her female boss,

900
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,671
who's very controlling
and answers questions for her

901
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,799
and won't leave her side for
anything, even a pelvic exam.

902
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,260
And you're thinking?

903
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,679
- Red flags for trafficking.
- Sounds like it.

904
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,306
I need to take a sexual history

905
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,974
and do a pelvic in private.

906
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,101
She's not going to talk
unless we separate them.

907
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,854
That we can do. Come on.

908
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,192
That looks like ST elevation.

909
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,944
That could be bad.

910
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,654
Oh, no.

911
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,073
That's just because we're
pacing your right ventricle.

912
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,575
Willie, I'm impressed.

913
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,951
After all these years,
you still remember

914
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,620
your medical training.

915
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,079
He couldn't tell you
what he had for breakfast.

916
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,415
- [scoffs]
- It's all right.

917
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,500
I remember what's important.

918
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,169
Like the Freedom House.

919
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,670
What's that?

920
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,755
A damn shame.

921
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,256
That's your history.

922
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,674
Dad, they're busy.

923
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,968
Back in the '60s, no 911,

924
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,678
no ambulances.

925
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,472
All we had was
police paddy wagons

926
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,184
that took you to the hospital,
if you were lucky.

927
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,520
Then this doc from Pitt,
Dr. Safar,

928
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,898
he got some money
and trained us up.

929
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,025
Well, you must have been
a good student.

930
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,526
Hell, no.

931
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,403
I was a knucklehead.

932
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,032
Smoked a lot of weed,
dropped out of high school.

933
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,701
But Freedom House trained me up.

934
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,370
Saved my life.

935
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,538
What are you doing there,
Willie?

936
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,998
Nothing.

937
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,917
You're moving
your old pacemaker.

938
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,043
Diagnosis made.

939
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,044
What?

940
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,921
Twiddler's syndrome.

941
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,256
Spinning that thing around
caused the wires to break off.

942
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,925
Oh, Dad.

943
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,510
- I didn't mean to.
- It's OK.

944
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,886
We'll put the new one in
a little deeper.

945
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,054
Won't happen again.

946
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,223
[sighs]

947
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,226
Some of your tests are
concerning for a kidney stone.

948
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,894
Wouldn't that give more pain?

949
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,479
Not always.

950
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,897
If it's a urine infection
with a stone,

951
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,898
you'll need to stay
in the hospital

952
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,401
for some IV antibiotics.

953
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,652
What do we have to do?

954
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,570
A CT scan of your kidneys.

955
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,197
How long is that going to take?

956
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,824
- They can do it right now.
- Great.

957
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,575
- Let's go.
- I'm... I'm sorry.

958
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,994
There's radiation.

959
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,578
You won't be able
to stay with her.

960
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,998
But we'll be back as
soon as the scan is done.

961
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,416
You're good with this, right?

962
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,377
Yeah, I'll be fine.

963
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,879
We'll see you in a minute.

964
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,589
So Laura's an accountant?

965
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,049
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

966
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,260
How'd you get the job?

967
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,386
- Online ad.
- Yeah.

968
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,221
Zoom interview.

969
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,889
You must be good at math.

970
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,975
Not really.

971
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,227
So what do you do for work?

972
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,106
I answer the phones,
I make appointments, I...

973
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,233
I bring deposits to the bank.

974
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,986
You work with spreadsheets?

975
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,905
She hasn't taught me that yet.

976
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,033
This is where you do the CT?

977
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,285
Uh, no.

978
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,539
We wanted to give you some
privacy for your pelvic exam.

979
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,207
Laura's going to be so pissed.

980
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,792
Why would she be mad?

981
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,544
Piper, do you have any concerns

982
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,796
you want to talk about?

983
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,425
No, just the pain when I pee.

984
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:17,095
Anything you need to tell us
about your job or your boss?

985
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,138
No.

986
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,975
No, it's all really great.

987
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,147
OK.

988
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,149
Temp is up to 91.

989
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,817
She's so much warmer.

990
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,819
Is it working?

991
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,155
Can you shock the heart now?

992
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,991
91 is warm enough
for her heart to respond.

993
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,034
Hold compressions.

994
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,203
[machinery flatlines]

995
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,788
Asystole.

996
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,332
Resuming compressions.

997
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,792
Got the potassium level back.

998
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,794
12.2.

999
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,631
[machinery beeping]

1000
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,269
No one has ever survived
a cardiac arrest

1001
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,606
with a potassium over 11.

1002
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:14,820
There is absolutely
no chance of recovery.

1003
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,697
I am so sorry.

1004
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,199
Amber has died.

1005
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,701
[sobbing] No.

1006
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,537
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1007
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,538
It's not happening.

1008
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,622
No, no, no!

1009
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,167
No! No!

1010
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,377
I'm sorry.

1011
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,712
I am so...

1012
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,258
Before we stop,
do you think her sister

1013
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,760
would like a chance
to say goodbye?

1014
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,220
No.

1015
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,056
Uh, Bella shouldn't see her
like this.

1016
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,057
OK.

1017
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,559
[sobbing]

1018
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,227
You can stay in here
for as long as you like.

1019
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,228
Shh.

1020
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,897
It's OK. It's OK.

1021
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,109
We are going to stop now.

1022
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,904
[both sobbing]

1023
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,741
Resuscitation efforts
discontinued at 14:51.

1024
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,369
[machinery flatlining]

1025
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,497
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

1026
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,585
[both sobbing]

1027
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,754
OK, that's it.

1028
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,756
We're done.

1029
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,050
Let me get the gurney up.

1030
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,931
Is everything OK?

1031
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,099
Yeah.

1032
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,184
There's no infection

1033
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,685
in your uterus or ovaries.

1034
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,937
OK, that's... that's good.

1035
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:34,608
But your urine test was
positive for chlamydia.

1036
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,067
Shit.

1037
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,778
It's a sexually
transmitted infection.

1038
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,781
Any idea how that happened?

1039
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,909
Yeah, my cheating

1040
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,411
piece of shit ex-boyfriend
back home.

1041
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,788
But we broke up before I moved.

1042
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,458
You need antibiotics
twice a day for 10 days.

1043
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,584
That'll clear it up.

1044
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,127
And he'll need treatment too.

1045
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,837
If I don't tell him,
is there a chance

1046
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,797
his dick will fall off?

1047
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,467
If you don't tell him,
a public health nurse will.

1048
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,302
You should also test
for HIV, syphilis,

1049
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,970
gonorrhea, and hepatitis.

1050
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,305
OK.

1051
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,556
Any other sexual partners

1052
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,100
in the last few months?

1053
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,560
Not really.

1054
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,645
Use condoms?

1055
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,146
Most of the time.

1056
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,481
It's important to use them
all the time.

1057
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,899
Yeah, but if I forget,

1058
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,067
you can just give me a shot, right?

1059
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,235
Not for some infections.

1060
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,070
This is serious.

1061
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,112
Birth control?

1062
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,155
Norplant.

1063
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,492
It's good for five years.

1064
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,412
Piper, we have a question
that we ask everyone.

1065
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,748
Sometimes people are pressured

1066
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,833
to have sex
when they don't want to.

1067
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,795
Does that ever happen to you?

1068
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,340
No, never.

1069
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,676
And when you signed in,
you put down Laura

1070
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,344
as your emergency contact.

1071
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,388
Yeah.

1072
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,807
You have the same address
as Laura?

1073
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,183
Yeah.

1074
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,685
She's letting me use
her guest room

1075
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,729
until I can save up
for a place of my own.

1076
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,524
OK.

1077
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,067
Why don't we have you
lie down again?

1078
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,193
What for?

1079
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,569
Uh, ultrasound.

1080
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,446
We're going to check
your kidneys.

1081
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,368
You got bumped from CT by
a couple of emergency cases.

1082
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,720
Bella, Dr. King
and Dr. Collins are here.

1083
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,887
Hi.

1084
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,473
I'm coloring.

1085
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,392
You're a very good artist.

1086
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,186
Thanks.

1087
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,899
Um, Bella?

1088
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,276
Yeah?

1090
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:47,073
She's really sick,
but the doctor and the nurse

1091
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,285
is trying to make her better.

1092
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,663
That must make you sad.

1093
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,082
You know, I have a sister too,

1094
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,210
and I don't like it
when she's sick.

1095

1097
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,427
I fell in the pool.

1098
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,182
She helped me get out,
but then she couldn't get out.

Freedom House took us in

1102
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,120
They turned out
the very first medics

1103
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,872

1104
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,751
We started IVs, defibrillated,

1105
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,504
intubated in the field.

1106
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,506
They were the heroes
of Hill District,

1107
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,801

saving lives every day.

1108

how successful it was

1111

Willie and his friends did

Dr. Adamson,
med student when I arrived.

1121

But I'm telling you,

1122

standing right here,

1127
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,011

1128
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,013

00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,016
Yeah.

Where is he working now?

1132
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,814
Dr. Adamson died a few
years ago, during COVID.

1133
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,566
Oh.

1134
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,860
Hard to believe.

1135
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,903
He was so young,
so full of life.

1136
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,738
A force of nature.

1137
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,409
Yes, he was.

1138
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,746
We're back.

1139
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,749
I should be out there
for the honor walk.

1140
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,501

Um, but you get to name it.

1157

Bear.

1159
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,976
All right.

1160
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,396
Um, since you can't see
Amber right now,

1161
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,233
but I bet you got a lot
of things to tell her,

1162
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,901
Bear is going to help.

1164
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,781

everything you want
to tell Amber,

1166
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,118
then I'll take Bear
and sit her on Amber's pillow,

1167
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,287

everything you said.
