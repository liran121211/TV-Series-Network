1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,259
- [knocking]
- Ma'am.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,385
Kristi, please.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,678
OK, ma'am, that's enough.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,554
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

5
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:16,932
Let's clear the hallway and get
Kristi out of the bathroom.

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,268
Either you gotta calm down,
or I will escort you out.

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,894
El, you're making a scene.

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,562
- I'm so sorry about all of this.
- What happened?

9
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:24,231
Daughter locked herself in.

10
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,983
Sisters started fighting.
Collins got in the middle.

11
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,901
- Mom pushed her.
- Ma'am.

12
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,361
- Are you all right?
- I'm Gloria Underwood,

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,696
chief medical officer
of this hospital.

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,072
How can I help?

15
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,407
I just want to take
my daughter home.

16
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,825
- OK.
- We will get Kristi out,

17
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,159
and we will bring her to you, yeah?

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,411
- Let us help you.
- Right this way.

19
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,912
- Right this way.
- It's OK.

20
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,289
You're on it.

21
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,623
At least they
didn't see the rats.

22
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,749
How long has she been in there?

23
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,875
About five minutes.

24
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,043
I'm gonna find the key.

25
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,295
We are gonna handle this.

26
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,879
- This is your patient?
- Yes.

27
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,423
No, actually, it's my patient.

28
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,091
She's been here for hours.

29
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,093
Patients come in
already in distress,

30
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,720
and waiting only makes it worse.

31
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,555
Wait time has nothing
to do with this.

32
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,723
Which is why we're
seeing hospital workers

33
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,932
like Dr. Collins get assaulted.

34
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,058
Assaulted?

35
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,435
It was a little push.

36
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,061
Which we're gonna
take seriously.

37
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,604
We risk our lives coming
to work here every day.

38
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,064
What if that mother had
brought a weapon?

39
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,774
We have metal detectors.

40
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,192
This is what happens when
you keep all the hospital

41
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:10,277
admissions stuck
down here instead

42
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,154
of properly staffing upstairs.

43
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,614
I've got four patients waiting
on ICU that have been here

44
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,116
since before I got here,
and it's already 1:00.

45
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,492
I can see that you're...

46
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,119
We've got four more
waiting on psych.

47
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,787
One of them's been here
for a fucking week.

48
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:23,749
So please, for the love
of God, hire more nurses.

49
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,292
I'll come back later.

50
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,919
That's not gonna help anything.

51
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,964
Same fucking thing every day.

52
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,632
You OK?

53
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:33,884
Yeah.

54
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,719
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

55
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,804
Dr. Robby, X-rays came back

56
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,097
for that elbow fracture
in the hallway.

57
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,474
OK. Thank you.

58
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,600
Can you also find Esme
and tell her

59
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,851
to bring me that bathroom key?

60
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,811
You got it.

61
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:47,481
Terrance, I'm Dr. Langdon.

62
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,025
Do you go by Terrance or Terry?

63
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,443
Terrance.

64
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,278
So what brings you in today?

65
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,489
I everted my ankle
playing table tennis.

66
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,449
- Everted?
- Yes.

67
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,826
You mind if I take a look?

68
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:01,411
Are you an orthopedic surgeon?

69
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,788
No.

70
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,581
I am an emergency
medicine specialist.

71
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,500
Could I talk
to an orthopedic surgeon?

72
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,418
I'd prefer an expert
in that area.

73
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,295
Well, I'm pretty good
at ankle sprains.

74
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,797
How do you know it's a sprain?

75
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,715
Well, I'd have to examine
you first, but...

76
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,009
Could it be a Jones fracture
or a dancer's fracture?

77
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,135
Could be.

78
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,304
Again, I'd have to look.

79
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,181
Why don't I examine you,
and that'll tell me...

80
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,557
Shouldn't you take
a complete history

81
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:23,975
on the present illness first?

82
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,185
It sounds like
you're more interested

83
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,812
in asking the questions, so...

84
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,230
You didn't ask me
if I felt a pop or a snap.

85
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,689
You didn't ask about
previous injuries.

86
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,149
You didn't ask about
weight bearing.

87
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,194
Why don't I get you
some fresh ice?

88
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,946
- Kristi?
- [knocking]

89
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,280
It's Dr. Robby.

90
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,032
No, I'm not leaving with her.

91
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,325
Your mom is not out here.

92
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,701
Your mom is in the waiting room.

93
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:43,370
Listen, I can put you
in a quiet room.

94
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,996
You can spend as much time
as you want in there.

95
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,331
But I cannot have you
locked in this bathroom

96
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,083
for safety reasons.

97
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,836
Does that sound OK?

98
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,798
[sighs] Kristi?

99
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,594
OK, I'm gonna
open this door now.

100
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,977
A quiet room without my mom?

101
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,271
Of course.

102
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,064
Lab is back on our 25-year-old.

103
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,732
Thank you.

104
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,111
Sickle cell and cirrhosis
both on deck for the ICU.

105
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,072
Subway fall is next
in line for the OR.

106
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,117
And our good Samaritan with
a head injury is waking up.

107
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,785
Oh?

108
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,787
He's alert with good
parameters for extubation.

109
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,205
Great.

110
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,124
- You working this weekend?
- No.

111
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,917
I've got a date with my bed

112
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,669
and "The Great
British Bake Off."

113
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,421
You?

114
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,756
My new boo planned
a romantic weekend getaway

115
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,341
but won't tell me
where we're going.

116
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:39,426
Oh.

117
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,927
I hate surprises.

118
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,429
Make sure you share
your location

119
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,890
- with someone, just in case.
- [chuckles]

120
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,476
Hey, pussycat.

121
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,270
Oh, um, my name is Whittaker.

122
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,939
Pussycat, I need
to use the bathroom.

123
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,150
Can you get a key for this?

124
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,818
I don't think I should.

125
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,905
Don't be a pussy, pussycat.

126
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,616
I only use this so
no one steals my wheelchair.

127
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,410
- Uh...
- You need a bedpan, Myrna?

128
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,996
Lassy.

129
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,876
Good sandwich?

130
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,461
Uh, yeah, really good, actually.

131
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,795
Yeah, I can tell
from all the crumbs

132
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,464
you're getting
on my workstation.

133
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,634
We eat in the lounge,
if we eat lunch at all.

134
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,968
[coughs] I am so sorry.

135
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,303
I was gonna grab a patient.

136
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,804
Maybe wash your hands first?

137
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,390
Yeah.

138
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,518
Too harsh?

139
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,186
A little.

140
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,396
Maybe I've gotten too soft.

141
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,981
Want me to find you
something for lunch?

142
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,316
- Nope.
- You seem hangry.

143
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,984
I'm not.

144
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,611
I managed to get
the Mifepristone teen

145
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,404
out of the bathroom
and parked in Central 14.

146
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:42,489
How are mom and aunt?

147
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,782
Mom's in chairs.

148
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,950
Aunt was headed
to the cafeteria.

149
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,493
Do you want to talk to them?

150
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,994
I don't know what's left
to say to them.

151
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,122
I think they need to talk
to each other.

152
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,999
Nick Bradley's friends.

153
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,001
[sighs]

154
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,671
How do you get through
the loss of a child?

155
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,839
The same way you get
through anything,

156
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,093
by leaning on your friends
and family.

157
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,641
How are they doing?

158
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,309
Still working through it.

159
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,019
I'll let you know when
it's time to revisit

160
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,021
the organ donation conversation.

161
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,691
OK.

162
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,572
Any update on my
abandoned senior, Ginger?

163
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,990
I still haven't reached
the daughter.

164
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,366
I tried Ginger's son too.

165
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,034
He was no help...
lives in Cleveland.

166
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,411
That's disappointing.

167
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,705
At least she's in good spirits.

168
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,707
I'm sure she appreciates
the company.

169
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,376
And her daughter, Rita,
does need a break.

170
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,628
I just hope she comes back.

171
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,463
And you know, um,

172
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,549
I wanted to apologize
about earlier.

173
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,385
I... I spiraled.

174
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,306
Sometimes I occasionally jump
to the worst case scenario.

175
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,724
So I...

176
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,434
Understandable,
given what we see here.

177
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,060
I'll let you know
if I hear from Rita.

178
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,521
OK. Thank you.

179
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,106
Hey, Mel.

180
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,774
[chuckles] Hey.

181
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,860
What's Mel short for, Melanoma?

182
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,903
- Melatonin?
- Melissa.

183
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:05,071
Yeah, I'm just...

184
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:06,573
I'm just messing with you.

185
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,618
Um...

186
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,411
I noticed that
you and Langdon have

187
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,246
really been hitting it off.

188
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,373
- You think?
- Yeah.

189
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,002
Have you noticed anything...
strange about his behavior?

190
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,253
Like what?

191
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,756
Anything at all.

192
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,967
I have noticed that he...

193
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,094
he has a tendency
to sweat a lot.

194
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,263
I don't know if that's weird.

195
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,098
- It could be genetic.
- Yeah.

196
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,727
- Just keep an eye out for me.
- OK.

197
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,398
Is everything OK, Dr. Langdon?

198
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,733
Oh, yeah.

199
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,736
I've got Dr. Google
in Central 9

200
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,738
bombarding me with questions
like my four-year-old.

201
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,948
I couldn't even get
through a history.

202
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,116
Is that his chart?

203
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,409
Yep.

204
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,620
Can I see it?

205
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,539
Knock yourself out.

206
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,668
Oh. [chuckles]

207
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,798
Oh, he... he's autistic.

208
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,966
Did you... did you see that
in his past medical history?

209
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,301
It's an ankle sprain.

210
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,388
It has nothing to do
with the injury.

211
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,556
- I could talk to him.
- Great.

212
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,143
I can see three other patients
while you do.

213
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,146
Have you seen
our sad boy anywhere?

214
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,648
Robby.

215
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,816
My daughter's teaching me
the Gen Z lingo.

216
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,942
It has a nice ring to it.

217
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,276
What is a sad boy?

218
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:26,861
Hey, will you keep
calling the ICU?

219
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,488
I think those cardiologists
are hoarding beds.

220
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,198
And if they hoard them,
they can board them.

221
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,158
Lunch service is gonna
start down here.

222
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,827
It's going to get a lot busier.
They can feed them upstairs.

223
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,286
- On it, Cap.
- Thank you.

224
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,830
Hey.

225
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,498
Our good Samaritan is alert

226
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,041
with adequate parameters
for extubation.

227
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,459
Great. Get to it.

228
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,169
How's Kristi?

229
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,462
You can see for yourself.

230
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,964
I parked her in 14.

231
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,174
Sir...

232
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,345
I overheard a nurse saying
they found rats back there.

233
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,764
- What?
- Yeah.

234
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,183
Pest control takes priority.

235
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,227
Guess you got bumped again.

236
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,687
Mrs. Dunn?

237
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,063
How's my dad?

238
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,690
He's still stable.

239
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,066
His chest tube output
has slowed down,

240
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,985
which is an excellent sign.

241
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,028
Thank you for
taking care of him.

242
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,989
Yeah, of course.

243
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
Mrs. Dunn,
could we talk for a moment?

244
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,203
Excuse me.

245
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:19,831
We found something
in your husband's exam.

246
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:24,294
He, uh... he has some
breast enlargement.

247
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,045
Is that unusual?

248
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,255
It depends.

249
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,507
One common cause is alcoholism.

250
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,050
Is he a drinker?

251
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:32,886
He has a few drinks every night.

252
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,929
We'll do liver function
blood tests for alcoholism.

253
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,056
There's also disorders
of the endocrine system,

254
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,558
so we can check
his hormone levels.

255
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,185
Let me go.

256
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,270
- Hormones?
- Let me go.

257
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,397
- Can somebody help me, please?
- Excuse me.

258
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,690
We need a wheelchair here.

259
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,400
What happened?

260
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,860
I was on my way home
when I saw her in the road.

261
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,737
She was in and out
of the intersection,

262
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,239
- yelling at cars and people.
- What's her name?

263
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,074
Nandi.
She's... she's my roommate.

264
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:56,910
Did she get hit?
Her knees are all scraped up.

265
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,329
No, she tripped while I was
pulling her out of traffic.

266
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,914
Does she have
a psychiatric condition?

267
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,373
Not that I know of.

268
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:03,708
- Liars!
- Let's get her a bed.

269
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,878
- You're OK.
- Let me go!

270
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,255
[knocking]

271
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:10,423
Hi, Terrence.

272
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,217
I'm Dr. King.

273
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,552
Hello.

274
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:20,266
Dr. Langdon is with another
patient right now, so...

275
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,101
I'm gonna finish
taking your history.

276
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,770
- Is that OK?
- Sure.

277
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,314
OK.

278
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,609
It's a little bright in here.

279
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,487
<i>[beeping]</i>

280
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,448
Oh, that's...

281
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,411
Sorry.

282
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:43,456
The, uh, ER can be very noisy.

283
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,124
I agree.

284
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,668
So I heard that you might have

285
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,753
sprained your ankle
playing table tennis?

286
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,089
- I everted it.
- Yeah?

287
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,926
What is your biggest
concern today, Terrence?

288
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,262
What worries you
the most about your...

289
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,763
the pain in your ankle?

290
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,890
What worries me?

291
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,559
Do you mean right now
in this moment?

292
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,019
Right now.

293
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,981
I'm worried I won't
be able to play

294
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,149
table tennis
if it's a bad injury.

295
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,609
There's a tournament
in six weeks,

296
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,986
and I already registered.

297
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,571
It's my first tournament.

298
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,990
Wow, that's a big deal.

299
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,825
Yes.

300
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,410
The championship is hosted

301
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,328
by the South Park
Table Tennis Club.

302
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:25,164
Nine players have
USATT ratings over 2,000.

303
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,000
1,400 is considered average.

304
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,252
2,000 is a master player.

305
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,005
My goal is to get
a rating over 2,000.

306
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,300
Well, let's get you
to that tournament, then.

307
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,676
So...

308
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,637
[door opens]

309
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,226
Terrence, would you walk
around the room for me, please?

310
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,563
I'll be able to tell a lot
more about your injury.

311
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,529
It hurts a little.

312
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,531
How painful on
a scale from 1 to 10?

313
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,867
- 10 is the worst.
- The worst?

314
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,660
The worst I've ever felt
or the worst that

315
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,162
a human being can experience?

316
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,331
A little pain is
a great answer, Terrence.

317
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,707
Thank you.

318
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,542
Well, based on your
walking around,

319
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,002
I don't think
it's a serious injury.

320
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,629
You know what?

321
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,880
There's actually something
I want to show you.

322
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,424
I'll be right back.

323
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,889
Ahh! What was that?

324
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,974
Olanzapine, 10 milligrams.

325
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,393
Do you know any
of her medical history?

326
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,062
No.

327
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,897
We've only known each other
for a few months.

328
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,357
We're both influencers.

329
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,067
We met online.

330
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,944
I thought it would be
a good idea to live together.

331
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,696
When did she start
behaving differently?

332
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,573
About a month ago.

333
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,118
She's been up at all hours
talking to herself non-stop.

334
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,870
I think she's suicidal.

335
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,580
Any drug use?

336
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,416
No, I don't think so.

337
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,963
Javadi, Whitaker,
see if you can do the exam.

338
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,756
Can you look at the light?

339
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,925
No. What was that?

340
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,385
OK. Open your mouth?

341
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,261
No. It's not real.

342
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,972
Where am I?

343
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,431
How do you even do an exam
with a patient like this?

344
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,849
This isn't my room.

345
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,434
- The furniture's changed.
- Observe her.

346
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:10,895
Wait for her to look at you
or open her mouth

347
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,563
and get a quick look.

348
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,440
Make sure she moves her
arms and legs equally.

349
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,734
This is... this is just
to monitor your heart.

350
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,277
All right, we might need to wait

351
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,030
until after the meds kick in.

352
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,616
Everybody.

353
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,494
This isn't the same place.

354
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,373
OK, differential diagnosis?

355
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,250
Schizophrenia,
first psychotic break.

356
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,293
- She's in the right age range.
- Yeah, what else?

357
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,295
Drugs, also common
in this age group.

358
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:38,131
Common in all age groups.
What else?

359
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,465
Not just recreational drugs.

360
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,134
It could also be
toxicity to medications.

361
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,635
Don't jump to conclusions.

362
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,971
Think big categories
and then specifics.

363
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,141
Metabolic, hyper-
or hyponatremia,

364
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,643
calcium, hepatic encephalopathy.

365
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:54,147
Endocrine, hyperthyroid,
infectious encephalitis.

366
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,107
These are all possibilities.

367
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,526
OK, let's work her up medically
and see if we can clear her.

368
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,778
Chem panel, CBC, TSH and T4,

369
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,321
- drug screen, and hCG.
- Yep.

370
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,865
Keep me posted.

371
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,410
If it's all negative,
then admit her to psych.

372
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,046
[knocking]

373
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,176
Still feeling nauseous?

374
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,178
Not really.

375
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,805
Good.

376
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:32,477
So your mom is looking for you.

377
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,854
I didn't think
my mom would find out.

378
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,484
If I go home with her,
my life is over.

379
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,695
Mm.
Maybe she'll change her mind.

380
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,364
Sometimes this tendon
called peroneus brevis

381
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:47,158
can pull off a piece
of this bone,

382
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,701
the fifth metatarsal.

383
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,161
That's the dancer's fracture, right?

384
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,871
Exactly.

385
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,539
You most likely have
a second-degree ankle sprain.

386
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,541
The X-ray will tell us
everything.

387
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:58,044
Tech will come get you,
and then I'll come back

388
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,378
and show you the images.

389
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,005
Great.

390
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,257
OK.

391
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,009
I'll put the orders in.

392
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,719
How'd you do that?

393
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,887
Do what?

394
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,680
Talk to him.

395
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,057
I listened?

396
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,391
Funny.

397
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:13,893
No, you...
you unlocked something.

398
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,228
I wasn't getting
anywhere with him.

399
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,064
Oh, my sister is
on the spectrum.

400
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:22,068
And the ER can be a very,
very overwhelming place

401
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,820
for autistic people, so I...

402
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,238
I don't know.

403
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,572
It just takes
a different approach.

404
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:27,698
Are you and your sister close?

405
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,325
Yeah, we're best friends.

406
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,535
There was this one time
we were on the swing...

407
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,869
I got to hit the head.

408
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,079
Let me know when
the X-rays are back.

409
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,289
Uh-huh.

410
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,921
Where is she?

411
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,965
She's OK.
She just needs a minute.

412
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,925
I have given her enough time.

413
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,885
She can process this
on the car ride home.

414
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,596
Can we talk for a moment?

415
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:51,890
Please.

416
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,227
I know you're trying to help,
but this is really

417
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,937
between me and my daughter.

418
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,231
So if you could just
bring her out,

419
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,151
we will be on our way.

420
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,947
She's really upset.

421
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,074
She'll get over it.

422
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,617
Weren't you about the same age

423
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,077
when you got pregnant with her?

424
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,453
Yes.

425
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,539
So you know how hard it can be.

426
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,084
It was very hard at the time.

427
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,919
But she turned out
to be the best thing

428
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,629
that has ever happened to me.

429
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,090
And I hope she feels
the same way when she's ready.

430
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,092
But right now, she's not.

431
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,595
For her, the world is ending.

432
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,974
If you push her away,
she might never come back.

433
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,310
Dr. Collins?

434
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,812
Excuse me.

435
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,941
<i>Code STEMI, Trauma 2 now.</i>

436
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,484

00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:46,611
Hey, need a hand with the STEMI?

438
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,695
We're all set.

439
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,113
Whitaker, you're with me.

440
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,032
Trauma 2.

441
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,825
Brought in by a coworker
after 10 minutes

442
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,785
of substernal chest pain
with diaphoresis,

443
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,162
anterior STEMI and triage.

444
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,625
Dr. Santos,
do you have a minute?

445
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,168
Yeah, sure.

446
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,669
I'm Dr. Langdon.
This is Dr. Robby.

447
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,046
Harvey Chang.

448
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,047
You're having
a heart attack, sir.

449
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,381
I figured.

450
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:09,508
- You ever had one before?
- No.

451
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,843
How much pain?

452
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,386
Like an elephant's on my chest.

453
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,513
Are you taking any medications?

454
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:17,475
Metformin and rosuvastatin.

455
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,310
170 over 92 at triage.

456
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,853
324 chewable aspirin,

457
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,647
sublingual nitro q
five times three.

458
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,190
Cath lab is
standing by and ready.

459
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,608
Harvey, if we get you
up to cardiology,

460
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,859
they can open your
blocked artery.

461
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,611
We can stop this heart attack.

462
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,696
Anyone got a score
for the Pirates game?

463
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,698
They're up by 2
at the bottom of the first.

464
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,617
McCutchen hit an oppo taco.

465
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,702
Clutch, clutch.

466
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:37,870
Is there anybody we can call?

467
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,996
No.

468
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:41,332
My wife died a year ago.

469
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,334
I guess today is the day
I'll be joining her.

470
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,710
I appreciate that sentiment,

471
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:45,920
but that is not part
of our plan.

472
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,046
No murmurs.

473
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,714
Radio pulses are symmetric.

474
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,007

476
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,343
Whittaker, chest compressions.

477
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,096
Charge to 200.

478
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,516
Best way to face your fears.

479
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,226
Yeah, I can think
of better ways.

480
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,395
Let's bag him on 100%,
set up for intubation.

482
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,067
Charged and clear.

483
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,194
Still V-fib.
Resume compressions.

484
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,904
Let's get him on the LUCAS.

This is all my fault.

00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,211
What is?

491
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,423
Is there something
you haven't told us?

492
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,009
Mrs. Dunn, in order to
effectively treat your husband,

493
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,385
we need to know anything that...

494
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,179
The hormone levels...

495
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,099
it could be the progesterone.

496
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,768
He's taking progesterone?

497
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:45,104
I've been giving it to him.

498
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,399
I put it in his coffee
every morning.

499
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,112
I thought if I could kill
his libido, he'd stop.

500
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,906
Stop what?

501
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,119
I think he's molesting
our daughter.

502
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,454
Whitaker, on LifePak.

503
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,080
- You need to learn this.
- Yeah.

Set 200 joules asynchronous.

505
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,292

00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,507
That's your cue, Whitaker.

511
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:14,885
Shit.

512
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,636
No change.

Double sequential

518
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:25,770

Right sternal border, apex.

521

The theory is that
the first shock lowers

522
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,110
the defib threshold so
that the second shock

523
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,487
has a better chance
of converting

524
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,155
any fibrillating myocytes.

I'm OK.

You've been here
about seven hours,

529
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,668
hit your head
and came in unconscious,

Minu?
She's doing a lot better.

536
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,811
Did the cops catch
the guy who pushed her?

537
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,356
She was pushed?

00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,982
Yeah. I saw it.

00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,404
They wanted to talk to you.

541
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,197
I can give them a statement.

542
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,657
OK.

543
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,535
We can reach out.

544
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,037
Can I see her?

545
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,541
I think we can make that happen.

546
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,795
All right, Whitaker,
if he's pulseless,

547
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,380
we clear it
and then shock-shock.

548
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,506
I go first.

549
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,549
You hit it as fast as you can.

550
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,675
I got it.

551
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,135
Charging both to 200.

552
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,136
Charged.

553
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,303
Pause compressions.

554
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:42,721
<i>[sustained tone]</i>

555
00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:43,848
No pulse on the A-line.

556
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,890
Clear for the one-two punch.

557
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:46,309
- Clear.
- Clear.

558
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,019
<i>[sustained tone continues]</i>

559
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,563
Resuming compressions.

560
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,897
That was our Hail Mary.

561
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:52,898
We got one more.

562
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,234
Activate ECMO.

563
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,069
OK, draw up an ABG.

564
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,237
Prep the fems.

565
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,572
Cordis introducer.

566
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,740
Get the ECMO team down here.

567
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,034
Feeling any better?

568
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,369
Maybe.

569
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,831
Um, less...

570
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,792
Is there anybody we can call?

571
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,295
Your friend had to leave,
but we can give her an update.

572
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,588
Charis.

573
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,381
She's not really a friend.

574
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,593
I don't have friends,
just followers.

575
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,553
So you're on TikTok?

576
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,221
Of course.

577
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:27,099
I'm a beauty influencer.

578
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,601
Like makeup tutorials?

579
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,730
Makeup, skincare, hair.

580
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,273
What's the most amount of views

581
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,774
you've ever gotten
on one of your videos?

582
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:36,942
2 million.

583
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,402
2 million?

584
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,529
OK, I need to follow you.

585
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,992
Nandi, why did you wander
into traffic today?

586
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:50,665
Um, I was afraid
of people coming after me.

587
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,876
I don't feel safe at home.

588
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,628
Who's coming after you?

589
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,921
I don't know.

590
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,589
Something changed.

591
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,341
When?

592
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,093
Maybe a month ago.

593
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:05,180
What changed?

594
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,807
I can't remember.

595
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:13,604
I was worried all the time,
trouble sleeping.

596
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,481
What about physical symptoms?

597
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,025
Pain? Aches?

598
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:22,613
My hands shake.

599
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,991
I can't even put on makeup.

600
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:29,495
My feet get numb.

601
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,622
What else?

602
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,501
I don't recognize myself
in the mirror sometimes.

603
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:40,882
I feel like I'm in a dream,
and nothing is real.

604
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,969
What's happening to me?

605
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,723
We don't know yet,
but we're gonna do more tests.

606
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,070
Any ideas?

607
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,823
Call for a psych consult.

608
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,742
Let's ask for a head CT
with contrast first.

609
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,202
Looking for what?

610
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,204
Tremors, coordination problems.

611
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,707
Frontal lobe lesions can
cause behavioral changes.

612
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,001
We can't assume
this is all psych.

613
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,711
Got it.

614
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,881
I've got a seven
French cordis in place.

615
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,261
- Robby.
- Here we go.

616
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:31,390
ABG?

617
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,391
Looks good.

618
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,809
Let's do this.

619
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,394
I accessed
the right femoral vein.

620
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,895
Thanks for that.

621
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,230
So, Whittaker, we treat this

622
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,815
like a sterile
surgical procedure.

623
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,277
We can't introduce bacteria
into the circuit.

624
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,197
He'll get a garden hose

625
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,907
coming out of the vein
at the right leg.

626
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:50,909
That flows into the ECMO
machine for oxygen

627
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,578
and gets pumped back
through a second hose

628
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,246
into the left femoral artery.

629
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,415
These guys are impressive.

630
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:00,044
The ECMO does all the work
of the heart and lungs.

631
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,128
Place an IJ at the neck.

632
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,254
They'll want that.

633
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,381
Got it.

634
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,091
OK, I think there's
enough warm bodies in here.

635
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:07,926
I'm gonna go check
the rest of the department.

636
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,428
You don't want
to hang out until...

637
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,930
These guys know
what they're doing.

638
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:13,641
- Dr. Robby?
- Yep.

639
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,893
Can we talk about the patient
in Trauma 1, Silas,

640
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,269
the fixer upper
who fell off the ladder?

641
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,104
- Are his labs back yet?
- No.

642
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,731
But his wife, Susan, told me
that she's been putting

643
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,274
progesterone in his coffee.

644
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,776
Progesterone? Why?

645
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,612
She wanted to kill
his sex drive.

646
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,573
He's been sexually assaulting
their daughter.

647
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,450
Shit.

648
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,743
Well, we don't know that.

649
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,703
What exactly did the wife say?

650
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,581
He goes into the kid's
bathroom when she's showering,

651
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,291
gives her unwanted massages.

652
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,959
Her behavior's changed.
She's struggling in school.

653
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,461
The mom is really worried.

654
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,962
But she hasn't talked
to her daughter

655
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:45,255
about any of this,
doesn't want to put

656
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,424
- ideas in her head.
- It's grooming.

657
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,386
And we are mandated reporters
of child abuse in Pennsylvania.

658
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,096
There's nothing to report
unless we have proof.

659
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,972
Right now, it's all speculative.

660
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,933
Are we obligated to report
Mom for poisoning the husband?

661
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,267
Unfortunately, yes.

662
00:23:57,268 --> 00:23:58,727
She's not trying to kill him.

663
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,312
She's just worried
about her daughter.

664
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,897
He fell off a ladder.
He broke a bunch of ribs.

665
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,023
You're the one
who's treating him.

666
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,483
What if next time, it's worse?

667
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,193
So we're just gonna
send her home

668
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,278
and wait till she comes back
as a victim of incest?

669
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,489
We can't do anything unless
the daughter comes forward.

670
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,032
We can try to talk to her.

671
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,492
But if Mom doesn't want us to...

672
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,494
I will talk to the mom, OK?

673
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,247
Then we'll just take it
from there.

674
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:27,297
They keep dilating until it
takes the largest catheter.

675
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,384
Why didn't we try ECMO on
Mr. Milton, my gallbladder guy?

676
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,846
For ECMO, you need CPR
within five minutes

677
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,599
and an initial rhythm
of V-fib, V-tach, or PEA.

678
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,601
Which he had none of.

679
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:41,604
No.

680
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,024
First line's in and clamped.

681
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:48,026
Do you need anything,
Mrs. Kitajima?

682
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:50,320
I need to use the bathroom.

683
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:53,449
I'm afraid I may need some help.

684
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,825
Oh, no problem.

685
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,327
There's one nearby.

686
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,872
Should I grab
the interpreter device?

687
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,875
Let's see how they do first.

688
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,464
Hey.

689
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,219
I'm Sam.

690
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,390
Minu.

691
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,102
Does it hurt?

692
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:33,572
A stranger walked up
to you and pushed you.

693
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,366
I saw it.

694
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:41,914
I'm gonna help cops find
person who did this to you.

695
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,583
They won't get away with this.

696
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,418
[speaking Nepali]

697
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,881
It's Vishnu, protector
and guardian of the universe.

698
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:04,646
OK, Minu, time to take you
up to the OR.

699
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,320
Good luck.

700
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,629
The two catheters have to get
attached to the ECMO lines

701
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,964
with no air bubbles.

702
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,340
You see what's happening?

703
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,800
Good to go.

704
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,345
Circuit on and clamping.

705
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,267
OK, it's venous blood
out the right femoral,

706
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,727
into ECMO for oxygen,
and then pump back

707
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,980
into the left femoral artery.

708
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,482
Stop the LUCAS.

709
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,317
What's the MAP?

710
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,777
74.

711
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,445
Excellent.

712
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,906
So the ECMO has taken over
for the heart and lungs.

713
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,825
Once they open up
the blocked artery,

714
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,078
they can restart the heart,
and he's basically good as new.

715
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,581
Incredible.

716
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm sorry you have to do this.

717
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,835
It's OK.

718
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,796
My daughter would have
helped me.

719
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,133
I don't know where she is.

720
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,803
She... she's probably
gonna be back soon.

721
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,973
The kids are such a handful.

722
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,725
Your grandchildren?

723
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,978
Sometimes it's just too much.

724
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,064
But my husband's busy with work.

725
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:33,817
Your husband?

726
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,446
Did you take your medication
today, Ginger?

727
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,489
I'm finished.

728
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,992
OK.

729
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,707
I should get home.

730
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,209
I need to start making dinner.

731
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,463
Hopefully, it won't be
too much longer.

732
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:19,489
You can go in if you want.

733
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,742
Will he be OK?

734
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,619
Yeah.

735
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,623
Yeah, he just needs to stay
in the hospital for a few days.

736
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,542
And then he comes home.

737
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,087
Yes.

738
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,592
So your mom said
that high school

739
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,096
has been kind of hard for you?

740
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,932
I guess so.

741
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,934
It was hard for me too,

742
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,938
especially when things
sucked at home.

743
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,108
Do your parents put
a lot of pressure on you?

744
00:28:57,276 --> 00:28:59,195
Not really.

745
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,280
Are you and your dad close?

746
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:05,075
Yeah.

747
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:09,079
Has your dad ever made you
feel uncomfortable?

748
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,040
What do you mean?

749
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,169
Has he ever done anything
to you that didn't feel right,

750
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,923
even if you pushed it down
or tried to forget about it

751
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,927
because it didn't seem
like a big deal?

752
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,304
It may seem harmless for him
to go into the bathroom

753
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:28,265
when you're taking a shower,
but it's not.

754
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,183
Where is this coming from?

755
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:32,185
And if it's more than that,
if he is touching you anywhere

756
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:33,645
that you don't want
to be touched...

757
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,313
Why are you asking me this?

758
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:38,109
I'm just trying to make sure
that you're safe.

759
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,488
Whatever is happening...

760
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,366
you can tell me.

761
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,250
He's my dad.

762
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,088
I need to find my mom.

763
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,216
Alana, wait.

764
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,636
Dr. Robby, lab's all good
on our influencer patient.

765
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,472
Tox screen negative.
Head CT normal.

766
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,848
Head CT?

767
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,141
She had memory problems, tremors.

768
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,684
I had a hunch.

769
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,019
Well, she's had
a million dollar workup now.

770
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,353
- Psych can't refuse her.
- But...

771
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:17,314
Being a good doctor,
Dr. Mohan,

772
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,358
is knowing when to dig deep
and knowing when to move on.

773
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,653
Ready?

774
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:32,662
How are you doing?

775
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:36,166
Uh... OK.

776
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,335
I still can't believe
this is happening.

777
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,338
Of course.

778
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,801
It seems like a lot of people
showed up for Nick.

779
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,721
Everyone came.

780
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,889
We needed this.

781
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,475
We needed people.

782
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,686
That's the only way to get
through anything in life.

783
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:59,065
You have to lean
on friends and family.

784
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,150
Nick's friends kept
talking about what

785
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,362
a kind person he was.

786
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,742
When he registered to be
an organ and tissue donor,

787
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,328
he made the decision
to save eight lives

788
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,998
and improve hundreds more.

789
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,585
Nobody should ever lose a child,

790
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:24,756
but Nick's gifts could help
other parents avoid the pain

791
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,051
that you've experienced today.

792
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,599
I just need a little more time.

793
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,144
And I'd like to talk
to Father McGill.

794
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,396
OK.

795
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,731
How's your influencer?

796
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:43,441
She's been cleared for psych,

797
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:46,403
but she keeps saying
something's wrong.

798
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,947
It doesn't feel right to me.

799
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,117
Listen to your patient.

800
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:54,452
That is your superpower.

801
00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:56,621
But Robby told me to move on.

802
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:59,125
I... I finally got
on his good side.

803
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,296
Robby is off today.

804
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,256
Trust your gut.

805
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,301
I'll back you up.

806
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,762
<i>Well, there's no fracture.</i>

807
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:14,389
So it is just a sprain.

808
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,392
Sprains usually take about
six weeks to fully heal.

809
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,810
Can you hold this
like that for me?

810
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,312
Of course.

811
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,938
Weight bearing has
actually been shown

812
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,649
to speed up the healing process.

813
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,818
This is what NBA players
wear during games

814
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,820
after an ankle sprain.

815
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,948
Do you want to walk around
and see how it feels?

816
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,042
I believe this will suffice.

817
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,337
Your labs and your
brain scan are all normal.

818
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,130
So then what's wrong with me?

819
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,050
We're having a psychiatrist
come talk with you.

820
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,927
You think I'm crazy?

821
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,678
A psychiatric illness could
be causing your symptoms.

822
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,681
I'm not crazy.
You have to believe me.

823
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:58,017
Please.

824
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,943
Take me through
your skincare routine.

825
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,694
Don't leave anything out.

826
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:12,030
Write this down.

827
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:16,868
So, um, I start off
with a double cleanse.

828
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,621
Next is the essence...

829
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,666
I learned it from
a Korean beauty influencer...

830
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,210
then a serum.

831
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,045
Do you use products
from other countries?

832
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,215
Some of the best stuff
is from overseas.

833
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,926
They have better products
for skin brightening

834
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,053
and removing wrinkles.

835
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,388
You don't have wrinkles.

836
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,056
They'll be here
before you know it.

837
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,599
Don't do that.

838
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,101
You need to watch your elevens.

839
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,602
Do you have photos
of these products?

840
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,937
Of course.

841
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,230
I post everything
that works for me.

842
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,816
Can you show me?

Dr. Mohan, may we speak
for a moment?

855
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,283
I thought psych was taking over.

856
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,243
I haven't called them yet.

857
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,828
I've got five patients
back here that haven't

858
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,788
been seen yet,
51 more in the waiting room.

859
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:45,498
I'm thinking
this is a toxicology case.

860
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:47,751
Everything is pointing
to new-onset schizophrenia.

861
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,669
So what zebra are you hunting?

862
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,087
She's been using
a face cream from Asia

863
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,422
with a high mercury content.

864
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,132
This could explain
all her symptoms.

865
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,426
Look, the FDA website has

866
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,137
a list of imported products
that contain mercury.

867
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,638
She's been using this one.

868
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,098
I've ordered a heavy metal panel

869
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,310
looking for mercury,
lead, or arsenic.

870
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,729
Why didn't you consult me?

871
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,272
I consulted Dr. Collins.

872
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,649
Dr. Collins is not
supervising this case.

873
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,985
I know.
I just didn't know if...

874
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,072
If what?

875
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,743
I thought you were
having a bad day.

876
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,579
Did Dr. Collins say that?

877
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,663
No.

878
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:26,998
She was just trying to help.

879
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,001
Don't ever do that again.

880
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,798
Elevate to stop the swelling,
ice for 20 minutes twice a day,

881
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,966
and wear the ankle stirrup
until the pain is gone

882
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,301
and for another six weeks

883
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,178
whenever doing
anything athletic.

884
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,679
Any questions?

885
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,890
No. I'm all set.

886
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,227
And sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

887
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,686
That was a joke.

888
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:50,188
I understood your intention.

889
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,232
Is Dr. King around?

890
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,484
She might be
with another patient.

891
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,194
Will you tell her
goodbye for me?

892
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,904
She's a very good doctor.

893
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,615
Right. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

894
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,661
And good luck with
your table tennis tournament.

895
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,621
Thank you.

896
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,540

897
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,874

- Samira's patient.

You overrode me?

If Samira put in an order,
there was a reason.

Maybe you should too.

906
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:27,016
I'm trying to break her
of these bad habits.

907
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:28,143
- And you are enabling her.
- No.

908

You're riding her so hard,

909
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:31,187

to lose confidence.

910
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,689
It's affecting her.

911
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,941
I told her not
to take it personally.

912

I'm pretty sure it's because
today is the day Adamson...

- Then don't be.

Since you're giving out
feedback, I have some too.

926
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:08,099
You are a rule follower
in an environment

that requires flexibility.

928
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,187
You let fear drive
your decision making.

929

And you have no fucking respect
for your superiors.

- Superiors? Wow.
- Yeah.

I give you a lot of leeway,
but I'm your attending,

932

And you need to remember that.

OK, Dr. Robinavich.

- of the Trauma 1 patient.
- Yeah, OK.

939
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,167
With the wife, should I...

940
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,294
I'll handle it.

941

What's next?

942
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:39,339
Dr. Robby will explain
everything.

943
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,174
Dr. Robby, Susan Dunn.

944
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,634
- Hi.
- Hi.

945
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,344
OK, so your husband is gonna be

946
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,012
admitted to the ICU.

947
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,473
And if everything goes well,
then we'll extubate him,

948
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,141
and the chest tube can come out.

949
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,935
But he's gonna need
to stay in the hospital

950
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,686
for three or four days.

951
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:55,647
Thank you.

952
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,482
I'm going to take Alana home,
but I'll be back later.

953
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,108
There is one other thing.

954
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:02,529
Dr. Santos filled us in
on your conversation.

955
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,489
What you did to your husband
is against the law.

956
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,324
So unfortunately, we're required

957
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,409
to report it to the police.

958
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,827
Police?

959
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:11,412
No, I... I wasn't trying
to hurt him.

960
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:14,832
Even so, this is
where he ended up.

961
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,502
I would suggest that you speak
to somebody about your feelings

962
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,462
and talk to your daughter.

963
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,005
If there is something
happening at home,

964
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:22,507
she'll need to know that
you're willing to listen.

965
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,175
We have resources I can provide,

966
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,221
which include connecting you
to the authorities.

967
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,516
We'll be fine.

968
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:36,062
So that's it?

969
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,022
Hopefully, now that
it's out in the open,

970
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:41,025
she'll take the necessary steps
to handle this the right way.

971
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,361
- But she...
- Don't fight me on this.

972
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,990

your patients.

Are you OK?

974
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,704
The mother could be arrested,

975
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,372
and the daughter would be
left alone with her dad.

976
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,707

to someone...

978
