00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,192
I thought, you know,
it'd be a good fit.

181
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:51,276
Can I present my headache
to you?

182
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,819
Uh, yeah, what do you got?

183
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,696
A 36-year-old woman
with severe headache

184
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,531
due to paracervical
trigger point.

185
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:59,201
Her pain went from 11 to zero
after 2 ccs of IM Marcaine

186
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,536
- to the...
- Wait, wait, wait.

187
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,037
You did
a trigger point injection

188
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,705
- before presenting the case?
- Yeah. I...

189
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,999
Interns always present first.

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,251
I spent a month at
the pain clinic at Hopkins.

191
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,044
- No, it's not OK.
- Incoming!

192
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:11,004
- I'm very comfortable with...
- It's definitely not OK.

193
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,756
23-year-old Ben Kemper,
no helmet,

194
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:14,633
got doored riding an e-scooter.

195
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,635
Neck versus handlebar then
face-planted to the pavement.

196
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,220
Obvious facial fractures,

197
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,181
but alert and oriented
with good vitals.

198
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,935
Here we go.

199
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,772
One, two, three.

200
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,065
[elevated vitals
monitor beeping]

201
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,400
How are we doing, Ben?

202
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,777
- [strained]
- Blood, back in my throat.

203
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,571
That's probably
from the nosebleed.

204
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,447
Short Rapid Rhino, please.

205
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:40,701
Tachy at 120,
pulse ox borderline at 90.

206
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:42,077
Blow by at 15 liters for now.

207
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,620
- Neck contusion.
- BP 138 over 84.

208
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:45,330
Larynx shifted to the right,
no crepitance.

209
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,332
4 of morphine.

210
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,837
I'm going to stick something in
your nose to stop the bleeding.

211
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,547
No hemotympanum.

212
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:56,425
Inflate the balloon.

213
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,886
How about now, Ben?

214
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,388
- [softly] Better.
- What's up?

215
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,601
Good vitals,
A and O, let's have a look.

216
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,395
[gagging]

217
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:09,771
Ouch.

218
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:12,524
- Floating face.
- Le Fort III fracture.

219
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,943
You don't see that every day.
OK, let's prep for airway.

220
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:17,237
Double setup just in case.

221
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:18,864
[indistinct chatter]

222
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,992
[sighs]

223
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,662
[door clicks]

224
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:34,296
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

225
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,340
All right, Mr. Tagari,
you are good to go.

226
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,008
Oh, thank you.

227
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,346
Remember, 10% off
for doctors and nurses.

228
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,805
I'm a student doctor.

229
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,807
Oh, right. Sorry.
[chuckles]

230
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:48,185
- I hit my head, remember?
- Well, my son loves pizza,

231
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,811
so I will take you up on it
for sure, OK?

232
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,021
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

233
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:52,814
- Wait for a nurse.
- OK, thanks.

234
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,775
[whispers] Hi.

235
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,319
I just realized it sounds like
I always feed my kid junk food.

236
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,528
- Oh.
- You know?

237
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,113
Pizza, s'mores.

238
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:02,991
No, no, please.
I... I like pizza and s'mores.

239
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,827
- Who doesn't?
- Mm.

240
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:09,331
- How many kids do you have?
- Just one, Harrison.

241
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,792
He's 11 now.

242
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,168
What does your husband do?

243
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,128
No husband, just me and my son.

244
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,588
I take it you don't have kids?

245
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,966
I... I don't mean on account
of your age.

246
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,592
Or maybe I do.

247
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,511
I mean, most medical students
don't have kids.

248
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:26,139
Oh, yeah, no, no.
Um, no kids.

249
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,434
Just not even a boyfriend.
Uh, it's just school for now.

250
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,436
Yeah.
That'll keep you pretty busy.

251
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,730
I do not miss it.

252
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:36,024
Must have been difficult
as a young mother.

253
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:37,526
It had its moments,

254
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,236
but my life has been
full of challenges,

255
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:42,531
and med school was not one
of the hardest, by far.

256
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,867
It was one of the most
rewarding, though.

257
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:48,662
- Other than having my son.
- Hey.

258
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:51,081
Facial lash with possible
foreign object in the eye,

259
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:54,543
which is always a solid 7
on the WMMV Scale.

260
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,211
What Makes Mateo Vomit.

261
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:57,964
[laughs]

262
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,175
- You OK?
- Yeah.

263
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:05,721
Yeah.
Um, he's funny, the...

264
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,180
- the nurse.
- Oh, Mateo.

265
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:08,933
You can say his name.

266
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,519
Um, yeah, uh...

267
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,690
a foreign object in the eye
could be really serious.

268
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:18,318
[clears throat]

269
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,657
Hey, Fruitcake.

270
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,075
Hey, I'm talking to you,
Fruitcake.

271
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,827
Myrna, I told you
a hundred times

272
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,246
my name is Dr. Robby.

273
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,373
You want to see my vagina?

274
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:35,417
I have already seen it.

275
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,295
And once was enough, thank you.

276
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,380
Robby, parents of Nick Bradley,

277
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,133
- the OD teen, are here.
- OK, park them in Trauma 1.

278
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:44,927
He's not back from CT yet.

279
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:46,220
I'll be right there in a minute.

280
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:47,554
Got it.
Behaving yourself, Myrna?

281
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,474
Oh, yes, ma'am.

282
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:54,144
How we doing?

283
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:55,270
Ketamine and sux on board.

284
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:56,939
Pulse ox holding at 94.

285
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,315
Prepping the neck just in case.

286
00:10:58,316 --> 00:10:59,399
Let's have a look.

287
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,610
[steady beeping]

288
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,612
A little deeper.

289
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,239
Lots of swelling.
I can't see the cords.

290
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,783
To the right.
The left.

291
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,284
Yeah, it really distorted
from the trauma,

292
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,452
and the edema's
only going to get worse.

293
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:11,912
Which is why we should crike.

294
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,705
You don't crike
a laryngeal fracture.

295
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,957
Don't listen to
Edwina Scissorhands here.

296
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,375
If they can't cut it,

297
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,960
surgery doesn't know
how to fix it.

298
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,628
The contusion is high
at the thyroid cartilage,

299
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,296
so you just stand there
looking pretty, ER Ken,

300
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,757
and let me fix this.

301
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:25,133
- We're down to 85.
- All right, pull out.

302
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:27,427
- I-gel, bag and crike.
- I-gel, please.

303
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:28,720
- [rapid beeping]
- Turn off the alarm.

304
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,805
I've never done a crike before.

305
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,139
No. Mel will do the crike.

306
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,307
You've already had
a busy morning.

307
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:33,642
Glove up, Mel.

308
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,143
No, I'm doing the crike, doctor.

309
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,144
You would be doing it, <i>doctor,</i>

310
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,646
if it wasn't an odd day.

311
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,855
Surgery gets even days,
ED gets odd days.

312
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,607
You know this.
For crikes' sake.

313
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,276
That's because you're
all fucking odd down here.

314
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,027
OK, team work, please.
Let's focus on the patient.

315
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:46,029
I so appreciate
your gracious understanding.

316
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,781
I'll assist in case
she screws up.

317
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:49,825
Yolanda, play nice.

318
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,368
Sats are up with the I-gel.

319
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:53,829
You ready?
Hello?

320
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,622
Oh, uh, hello.

321
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:57,124
You've done this?

322
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,669
Yes, in the cadaver lab.

323
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,672
Let's hope that's not where
this poor soul ends up.

324
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,549
We'll do an open technique
since we have a minute.

325
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,718
OK.

326
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,803
OK, you're going to be
making a vertical incision

327
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:12,347
to avoid the jugulars
in the carotids.

328
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:13,807
[steady beeping]

329
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:15,601
Mm-hmm, good.

330
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,269
If this was a crike that needed
to happen in seconds,

331
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,272
you could use a 10 blade,
your finger, and a bougie.

332
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,149
[ventilator whooshing]

333
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,609
[vitals monitor beeping]

334
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,193
This is called a Weitlaner.

335
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:27,654
And this is your trake hook.

336
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:31,533
C-spine, head CT, OMF.
Start a propofol drip.

337
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,202
OK, now we're going to make
a horizontal incision

338
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:35,330
across
the cricothyroid membrane.

339
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:39,875
Yeah.

340
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,877
4.0 Shiley next.

341
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:43,129
Get ready to bag the crike.

342
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:47,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good.

343
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,013
[vitals monitor beeping]

344
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,224
Oh, excuse me.

345
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,392
No worries.

346
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:58,727
End tidal CO2 is yellow.

347
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:00,270
Yellow is yes.
Nicely done.

348
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:03,357
Sew it in.
OK, I will be next-door.

349
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:05,025
[sighs]

350
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:06,360
Does your resident
know how to suture,

351
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:07,736
or do I need to teach?

352
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,781
- You're all class, Yoyo.
- I know, thanks.

353
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:13,242
That means a lot of nothing
coming from you.

354
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,744
- Mel, you OK?
- If you're done fighting.

355
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:17,246
We're not fighting.
This is playing.

356
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:19,081
Langdon's too soft to fight.

357
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:21,083
Oh, yeah, I have nothing
but respect for Dr. Garcia.

358
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:22,543
In fact, I think she would

359
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,419
make a wonderful hostess
at Applebee's.

360
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,964
Later, Odds.

361
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,050
Let's go.

362
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,718
OK, thanks.

363
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,179
Just received word
your son's head CT is normal,

364
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,014
and he's maintaining
a good heart rate.

365
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,225
- You got him back.
- Thank you. Thank God.

366
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:39,685
Right now, he's unconscious

367
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,938
with a tube in his throat
for oxygen.

368
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,439
Why don't we step out
for a minute while they

369
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,983
get him settled,
and then you can come back?

370
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:48,443
You can sit with him
as long as you want.

371
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,946
Nicky, it's Mama.
I'm here, baby.

372
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:53,407
You're doing great, son.

373
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:56,285
Blown.

374
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:59,663
- OK, let's step outside.
- OK.

375
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,332
[indistinct chatter]

376
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,794
[sighs]

377
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,754
So we don't know

378
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:09,798
how long he was at home
without breathing.

379
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,968
- He's breathing now.
- Not on his own.

380
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:14,303
But he's going to wake up.

381
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,054
We certainly hope so.

382
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,306
We're going to know better after

383
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:18,807
we get some more
test results back.

384
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:21,560
Are you sure that
he didn't take anything

385
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,644
that could have caused this?

386
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,396
No, no, he's a good kid.

387
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,648
He's in college,
he has a part-time job.

388
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,943
He even chose to live at home
so he could focus on school.

389
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,820
Dr. Robby.
From the urine.

390
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:34,323
What's that?

391
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:35,657
It's a drug test.

392
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,285
And it is positive for fentanyl.

393
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:40,996
No, that is impossible.
Nick doesn't do drugs.

394
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:43,332
There are a lot of pills
that are sold illegally

395
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,542
that have fentanyl,
not just painkillers.

396
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:47,294
Xanax, Ativan.

397
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,796
- No, not our son.
- Uh...

398
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,381
Well, maybe he didn't know
that he took something

399
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,966
with fentanyl, I don't know.

400
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,177
The hows and the whys
don't really matter.

401
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:57,179
What matters is
spending time with Nick.

402
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,513
We've got some
more tests to run.

403
00:14:58,514 --> 00:14:59,640
We'll know our options
after that,

404
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:01,016
but in the meantime,

405
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,936
why don't you take a seat
and talk to him?

406
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,688
Can he hear us?

407
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,023
You know,
we're never really sure,

408
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:10,025
so we should assume that he can.

409
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:12,361
And we'll come find you
as soon as we know more, OK?

410
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:13,362
OK.

411
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:16,491
[vitals monitor beeping]

412
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,120
Can we move Nick Bradley
to a private room?

413
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,665
The kid going to make it?

414
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,959
Didn't he respond to Narcan?

415
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,002
I think his pinpoint pupils
just grew into blown pupils

416
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,128
from brainstem death.

417
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,465
- Shit.
- Yeah.

418
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,009
Not much older than Jake.

419
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,345
Don't go there.

420
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:41,390
- [alarm beeping]
- Hard not to sometimes.

421
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:43,559
Mr. Spencer's room.

422
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,394
Hey, Robby,

423
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,563
Theresa, the mother of the
young man David who bolted,

424
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:48,897
she's asking for her son.

425
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,399
OK.
I'll be there in a minute.

426
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,900
What is happening?

427
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:54,736
Uh, his oxygen levels
are dropping.

428
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,030
Mr. Spencer,
how are you feeling?

429
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,575
I don't remember where I parked.

430
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:01,535
Mr. Spencer,
do you know where you are?

431
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,912
It's so loud in here.

432
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:06,415
Dad?
Do you know where you are?

433
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,876
Dad, look at me.
What's my name?

434
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:12,963
[sobbing]
I don't know where my car is.

435
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:14,715
BiPAP, 15 over 5.

436
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,050
Let's step out.

437
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,180
What's a BiPAP?

438
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,517
It is a pressurized air mask
that can improve his oxygen.

439
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,935
Either his pneumonia
is getting worse

440
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,937
or his heart couldn't
handle the fluids

441
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,772
that we gave him
to treat the sepsis.

442
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,274
His lungs are filling up
with fluid.

443
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:33,734
Can't you take the fluid away?

444
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:35,569
Not without his
blood pressure crashing

445
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,862
with very bad consequences,

446
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,947
so let's just hope
the BiPAP works.

447
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:40,949
And if it doesn't?

448
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,410
Then I would need
to know your decision

449
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:44,786
about using a breathing machine.

450
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:46,788
We're still talking about it.

451
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,124
Well, we know
he expressed <i>his</i> wishes.

452
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,168
In writing.
"Do not intubate."

453
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,296
We're thinking
try it for a week.

454
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:57,591
That would be
a very painful week.

455
00:16:57,592 --> 00:17:00,302
He wouldn't get a lot of rest
with all the monitors

456
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,512
and all the blood tests.
He might need to be sedated.

457
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,014
He might need to be restrained

458
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,141
because he'd be
in an unfamiliar place

459
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,769
with a very uncomfortable tube
down his throat.

460
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,104
And he wouldn't really know
what was happening.

461
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,608
Elderly patients
can often develop psychosis.

462
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,861
- But he might get better.
- Or he might get worse.

463
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,155
What would you do?

464
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,907
I really
can't answer that for you.

465
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,450
This is your father.
It's your decision to make.

466
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,118
I can guarantee you

467
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,954
that we will keep him
as comfortable as possible

468
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,789
if a natural death
is what you choose.

469
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,499
But he's not your father.

470
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,292
[shakily]
And he can recover from this.

471
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:34,002
What my sister means

472
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:36,047
is that we're still deciding
the best thing to do.

473
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,176
Well, the sooner you decide,
the better.

474
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:42,511
I'm really sorry.

475
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,513
I wish there was more
that I could do.

476
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,848
I'm not sure that
he has that much time left.

477
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,393
[gasps]

478
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:55,441
Dr. Robby.

479
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,365
You were right.

480
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,033
She can't say whether
she was bumped by accident

481
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,869
- or shoved on purpose.
- No other witnesses?

482
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,413
No, not really.

483
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,373
We pulled security footage.
Maybe we'll find something.

484
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:13,667
Hopefully she tripped.

485
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:15,085
I don't mean I hope she tripped.

486
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:17,588
I mean I hope she wasn't
pushed on purpose.

487
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,548
That would this a hate crime.

488
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,050
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,219
- Ma'am?
- Doctor.

490
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,388
Sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

491
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:28,682
[laughs] No harm, no foul.

492
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:33,104
Will you let me know
if she says anything else?

493
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,107
Will do.

494
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:40,068
At the risk of seeming...

495
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:41,236
Then you probably shouldn't.

496
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,572
- I just...
- No, trust me.

497
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,365
- How do you know...
- I just know.

498
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:48,327
- I just wanted...
- I know.

499
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,246
Look, I'll let you know
if she says anything else

500
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:54,000
that could be important
to your investigation.

501
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,463
Thank you.

502
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:02,424
- You know, for the record...
- Nope.

503
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:05,595
[chuckles]

504
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:15,437
Any luck getting our
psych boarders upstairs?

505
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:18,775
Yeah, right, at least
the Kraken's still sleeping.

506
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:21,401
Is it me or was that officer...

507
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:23,445
- No.
- What?

508
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:26,740
- You don't even know what I...
- What you were going to say?

509
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:29,785
Maybe you do.

510
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,745
- He seemed nice.
- Absolutely not.

511
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:33,622
Mm-mm.

512
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:35,123
There is no possible scenario

513
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:37,584
in which you and I
have this conversation.

514
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:39,461
You of all people
should know better.

515
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:42,214
- I was...
- No.

516
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,799
Just walk away.

517
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,969
Best possible scenario.
Just keep on walking.

518
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,804
Mm-hmm.

519
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,765
You got to lay off mixing
Adderall and energy drinks.

520
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:53,100
Trust me, I will.

521
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:55,228
[chuckles]
All right. Thanks.

522
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,980
That's the thing about
emergency medicine.

523
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,481
You never know what
you're going to get.

524
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,358
And we get everything.

525
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,651
Is that why you chose it?

526
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,319
[sighs] Maybe a little.

527
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,821
I also get to pick my shifts,

528
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,490
which, for a single mother,
is amazing.

529
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:11,201
But mostly, I just like
the people, you know?

530
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:12,870
They're always there
when you need them.

531
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:14,496
Who wouldn't want to
be a part of that, you know?

532
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:17,165
[alarm beeping]

533
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,167
[softly]
Fuck off.

534
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,254
[sighs]

535
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,301
<i>This is the monitoring center.</i>

536
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:29,177
<i>We see that you are not
in your inclusion zone.</i>

537
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:31,263
<i>Do you have permission
to be outside this area?</i>

538
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,807
Yes, I am at work.

539
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:37,644
Just like last time
and the time before that.

540
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:39,146
[alarm beeping]

541
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,355
[sighs]
I'll be right back.

542
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:42,357
[alarm echoing]

543
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,860
What is the point
of this fucking thing

544
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:46,486
if it doesn't even work?

545
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,530
[sighs]

546
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:51,659
[beeping alarm echoing
in hallway]

547
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:55,621
Sorry.

548
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,623
You're doing great.
Take your time.

549
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,665
You OK?

550
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,167
I am... yeah.

551
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:01,543
I get frustrated
when I can't do things,

552
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:03,045
or at least it looks like it.

553
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:05,255
Yeah, you and me both.

554
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:08,592
Thanks, but my frustration
manifests itself emotionally,

555
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,510
and then, uh, I get upset,

556
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,346
and then it looks like
I can't handle things,

557
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:14,514
and, you know, then I can't cry
in front of the patient

558
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:15,724
because no one wants
to see their doctor cry.

559
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,434
That's just a big red flag.

560
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:20,730
You just did a perfect crike.
You're doing great.

561
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:25,859
Hey, you!
Pasty white!

562
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,277
How about a sandwich?

563
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:30,572
Uh, what brings you
here today, sir?

564
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:33,492
I'm here for a fucking sandwich.

565
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,244
OK.

566
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:38,163
OK, uh, excuse me...

567
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:39,581
- Perlah.
- Perlah.

568
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:41,416
Can this patient get a sandwich?

569
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:42,918
I already gave you
a sandwich, Earl.

570
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,837
I ain't ate this whole week.

571
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,506
[chuckles] Sure.

572
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,341
Give him another sandwich.
They're on the food cart.

573
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,551
Just make sure
it's not egg salad,

574
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:52,094
or he'll throw it on the floor.

575
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:53,972
OK. Good to know.
Thanks.

576
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:10,112
Any quick ones up here?

577
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:11,947
It's only 8:30,
and Robby's already on my case

578
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:13,907
for being too slow.

579
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:14,992
I can usually at least
make it to lunch

580
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:16,618
before he starts hounding me.

581
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:18,495
Cut him a little slack
today, OK?

582
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:21,123
It's the anniversary
of Dr. Adamson's death.

583
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:23,750
That's sad.

584
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:26,420
But it's still no reason
to take it out on me.

585
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:28,130
I'm just saying.

586
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:30,632
- Dr. Mohan?
- Samira, please.

587
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,634
I just wanted to apologize.

588
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:35,721
When my phone went off earlier,
that was really unprofessional.

589
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,097
Don't sweat it.
Trust me.

590
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:38,473
We need to laugh.

591
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:39,975
Otherwise,
we'd never stop crying.

592
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:41,310
Thank you.

593
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,769
Besides, with all the craziness

594
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,104
that comes through here
every hour,

595
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:45,898
- nobody cares or notices.
- [sighs]

596
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,275
Got an unresponsive
unhoused man coming in.

597
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:52,363
Might be a good teaching case,
Funky Music.

598
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,824
Let's go.

599
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:57,159
Caucasian male,

600
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,827
approximately
60 to 70 years old,

601
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:02,207
found unresponsive.
No signs of trauma, no ID.

602
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,292
On three.

603
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,587
One, two, three.

604
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:12,299
Oof.
Did you take anything?

605
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,800
I smell the alcohol from here.

606
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:15,010
This guy's wearing
the spring, summer,

607
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:16,178
and fall collection.

608
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,304
[scissors rustling]

609
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:18,513
[rat squeaking]
Oh! Whoa!

610
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:20,307
- Jesus, uh...
- Oh, oh, oh!

611
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:21,350
- [rats squeaking]
- What the...

612
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:22,684
Oh!

613
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:25,354
Uh, what's wrong?
What's going on?

614
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:28,357
Patient tested positive
for rats.

615
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:29,733
No.

616
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:33,320
If it matters,
I only counted three.

617
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:34,821
Oh, there goes one.

618
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:39,284
- [clattering]
- [laughs]

619
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,453
Because your son
tested positive for THC,

620
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,622
the psychoactive ingredient
in cannabis,

621
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,290
we're going to have to
admit him for overnight

622
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,292
observation and monitoring.

623
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,378
And what about his brain?

624
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:51,797
Is there a chance that much pot
is going to do some damage?

625
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,215
He's only four.

626
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:54,883
The honest answer
is we don't know.

627
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,468
There haven't been
any long-term studies,

628
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,220
but the fact that this is
a one-time occurrence

629
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:00,389
suggests that there should be
no long-term effects.

630
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,140
But you don't know.

631
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,309
So my son could end up
with learning disabilities,

632
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,770
psychiatric problems,
or even autism because of this.

633
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:08,564
There's no evidence
to suggest any of that.

634
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:11,358
Hello.
I'm Kiara Alfaro.

635
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,235
I'm the department
social worker.

636
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:16,196
Kiara will help you
navigate the next steps.

637
00:24:16,197 --> 00:24:17,447
What steps?

638
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:19,032
Well, a case like this

639
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:22,077
requires mandatory reporting
to child services

640
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:24,121
- and sometimes law enforcement.
- No.

641
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:25,289
Why... why do you have
to involve the police?

642
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,623
It's a controlled substance.

643
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,292
They're not taking my kid away.

644
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:30,210
- They were pot gummies.
- No one's suggesting that.

645
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:32,296
Well, fuck your suggestions!
No one is touching my child!

646
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:33,797
In fact, we're leaving.

647
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:35,299
Well you...
no, you can't take your son.

648
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,925
He could stop breathing.
He could have a seizure.

649
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:38,510
- I will observe him at home.
- Amanda, please.

650
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,178
- Fuck off, Drew.
- Get security.

651
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,555
If you can't cooperate,

652
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:42,931
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

653
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:44,433
Amanda, please.
He needs to stay here.

654
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:46,184
And you need
to get a fucking hotel.

655
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,436
Your son can't leave
the hospital,

656
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:48,770
but I can have you removed.

657
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,105
Don't you dare touch me.

658
00:24:50,106 --> 00:24:51,773
Get out! All of you!

659
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:53,942
Mrs. Jones, I know this
is scary and stressful.

660
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:56,111
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you!
This is my son.

661
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,446
My son!
And nobody is touching him!

662
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,114
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

663
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:00,532
- How can I help you?
- By backing the fuck off!

664
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,117
Mom's worried
a CYF investigation.

665
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:04,119
- Amanda, just calm down!
- OK, OK, OK, enough!

666
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,537
This is a hospital.

667
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,122
This isn't
"The Jerry Springer Show."

668
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:09,625
Ma'am, nobody's trying
to take your child,

669
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:11,293
so why don't you
stay here with him

670
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:13,086
while your husband talks
to our social worker outside

671
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:14,755
and straightens all this out?

672
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:17,132
Well, I don't want him
speaking for me and my son.

673
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,092
Well, it is either you or him.

674
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:22,095
Your son is not leaving,
but you can be escorted out

675
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:24,139
and even arrested
if you refuse to cooperate.

676
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,641
Nobody wants that.

677
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:27,685
So you tell us.
What do you want to do?

678
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:33,440
- I'm staying with my son.
- OK, great.

679
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,275
You do that.

680
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:37,653
We all on the same page here?

681
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:39,029
Thank you, Olsen.

682
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,072
- You know where to find me.
- You OK?

683
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:41,823
Yeah, we got this.

684
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,659
- All good.
- It's all yours.

685
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,410
Mrs. Jones, we just
have a couple things.

686
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,246
[indistinct PA announcement]

687
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,664
[indistinct chatter]

688
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:49,998
Everything all right out there?

689
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,334
Yeah, just another day
in paradise.

690
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,294
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

691
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:56,838
- Where's David?
- He left.

692
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,675
He said he had to
get back to school.

693
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,301
[sighing] Oh.

694
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:03,095
Um, maybe you
could try calling him,

695
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,305
get him to come back.

696
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:09,935
What's going to happen
to him if I do?

697
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,187
Hopefully he'll be willing
to talk to somebody.

698
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:14,815
- Will you talk to him?
- I can try.

699
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:17,526
I don't think
he wanted to talk to me.

700
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,861
Have you shared with anyone

701
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,989
about the writings
of his you found?

702
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,740
No.

703
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:25,492
I didn't know who to tell.

704
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,703
I just don't want
to see him get hurt.

705
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:29,581
Neither do we.

706
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:38,881
[sighs]

707
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,257
It's just going straight
to voicemail.

708
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:42,427
Maybe if you can text him.

709
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,099
[phone chirps]

710
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:56,815
He's not texting back.

711
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,400
Oh, I'm sorry about all this.

712
00:26:58,401 --> 00:26:59,902
It's OK, it's OK.

713
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:03,155
What are you doing for David
is very brave.

714
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:04,406
I'm his mother.

715
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:06,534
I'll do anything to protect him.

716
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:09,745
Do you think
he would hurt anyone?

717
00:27:09,746 --> 00:27:11,456
No.

718
00:27:13,124 --> 00:27:17,127
But...

719
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:20,923
I'm sure
a lot of parents felt that way

720
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:23,885
before their children
did unspeakable things.

721
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,930
Does he have any history
of violence?

722
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,389
Has he ever been in any trouble?

723
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,807
No, never.

724
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:33,268
He's very quiet.

725
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:35,646
And he takes great care of me.

726
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:41,151
He... he's struggled
with his father's death.

727
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:43,111
We both have.

728
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,447
Flight is ten minutes out
with an electrocution.

729
00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:48,534
OK, grab Collins.
I'll be right there.

730
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:49,952
Keep trying to reach him.

731
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:51,578
If you do,
have someone come find me.

732
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:53,956
- OK?
- OK.

733
00:27:53,957 --> 00:27:56,083
- Thank you.
- Of course.

734
00:27:56,084 --> 00:27:58,252
- You got some good news for me?
- I sure do.

735
00:27:58,253 --> 00:27:59,878
There are two rooms
in ICU being cleaned.

736
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,630
- They'll be ready by now.
- Great.

737
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:02,756
And I got bagels in the lounge.

738
00:28:02,757 --> 00:28:04,299
Nice job.
Thank you.

739
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,718
[sighs]

740
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,263
- Is it true?
- You have to be more specific.

741
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:10,889
Are there rats in the ED?

742
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,225
Uh, apparently,
if somebody already snitched.

743
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:15,644
Do you know how bad this looks?

744
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:17,646
One more reason
to shutter this place.

745
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:19,856
Only the emergency department
admits rats.

746
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,483
Emergency department
would never admit rats,

747
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:23,026
unless they had
the right insurance.

748
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:24,444
Did you catch any of them?

749
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:26,196
One, and I charged him
for a full visit.

750
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:27,781
I'm glad
you think this is funny.

751
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:28,949
I'm sorry that you don't.

752
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,701
Did you call an exterminator?

753
00:28:30,702 --> 00:28:32,494
He's waiting
on a second opinion.

754
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:35,706
[shuddering chuckle]
You're pushing your luck today.

755
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:36,999
Don't worry.
Last I heard,

756
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,375
they were headed
for the cafeteria,

757
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:39,543
so they should be dead
within the hour.

758
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:41,003
- OK.
- [groans]

759
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:43,881
- I'll be here all week.
- Or maybe not.

760
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:47,509
[screaming]

761
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,803
Drug-seeking woman
kicked off the city bus

762
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:51,179
for disrupting
and disturbing passengers.

763
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,764
I called 911!

764
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,516
She's been screaming
for narcotics nonstop.

765
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:56,143
We found an empty Percocet
bottle filled five days ago.

766
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:57,311
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

767
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:58,770
She's been uncooperative

768
00:28:58,771 --> 00:28:59,980
and combative
since we picked her up.

769
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:01,356
Get off her.
Let her go.

770
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:02,941
- Stop fighting.
- [screams]

771
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,776
Calm the fuck down,
or I'm calling the cops.

772
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,486
My meds at home aren't working!

773
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:08,697
Please, I have sickle cell!

774
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:10,490
OK, stop.
Everybody stop.

775
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:12,160
Stop!

776
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:14,494
- [screams]
- What's your name?

777
00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:16,705
It's Joyce.
It's Joyce St. Claire.

778
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:18,916
Joyce, is this
your sickle cell pain?

779
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:21,210
- Yes!
- 10 milligrams of IV morphine.

780
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:22,544
- You really want 10?
- Yes.

781
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:23,712
Repeat it in five minutes
if needed.

782
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:25,047
And she needs a Dilaudid drip.

783
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:26,173
This is a vaso-occlusive crisis!

784
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,341
I'm so sorry this happened.

785
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,926
You're going to be OK now.

786
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:30,052
- [sobs]
- You're safe here, I promise.

787
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:31,553
Come on.

788
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:33,222
You're going to be safe here.
I promise.

789
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:35,057
- Just breathe. OK?
- [exhales deeply]

790
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:38,144
[helicopter whirring]

791
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:02,000
Live wire hit his left forearm,

792
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,710
shocked him once for v-fib.

793
00:30:03,711 --> 00:30:05,754
- Was there a power pole down?
- No, abandoned factory.

794
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:06,838
We found bolt cutters
at his side.

795
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,090
Got electrocuted.

796
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:09,091
Was he trying to steal copper?

797
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:10,092
Most likely.

798
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:12,010
Powerline fried his arm,

799
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,888
and the current through his
whole body stopped his heart.

800
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:17,558
Ready?

801
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,727
Steady, lift.

802
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:24,273
Add a myoglobin and a CK
to the labs.

803
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:26,275
Two liters normal saline
wide open.

804
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:28,068
Dr. Santos,
what are we worried about?

805
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:30,988
Um, rhabdomyolysis
from tissue damage

806
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:33,949
can kill the kidneys, ongoing
risk of cardiac irritability.

807
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,576
- Excellent.
- AP pads in place.

808
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:37,286
Guy fell off a telephone pole?

809
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:39,621
- No, he was on a platform.
- Boring.

810
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:42,165
Cut into a live wire.

811
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,834
Tense ventral compartment.

812
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:45,294
Set up the STIC
pressure monitor.

813
00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:46,795
- [steady electronic beep]
- V-fib.

814
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:48,255
- All right, charge to 300.
- Charge to 300.

815
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:49,464
Am I running this or are you?

816
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:51,592
- Sorry, reflex response.
- Clear.

817
00:30:51,593 --> 00:30:52,968
[defibrillator thumps]

818
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,303
- [electricity snaps]
- Ah, fuck!

819
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:55,804
Sorry.

820
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:57,306
- Sorry.
- [shudders]

821
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,892
So what... what happened?

822
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,436
[whispering] I bought it
for my girlfriend's dog.

823
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:06,481
I work nights,
and he yaps all day long.

824
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:09,151
And when I woke up,
I was wearing it.

825
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,736
Stupid bitch!

826
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:12,112
[electricity snaps]
[whimpers]

827
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:15,115
Sorry, sorry.

828
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:17,618
I think she must have
used Krazy Glue.

829
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:20,954
Yeah, it, um, it looks that way.

830
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,664
Have you tried
removing the batteries?

831
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:26,668
Of course.
She glued the case shut.

832
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:29,546
All right, I think we have
a couple options, Gary.

833
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:32,633
Um, we can try to find
a solvent that will dissolve

834
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:35,052
or at least soften the glue
enough for you to peel it off

835
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:37,179
without taking your skin
with it.

836
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,389
Or, um...

837
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,975
- Dr. Javadi?
- Um...

838
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:45,020
I... I guess your skin cells
on your neck will naturally

839
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:48,523
slough off and you should just
be able to remove it in time.

840
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,568
- How much time?
- Um, couple of weeks, maybe.

841
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:52,903
- Couple weeks?
- [electricity snaps]

842
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:54,529
I think this guy's got scurvy.

843
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,697
What is he, a pirate?

844
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:57,366
No, he's an unhoused man

845
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,952
who lives almost exclusively
on dollar store ramen.

846
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:02,538
There's perifollicular
hemorrhage, gingivitis,

847
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,873
bleeding gums, and, um, yeah,

848
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:06,333
no fruit or vegetables
in his diet.

849
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:07,626
I suppose that could do it

850
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:09,461
as long as
you've ruled out piracy.

851
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:12,548
No parrot, no peg leg,
doesn't reek of sweat and rum?

852
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,508
Well, now that you
mention it, there was a smell.

853
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:17,511
Probably a pirate.

854
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:18,887
Tell him to pick up
some vitamin C

855
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:20,431
next time he docks
at a dollar store.

856
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:24,393
I can't tell if you're joking.

857
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:26,728
No, Captain Scurvy's
got a vitamin C deficiency.

858
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:29,231
Cheapest way to fix it
is with a daily supplement.

859
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:31,066
Captain Scurvy is another joke.

860
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,068
- I'd like to think so.
- It's a good one.

861
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:35,112
Dr. Langdon, Dr. King,
this is Arthur Carlson

862
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:36,863
from Children,
Youth, and Families.

863
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,740
He'd like to speak to
the parents of Tyler Jones.

864
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:40,617
Right, right.

865
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:43,120
Uh, Mel, would you mind showing
him to Kiara and the family?

866
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:44,622
Mm. Yeah, right this way.

867
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,253
- Beto?
- Hello, Doctor.

868
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:54,631
- What are you doing here?
- I'm working day shifts now.

869
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:56,592
Didn't you retire
a couple of years ago?

870
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:58,093
No.

871
00:32:58,094 --> 00:33:01,263
- I have to work today.
- Right.

872
00:33:01,264 --> 00:33:02,848
Right.
Just stay right here, OK?

873
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,766
I... I have a lot
of cleaning to do.

874

Resume compressions, amp of epi.

1049
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:51,632
Slower, slower tempo,
slower tempo.

1050
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,550
- Should I intubate?
- No. Drop an LMA.

1051
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:56,220
We don't want
to hold compressions.

1052
00:39:56,221 --> 00:39:58,347
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

1053
00:39:58,348 --> 00:39:59,807
He's been down a long time.

1054
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:13,195
How we doing in here?

1055
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:14,696
So much better.

1056
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:17,324
Dr. Mohan, this is my wife,
Ondine.

1057
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,952
Dr. Samira Mohan.
Nice to meet you, Ondine.

1058
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:22,120
- Thank you for helping her.
- Of course.

1059
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:24,873
And, again, I'm so sorry
about how you were treated

1060
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:26,542
when you first arrived.

1061
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:27,960
Not everyone who works here

1062
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:29,878
is accustomed to dealing
with sickle cell.

1063
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:31,338
We will be doing
everything possible

1064
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:34,007
from here on in
to manage Joyce's crisis.

1065
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:35,884
In the meantime,
can I get you anything?

1066
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:36,885
I'm fine.

1067
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:38,387
- Ondine?
- No, thank you.

1068
00:40:38,388 --> 00:40:39,846
OK. Well, have the nurses
come find me

1069
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:41,015
if you need anything.

1070
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:46,103
Take slow, deep breaths
for me, Ian.

1071
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:49,106
They ordered a neb,
5 albuterol, 125 solumedrol.

1072
00:40:49,107 --> 00:40:50,732
All right.

1073
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:52,401
Keep an eye on him
and present to Dr. Langdon.

1074
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:54,528
- OK.
- OK, great.

1075
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:56,738
I'll see you back in triage
once he settles down.

1076
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,615
Yeah.

1077
00:40:58,616 --> 00:40:59,741
OK, let's take this off.

1078
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:01,201
All right, hang in there, Ian.

1079
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:03,037
This should really help
your asthma.

1080
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:14,089
How can I help you, hon?

1081
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,507
Um, I'm looking
for Dr. Langdon.

1082
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,343
Yeah, let me see where he is.

1083
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:22,681
Dr. Langdon,
we have a med student

1084
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:24,309
at Central looking for you.

1085
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:27,603
Copy that.
He's headed this way.

1086
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:28,813
Thanks.

1087
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:31,273
Hey, Crash.

1088
00:41:31,274 --> 00:41:33,775
You missed
a pretty cool fasciotomy.

1089
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:35,110
I'm not sure I'd be describing

1090
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,695
a fasciotomy as cool.

1091
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:39,406
You would if you were
the one who did it.

1092
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:42,535
How's it going out
in the arrivals lounge?

1093
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:47,456
Do you know anything
about Dr. McKay?

1094
00:41:47,457 --> 00:41:49,791
I've been here
for less than two hours.

1095
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:52,961
I don't know anybody,
including you.

1096
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:55,839
I thought you were some kind
of kid genius.

1097
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,300
I'm like any other
third-year med student.

1098
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:01,178
Clearly.
[chuckles]

1099
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:02,638
Hey, I'm just trying
to break the ice.

1100
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,681
I'm not trying to annoy you.

1101
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:06,642
And yet, you're still
calling me Crash

1102
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:08,018
when I asked you not to.

1103
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:09,811
Really?
You're still on that?

1104
00:42:09,812 --> 00:42:11,231
Still on that.

1105
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:15,442
[sighs]
Yep. OK, sorry.

1106
00:42:15,443 --> 00:42:20,405
I had no idea genius
was so sensitive.

1107
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:23,492
But I get it.
Big brain, big feelings.

1108
00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:24,952
Makes total sense.

1109
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:26,871
I'll try to be softer.

We switch out every few minutes.

1115
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:53,814
- You can take a break.
- I'm fine.

1116
00:42:53,815 --> 00:42:55,065
Hold compressions.

1117
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,025
[flatline tone droning]

1118
00:42:57,026 --> 00:42:58,694
Still in asystole.

1119
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:01,196
Resume compressions.

1120
00:43:01,197 --> 00:43:02,531
Should we shock him?

1121
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:03,991
You don't shock asystole.

1122
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:05,242
It could be fine v-fib.

1123
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:07,911
- Not a chance.
- OK.

1124
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:09,162
Uh, when was his last epi?

1125
00:43:09,163 --> 00:43:10,873
- Three minutes ago.
- OK.

1126
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:12,249
Well, ACLS says every
three to five minute, right?

1127
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,835
- So let's push another round.
- Fine.

1128
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:17,713
Robby, Mr. Spencer's adult
children are asking for you.

1129
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:19,631
And the parents of Nick Bradley,

1130
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:21,550
the fentanyl overdose,
also want to speak with you.

1131
00:43:21,551 --> 00:43:22,968
OK.

1132
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:26,179
Three rounds of epi
and then call it.

1133
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,724
Mr. Spencer's maxed out
on BiPAP, 25 on 10.

1134
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:31,727
- Sats?
- Not great, High 80s.

1135
00:43:31,728 --> 00:43:34,563
[indistinct chatter]

1136
00:43:34,564 --> 00:43:36,315
Hi. I heard you wanted
to talk to me.

1137
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,150
Yeah.
That alarm kept going off.

1138
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:41,153
Yeah.
Why don't we step outside?

1139
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:43,488
[clears throat]
The alarm is for low oxygen.

1140
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,741
Does he need more
of that, um, BiPAP?

1141
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,826
I'm afraid
that's as high as we go.

1142
00:43:47,827 --> 00:43:49,578
So the decision
at this point is...

1143
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:52,582
We want you to put our father
on the breathing machine.

1144
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,084
Even though that goes
against his desires

1145
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:58,420
to not be intubated?

1146
00:43:58,421 --> 00:44:00,923
We're not ready to let go yet.

1147
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:04,010
And if your father is?

1148
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:06,970
He was a stubborn son of a bitch

1149
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:09,556
who would never have given up
on either of us.

1150
00:44:09,557 --> 00:44:12,309
We're not giving up on him.

1151
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,311
You're absolutely certain
you want

1152
00:44:14,312 --> 00:44:16,439
to put your father through this
after everything I've told you?

1153
00:44:19,484 --> 00:44:20,943
[sighs]

1154
00:44:20,944 --> 00:44:25,113
I may have to honor
his advanced directive.

1155
00:44:25,114 --> 00:44:29,243
No, you have to honor our
durable power for health care.

1156
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:32,705
If not, we can talk
to your hospital attorney.

1157
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,459
Jereme,
you're on board with this?

1158
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,712
Yeah, I guess so.

1159
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:44,091
OK. You can sit with him
until we're ready.

1160
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:46,260
- And when will that be?
- Momentarily.

1161
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:49,764
[indistinct chatter]

1162
00:44:57,855 --> 00:44:59,189
Please don't tell me

1163
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,524
you're going to intubate
that poor man.

1164
00:45:00,525 --> 00:45:02,276
It's what the family wants.

1165
00:45:02,277 --> 00:45:03,986
So what?
They want to torture him?

1166
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:06,488
I explained all that.

1167
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:10,492
If I co-sign, you can
override their durable power.

1168
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:12,327
They're threatening
to go to the hospital attorney.

1169
00:45:12,328 --> 00:45:13,787
Let them.
Call the Ethics Committee.

1170
00:45:13,788 --> 00:45:14,997
They'll agree with us.

1171
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:16,331
No, no, you're probably right.

1172
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:17,833
But we don't have
that kind of time.

1173
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:19,626
We are stuck.

1174
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:22,755
- What are you talking about?
- Shit.

1175
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:26,341
What?

1176
00:45:26,342 --> 00:45:27,759
I got to go tell those parents

1177
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,262
their 18-year-old son
is brain-dead.

1178
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:32,848
- Want me to come with you?
- No, It's OK.

1179
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:34,182
What are you going to say?

1180
00:45:34,183 --> 00:45:35,642
I'm going to say
that it's likely,

1181
00:45:35,643 --> 00:45:37,185
but we still need
to do an apnea test

1182
00:45:37,186 --> 00:45:40,272
and a cerebral perfusion study.

1183
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:41,982
There's no
cranial nerve activity.

1184
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:45,819
- Those people need some hope.
- False hope.

1185
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,946
- Hope is hope.
- Is it?

1186
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:51,533
What, are we praying
for miracles today?

1187
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:53,035
They need time to process

1188
00:45:53,036 --> 00:45:56,038
before they can accept
what's happening.

1189
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,499
You ever consider
taking that advice?

1190
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,586
Physician, heal thyself.

1191
00:46:02,587 --> 00:46:04,214
Don't you have patients?

No, no, no, no, no, no.

1194
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:31,573
You can wake him up.

1195
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:33,867
You can do that.
You can... you can shock...

1196
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:36,411
you can...
you can shock him back.

- Not yet.

Dr. Robby said
three rounds of epi.

1215
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,022
It's time.
Let's push another amp.

1216
00:48:27,023 --> 00:48:28,650
This one could do it.
