1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,178
There is no way
this is happening.

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,845
Not now, not ever.

3
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:16,180
Mom, stop!

4
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,557
This is what you had in mind

5
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,724
{\an8}for your fun weekend
with your aunt?

6
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,352
{\an8}- All right. Can we...
- I was trying to help her.

7
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:24,311
{\an8}No, what would have
been helpful is telling me

8
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:25,980
that my daughter is pregnant!

9
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,482
Instead, I find out
from a confused teenage boy!

10
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:30,149
- Jackson told you?
- Yeah, he did.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,110
Whoa, whoa,
everything OK in here?

12
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:34,027
This is Mrs. Wheeler,
Kristi's mother.

13
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:36,196
Lynette is Kristi's aunt.

14
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:37,531
She doesn't want
to have this baby.

15
00:00:37,532 --> 00:00:39,365
This has nothing to do with you!

16
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:42,201
- OK, maybe we just take...
- Mom, I called Aunt Lynn, OK?

17
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:44,035
I don't want to be a teen mom.

18
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:45,537
Well, then maybe
you should have thought of that

19
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:47,080
before you started having sex.

20
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,872
OK, emotions are running high.

21
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:50,374
I think a private conversation

22
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,750
between mother and daughter
is in order.

23
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,043
Lynette, let's you and I
step out.

24
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:54,545
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

25
00:00:56,714 --> 00:01:00,675
[indistinct chatter]

26
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,053
The crashed ambulance thieves
are en route.

27
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:07,972
ETA, 10 minutes.
Trauma 2's all yours.

28
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,222
Great.

29
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:10,724
They better be meth-head junkies

30
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,225
'cause Abby wants a Birkin
for her birthday.

31
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:13,559
What's she gonna do
with a Birkin?

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,893
Hopefully forgive me for getting

33
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:16,729
the kids a goldendoodle.

34
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,354
You want to be a good husband?

35
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:20,189
Send her on a vacation

36
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,692
without you or the kids
or a damn puppy.

37
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:24,693
Are you mean to everyone
or just me?

38
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:26,987
Just you.

39
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:28,571
Hey, what's the status

40
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,239
of the head CT on Joseph Marino?

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,741
Uh, still waiting on results.

42
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,491
He's postictal
and sleeping in North 2.

43
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,160
- No more seizure activity.
- Good.

44
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,412
Let me know as soon as
those CT results get back.

45
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:38,537
Yeah, of course.

46
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,998
[indistinct chatter]

47
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,249
How's, uh, Travis,
our tonsillectomy patient?

48
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,585
Oh, I, uh, just dropped
him off at surgery.

49
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:47,462
- He's doing well.
- Good work.

50
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:49,588
- You kept him from bleeding out.
- Oh, no, come on.

51
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:51,089
That was all you and Dr. Robby.

52
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,299
I mean, I could never have done

53
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,716
what you guys did
with that airway.

54
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:55,259
Not yet.
That's why you're here.

55
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,761
But you stayed with him
the whole time.

56
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,511
He would have died
at most other hospitals.

57
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,764
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I guess you're right.

58
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,599
Yeah, I usually am.

59
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,938
[indistinct chatter]

60
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,652
I'm sorry about all of this.

61
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,402
I didn't think
that Eloise would find out.

62
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:20,446
Yeah, well, she did.

63
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:22,447
Kristi should make
her own decisions.

64
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,282
Unfortunately,
she's still considered a minor.

65
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,950
Why don't you take a seat?

66
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,786
And we'll come find you
if there's an update.

67
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:31,538
[taps glass]
[buzzer sounds]

68
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,206
- What do you need, Robby?
- Escaping.

69
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:34,374
Go, go.

70
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,417
- Dr. Robinavitch.
- Gloria.

71
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:38,293
This is Dr. Tracy Morris,

72
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:40,545
regional manager of ECQ America.

73
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,088
The contract management group.

74
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:43,756
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

75
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:45,132
But if you'll excuse me,
I'm a little slammed,

76
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,676
as per usual.

77
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:47,967
We were upstairs
with the executive team

78
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,302
going over a proposal.

79
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,345
- A proposal?
- Mm-hmm.

80
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:51,596
We're interested in having

81
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:53,138
your emergency department
join us.

82
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,349
The 500 or so ERs
you have aren't enough?

83
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,141
What can I say?
Business is good.

84
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,601
Yeah, for who?

85
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:00,978
- Everyone benefits.
- Do they, though?

86
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,105
Your contract management's
corporate mandate

87
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:05,315
is profits for shareholders
above everything else, yes?

88
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,899
- Robby.
- Dah-dah-dah.

89
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,317
Your hospital's board
was very impressed

90
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,778
with ECQ's metrics
on patient satisfaction,

91
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:12,320
throughput time,
and billing collections.

92
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:13,822
Does your proposal
include the part

93
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:16,324
where you cut the pay
for all my doctors?

94
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:18,701
Maybe I can find
an incentive for you.

95
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:20,994
How does regional
medical director sound?

96
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:24,497
Lighter workload,
better benefits, stock options.

97
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,332
Did you go to business school
or medical school?

98
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,667
Both.

99
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,168
We look forward
to your decision.

100
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,919
Of course.

101
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,921
Hopefully we'll get a chance
to work together soon,

102
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,006
Dr. Robinavitch.

103
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,094
I can't believe you're
seriously considering this.

104
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,011
Bottom line is, our current
numbers aren't good,

105
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,430
and theirs are.

106
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:45,848
Just because
their dashboard is pretty

107
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,348
doesn't mean
it's good for patients.

108
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,684
If you want to keep this ED,
improve metrics.

109
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,685
There's a lot of OFI.

110
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:53,145
Opportunities for improvement.

111
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:54,896
Well, you could have
just said that.

112
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:57,231
I need you to care about
patient-satisfaction scores.

113
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:58,983
I would love nothing more.

114
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,526
But right now the average
wait time is six hours,

115
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:01,901
and that's before
you see a doctor.

116
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,361
You need to hire more staff

117
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:05,113
so we can open
more inpatient beds.

118
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,989
Are you prepared to do that?

119
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,158
I need you to improve scores
with the resources we have,

120
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,033
or we will explore
what ECQ has to offer.

121
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,035
This is bullshit.
You know this is bullshit.

122
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,538
And if you don't,
then we are all in trouble.

123
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,415
- Maybe you need some time off.
- Hey, we got a ladder fall.

124
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,041
A couple of minutes out.
Yeah.

125
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:24,170
[indistinct chatter,
distant telephone ringing]

126
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,212
Mint?

127
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,756
Who would have guessed
frat boys?

128
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,257
Collins.

129
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:31,759
Damn it.
I knew they were gonna crash.

130
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,218
Then why didn't you bet crash?

131
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,053
I didn't want anybody
to get hurt.

132
00:04:35,054 --> 00:04:36,721
- It's bad karma, man.
- So who won?

133
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,848
Oh, Doc Collins hit
the full parlay...

134
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,017
in our zone, crash,
and frat boys.

135
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:44,811
That's uncanny,
bordering on spooky.

136
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:47,062
And the rich just get richer.

137
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:48,856
You need to practice
more gratitude.

138
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:52,358
I'd be a lot more grateful
if my paycheck was bigger.

139
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,069
That part.

140
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,243
Any luck finding
Ginger's daughter?

141
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:06,161
She was supposed to be right
back to take her mom home.

142
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:09,039
I just tried her cell again.
Still no answer.

143
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,332
Let me try the cafeteria
one more time.

144
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,708
What do we tell her?

145
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,251
No, don't tell her anything yet.

146
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:15,585
Oh, boy.

147
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:17,420
Um, you should consult
with Kiara

148
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:19,298
just in case this goes south.

149
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:24,384
[distant siren wailing]

150
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,220
- What do we have?
- 45-year-old Silas Dunn.

151
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,596
Fell off an 8-foot ladder.

152
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,555
Right chest hit
the carpeted floor.

153
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,599
No LOC. Good vitals.
No meds, no allergies.

154
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,934
I'm Dr. Santos.
How are you doing?

155
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,393
Fine.
My wife called 911.

156
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:39,772
These guys said this was all
necessary, but I-I can walk.

157
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,564
We're gonna keep it on until
we get you all checked out, OK?

158
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:43,358
What are you thinking?

159
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,567
What made him fall could have
been cardiac or neuro.

160
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:47,528
- Any headache?
- I was a little dizzy.

161
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:49,112
He needs a head CT.
EKG and troponin.

162
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:50,446
- Exactly.
- On my count.

163
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:53,449
- One, two, three.
- [groans]

164
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,408
I was installing
a lighting fixture...

165
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,577
Dr. Santos on E-fast, please.

166
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:59,412
I'm Dr. Garcia.
Can you spell "world"?

167
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,789
W-O-R-L-D.

168
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,290
Start with D,
spell it backwards.

169
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,125
Oof. D-L-R-O-W?

170
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:07,585
Excellent.
Your brain is fine.

171
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:10,212
Pulse 92.
BP 132 over 78.

172
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:12,756
- Sat 98.
- No pericardial effusion.

173
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:14,632
- Ow.
- Oh. Tender?

174
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,717
- Yeah.
- OK, ribs 7 and 8, MCL.

175
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,386
You probably cracked
a rib or two.

176
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,970
Check for lung sliding.
That could be a pneumo.

177
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,638
Ah, I was gonna paint
the living room next.

178
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,848
My wife has
a whole list of things

179
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,266
she wants us to get done.

180
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,975
I'm afraid
the only home renovations

181
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,184
you're gonna be doing
in the next couple weeks

182
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,644
are the kind you watch on TV.

183
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:29,811
Can you tell my wife that?
[chuckles]

184
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:30,979
Lungs are up.

185
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,814
What's your sign?

186
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:35,023
- Scorpio.
- Spicy.

187
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,984
And I'm focused on our patient.

188
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:39,485
- Um, belly's clear.
- [phone rings]

189
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:41,988
Dr. Garcia.

190
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,281
Shit. Be right there.

191
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,656
Wish I could stay.

192
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,116
Post-op hemorrhage.

193
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:48,577
You're in good hands.

194
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:51,829
<i>Tier One Trauma, ETA now.
Trauma Tier One...</i>

195
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,163
OK, call me if anything changes.

196
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,457
Stolen ambulance versus tree.

197
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,877
PPD maintaining custody
of suspects.

198
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,544
This one doesn't meet criteria.

199
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,338
Zac Dawson, 21, restrained
front-seat passenger,

200
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,006
was ambulatory on scene.

201
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,133
Lacerations to the anterior
thigh from broken glass.

202
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:08,967
Otherwise no injuries.
Good vitals.

203
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:11,970
- You hurting anywhere, Zac?
- Where's Miles?

204
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:15,014
Miles Hernandez, 18,
unrestrained driver

205
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,432
of the stolen ambulance.

206
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,142
Right chest, left leg injuries.

207
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:19,601
Short of breath.
Sat 91.

208
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:21,853
Tachy 120s.
BP 105 over 70.

209
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,687
- Can I go with him?
- Is this your friend?

210
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:25,022
He's my pledge.

211
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:26,690
We're gonna find a room for you.

212
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:28,191
- Let us take care of Miles, OK?
- I'm Dr. Collins.

213
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:29,817
- Can you talk?
- [wheezes]

214
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:31,360
Breath sounds bilateral
but lots of stridors.

215
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,237
Set up for intubation.
We got to fix this fast.

216
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:35,530
Posterior hip dislocation.
Good pedal pulse.

217
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,365
We need induction meds,
ketamine and rock.

218
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,158
Ho, ho, ho,
look at this clavicle.

219
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,368
Depressed centrally.
Sternoclavicular dislocation.

220
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,037
It's compressing his trachea.

221
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,039
Let's reduce it, see
if it helps his breathing.

222
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,790
All right, stabilize the leg.

223
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,042
One, two, three.

224
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,335
Four of morphine.

225
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,045
Draw a rainbow, type and screen.

226
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,629
- [rapid beeping]
- Heart rate's 125.

227
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,881
Langdon, get on the airway.
Collins, E-fast.

228
00:07:56,882 --> 00:07:58,340
No blood in the oropharynx.

229
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,383
Clavicle is
dislocated posteriorly.

230
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,010
Chlorhexidine swab.

231
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:05,679
10 of lido with epi.
Time is of the essence.

232
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,431
BP's 108 over 74.

233
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:10,391
All right, Miles,
your collarbone

234
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:11,559
is pushing against
your windpipe.

235
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,977
We're gonna pull it back up.

236
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,478
I'm going to inject
an anesthetic.

237
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,648
You're gonna feel
a pinprick and a big burn.

238
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,899
[groaning]

239
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,401
All right, towel clip.

240
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,735
All right, go deep.

241
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,737
You want to get
a really good grip

242
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,448
on both sides of that bone.

243
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,366
[groans]

244
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,076
Got it.
All right, Miles.

245
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,535
It's gonna hurt for a second.
You ready?

246
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:35,787
[groaning]

247
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:38,080
[cracking, pops]

248
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,623
Oh, motherfucker!

249
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,541
- Ooh.
- Screaming is good.

250
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,584
Who are you torturing now?

251
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:45,378
Reduced a sternoclavicular
dislocation.

252
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,921
- How's your breathing?
- Better.

253
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:48,588
What happened to your
post-op hemorrhage?

254
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:49,923
Panicky intern.

255
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:51,591
False alarm.

256
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,592
- Who is she?
- Right?

257
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:56,095
This is Dr. Garcia. We're gonna
get your leg straightened out.

258
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:57,429
After we do a CT.

259
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,930
OK, looks like
you got it from here.

260
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:01,766
You know
you guys were on the news?

261
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,101
You stole an ambulance.
What were you thinking?

262
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:05,602
It wasn't my idea.

263
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:07,561
Does he look like
a meth head to you?

264
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:11,232
Seriously,
what is wrong with you?

265
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,526
This was a terrible idea.

266
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,904
OK, Chanel, all set.

267
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:20,447
How bad does it look?

268
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,699
I'm gonna be honest with you.

269
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
- It doesn't look great.
- [sighs]

270
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,284
Thankfully,
there's no signs of infection.

271
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:27,244
I'm such an idiot.

272
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:30,122
And now I'm having
a panic attack.

273
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,164
Excuse me, Dr. Mohan...

274
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:33,834
I'll be right back.

275
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,463
I've only been in with her
for a few minutes.

276
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,172
I didn't say anything.
What's the case?

277
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,674
Chanel Sutton, 22,

278
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:45,926
complications from silicone
butt injections.

279
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:47,593
So call the clinic that did it.

280
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:49,137
She found the guy on TikTok.

281
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,431
He did the injections
in his living room.

282
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:53,849
She thinks it was maybe
silicone caulk from Home Depot.

283
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,475
Jesus.

284
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:56,851
Really?

285
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,310
Kids today.

286
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,104
She is tachycardic
and tachypneic.

287
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,564
I think it's a panic attack.

288
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,106
But if a piece of silicone
hit a vein,

289
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,441
she could have
a pulmonary embolism.

290
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,984
- We should scan her.
- Good.

291
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,609
How's Joyce,
our sickle cell patient doing?

292
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,153
Holding up.

293
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:10,821
She's intubated
and waiting on an ICU bed.

294
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,822
Good. Keep it up.

295
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,449
Will do.

296
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,617
<i>Team rounds. CWA.
Team rounds. CWA.</i>

297
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,453
Come join us
when you're finished.

298
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:21,621
As soon as I put in
a few orders.

299
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,624
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, how's she doing?

300
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,293
Better. Faster.
Still need ten more of her.

301
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,502
Never thought I'd see the day

302
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,754
where you'd wish
for more Samiras.

303
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,337
You can blame Gloria for that.

304
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:34,006
If I don't get
patient satisfaction scores up

305
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,549
around here, they're bringing in

306
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,341
an outside management company
to run things.

307
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:40,011
- Mother of God. Really?
- Yep.

308
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,304
Holy hell.

309
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:42,971
Any word back on Nick Bradley's

310
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:45,015
- cerebral perfusion test?
- Still waiting on results.

311
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:46,724
What about ipecac mom,
Theresa Saunders?

312
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,809
On fluids.
Should be good to go soon.

313
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,271
See, we do have patients
that appreciate you.

314
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,816
You're done with triage
for the day.

315
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,069
I'm sorry.
Did I do something wrong?

316
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,236
Because I know I said too much
to the unhoused mom.

317
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:03,988
No, don't...
don't worry about it.

318
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:05,364
It's cool.

319
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,656
One of us just covers
the waiting room

320
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:08,200
and triage
for the first few hours,

321
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,868
try to thin the herd out there.

322
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,994
We're back here
for the rest of the shift now.

323
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,662
OK, great.

324
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,955
Hey, do you think
they're gonna give us lunch?

325
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,874
It's past 12:00,
and I'm starving.

326
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,502
Oh, you can pack a bunch
of these for your next shift

327
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:22,669
or grab a sandwich
from the patient bin.

328
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,713
There's no time for breaks
around here.

329
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,464
Thanks.

330
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:28,382
Wardrobe change?

331
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,801
Oh, I caught a gusher.

332
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:32,636
Helped save his life.

333
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:35,263
- How's triage?
- It was good.

334
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:37,223
I-I'm back with you guys now.

335
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,725
Cool.
So you're feeling OK?

336
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:42,393
Yeah, I'm feeling fine.
I slipped hours ago.

337
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:44,062
I'm great.

338
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:45,438
Ready to go.

339
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,897
Let me guess.

340
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:49,191
You got these ones
from the lost and found.

341
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:51,234
The scrub dispenser
was out of my size.

342
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,736
Well, it's a good look,
Huckleberry.

343
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:56,196
Show off those ankles.

344
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:57,739
Aren't board rounds at 2:00?

345
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,741
These aren't board rounds.

346
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:03,702
I just want to remind you all
of a few things, OK?

347
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:06,371
So we do a great job coming up
with the right diagnosis

348
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,248
and treatment plan
for our patients,

349
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:11,667
but there are still some...
opportunities for improvement.

350
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,919
- Not this bullshit again.
- First off...

351
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,045
always sit down at the bedside
of a stable patient.

352
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,588
It will make you
a better doctor.

353
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,423
Second, if there's
a discharge to be done,

354
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:23,844
do it before you pick up
a new patient.

355
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,094
The patients are very aware
of the time

356
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:26,887
that they spend with us,
so please

357
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:28,597
don't keep them here any longer
than they need to be.

358
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:30,098
They complain about the wait.

359
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,100
I get it, but for
the sake of efficiency

360
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,519
and running smoothly on our end
and opening up beds

361
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,270
and opening up rooms,
let's discharge

362
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:38,313
before we start
with somebody new, OK?

363
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:40,898
Thank you. Lastly,
in your medical records,

364
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,109
make sure that your
decision-making and your notes

365
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,402
reflect not just the diagnosis
but all the thought

366
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:47,445
that you put into ruling out
all the critical illnesses

367
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:49,156
- in the differential.
- More work?

368
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:50,656
I do enough charting as it is.

369
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:52,408
The hospital won't admit this,

370
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:55,076
but it's less about charting
and more about profit.

371
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:56,828
OK? Good.

372
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,830
That's it. Goodbye.

373
00:12:58,831 --> 00:12:59,913
Go.

374
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,499
[indistinct chatter]

375
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,168
Are our pregnant teen
and mom still talking?

376
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,459
Yeah.

377
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,170
No more yelling from that room?

378
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:09,088
- Not that I've heard.
- Good, maybe it's working.

379
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,547
Either that,
or they killed each other.

380
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:11,923
I'm good with either one
at this point.

381
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,383
And you wonder why your patient

382
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:15,050
satisfaction scores are
in the toilet.

383
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:17,887
[chuckles]
Always appreciate your support.

384
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,138
I need to check
on my Nepali patient.

385
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,390
She likes me.

386
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,309
Everybody likes you
when they're on morphine.

387
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,645
All right, I think we'll
follow up with Gillian Dupree,

388
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:31,314
the four-year-old we saw
in triage with the fever.

389
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,982
- OK.
- Yeah.

390
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:35,317
Dr. Javadi.

391
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:38,111
Um, sorry.
What... what are you doing here?

392
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:40,279
Oh, I'm down to see a consult...

393
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,865
young man with a hot appy.

394
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:45,366
- Are you a med student?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

395
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,035
This is a great case
for the students.

396
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,661
Can they come with?

397
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,621
I'd be happy to do
a little bedside teaching.

398
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,289
- Oh, we have a four-year-old...
- Oh, yeah, I would love that.

399
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,498
Do you mind if I join?

400
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,041
Maybe I can learn something new.

401
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,334
- Sure.
- Great.

402
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,002
I just...
I don't need anyone else

403
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,669
associating me with my mom.

404
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,672
I know, but I just can't
say no to a hot appy.

405
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:05,299
These are student doctors.

406
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,384
- Mind if I do a little teaching?
- Go for it.

407
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:10,011
Now, everyone knows
McBurney's point.

408
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:13,097
But who can tell me
the name of this sign?

409
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:16,850
Tim, raise your right leg, please.

410
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:19,018
- Oh!
- Psoas sign.

411
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,020
Causing friction
of the psoas muscle

412
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,688
over the inflamed appendix.

413
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:24,189
Excellent.

414
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,024
Now, back in the day,
appendicitis meant

415
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:28,193
you went straight to the OR.

416
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:31,487
Who can tell me
about the CODA study?

417
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:34,364
Uh, well, it's from a 2020
"New England Journal" trial

418
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:37,367
comparing surgery
to antibiotics, you know?

419
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:39,201
It, um... it showed that
without an appendicolith,

420
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:43,372
there was a 75% success rate
in the antibiotic-only group.

421
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:44,997
Exactly.

422
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:48,541
Honey, we discussed
the study at home, right?

423
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,877
"Honey"?

424
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:53,379
Wait. She's your mom?

425
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,673
It's... it's Victoria...

426
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,968
or Javadi, Dr. Shamsi.

427
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,012
Uh, hello?

428
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:04,554
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

429
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,931
Mrs. Grant now has chest pain.

430
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:07,432
If you'll excuse us.

431
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,477
Oh, yeah, go.
Patients come first.

432
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:15,313
- Who's Mrs. Grant?
- Nobody. I made her up.

433
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,856
[laughing]
Sorry.

434
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,816
You just had
that look on your face

435
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,068
my son gives me
when I give his basketball team

436
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,820
pointers from the sideline.

437
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,738
I'm sorry.

438
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,740
[laughs]

439
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:29,366
- [elevator bell dings]
- No, I think renovations

440
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,993
should be treated
like dental care.

441
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:32,868
- Leave it to the professionals.
- [chuckles]

442
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:36,080
They're the only ones that
should be climbing on ladders.

443
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,707
Um, is my family here yet?

444
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,749
I'm not sure. We'll check.
How was the CT?

445
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,501
Head and neck normal,
but tech found

446
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:43,419
a small hemothorax on the right.

447
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,878
- What's that?
- It's a little bleeding

448
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,213
around the lung
where you broke a rib.

449
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:47,755
He's also been
more short of breath

450
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:50,591
- since after the scan.
- Is that from the pain?

451
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:52,135
Silas?

452
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:54,094
Hey, Silas, wake up.

453
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,595
Lost the radial pulse.

454
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:57,431
Thready carotid.
His BP'S crashing.

455
00:15:57,432 --> 00:16:00,599
I think he might need
a chest tube.

456
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,059
Check another hemocue.

457
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,768
Get type specific
from the blood bank.

458
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,103
[rapid beeping]

459
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:06,563
BP 72 over 44.

460
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,771
Pulse ox 89.

461
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:09,732
He just dropped his BP and sats.

462
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,233
Put him on 100% nonrebreather.

463
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:13,401
- Call for two units.
- Already done.

464
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:16,112
Normal head CT.
Small hemothorax on the right.

465
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,447
Which has now turned into
a huge collection of blood.

466
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:19,906
Prep for a chest tube.
20 French.

467
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:21,283
I would love to do
the chest tube.

468
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,908
You got it.
I'll guide you.

469
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,910
Sats are low.
Should we intubate?

470
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:26,454
Not until after
the chest tube's in.

471
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,204
We wouldn't want to cause
a tension pneumo.

472
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,082
She won't make
that mistake again.

473
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,963
Ten blade to Dr. Santos.

474
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:41,549
There's a lot of breast tissue.

475
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,717
Focus on the chest tube.

476
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:45,927
[clears throat]
Fifth intercostal space,

477
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:48,512
- anterior axillary line.
- Perfect.

478
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:51,973
[beeping continues]

479
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:54,476
Long Kelly next.

480
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:55,810
[scalpel clatters]

481
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:58,187
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God. Are you OK?

482
00:16:58,188 --> 00:16:59,480
Oh, that's got to hurt.

483
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,190
- Leave it!
- OK, but...

484
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,649
- OK, I'm stepping in.
- No, you're not gloved.

485
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,817
I got this.

486
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:06,903
- I-I...
- On my own.

487
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:10,698
[grunts]

488
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,158
Glove up.
You're sewing this in.

489
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,244
[steady beeping]

490
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,331
- We're good. No need to hover.
- OK.

491
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,500
I'll be next door
if you need me.

492
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,918
- [groans]
- [sighs]

493
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,961
- Sats and BP look perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:31,671
- We ready to go in here?
- We're getting there.

495
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,423
- You good?
- Absolutely.

496
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:35,467
You start feeling
lightheaded, just speak up, OK?

497
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:37,176
Yeah.

498
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,678
OK, you're gonna pretend
you're a pirate

499
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,846
with your foot on a keg of rum.

500
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,681
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

501
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,517
This is the Captain Morgan
technique for hip reduction.

502
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:47,351
- Who's Captain Morgan?
- [chuckles]

503
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:48,977
The guy on the rum bottle?

504
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:51,396
[bed whirring]

505
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:53,189
I'll stabilize the pelvis.

506
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,525
OK, you're gonna step up here.

507
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:58,026
Actually, let me just... sorry.

508
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:02,029
Yeah, and you are gonna put
your right leg behind his knee.

509
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,407
- Like this?
- Yeah.

510
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:07,200
And you are gonna use
your leg as a hinge

511
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,410
to put anterior force
on his femur.

512
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:10,078
Physics.

513
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,745
Push down on the lower leg
with your left hand.

514
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:13,664
You got this.
Put your back into it.

515
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:16,207
The hip is a big joint with
lots of muscle stabilizing it.

516
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,378
OK.

517
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,629
[crack]

518
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,880
- Whoa!
- Oh, shit.

519
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,507
I mean, shoot.

520
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:27,716
And that is what
a hip reduction feels like.

521
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:28,801
Nicely done.

522
00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:31,636
Thank you.

There is no blood flow here
at all.

700
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:03,747
Is that dangerous?

701
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:05,414
If it goes untreated
for more than six hours,

702
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:07,082
he could lose a testicle.

703
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,292
I could...

704
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,877
I could lose my balls?

705
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:11,753
One testicle.

706
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:13,421
And we're going to try
and prevent that.

707
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:15,255
What the hell
were you doing, Dillon?

708
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:17,090
I'm taking that lock
off your door.

709
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:18,467
It's difficult to know

710
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:20,760
what causes a torsion, unfortunately.

711
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:22,595
Dillon, hey,

712
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:25,931
it's really important
that I try and fix this now.

713
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,934
OK.

714
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,480
And I see we're gonna have
a new prescription sent to...

715
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,439
To the pharmacy.

716
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,525
And, uh, it's just one pill
every morning.

717
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:41,401
OK, up next,
nausea and vomiting in North 4.

718
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,445
Oh.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

719
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:44,862
Forearm X-rays are back

720
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:46,447
on Mr. Ofori
in the south corridor.

721
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:48,032
You can discharge
with a volar splint.

722
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,783
Notify ortho. ADF.

723
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:52,453
Always discharge first.
Got it.

724
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,290
Four-year-old with a fever.

725
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,750
Your medical decision-making
says otitis media.

726
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,460
Yeah, she had an ear infection.

727
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,254
Did you also consider
and rule out

728
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,464
meningitis, mastoiditis,
malignant otitis externa?

729
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:09,341
I did.

730
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:11,968
Then you should document
your cognitive work in the MDM.

731
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,469
You want me to pad my chart?

732
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,136
No, I want you
to show your work.

733
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:18,014
Billing is a side effect
of that.

734
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:21,767
[sighs] Did anyone listen
to what I said earlier?

735
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:24,811
Most of the time,
the torsion is to the inside,

736
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:27,647
so we rotate outward
by opening the book.

737
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,314
[yelling]

738
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,651
The testicle might have
twisted the other way.

739
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:35,278
Uh, let's go back 180

740
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,698
and then try
another 180 to the inside.

741
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,659
[groans]

742
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,994
That's good.

743
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,787
That feels good.

744
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:48,998
- I think I'm OK now.
- It's fixed?

745
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,415
For the time being.

746
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,417
We need to admit to Urology.

747
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:54,668
He'll need minor surgery
to tack it down

748
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:56,503
and prevent it
from happening again.

749
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:57,838
Thank you.

750
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,839
Dillon, say thank you.

751
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,757
- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

752
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:04,092
I'll call Urology
and see about the wait.

753
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:07,304
- Thanks.
- Thank you, too.

754
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:09,430
Any other questions
I can answer for you?

755
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,223
Yes, can you please let me know

756
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,183
how we can sign up
for you to be our doctor?

757
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,184
I specialize
in emergency medicine,

758
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:18,646
so I only work at this hospital
and not in primary care.

759
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:20,230
Damn.

760
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,190
Please let me know
when you get your own office

761
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:24,525
because you have been wonderful.

762
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:27,153
And you have a great
relationship with your son.

763
00:28:27,154 --> 00:28:31,323
[laughs]
He is my heart in human form.

764
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:32,574
Oh.

765
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:34,033
Do you have any?

766
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:37,328
Uh... [chuckles]
Not yet, but, uh...

767
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,912
hopefully soon.

768
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:40,538
Hey, I've been in triage.

769
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:42,206
What's the update
on incel kid's mom?

770
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:44,541
Please don't refer
to her that way.

771
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,043
Theresa is rehydrated,

772
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:47,711
and her electrolytes
have been replaced.

773
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:49,670
I'm gonna let her know
that she can be discharged.

774
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:51,505
Did she hear from her son
who ran off?

775
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:53,882
- I have no idea.
- [scoffs]

776
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,884
I'm ready to get
law enforcement involved

777
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:58,053
- whenever you are.
- [sighs]

778
00:28:58,054 --> 00:29:00,346
If he's not here, he could
be out there hurting somebody.

779
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,473
I'm not ready to ruin a kid's
life over a thought crime.

780
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,349
We just need to make sure
that he's not...

781
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,185
OK. OK. OK, I get it.

782
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:09,227
I heard you loud and clear when
you brought this up before.

783
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:10,729
I will speak to Theresa.

784
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,230
I will see if she's talked
to her son.

785
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:13,397
Fine.

786
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,441
We should admit her.

787
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,026
She's recovered.

788
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:19,194
She's good physically,
but she made herself sick

789
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:20,445
to get her son here.

790
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:21,780
She's clearly not coping,

791
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:24,032
and she needs professional help.

792
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:31,621
Neurocysticercosis,
a parasite in your brain.

793
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:34,748
I thought I just had
a migraine, but I have...

794
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,291
bugs in my head?

795
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,709
Well, not exactly.

796
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,753
You had larva
from a pork tapeworm

797
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:43,588
that made multiple cysts,
but they're all dead now.

798
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:45,215
A worm?

799
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,925
In my fucking head?
Are you kidding me?

800
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:48,926
No, no, you don't have
a worm in your head.

801
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:50,511
You just said that I have...

802
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:52,595
I said you had a worm
in your head,

803
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:54,097
but it's dead and long gone.

804
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:56,265
What we're seeing
on the CT is scarring

805
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:58,850
around those dead cysts.

806
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:01,229
- Like dead worm eggs?
- Larvae.

807
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:06,774
[groans]

808
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:09,025
Is my brain like Swiss cheese?
Am I dying?

809
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:12,028
- No, no, you're not dying.
- Joseph, you're gonna be OK.

810
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:15,030
The... the cysts are tiny,
and they're calcified over.

811
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:17,116
There'll be no further damage.

812
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:19,909
- [sighs] Can you fix it?
- Unfortunately, no.

813
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,494
The... the little calcified spots
will stay there.

814
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:25,288
So there's gonna be a worm
graveyard in my brain forever?

815
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,124
Yeah, but they're
resting in peace.

816
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,168
[knock on door]

817
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,962
Hi, Theresa.
Any word from David?

818
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,463
Not yet.

819
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:37,297
It's still important
that we talk to him,

820
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:38,799
so keep trying.

821
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,593
In the meantime,
you are cleared to go home.

822
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,095
But I had a thought.

823
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:46,930
I'm concerned
that you took so much ipecac.

824
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,807
I don't want you
to do that again.

825
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:50,643
Oh, I won't.

826
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,897
How have things been
at home lately?

827
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,275
Different.

828
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,697
One of us is always sad
since my husband died.

829
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:08,614
Would you be willing to speak

830
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:10,825
to a behavioral health
specialist?

831
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,535
I don't need that.

832
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:16,246
Did you talk to anybody
after your husband passed?

833
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:19,540
Friends, family.

834
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:20,875
Anybody professionally?

835
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:24,545
Therapist, clergy,
social worker?

836
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,506
Devastating personal loss
can be very hard

837
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:31,841
to manage on your own.

838
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:33,719
It's OK to need help.

839
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,181
It might even improve
your communication with David.

840
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,685
- OK.
- Great.

841
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:47,812
I phoned in a favor
with behavioral health.

842
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:50,940
They can get you in to see
a psychologist at 1:30.

843
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:52,608
Today?

844
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,569
Mm-hmm, in an hour.

845
00:31:57,362 --> 00:32:00,157
- O-OK.
- Great.

846
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,993
Oh, hey. I was just coming
to check on you two.

847
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:08,704
- Are... are you leaving?
- Yes, we're going home.

848
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:10,997
Were you able to come
to a decision?

849
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:13,833
Kristi is gonna stay
in school until she's due.

850
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:15,794
Is that what you want?

851
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:18,880
[retching]

852
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:23,049
Morning sickness.

853
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,842
- I hate this.
- [lid thuds closed]

854
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,344
OK.

855
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,012
Let me get you
some anti-nausea medicine.

856
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,555
It'll help you feel better.

857
00:32:30,556 --> 00:32:34,016
And you've got a long drive
ahead of you.

858
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:35,559
OK, fine.

859
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,062
I never did meds, but sure.

860
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,771
Dr. Santos?

861
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,564
Susan and Alana Dunn...

862
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:45,234
here for an update on
Silas Dunn, your ladder fall.

863
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:46,400
- Thanks, Mateo.
- Yeah.

864
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:47,944
Is it serious?

865
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,946
He broke a few ribs
on his right side

866
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:52,823
from the fall, which caused
some bleeding around the lungs.

867
00:32:52,824 --> 00:32:55,075
So he has a drainage catheter
in his chest.

868
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:56,742
And with the trauma,

869
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:58,536
his oxygen levels
were really low,

870
00:32:58,537 --> 00:33:00,912
so he needed a breathing tube
in his windpipe.

871
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:02,539
Good Lord.

872
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,332
Could he die?

873
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,917
His condition is serious,
but it's... it's stable now.

874
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,836
Would you like to go see him?

875
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:10,711
He won't be able to talk with
the breathing tube in, but...

876
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,046
Yeah. Where is he?

877
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:13,548
No, we'll wait
in the waiting room.

878
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:15,423
- But, Mom...
- Alana, please.

879
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:19,094
Just let the doctors do what
they need to do for your dad.

880
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:21,178
We will find you
with any updates.

881
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,264
Thanks.

882
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:33,397
Doing OK, kid?

883
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:35,648
Oh, yeah, I was just
checking something.

884
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,441
I should get back to work.

885
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:39,943
Anything I can do to help,
I'm available.

886
00:33:39,944 --> 00:33:41,236
Thank you.

887
00:33:41,237 --> 00:33:43,238
It's just that I have, um...

888
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,573
I have a dependent patient

889
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:48,117
whose daughter
might have ditched her.

890
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:50,577
You don't always get to see
the best side of people.

891
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:52,620
I guess it just
kind of makes me sad.

892
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,372
It is sad.

893
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:57,457
But you can't dwell on it.
That'll tear you apart.

894
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,459
Look, you've taken
some time to step away.

895
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,918
That's good.

896
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,129
Don't forget,
your patient needs you.

897
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,422
- She still here?
- Yes. I've...

898
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,799
Mm, I've kind of
been avoiding her.

899
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,135
I don't really know what
to tell her about her daughter.

900
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,970
Well, you don't have
to have all the answers.

901
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:15,681
Sometimes just asking
how someone's doing is enough.

902
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,143
You got this.

903
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,604
Come on.

904
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,985
Will Miles be able
to walk again?

905
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,905
Yes, he will recover.

906
00:34:36,823 --> 00:34:38,490
None of this
was supposed to happen.

907
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:40,200
You want to share
how it was supposed to go?

908
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,118
'Cause you stole an ambulance.

909
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,953
- [clears throat]
- He did.

910
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,622
That was dumb.

911
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:49,291
Haven't you ever
done anything stupid?

912
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:53,336
No, not really.

913
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:57,172
We were gonna drive it
and bring it back to campus.

914
00:34:57,173 --> 00:35:00,758
I wanted the guys to see Miles,
think he was cool.

915
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:04,344
He has a hard time.
He doesn't really fit in.

916
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:06,346
That's actually kind of sweet.

917
00:35:06,347 --> 00:35:08,348
Some cops started chasing us.

918
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:11,099
Miles freaked out.

919
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,101
I'm pretty sure
you saw the rest.

920
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:16,020
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

921
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:18,273
Now we're going to jail.

922
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,275
My mom's gonna kill me.

923
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:24,818
Emma, no offense,
but I can't exactly say

924
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:26,445
I'm happy to see you.

925
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:28,239
It comes with the territory.

926
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,198
Is there anything more you can
tell me about the parents?

927
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,075
Lily and John Bradley.

928
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:35,035
Middle class,
college educated, Catholic.

929
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:37,579
- How's their demeanor?
- About what you'd expect.

930
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,206
Nick was their only child.

931
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,041
Got it.

932
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,251
I'm ready.

933
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:44,417
You?

934
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:46,378
[inhales deeply]

935
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:47,755
Never.

936
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:51,006
John, Lily,

937
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,008
uh, I want to introduce you
to Emma Isaacs.

938
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:54,759
She's a family support
specialist

939
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,887
that works with me and families
in the emergency room.

940
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,055
She's here to answer
any questions that you have

941
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:02,391
and to keep you informed.

942
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:04,308
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Bradley.

943
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,060
Oh, uh, John and Lily, please.

944
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:07,728
OK. I'll let you talk.

945
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:10,063
Doctor, can you stay?

946
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:12,482
Please.

947
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:14,149
Sure.

948
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,402
I'm happy to be here.

949
00:36:16,403 --> 00:36:20,071
Emma is really
the expert, though.

950
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:23,740
I understand your son is
in here and not doing well.

951
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,867
Can you tell me
what Dr. Robby has told you

952
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:28,787
about Nick's
unfortunate situation?

953
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,957
There's no blood
going to Nick's brain.

954
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,918
He's... he's brain-dead.

955
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:39,086
So...

956
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:41,755
he's dead.

957
00:36:41,756 --> 00:36:43,756
I'm so sorry for your loss.

958
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:46,010
He was a wonderful son.

959
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:50,470
- He was the quietest baby.
- [laughs]

960
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:52,722
He slept... slept
through the night.

961
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,265
It was perfect.

962
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:57,934
Um, if any one of his friends
had a problem,

963
00:36:57,935 --> 00:37:01,438
he was there to listen, to...

964
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,105
to lend a helping hand.

965
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:04,732
He...

966
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,193
he would have been a great man.

967
00:37:09,153 --> 00:37:12,779
Oh, I can't believe
this is happening.

968
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,407
I know how difficult
this must be for you.

969
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:17,533
Can you tell us
what happens now?

970
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:19,076
Yes.

971
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:22,079
I can walk you
through all the next steps.

972
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,915
[indistinct chatter]

973
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,708
How are you...

974
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:31,712
If you ask me how I'm doing,
I swear I'll punch you.

975
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:33,504
Did I miss something?

976
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:36,674
I just didn't get
to do my chest tube.

977
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,009
He did.

978
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,762
There's a little more to it
than that...

979
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:43,179
Not another word,

980
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,515
unless you want
your tongue stapled.

981
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:47,515
All right, fuck it.

982
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,100
I dropped a scalpel,

983
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,478
and it stuck into Garcia's foot.

984
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,187
Oh, that's bad.

985
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,022
It might actually be worse
than fainting, so...

986
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,690
Well, at least
I didn't kill anyone.

987
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,816
- Day's only half over.
- You killed a patient?

988
00:37:58,817 --> 00:37:59,984
Not really.

989
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:01,319
You kind of did.

990
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,653
I'm sorry. You did.

991
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:05,655
It... it wasn't fully
Huckleberry's fault.

992
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:07,239
It was a fluke.

993
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,325
He caught some gomer
with a sneaky bad ticker.

994
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,160
His name was Bennet.

995
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:13,828
Oh, great, you can get his
name tattooed on your chest.

996
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:15,914
At least I'm not
the only fuck-up here.

997
00:38:15,915 --> 00:38:17,790
I got nosebleed.

998
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,001
So long, fellow losers.

999
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,837
[both chuckle softly]

1000
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,838
I'll reach out
to a funeral director

1001
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,175
and get the paperwork started
on arrangements.

1002
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:34,054
- What's the name of your church?
- Um, St. Mary's.

1003
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:38,515
- Great. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1004
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,017
Do you have any other questions?

1005
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,811
Uh...

1006
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:45,813
[softly] No.

1007
00:38:45,814 --> 00:38:48,022
I think we should talk
about something else

1008
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:49,357
that is very important.

1009
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:51,858
Your son's driver's license
indicated

1010
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,070
that he wanted to be an organ
and tissue donor upon death.

1011
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,405
That means he's given
his permission for that...

1012
00:38:57,406 --> 00:38:59,532
No, no, I...

1013
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:01,366
I don't want to talk about that.

1014
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:05,578
No, he was too young
to make that kind of decision.

1015
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,996
I can understand
why you would think that,

1016
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:09,373
but he was 18.

1017
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:11,374
No!

1018
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,710
You didn't know him!

1019
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:17,880
He is still my son!

1020
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:22,508
[door closes]

1021
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:24,386
Sorry.

1022
00:39:31,808 --> 00:39:34,226
They need more time.

1023
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:36,185
<i>850 bucks.</i>

1024
00:39:36,186 --> 00:39:38,396
I'll Zelle you the rest.

1025
00:39:38,397 --> 00:39:40,856
PayPal is also fine.

1026
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:43,108
Winning.
It never gets old.

1027
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:45,776
Hey, I'm serious about
that vacation for your wife.

1028
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:47,403
- What about me?
- What about you?

1029
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,029
Your wife has
two kids under four.

1030
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,864
Abby works her ass off
every day.

1031
00:39:50,865 --> 00:39:52,407
I'm a doctor.

1032
00:39:52,408 --> 00:39:53,867
[mimics explosion]

1033
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,409
They're all clueless.

1034
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,244
What, is this...
is this a female thing?

1035
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:58,745
You should go, now. Go.

1036
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,580
Beat it. Go ahead, go.

1037
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:03,082
So what are you gonna buy
with all that hard-earned cash?

1038
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:06,126
I have had this
bookmarked for months.

1039
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:08,420
Oh, James Bond makes
strollers now.

1040
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:11,505
Convertible is the way to go.

1041
00:40:11,506 --> 00:40:13,257
- Ah, I'm gonna buy it.
- You should.

1042
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:15,675
You and baby
absolutely deserve it.

1043
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:17,218
[chuckles]

1044
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:19,512
Yeah, we do, right?

1045
00:40:19,513 --> 00:40:22,431
Yeah, it's good to be excited.

1046
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,600
Just ran into a totally lost
Uber Eats driver.

1047
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:28,519
- Where do I put these?
- I got this. Thank you.

1048
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,770
[steady beeping]

1049
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:32,397
Poor guy.

1050
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:34,899
Not everyone's cut out
for the home-reno life.

1051
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,152
[chuckles]

1052
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,370
Um, I'll... I'll be right back.

1053
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,458
- Dr. Robby?
- What's up?

1054
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:59,336
Silas's chest tube output
has slowed down after 650 CCs.

1055
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:01,295
- Good.
- But on re-exam,

1056
00:41:01,296 --> 00:41:03,255
I noticed
some breast enlargement,

1057
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:06,090
bilateral and symmetrical
with no palpable masses.

1058
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,926
What's in
the differential diagnosis

1059
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:09,344
for male gynecomastia?

1060
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:11,094
Definitely alcoholism.

1061
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,889
But then there's pituitary
and gonadal tumors

1062
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,056
or pathology.

1063
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,474
So what do you want to check?

1064
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:19,268
LFTs for alcohol abuse,
and for the rest,

1065
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,228
hormonal levels...
estrogen, testosterone,

1066
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,605
Prolactin, hCG, progesterone.

1067
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,064
Good. Go.

1068
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,650
[exhales sharply]

1069
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,734
Ugh!

1070
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:33,571
Oh, the things I would do
for pastrami.

1071
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:35,489
- Is there a turkey and cheese?
- Uh, yeah.

1072
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,325
- Oh, what is all this?
- Lunch. Primanti's.

1073
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:40,618
It appears that we have
at least one grateful patient.

1074
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:41,994
Hope is alive.

1075
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:43,663
- Who do we have to thank?
- I don't know.

1076
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:45,581
I think there's a card...
bottom of the bag.

1077
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:51,502
Mmm. My God, that's so good.

1078
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:53,046
Enjoy your lunch.

1079
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,340
What was that?

1080
00:41:57,341 --> 00:41:59,883
I don't know.

1081
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,802
- Aww.
- What?

1082
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:04,554
It's from Shelby Adamson,
Dr. Adamson's sister.

1083
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,556
She sends something every year.

1084
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,516
- He doesn't like her?
- It's not about her.

1085
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:09,975
It's about him.

1086
00:42:09,976 --> 00:42:13,311
Dr. Adamson was Robby's mentor,
and he...

1087
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:16,022
he died during COVID, so...

1088
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:21,693
Mr. Randolph in Central 10
can be moved to a chair.

1089
00:42:21,694 --> 00:42:23,111
Done.

1090
00:42:23,112 --> 00:42:24,653
[phone chimes]
Hey, if you're hungry,

1091
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:26,613
there's Primanti's
in the staff lounge.

1092
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:28,031
Sorry.

1093
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:29,532
Uh, daily reminder
to call my sister.

1094
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:30,866
You were saying?

1095
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:32,326
There's free lunch
in the lounge.

1096
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:34,119
Do you need
to take care of that?

1097
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,705
I do. I just, um... I want
to check on a patient first,

1098
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:38,706
but thank you...

1099
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:41,501
- Jesse. Jesse.
- Yeah.

1100
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,047
Hello, Mrs. Kitajima.
How are you feeling?

1101
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:50,007
Ginger, please.

1102
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:51,758
I'm getting tired.

1103
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,718
I want to go home.

1104
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:56,178
Where's my daughter?

1105
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,847
Um, I'm sorry, but I don't know.

1106
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:01,391
But we're doing
everything we can to find her.

1107
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:03,392
Can I do something for you
while we wait?

1108
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:05,894
I wouldn't mind a snack.

1109
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:08,022
I can have someone
bring you a sandwich.

1110
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:09,731
- Wonderful.
- [phone chimes]

1111
00:43:09,732 --> 00:43:12,859
Feel free to bring that
Dr. Robby back around, too.

1112
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,819
OK, yeah, I just...
I have to make a quick call.

1113
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,821
Um, can you get Mrs. Kitajima
a sandwich from the bin?

1114
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:20,906
Yeah, you got it.

1115
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:22,907
[door whirring]

1116
00:43:22,908 --> 00:43:25,827
[exhales sharply]

1117
00:43:25,828 --> 00:43:28,913
[line trilling]

1118
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:31,749
[phone chimes]

1119
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,166
Hi, Becca.

1120
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:35,418
- <i>Mel!</i>
- [both laugh]

1121
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:37,420
- Uh, how was lunch?
<i>- It was good.</i>

1122
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:40,339
<i>We had paninis
and watermelon salad.</i>

1123
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,882
That sounds delicious.

1124
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:43,591
<i>Are you coming to get me?</i>

1125
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:45,259
Um, yeah, remember,

1126
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,969
I'm coming, uh, to pick you up
after my shift.

1127
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,763
<i>Have you found a boyfriend yet?</i>

1128
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:51,973
- Uh, no.
<i>- Hurry up.</i>

1129
00:43:51,974 --> 00:43:53,599
<i>You have to find
somebody to kiss.</i>

1130
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,601
- You're right. I do.
- <i>Yeah. [giggles]</i>

1131
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:57,311
I got to get on that right away.

1132
00:43:57,312 --> 00:43:59,188
<i>Yeah. [laughs]</i>

1133
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,775
[doorknob rattling]

1134
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,902
[sighs]

1135
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:09,737
Hey. Is everything all right?

1136
00:44:09,738 --> 00:44:11,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1137
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,949
- Where's Kristi?
- She's using the bathroom.

1138
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:19,119
Hey, Kristi,
it's Dr. Collins here.

1139
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,080
Is everything all right
in there?

1140
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:23,873
- No, I want the pills!
- Absolutely not.

1141
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:26,751
Eloise, why don't you find
a place to sit, and I will...

1142
00:44:26,752 --> 00:44:28,126
You're gonna what,
give my daughter

1143
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:29,544
- the abortion I've forbidden?
- Hey.

1144
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:31,296
What's going on?
Kristi's texting.

1145
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:33,381
- Is she OK?
- You can't be back here.

1146
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:36,300
- She's begging us for help.
- Lynette, I got this. Come on.

1147
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:37,801
You are treating Kristi
like Mom treated you.

1148
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:39,052
Oh, fuck you!

1149
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:40,303
Hey, let's take it down a notch.

1150
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,429
This is none of your business!

1151
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,763
I am not abandoning Kristi.

1152
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,306
Just get the fuck out of here!

1153
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,100
- Fuck you.
- Hey, ladies, that's enough.

1154
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,642
- She is my daughter.
- Just step away.

1155
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,352
- Give her a chance.
- She's mine!

1156
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,605
That's enough!
