Their purpose is to find Sokka's father, Hakoda, and free him. Instead they find Suki, a Kyoshi warrior, and Sokka's girlfriend. She previously helped navigate Aang's group and some refugees through the Serpent's Pass - and actually saved Toph from drowning after Katara's ice bridge was smashed by the serpent. Dressed as Fire Nation Guards, Zuko and Sokka develop a plan to escape from the prison. Working together to a common end, they learn to trust and appreciate each other's viewpoints and judgments. Just as they are about to escape with several prisoners, they learn that Sokka's father might be among a group of prisoners arriving the next day. Sokka, Zuko and Suki abandon their own escape and stay in the prison so they can free Hakoda if the possibility arises. The escaping prisoners are caught, and Hakoda emerges from the cable car gondola as the last prisoner in the transport.\u2014richbh", "Sokka and Zuko go to the Boiling Rock, a heavily guarded Fire Nation Prison, in hopes of freeing Hakoda (Sokka and Katara's father, who was arrested after a failed invasion).
