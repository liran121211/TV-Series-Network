Only the AVATAR, the only human capable of bending all the four; Air, Water, Earth and Fire, could stop them, but when the world needed him the most, he just vanished, nobody knows why. In their Tribe, Katara and Sokka, are left in charge of the village in the absence of the adult males of their people, who left to join the Earth Kingdom against the Fire Nation two years ago. While in a fishing expedition, the Water-bending abilities of Katara accidentally reveal a humanoid form in light while she was arguing with her brother, Sokka. Then, she hits the ice freeing a boy with a white arrow painted or tattooed in his head and a flying bison. The name of the boy is Aang and his flying bison, Appa.
