Rose's involvement with Ross would seem to go beyond the professional. At the party Isobel dissuades Tom from emigrating to America with his daughter and later she proves to Violet that young Pegg was not a thief, being surprised by the dowager's open-mindedness in reinstating him. Alfred receives good news - he has been accepted at the Ritz after all and Molesley is quick to step into his role but Edith is still concerned as Michael seems to have gone missing in Germany.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "Mary and Tom propose that the estate invests in pig farming.
