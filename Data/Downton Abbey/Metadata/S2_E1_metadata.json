Sybil also feels useless and goes to York for nursing training whilst Mary hides her disappointment when Matthew, home on leave, brings his betrothed, Lavinia Swire, to meet her. She nonetheless sees him off, giving him her lucky mascot, as he returns to the fighting, Back in the trenches he meets Thomas, sick of the war, who deliberately gets himself wounded. John returns from his mother's funeral, hoping to buy off his greedy wife Vera with his inheritance and marry Anna. However, now that he has money, Vera turns up and threatens to expose Anna's part in Mary's indiscretion with the Turk Panuk unless he leaves with her immediately - which he does. Fortunately a suspicious Mrs. Hughes has overheard them and gets Carson to put Robert in the picture without exposing Mary. Unaware of this, a sorrowful Anna is comforted by Ethel, the starstruck new maid who is felt by the other staff to have ideas above her station.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "It's 1916 and the war is having an effect on everyone.

Robert Crawley is made Lord Lieutenant of the area and is disappointed that his appointment as colonel of a local regiment is an honorary post and that he will not actually be sent to France.

He returns with good news for Anna: his mother's estate was larger than anyone thought and he's now certain that he will be able to buy off his wife Vera and get a divorce.

Yet healthy William is frustrated not to be drafted and feels almost deserving the white feather handed by headless girls at a Downton hospital benefit for not volunteering at his father's request, immediately defended by Lord Lieutenant earl Robert, who feels discarded as Yeomanry 'toy soldier' commander and hopes a regimental command will mean front posting. Carson must do with dwindling staff and new maid Ethel is foolishly 'pranked' by O'Brien, even causing an incident at a grand dinner. Sibyl takes a York nursing course but Matthew arrives with his middle-class fiancee Lavinia Swire, so Mary decides against a last attempt to hook him up. Bates expects to pay off his wife Vera to divorce with his mother's inheritance, but she arrives in Downton to blackmail him to resign and leave with her, the earl only learns after his departure that was to prevent the Pamuk incident becoming public.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1821819", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 2493, "number_of_episodes": 52}
