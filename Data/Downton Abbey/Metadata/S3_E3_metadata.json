Lord Grantham can't quite bring himself to approve of the marriage but accepts it without objection. Cold feet set in and one of them is left standing at the altar. Lord Grantham has been waiting for Edith's wedding to be out of the way for him to formally announce their intention to sell Downton.

O'Brien and Thomas continue their battle of wills and Anna is still trying to find information that will exonerate her husband. Mrs. Hughes receives the news of her medical tests.\u2014garykmcd", "The earl being 'broke', he prepares the family to move to a smaller country house to be renamed Downton Place, after Sibyl's wedding at the Abbey. So everyone goes visit the country home for a picnic, leaving the staff unaware as their number would be reduced drastically. Matthew still refuses to accept Lavinia's father Reggie Swire's huge inheritance, or even to read a letter he has delivered by solicitor, but Rose does and finds proof he knew enough to chose his heir, so insists it be used to save the Abbey.

Bates is warned in time to avoid being set up by his cellmate, Anna finally gets to speak Vera's hostile friend.

Tom Branson is finally welcome visiting with pregnant Sibyl to attend the wedding, but at the altar Sir Anthony Strallan decides he can't 'condemnd her to a life as his nurse', so the staff gets to eat the lavish nuptial dinner.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2385216", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 2006, "number_of_episodes": 52}
