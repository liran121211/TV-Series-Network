Green is back in view as Lord Anthony Gillingham seizes any opportunity to see Mary again, in London and back at Downton. There he proposes but can't decide her, despite the consideration he can't keep promising engagement to alternative fiancee Lady Mabel, so they part with a one-off 'souvenir' kiss.
