Mrs Patmore, Daisy, and Andy help Mr Mason move into the farm. Thomas discovers that Andy is desperately illiterate, and kindly offers to teach him in secret, so he can study farming theory while apprenticing with Mr. Mason. The dowager decides to fire Denker for 'over-loyal' insolence to Dr. Clarkson, but the maid plays the hidden kin card to make Spratt argue for a second chance.

Robert suddenly vomits blood over the dinner table, collapses, and is rushed by ambulance to hospital as Dr. Clarkson diagnoses a burst ulcer. The earl survives surgery well, but Mary tells Tom that the two of them 'must' take over running the estate, 'sparing' her father further stress.
