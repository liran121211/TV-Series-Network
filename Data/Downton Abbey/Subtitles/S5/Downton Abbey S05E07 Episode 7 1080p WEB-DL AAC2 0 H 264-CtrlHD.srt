1
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:51,095
Gracious Mama, it's not like you to meet a train.

2
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:53,681
My dear, I'm taking you STRAIGHT to the house.

3
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:56,921
We'll go back and change and return for dinner.

4
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:59,838
Do you know what time she left yesterday? Not precisely.

5
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:02,133
The rest of us were at the point-to-point.

6
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:05,050
We heard when we got back. What are we going to say now?

7
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:09,470
I've been awake the whole night. There's only one thing we can say.

8
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:11,686
We have to tell Cora.

9
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,890
Well, isn't that rather a betrayal?

10
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,642
If anything happens to Edith and Cora learns later

11
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:19,393
we knew all along, she would never forgive us.

12
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:22,644
And I wouldn't blame her.

13
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:25,148
You see, as a mother, it is her right.

14
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,315
But you don't plan to tell Robert?

15
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,732
He is Edith's father. He's a man.

16
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,817
Men don't have rights.

17
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:38,279
They telephoned Lady Rosamund last night. She's on her way here now.

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,948
It seems very hard they should have guests staying

19
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:43,247
and more coming for dinner with this going on.

20
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:45,868
They couldn't put them off without telling them why.

21
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,911
It'll make for a funny evening.

22
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:52,496
We still don't know anything. We know she's in London.

23
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:56,290
She bought a ticket for King's Cross. But where can she be hiding?

24
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,209
It seems a terrific imposition for
us to be here. Should we just leave?

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,045
Why? We've got Dicky Merton, the Sinderbys and their son arriving.

26
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,881
We could put them off. Please don't. They're looking forward to it.

27
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:09,757
You are. I don't think we should.

28
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,300
We have to give the impression Edith
has gone away to stay somewhere.

29
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,511
How terribly worrying this is for you. I'm so sorry.

30
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,846
Why the song and dance? Edith's gone away. So what?

31
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,722
We three should go for a walk and leave them to talk.

32
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:25,849
Tony can be our guide. He must know the gardens pretty well.

33
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,519
Maybe we should take some air. I think we might emulate the others

34
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:33,188
and let Cora show us the garden. I'm not sure what good that'll do.

35
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,696
When I say we need some air, we need some air. Cora.

36
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:40,359
If it's what you want. Mary,
you can manage the children when they get here.

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,110
Of course.

38
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,528
There's a person downstairs, M'Lady.

39
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:48,613
A Mrs Drewe from Yew Tree Farm. She's very anxious to see you.

40
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:52,491
Oh. Well, you'd better show her in my sitting room.

41
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:56,243
I'm sorry, Mama. You go ahead without me.

42
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,536
I can take you for a walk if you like.

43
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:01,288
Why would I want to walk?

44
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:11,419
I'm going in to change. I'll sneak upstairs so I don't disturb them.

45
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,922
See you at dinner. Not if I see you first.

46
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:22,176
I don't understand. You're so well suited.

47
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:25,719
And you're much more relaxed with her than you are with Mary. Yes.

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,305
You must admit it's odd - Mary is trying to break off

49
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,473
and Mabel is dying for love of you.

50
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:35,184
I know. But I can't break it off with Mary. Not now.

51
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:37,351
Why not?

52
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:41,812
Well, I won't explain it but suffice to say,
it wouldn't be honourable.

53
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:45,606
You are an old dear if you think I
don't know what you're talking about.

54
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:48,359
But isn't it up to Mary? It's not what she wants.

55
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:53,362
Not really. Did she look like a woman today

56
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,447
trying to rid herself of a suitor?

57
00:03:56,531 --> 00:04:00,115
You're muddling her instinct, which is to hold every man in thrall,

58
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,368
and her wish, which is to break up.

59
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,703
I'm not convinced. I wish you would be.

60
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:09,038
For everyone's sake.

61
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:15,458
Who was that letter from? Mr Brook.

62
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,877
He's got a new job in Salford so he doesn't want to renew the lease.

63
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,961
We need to find another tenant. Damn it.

64
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,713
Don't be ungrateful. I've blessed your mother every day

65
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:27,006
for leaving us the house. When you have property, you have choices.

66
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:32,678
What should we do? After he's gone, let's ask for time off together.

67
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:35,513
Go down. See what condition he has left it in then we can plan.

68
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:41,474
Why are you smiling? Because whenever I see a problem,

69
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,976
you see only possibilities.

70
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,935
Did you both know?

71
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:51,147
Mrs Drewe told me Rosamund knew you
went to see the child with Edith.

72
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:54,815
Yes. And you never thought to tell me I have a third grandchild.

73
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,489
Edith didn't want me to.

74
00:04:56,525 --> 00:05:01,195
It makes sense of that bewildering
trip to Switzerland. What was I to do?

75
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:04,488
She wouldn't get rid of it. Get rid of it? It was her idea.

76
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:07,114
But she wouldn't go through with it in the end.

77
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:11,284
And what did you know? Well, not quite as much.

78
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:15,376
I knew why they were in Switzerland.

79
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:19,164
I thought she'd left the baby there. That was the idea.

80
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:23,083
Edith didn't stick to it. And you never thought to involve me?

81
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:28,085
Her OWN mother. You, Rosamund, you looked at that little girl

82
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:30,213
and you never thought it was my business too?

83
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:33,463
Well, we wanted to contain it.

84
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,840
To make as little noise abroad as possible.

85
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:40,842
So what changed? What tipped her
over the edge and into running away?

86
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:44,095
Well, I suppose we all knew Mr Gregson was dead

87
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:47,222
but the confirmation must have been very upsetting.

88
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,807
And Mrs Drewe was being difficult.

89
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,852
Clearly the child couldn't stay there indefinitely.

90
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:56,311
So, we thought...

91
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:59,355
What did you think? That it would be better and safer

92
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:01,856
if the girl was sent abroad. Now, we have it.

93
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,733
Edith was told her child would be taken away.

94
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:08,193
Are you going to say anything to Robert?

95
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:12,238
No. I agree with one thing - the secret is not ours to tell.

96
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,115
Somehow we must find Edith...

97
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,909
.. and we must hear from her what SHE wants.

98
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:29,957
M'Lady.

99
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry to bother you. What is it, Mrs Hughes?

100
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,216
It may have slipped your mind, M'Lady,

101
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:37,795
but do you remember I gave you a train ticket

102
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:40,379
when we came to London for Lady Rose's ball?

103
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,173
It was a return ticket that I found in the pocket

104
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:46,175
of Mr Bates' overcoat. Of course I remember.

105
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:50,219
I don't suppose you put it anywhere for safekeeping?

106
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,013
Why? Because we were wrong.

107
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:58,099
Far from proving Mr Bates went to London on the day Mr Green died,

108
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,518
it proved he didn't. He bought the ticket in York

109
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,395
but changed his mind and that's why it was never given in.

110
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:08,355
So it was proof of his innocence not his guilt?

111
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:10,273
That's about the size of it.

112
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:14,735
I'm afraid I burnt it, Mrs Hughes.

113
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,446
Atticus.

114
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:29,743
Hello. Lord and Lady Sinderby. Hello. Rose.

115
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:33,412
Oh, you know my cousin. We were in awe of your courage yesterday.

116
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:37,498
Well, courage or foolhardiness. Come and see Mama and Papa.

117
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,335
To be honest, we're in the middle of rather a drama.

118
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:48,839
Which I'll tell you about but you mustn't let on. Our first secret.

119
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:53,382
This is cold so it can go up now but cover it till it's served.

120
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:56,884
Shall we work on Vanity Fair when you've finished tonight? I dunno.

121
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:59,594
Well, I'll ask you later.

122
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,054
Lord Merton's arrived so everyone is here.

123
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:05,807
I'll announce it when you're ready.
I will be by the time you say it.

124
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,059
You're very glum. Am I?

125
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,353
Don't tell me your enthusiasm for learning is drying up.

126
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:14,645
Maybe. Have you read the papers lately?

127
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,022
I wish I had the time!

128
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:20,315
Mr MacDonald seems to limp from crisis to crisis.

129
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,942
They were going to do so much when they came in.

130
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:26,862
The first Labour Government. Now, I doubt they'll last the year.

131
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:29,196
Don't take it personally. But I do.

132
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:32,031
When I think about it, it seems to me that we're trapped.

133
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:36,159
Held fast in a system that gives us no value and no freedom.

134
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,660
Oi. Speak for yourself! I am. I do.

135
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:42,079
And now I'm wondering. Is it worth it me trying to better myself?

136
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,704
What's the point?

137
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:46,165
That's it. They're coming in.

138
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,382
Miss Baxter.

139
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:05,385
I'm afraid you think I've got you both into trouble.

140
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:08,553
I don't know what you mean. Yes, you do.

141
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:12,055
I said I had no proof. I gave them nothing that would stand up.

142
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:15,307
Why did you have to say anything? I was in a difficult position.

143
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:20,270
So now you've put us in one. I'm very sorry. I am. Truly.

144
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,856
I have to clean some shoes.

145
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,495
Are you enjoying Yorkshire? Well, first, we and Yorkshire

146
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:43,574
have to get used to each other. But you haven't come up against

147
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:47,451
too many impassable barriers. Lord Grantham,
we both know what we're up against.

148
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,455
Happily, we're used to it. You won't have any trouble with us.

149
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,581
Lady Grantham's father was Jewish.
That isn't a guarantee of tolerance.

150
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:56,624
So it's a relief to hear you say it.

151
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:00,753
Atticus seems to be very taken with your niece.

152
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:02,754
And I must say...

153
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,094
.. I find her quite charming.

154
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:11,550
Does Lord Sinderby approve? Well, you know, he needs time

155
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,551
to settle into things.

156
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:16,094
Your mother never considered converting.

157
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,763
I don't believe so.

158
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:23,390
Was it difficult? Having a different religion from your father's?

159
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,558
Not that I recall.

160
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,684
Hm.

161
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:31,354
And you're not ashamed of him? Lord Sinderby, I would point out

162
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:33,730
that we never changed our name.

163
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:37,149
Hm. It was my grandfather's decision.

164
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,526
I thought of changing it back but the family felt they were English

165
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,276
now and they wanted to stay...

166
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,693
English.

167
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:46,529
Have you decided at last whether you are leaving?

168
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:48,198
'At last' is the right phrase

169
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,074
but I want to make sure I do the right thing.

170
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:54,368
I don't want to disrupt Sybbie's life and then regret it.

171
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,411
You know they all want you to stay.

172
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:59,580
That only makes it more difficult.

173
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:04,833
Lord Grantham was saying Gregson left
Lady Edith his publishing company.

174
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,667
Yes. Then shouldn't someone telephone the office?

175
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,461
Won't she go there? They must know where to find her.

176
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,130
Of course. How clever you are.

177
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:18,133
Why? It seems rather obvious to me.

178
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:24,219
Your mother and Robert are hitting it off.
She's not the problem. Oh?

179
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,428
My father's the tough nut.

180
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,640
My people are the other way round. My father's a darling

181
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:33,976
and my mother's the nut. Then we
shall crack them against each other.

182
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:40,353
Strange how some people get married and married and...

183
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,521
we can't manage it once.

184
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:45,900
Dogs barking in wrong trees spring to mind.

185
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:51,068
Tony, I'm sorry if you feel I'm tracking you round the country,

186
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:54,820
but I can't give up just yet. We would be so happy if you'd let us.

187
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:56,947
And I won't be if I don't?

188
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:00,867
I remember my mother telling me, that in the end,

189
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:03,035
happiness is a matter of choice.

190
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:06,912
Some people choose to be happy and others select a course

191
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:09,538
that leads only to frustration and disappointment.

192
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:12,707
And I'm one of the latter. I terribly hope not.

193
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,376
For my sake.

194
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,544
I have a little announcement.

195
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,839
Are you sure? I am.

196
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,717
You might like to know that Lord Merton and I have decided

197
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:31,510
that we should get married.

198
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,511
How lovely.

199
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:36,513
Well, this calls for a toast.

200
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:38,639
I give you, Mrs Crawley.

201
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,517
Or should I say, the future Lady Merton.

202
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,978
The future Lady Merton! The future Lady Merton.

203
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:51,480
Naturally, it was the last thing I ever thought would happen.

204
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:54,190
I forced her into it.

205
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,611
He wooed me into it and I'm terribly pleased he did.

206
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,613
Well...

207
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:06,656
What's the matter, granny? I was worried about Edith.

208
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,247
I can't think why.

209
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:13,536
My dear, a lack of compassion can be as vulgar

210
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:15,163
as an excess of tears.

211
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,718
Ah, Daisy. Have you decided?

212
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,617
Shall we discuss the vices of Miss Becky Sharp?

213
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,514
I'm tired. I'm going up. Good night, Mrs Patmore.

214
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,849
What's that about?

215
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,018
She had such hopes of the Labour Government, she feels let down.

216
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:39,354
But she mustn't give up. I don't recall you being this keen

217
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,523
when Miss Bunting was teaching her.

218
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:45,816
I wouldn't interfere with a professional but now she's gone,

219
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,650
I'd like to help if I can.

220
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,735
Sounds to me as if you've missed out on your vocation.

221
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,195
Tell Daisy. Perhaps you can change her mind.

222
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:57,948
She wouldn't listen to me. Well spotted. What about Mr Mason?

223
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:01,075
Funnily enough, Mr Barrow might be right for once.

224
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:04,828
How do we get him to speak to her? Let me think on it.

225
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry if I seem distracted but I'm truly so happy for you both.

226
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:18,418
I thought I'd give a dinner so she could meet my sons.

227
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,171
Well, she has met Larry before. Let's hope she's forgotten!

228
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:25,465
Why don't we do it here? We could invite Granny and everyone.

229
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:29,884
You are my godfather and Isobel is the grandmother of my child.

230
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:32,552
Oh, please let's. It seems only right, Mama.

231
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:35,137
Of course. If you'd like. Oh, that would be very kind.

232
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,764
A signing of the bond between our families.

233
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:40,599
I wish we didn't know the anguish lurking around.

234
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,725
You love other people's secrets.

235
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,144
Not these days.

236
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,644
I can't tell you why I can't leave Mary but...

237
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:51,106
you'd understand if I did. Just promise me it's a struggle.

238
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,150
More than you know.

239
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:57,943
We must go but it's been such fun. I hope you come to us next time.

240
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:02,612
We should love it. I suppose we just
have to wait and see what happens.

241
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:06,199
No need to hurry them into anything. They're both very young.

242
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:10,659
Well, I would be delighted if something were to come of it.

243
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,453
Good night, Lady Grantham. Lady Rosamund.

244
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,870
The door, please, Molesley.

245
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:19,581
They're so easy in each other's company. Anyone can see.

246
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,750
But he won't let me go.

247
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,793
Because you refuse to make it clear that you want him to.

248
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:27,252
Just as he's moving off, you tug his strings.

249
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:30,046
Send a clear message and he'll go. I promise.

250
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,090
What is that message?

251
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,050
We'll think of something.

252
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:39,552
Atticus says the London office of the magazine must know

253
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,719
how to get in touch with Edith.

254
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,513
I thought we weren't going to tell anyone. He's not anyone, is he?

255
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:50,225
Of course not. We could ring them tomorrow but maybe I should go.

256
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:52,351
Mr Aldridge is leaving.

257
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,395
Oh.

258
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:59,688
I'll train up in the morning. I'm coming with you. I'm not going.

259
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:03,441
I'll have a horrible day worrying. Trust me.

260
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,902
How can you imagine I'll ever trust you again?

261
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:12,238
She doesn't mean it. On the contrary.

262
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:15,616
It's the most honest thing she's ever said to me.

263
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:20,453
There you are. Thank you.

264
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,668
Is our life overcomplicated?

265
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:37,546
In what way? Mrs Patmore is buying a house up here.

266
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:40,213
Why don't we sell the London house and do the same?

267
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,923
We could rent it out as long as we want to work out Downton.

268
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:46,718
And then live in it when we retire. We had a dream once.

269
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,636
Of a small hotel in the area.

270
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:53,346
A London house, even a little one,
would buy something substantial here.

271
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,391
I hate to say his name...

272
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,519
.. but do you feel the whole business of Mr Green might be over?

273
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,270
For us, I mean. Well, they seem to have accepted the fact

274
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:07,397
that I spent the day in York and Miss Baxter has given them

275
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:10,857
nothing new to go on. So we can dare to plan our future again.

276
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:14,025
Like normal people. Does that mean what I hope it means?

277
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:17,278
Mr Bates, I thought you'd decided to believe me

278
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,987
when I said that device was Lady Mary's? I do believe you.

279
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:23,656
I don't know why she wanted it but I believe you. Well, then...

280
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:26,991
You don't suppose there's anything wrong with us, do you?

281
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:29,160
No.

282
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,954
I think it takes some people longer than others.

283
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:33,204
That's all.

284
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:35,415
What would I do without you?

285
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:43,962
Did they get away? Just about. The train was late, thank heaven.

286
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:48,672
And it isn't going to be Tony? I don't think so.

287
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:52,132
Nor Charles. He decided that before I did. Well, well.

288
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:57,510
I don't suppose your ancient father's opinion carries much weight.

289
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:01,223
'Fraid not. And I've just remembered I said I'd go and see granny.

290
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:10,393
So, I don't think Tony is going to be my next son-in-law.

291
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:13,230
I don't believe he is.

292
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:17,439
Pity. I'd have been so pleased but there we are.

293
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,941
You're really not yourself, are you, old girl?

294
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,901
And what about you? We don't want you to be on your own forever.

295
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,237
Just to pick someone who shares the family's values.

296
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:31,031
Someone who feels friendly towards us is not the same thing. No.

297
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:36,409
You're right. And I don't blame you
for the departure of Miss Bunting.

298
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,368
I didn't want to spend my life in a bare knuckle fight.

299
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,621
But something's changed. I feel it.

300
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,665
I may as well tell you.

301
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,208
I've written to my cousin in Boston.

302
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,336
He's done well there and I'd like his advice. I see.

303
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,796
I apologise if my bad manners have brought this on.

304
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:59,924
No need to apologise. I am what I am and you are what you are.

305
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:02,300
Never the twain shall meet! I wouldn't say that.

306
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:04,426
I do love you all, you know.

307
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,969
It'll be hard to go.

308
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,888
On both sides.

309
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:14,267
But we have no way of knowing if Lady Edith will come in today.

310
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:17,601
It's already tea-time and we close the office at six.

311
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:21,151
Then we'll wait until six. And we'll come back in the morning.

312
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:25,815
And every day till she either turns up
or contacts you with her whereabouts.

313
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,983
It wouldn't be enough to give her a
message that you want to see her?

314
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,319
No, it would not be enough.

315
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:38,738
You've told her, haven't you?

316
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:41,033
You've broken your word.

317
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:44,535
No. I've... Mrs Drewe came to the house.

318
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:48,453
What did she want? She felt you had used her badly.

319
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,579
I confess it was a feeling we shared.

320
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,332
I'm not coming back, you know. Let's not talk about it here.

321
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,876
Come to me for dinner. No.

322
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:01,669
Very well, we'll discuss it now in front of your new employees

323
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,713
and give them something to chew on.

324
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,048
There is a tea room at the end of the street.

325
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:17,012
How are you, Spratt? Well, I hope.

326
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:21,223
Everyone has their troubles, M'Lady. Oh, dear.

327
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:24,226
Spratt has been helping to train my new maid. Denker.

328
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:27,853
I'd say she takes after the dachshund, M'Lady.

329
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:31,188
In what way? She's QUITE untrainable.

330
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:35,149
Spratt. Will there be anything else, Your Ladyship?

331
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:43,112
Sounds like trouble to me.

332
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,279
Are you certain Denker is worth it?

333
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,239
Oh, you must put dinner on Friday into your diary.

334
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,908
That's when Dicky Merton is coming with his sons.

335
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:54,368
Yes. I wonder if it is a good idea.

336
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,495
Isobel has got to meet them some time.

337
00:20:57,496 --> 00:21:01,164
And Larry won't make trouble for Tom again. Not with Sybil dead.

338
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:03,207
Let us hope not.

339
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:08,002
Granny, I know why you're finding this difficult.

340
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:12,546
Do you? Yes, but you mustn't give in to it.

341
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:15,881
What? Give in to what? Isobel has always been your protege.

342
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:19,884
She looks up to you and you have kept her from harm in return.

343
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:22,052
Have I?

344
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:25,763
Yes. So of course it's difficult that she is to take her place

345
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:28,430
among the leaders of the county. Why?

346
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:31,432
Why is it difficult? You needn't pretend.

347
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:36,311
Your positions have changed - you the widow in the Dower House,

348
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:40,522
Isobel a great lady presiding over a great house.

349
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:43,274
But you simply have to be bigger than that.

350
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:49,194
Is that what you think of me?

351
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:52,570
That I care about her change of rank?

352
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,614
Well, you're not exactly pleased, are you?

353
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:59,950
No. But that is not the reason.

354
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:02,951
Then what is?

355
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:04,996
If you must know...

356
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,123
.. I have got used to having a companion.

357
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:14,416
A friend. You know, someone to talk things over with.

358
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,836
Well, you'll still have us. You have your own lives.

359
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,880
And so you should.

360
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:25,798
But Isobel and I had a lot in common.

361
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,843
And...

362
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,885
.. I shall miss her. Granny,

363
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:35,097
you're quite dewy-eyed. I never think of you as sentimental.

364
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:37,140
Nor am I.

365
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:41,058
You've made me regret my confidence. Do have some cake.

366
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,392
And for your information...

367
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:48,314
I don't think Isobel has EVER looked up to me.

368
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:53,899
Now, we drop the sticks in together when I say.

369
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,943
Ready? Go!

370
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,321
Where are they?

371
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:05,239
There it is. It's me! It's me! Yes.

372
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,284
Now make a wish.

373
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:14,203
Darling, you know Aunt Edith has gone to London? Yes.

374
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:16,371
Well, I was thinking...

375
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:20,750
I wonder what if we were to leave here and go and live

376
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:22,917
in a place far away across the sea?

377
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,336
What would you say? Why?

378
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,963
Well, because...

379
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:33,258
.. it might be better for us to start a new life there. Why?

380
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,468
Because...

381
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,220
Because I hope to God I'm doing the right thing.

382
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,889
That's the stable clock.

383
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,933
WE had better get back.

384
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:07,152
I've got an idea and I've told Mrs Hughes but I want you to know it.

385
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:10,862
I could swear the train ticket hadn't been used. I would swear it.

386
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:15,491
What? I saw the ticket in Mrs Hughes'
hand when she found it in the coat.

387
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:18,576
It hadn't been torn in half. It was whole. I saw it.

388
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,702
Did you? Indeed.

389
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:22,870
Things have moved on, Miss Baxter.

390
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:25,372
They know Mr Bates was in York on that day.

391
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,290
I just wanted to be helpful.

392
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,917
We know how you like to be helpful, Miss Baxter.

393
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:33,835
By talking to the police about us.

394
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:37,504
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.

395
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:42,299
Miss Baxter won't say it but she's in a difficult position.

396
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,426
On the contrary, Miss Baxter keeps saying it.

397
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:49,094
She says nothing else.

398
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:52,681
Mr Molesley, can you remove the baize from the tables, please?

399
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,976
I'm ready to go up.

400
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,019
I'll come with you.

401
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:09,648
Ignore them. I can't. I feel sorry for them.

402
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:12,943
Then tell them why you had to talk to the police.

403
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,403
I'd feel ashamed.

404
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,239
You're in luck. I'm only just back.

405
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,828
Listen carefully. Today, I learned I've
been posted on a trade delegation to Poland.

406
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:29,994
I'll be gone for months. Some people have all the fun.

407
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,412
I want you to come up to London tomorrow.

408
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:35,748
I've things I can't get out of in the morning. That doesn't matter.

409
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:39,166
I just need you from about seven o'clock on. What for?

410
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:42,544
Mabel's given me an idea of how to settle it once and for all.

411
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:45,921
Just be here. What sort of clothes?

412
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:49,715
Rags. We're going to the Kinema. Ring me when you get to London.

413
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,009
Your wish is my command. Bye.

414
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:00,430
I'm worried about Isis. Why? What's the matter with her?

415
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:04,223
She's not looking too clever.
Did you manage to get hold of Mr Stapeley?

416
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:07,600
I spoke to his wife, My Lord. He's away until Friday.

417
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,768
Do you want me to try to find someone else? No.

418
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,438
I'll take her there myself on Friday afternoon.
Has the gong been rung?

419
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,731
Just. Why do we bother to change? It's you, me, Mary and Tom.

420
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:19,399
Don't let Aunt Violet hear you. Where have you been?

421
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,026
I went to have tea with Atticus. We met halfway in Ripon.

422
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:25,654
It's getting quite serious then? Fingers crossed.

423
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:29,281
But darling, you don't want to rush into anything. Oh, but I do.

424
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:31,532
I want to rush in like billy-o.

425
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:34,074
Rose, it's a big thing you're contemplating.

426
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:36,451
Bigger still because of the circumstances.

427
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:39,621
You sound like Lord Sinderby. I can see he wasn't keen.

428
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:42,914
He doesn't want Atticus to marry out of the faith. He minds.

429
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:46,166
Why shouldn't he mind? He's an important figure in that community.

430
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,958
But you're not against it, are you? Of course not.

431
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:52,775
Still, I think you ought to write to
your parents. Daddy won't stop me.

432
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,589
I don't believe he will. And Mummy hates
everyone so what's the difference?

433
00:26:56,657 --> 00:27:01,593
Even so, it's best not to pretend it'll be plain sailing.

434
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:10,922
Where's Marigold? The hotel arranges
a baby-sitter when you need one.

435
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,797
May I see her? I don't think so.

436
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,715
Not tonight. So what are you going to do?

437
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:19,385
I was toying for a while with the idea of going to America.

438
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:23,101
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Why is it ridiculous? She's half American.

439
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:27,226
I thought I'd drop my title and invent a dead husband.

440
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:30,521
Then I'd be Mrs Thing in Detroit or Chicago.

441
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:34,334
Where I wouldn't run into anyone I knew. So, is that your plan?

442
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:38,337
I don't want the magazine business to fall into ruin.

443
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:40,465
How could I keep an eye on it overseas?

444
00:27:41,673 --> 00:27:45,383
And I would like Marigold to grow up English.
What is the alternative?

445
00:27:45,384 --> 00:27:49,844
An invented dead husband here? I'd never get away with it in London.

446
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:52,763
I thought I'd make her my orphaned godchild.

447
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:54,807
Well, I have a different plan.

448
00:27:57,016 --> 00:27:59,141
I'd like you to bring her home. No.

449
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:02,643
I won't be the county failure. Poor demented Lady Edith

450
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:04,853
who lost her virtue and her reason.

451
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:06,856
Just listen to my plan.

452
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:13,317
The Drewes would reach a reluctant conclusion

453
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,945
that they can't afford to raise their friend's child.

454
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,863
You've grown so fond of the girl, you ask if she might join

455
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,657
the others in the Downton nursery. The Drewe plan was mad enough.

456
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:27,284
But this is COMPLETELY ludicrous.

457
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:30,577
How could it possibly work? Papa must never know the truth.

458
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,793
I've thought about it and don't agree.

459
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,624
It would take time for him to get
used to the idea, he would make it.

460
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:40,500
He'd never look at me in the same way again. Very well.

461
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:43,710
If that's how you feel, he doesn't have to know. Nor Mary.

462
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,676
I couldn't have her queening it over me.

463
00:28:45,712 --> 00:28:50,090
- No-one has to know who doesn't know
- your grandmother, Rosamund, you and me.

464
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:52,633
Everyone else will be told the story.

465
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:55,258
And how would we execute this insanity?

466
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:58,594
A farmer's foster child turns up in the Downton nursery?

467
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:02,430
People adopt babies all the time from all kinds of backgrounds.

468
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,390
So you're going to do this? I'll telephone Mr Drewe tonight

469
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:08,600
when we get back to Belgrave Square and I'll ask for his help.

470
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:11,185
And what about his wife? Let him manage her.

471
00:29:11,186 --> 00:29:15,312
Edith and I will go home tomorrow.
I'll ask Mr Drewe to meet the train

472
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:20,774
and take Marigold, then we'll discuss the Drewes' situation.

473
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:26,611
At last, Edith will fetch the girl
and bring her back in broad daylight.

474
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:29,364
Time to call it a day, ladies.

475
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,324
I couldn't agree more.

476
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:37,827
And one for you, Mr Moseley.

477
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,455
I'm going out with Lady Mary this afternoon but only for the night.

478
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:46,749
You didn't have much warning. I know. Something has come up.

479
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,835
I suppose there's no point in you looking in on the house. Not now.

480
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:53,586
Leave it till Mr Brook's left and we can both go.

481
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:57,588
Ooh, it's an invitation from Mr Mason. What? My Mr Mason?

482
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:01,800
Your Mr Mason. He wants us to come
to the farm tomorrow for luncheon.

483
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,843
If we can get the time off.

484
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,304
Why don't you go with them? I'm sure Her Ladyship wouldn't mind.

485
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:13,474
What is it to you? You did me a good
turn when I'd done you a bad one.

486
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:16,767
So I think you deserve a treat. He's right. It'll do you good.

487
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:18,935
But I've not been asked.

488
00:30:18,936 --> 00:30:23,688
Mr Mason would be glad to see you but would Mr Carson let us go?

489
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,523
Ooh, I think he will if you allow me to handle it.

490
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,191
He won't like it when we've got a big dinner on.

491
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:33,486
Just let me tell him. I'm the one with the extra work.

492
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:37,369
Would Miss Baxter be able to come with us? As Mr Barrow says.

493
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:40,866
Well, I don't see why not as long as
you're back in time. You can go early.

494
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:44,243
I still don't understand why he'd write to Mr Moseley.

495
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:47,745
I might have mentioned he's been helping you with your books.

496
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,788
I write to him now and then.

497
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,504
Can you see him? Not yet.

498
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:08,012
Oh, my God. There's Mary.

499
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:12,093
What? There's Mr Drewe. What shall we do? Leave it to me.

500
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:18,305
Mr Drewe. Can you help my mother with her suitcases?

501
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:27,561
My sister Mary is on the platform.
Go to the next station and come back.

502
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,604
I'll cover the cost.

503
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:44,571
Come on you. That's it. Come on, darling. It's just a game.

504
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:55,333
So, you found her. I did.

505
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,872
I don't know what the fuss was about.
I wanted a day or two in London.

506
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,879
I knew it. I said that's all it was. What a nonsense they made.

507
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:06,208
Why are you here? I'm catching the first
train to London. It's due any minute.

508
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:09,337
When will you be back? I'm not sure. Tomorrow, I think.

509
00:32:09,338 --> 00:32:11,468
Don't forget the dinner on Friday.

510
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:14,007
We have a duty to protect Isobel from Larry Grey.

511
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:16,089
I don't think he'll try anything, do you?

512
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,717
Well, have a lovely time. I'm sure I will.

513
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:27,639
That was close.

514
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:33,225
Have I met your younger son? I remember the elder one.

515
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:35,685
I should think you do.

516
00:32:35,686 --> 00:32:38,401
After his outburst the last time.

517
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:41,981
But Larry was fond of Sybil and not
about to welcome the man who'd won her.

518
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:46,107
Let us hope the years since have made him more forgiving.

519
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:49,109
I'm looking forward to it and think we should make no reference

520
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,486
to the earlier meeting. How lucky I am in you.

521
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:55,245
I know it every time you speak. Flatterer.

522
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:59,657
I should be going. I'll see you on Friday. I can't wait.

523
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:02,202
Thank you so much for my lovely tea. Not a bit.

524
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:04,995
Spratt will see you out.

525
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,500
Spratt still looks rather down in the mouth.

526
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:18,419
I'm afraid the battles with Denker are far from resolved.

527
00:33:21,005 --> 00:33:24,215
It's good to have a moment alone to say how much I appreciate

528
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:27,383
your kindness to Dicky. I know you don't approve.

529
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:31,260
Which makes you all the more generous. It's too late to stop it.

530
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,553
How is Prince Kuragin?

531
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:37,348
I haven't heard from him lately. Why?

532
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,975
I was wondering how you were going
to manage when the Princess arrives.

533
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:44,602
Will you receive her here? Well, I'm not sure.

534
00:33:44,603 --> 00:33:49,187
Since Shrimpie hasn't found her yet, I've got time to plan.

535
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:52,149
- Ah.
- Oh!

536
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,567
What is it now, Spratt?

537
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:59,819
I'm sorry to bother Your Ladyship. Especially when you have company.

538
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,654
I'm afraid I must... hand in my notice.

539
00:34:02,655 --> 00:34:07,408
I have suffered as much as anyone can expect to suffer

540
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,534
in the course of their duties.

541
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:11,660
I can take no more, M'Lady.

542
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:14,454
I can take no more.

543
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,833
Typical Spratt.

544
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,918
He's as touchy as a beauty losing her looks.

545
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,837
You don't think he meant it? If he did, he'd have given it quietly.

546
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:32,715
For a good reference in return. No. No.

547
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:38,468
It's a demonstration of discontent. So you'll forgive his outburst?

548
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:42,638
Anything rather than find a new butler.

549
00:34:58,606 --> 00:35:01,482
Why did we have to rush out? Come and stand here.

550
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:03,692
I still don't understand. You will.

551
00:35:03,693 --> 00:35:07,194
Do exactly as I tell you and you will. Kiss me.

552
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,696
What? Kiss me. Now!

553
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:17,325
Mary.

554
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:20,452
What are you doing here? So what did you think of the film?

555
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:22,953
There was no need to stage a tableau.

556
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,205
If you'd just told me I was allowed to walk away, I'd have gone.

557
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:29,707
Without any silly games. But I DID tell you. Often.

558
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,502
And you didn't go. Well, I'm going now.

559
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:37,170
I know. And I wish you both such happiness, Tony.

560
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:40,839
I do. I don't want to hurry anyone but can we bring this to an end?

561
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,842
I've had quite enough sentiment from
John Barrymore and I'm starving.

562
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,803
Goodbye, Mary. And good luck to you.

563
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:53,055
I'm glad to have engineered a resolution

564
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:56,348
even if I should have thought of it long ago.
He said we didn't need to.

565
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,143
But I know we did. It's funny. I feel quite sad in a way.

566
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:03,061
But not sad enough to change my mind.

567
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:07,731
She's nice, you know. She'll suit him very well. Good. I'm glad.

568
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:12,733
So, what now? Shall we find ourselves some dinner too?

569
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,902
Let's. We'll toast the fun we've had.

570
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,988
And whatever the future may bring us.

571
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:21,030
When are you off to Poland? I catch the boat train on Monday.

572
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:23,990
So I'm scrambling around trying to get everything done.

573
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:26,950
When are you back? Oh, not for months or even a year.

574
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,036
You'll be married by then.

575
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,915
There. Are we all finished?

576
00:36:35,998 --> 00:36:39,416
How lovely, Daisy, to have such a beautiful place to come to.

577
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:44,545
She's always welcome is Daisy. I've not been here enough lately.

578
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:47,338
You've been busy I know. With your books.

579
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,340
That takes up time. I think I'll stop it now.

580
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,008
So I'll be able to visit more.

581
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:56,593
Do you think she's right to give up her studies, Mr Mason? I do NOT.

582
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:59,804
Don't you want to see more of me? You know I do.

583
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:03,431
But education is power. Don't forget that.

584
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:06,225
There's no limit to what you can achieve

585
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:11,019
if you'll just give a year or two to mastering those books. I agree.

586
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,730
There are millions out there who could have done so much

587
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:18,690
if they'd only been given an education.

588
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:21,775
I'm one of 'em. I could have made something worthwhile of my life

589
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:26,070
if I'd had the chance. Don't talk as
if your life were not worthwhile...

590
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:30,322
when I know it is. I think the system is slanted against us.

591
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:33,241
The men in charge will always be the men in charge.

592
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:35,826
How can you say that with a Labour Government in power?

593
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:39,744
I doubt they'll last the year. Next time, when they're elected,

594
00:37:39,746 --> 00:37:41,914
it'll be for longer, and soon

595
00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:44,540
a Labour Government might seem ordinary.

596
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,833
Do you think I should stick at it? I do!

597
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:52,085
And now, we ought to think about getting you back to the bus.

598
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:54,087
Let me take these. No. No.

599
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:56,214
Daisy and I are your hosts.

600
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:58,299
Thank you. Well, thank you.

601
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:09,472
He's made a daughter out of his widowed daughter-in-law.

602
00:38:09,473 --> 00:38:12,599
I like it when good things come from bad.

603
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:18,602
Have you thought of explaining to Mr Bates why you had to speak out?

604
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:20,769
He'd understand if anyone would.

605
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,940
He's troubles enough without burdening him with mine.

606
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:27,899
We should go. We must be back in good time for Mrs Crawley's dinner.

607
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,401
Mr Carson says there was trouble the last time

608
00:38:30,402 --> 00:38:33,903
Lord Merton's elder son came to Downton. What happened?

609
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:38,197
Alfred told me if Mr Branson hadn't been too drunk to stand

610
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:40,367
we'd have had fisticuffs on the table.

611
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:45,077
And here's my thinking life in a great house must be dull work.

612
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,496
Walk on.

613
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:54,135
Do Mr and Mrs Drewe really want you to take her?

614
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:57,229
Or is it just a way of keeping her here till they have her back?

615
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,731
I don't think so. They simply can't afford another child.

616
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:04,192
And there aren't any prior claims? Apparently not.

617
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:06,986
That's why they took her in the first place.

618
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:10,702
What did he say? Is she carrying puppies?

619
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,741
I don't see how that could have happened. It's not that.

620
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:16,575
She's got cancer. Poor old thing.

621
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:20,618
Oh, no. Oh, how I hate that word.

622
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,788
He said it won't take long now.

623
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:27,707
He offered to put her down there and then but I couldn't let him.

624
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,798
Oh, Papa. I'm so, so sorry.

625
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:33,043
Of course, it was stupid to mind so much.

626
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:35,878
She doesn't even know who I am beyond the hand that feeds her

627
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:37,922
but even so...

628
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:40,965
We'll keep her right here. This is her spot.

629
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:43,174
She'll know she's back at home.

630
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:48,219
I suppose we can't stop this ghastly dinner tonight.

631
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,304
I don't see how. Dicky's sons have come from London.

632
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:55,224
And Atticus was on the same train.
No, of course we can't put it off.

633
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:58,016
I wasn't thinking. Why don't we say that you're ill?

634
00:39:58,017 --> 00:40:01,643
I could watch her. I don't have to go to the dinner. I think you do.

635
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:04,564
To lay the ghost of the last time Larry Grey was here.

636
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:09,899
I asked them to bring them down early.

637
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,442
Hello, Daddy. Come to Mama, darling.

638
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,194
Hello, my darling.

639
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:19,697
So, how should I answer?

640
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:23,699
What's this about? The child at the Drewe's house.

641
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,867
Oh. It seems idiotic to me.

642
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:30,744
And me. What about if you want to start a family of your own?

643
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:34,832
But I dote on her. If they send her to some horrid orphanage,

644
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:38,292
I'd never forgive myself. Can't you just give them some money?

645
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:40,502
So they can keep her. I think...

646
00:40:41,627 --> 00:40:46,463
.. Mrs Drewe finds it too much. It isn't only the money.

647
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:49,925
It seems a bit feeble. Does it? Looking at these two.

648
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,384
So, should I take her?

649
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,637
Papa?

650
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:03,766
I'll leave it to your mother. Well...

651
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,391
I believe we should offer little Marigold a home here.

652
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:08,436
Do you really, darling?

653
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:14,856
Well, then, I suppose that's settled.

654
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:24,777
Have all the guests arrived?

655
00:41:24,778 --> 00:41:29,197
I think so. I should tell Mrs Patmore it won't be long now.

656
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:31,240
What are these?

657
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,867
Mr Carson's got a notion he and I might buy a place

658
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:39,704
as an investment and maybe run it as a guesthouse or rent it out.

659
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,871
How strange.

660
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:44,498
Mr Bates was talking about doing something similar.

661
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:47,959
I suppose we're all beginning to think of a different future

662
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,378
whether we want to or not.

663
00:41:51,629 --> 00:41:55,255
The other day, Mr Drewe was on the platform.

664
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:58,381
When Lady Mary and I were waiting for the London train.

665
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:03,343
Oh, yes. Then her Ladyship and Lady Edith arrived.

666
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:07,053
And he got into their carriage. He helped lift their bags out.

667
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:09,598
But then he just stayed there. In first class?

668
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:13,856
That'll have cost him a pretty penny.

669
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:18,061
When the train moved off, I thought for
a moment he had a child on his lap.

670
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:23,064
I may have been wrong. Anna, you shouldn't involve yourself

671
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:24,939
in any speculation of that sort.

672
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,484
The child is safe and the child is loved.

673
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:31,611
And that's all we need to be sure of.

674
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,949
I've been hearing about Edith's plan. How marvellous of her.

675
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,368
If you ask me, it's absolutely crackers.

676
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:46,626
Cora seems pleased. What idea is this?

677
00:42:46,662 --> 00:42:51,039
Edith has taken in a motherless child and is giving her a home here.

678
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,540
I should have thought an orphan an uncomfortable piece of baggage

679
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,083
for an unmarried woman.

680
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:58,586
You mean a man might not want to take the child on?

681
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:01,713
Well, I wouldn't.

682
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:07,944
Rose, have you written to your mother about Mr Aldridge? I have now.

683
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:12,635
And will she approve? Don't be disappointing, Aunt Violet, please.

684
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:16,429
I promise you we know difference in religion is a big thing.

685
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,099
Quite right. How would you bring up
any children, for example? Children?

686
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,017
When did this happen? Talking hypothetically.

687
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,895
The fact is, most marriages that fail,

688
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,438
founder for precisely this kind of reason.

689
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:35,274
An irreconcilable difference. Or maybe they just don't get on.

690
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:38,067
No, I'd agree with Larry. It's usually more than that.

691
00:43:38,068 --> 00:43:41,820
It might be different beliefs, or different nationalities

692
00:43:41,821 --> 00:43:43,988
or a huge age gap.

693
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,906
It the end, they cannot see eye-to-eye.

694
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:50,783
I don't see what you're getting at. You mean to marry Mrs Crawley.

695
00:43:50,784 --> 00:43:54,828
She seems very nice and I wish you both every happiness.

696
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:56,370
Thank you.

697
00:43:56,371 --> 00:44:01,415
But that doesn't prevent me from seeing the wide disparity in class

698
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,958
and background may prove your undoing.

699
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:07,794
What did you say? Only that Mrs Crawley, a decent middle class woman

700
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:11,423
with neither birth nor fortune is expecting to fill another's shoes

701
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:13,673
as one of the leaders of the county.

702
00:44:14,758 --> 00:44:16,924
Is she capable of it?

703
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:20,759
Or will her inevitable failure prove
a source of misery to them both?

704
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,346
Do you know Mrs Crawley's late son was my heir?

705
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:27,973
What does that prove? Everyone has distant cousins who are odd.

706
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:30,809
How dare you?! Will you GO, Larry?

707
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:35,149
I had to make excuses for your rudeness the last time

708
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:38,981
you sat at this table. It is tiring to think I should be called upon

709
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:42,029
to do so AGAIN. I know the choice of in-laws is eccentric.

710
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:45,943
In this family, you already boast a
chauffeur and soon you can claim a Jew -

711
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:48,074
Why don't you just get out, you bastard?!

712
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:50,779
And suddenly we've slipped into a foreign tongue.

713
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:58,158
Well, if that is how you feel?

714
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,036
I do not endorse Tom's language but
that is certainly how we all feel.

715
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:07,748
Then, Lady Grantham, goodbye.

716
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,917
And thank you for a delightful evening.

717
00:45:23,175 --> 00:45:25,217
What did you imagine?

718
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:29,261
That we would welcome you with open arms?

719
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:37,181
He actually called him that? He did. Right to his face.

720
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:41,066
Mr Moseley, please. I think he was right to say it.

721
00:45:41,102 --> 00:45:44,812
He may have been right but I will not
have bad language in front of the maids.

722
00:45:44,813 --> 00:45:48,022
I feel sorry for Mrs Crawley. Why should she be humiliated?

723
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:51,315
They're leaving early. No wonder.

724
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:55,359
Mr Moseley, why are you down here? Not gossiping I hope?

725
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,237
Oh, no, no, Mr Carson, no.

726
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:02,238
Golly, what an evening.

727
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,325
We won't forget it in a hurry. Let us remember it for two reasons.

728
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:09,952
One bad, one good. What's the good one? I hope it is good.

729
00:46:09,953 --> 00:46:13,829
I'm listening. See, the thing is, it occurs to me

730
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,830
that we're already having to defend ourselves. Yes.

731
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:21,876
Let's have a real reason to. That is, if you feel equal to it.

732
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,919
I'm not going to give you an answer until you say it properly.

733
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,879
Do I have to kneel down? Of course.

734
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,297
But you don't have to stay kneeling for very long.

735
00:46:30,298 --> 00:46:33,967
Rose, darling Rose...

736
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:37,593
.. will you marry me?

737
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,761
Oh, you can get up now. Come on.

738
00:46:39,762 --> 00:46:44,430
We ought to be serious. The truth
is we haven't known each other long.

739
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:49,100
And they're right. There are bound to be problems. The way I see it,

740
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,852
we both know we're going to get married in the end.

741
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:53,979
We know we're right together. Yes!

742
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,814
I suppose we do. That's all I need to hear.

743
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,481
I'll telephone tomorrow

744
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:02,943
and we'll settle who tells what to whom and when. Oh, darling.

745
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:19,036
I'm going to wait in the car. Take as long as you like.

746
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:22,205
We'll laugh about this one day. The sooner, the better.

747
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:25,916
Night. Good night.

748
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,875
Tell me it won't change your mind. I can't talk about this tonight,

749
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:33,128
nor for some time to come.

750
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:35,545
And I think Rose and her young man will take up

751
00:47:35,546 --> 00:47:38,380
every scrap of attention we have for weddings.

752
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,965
Please don't say that. Papa!

753
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:43,592
Larry's been in the car since he left the dining room.

754
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:47,387
I'm just coming. I'll say good night, Mrs Crawley.

755
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:49,471
Good night.

756
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,391
Don't blame Larry. He was close to his mother

757
00:47:56,392 --> 00:47:59,268
and hates the thought of a replacement. They both do.

758
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:01,436
You don't need to remind me.

759
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:04,730
The boys take after their mother in every possible way.

760
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:21,448
I'm going to sleep in the dressing room tonight.

761
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:24,159
I'm not cross. I just want to have her with me.

762
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,325
Stay here.

763
00:48:26,326 --> 00:48:30,496
The thing is, I'm pretty sure she won't last till morning

764
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:32,581
and I don't want her to be frightened.

765
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:36,124
Then lay her here between us.

766
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:39,627
And she'll know she has someone who loves her very much next to her.

767
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:47,882
Two people who love her and each other very much on either side.

768
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,843
I only hope I can say the same when my time comes.
