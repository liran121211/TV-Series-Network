2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,080
Are you taking it out? Oh...

3
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,520
Look at this. A man in misery.

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,960
Who's in misery?
The King, according to Robert.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
Why? He has to deal with a Labour
government. Why do you think?

6
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,440
He doesn't look miserable to me.
He just looks like himself.

7
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,800
What is your objection to Mr MacDonald? That
the Prime Minister is the son of a crofter?

8
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,040
I couldn't care less if he was
the son of Fu Manchu.

9
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,440
What worries me is that our
government is committed

10
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,440
to the destruction of people like us
and everything we stand for.

11
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,040
Well, let's wait and see what
happens before we panic.

12
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,880
Where's Edith? She had some old lady
to see in the village.

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,480
What about you? Is everything
settled at the school? What's this?

14
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,320
They swore in Mr Adams' replacement on
the school board. It all went off smoothly.

15
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,440
I thought they might have asked me.
I feel guilty about the school.

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,000
I ought to support it more.

17
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,680
Well, I'm giving away the prizes
this year. Come with me.

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
Barrow, can we clear the tea?

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Lady Edith's missed it, and Nanny
will be down shortly.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,120
I'd better run.
Oh, stay and see them.

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,800
Just as soon as they're able to
answer back.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,760
Sybbie CAN answer back.
True. Why does she call me Donk?

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,320
That game you played - pinning the
tail on the donkey.

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,800
Can't I be Grandpapa or something
dignified?

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm afraid it's Donk for the moment.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
I don't want George to catch it.
Here they are.

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,040
Here's your grandfather now.
Bye-bye, darlings. Goodbye, Donk.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,160
George, come and sit here, darling.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,080
Put it there and I'll see to it.
Oh, don't be like that.

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,680
Ena can manage.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,920
Why should she, any more than me?
We've no proper kitchen maid now, so
we must all muck in.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,960
What's the matter? Daisy's grumbling
because they didn't replace Ivy.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,120
At Skelton Park, they're down to a
butler, a cook, two maids and a
cleaning woman, and that's it.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,520
How on earth does it work?
I couldn't tell you.

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
Why have the people left?

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,480
They prefer to be in factories or
shops. They like the hours better.

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
Oh... I'll forget my head next.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,160
I came in to remind you it's their
34th wedding anniversary on Saturday week,

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,840
so, if you want to do a cake, this
is an advance warning.

40
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,800
I suppose there'll be a dinner of
some sort. Oh, I don't know.

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,440
34 years! If I were to marry this
year, what would life be like in 1958?

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,120
I doubt I'll be troubled by it.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,080
Do you think we'll leave service?

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,400
Well, you'll be fine. You've got Mr
Mason's farm to go to. What about me?

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,000
But could I? What do I know about farming
or ordering supplies or doing accounts?

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,080
Suppose I can't tackle a new life.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,880
If it's all right with you, I've to
tackle tonight's dinner.

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,200
Now, start the salmon pates,
while I do a lemon mayonnaise.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,720
We had good news today. Tim was asked
to be chief of the estate firemen.

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, how nice. Many congratulations.

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Can I give you some more tea?
No, thank you.

52
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
How about you, Marigold? Are you
quite finished?

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,320
I just love to see her gurgling
away, so peaceful and happy.

54
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,960
We've almost forgotten she's not one
of our own, haven't we, Tim?

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,200
She's just lovely. How pretty your
hair is, darling.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,960
I do wonder where she got her
colouring, but I never knew her parents.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
No?
No.

58
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,560
Her mother was an old friend of
Tim's, but I never met either of them.

59
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,960
Oh, is that the time? We mustn't
hold you up.

60
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Good girl.

61
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Good girl.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
I should probably go.
Have you got your teddy?

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Say goodbye.

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Goodbye.

65
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,320
Thank you for... Thank you.

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
She's got a soft spot for you.

67
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Don't be daft.

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,400
I do love this evening light.

69
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Oh, I must tell Lord Merton.

70
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,680
Tease me if you will, but I don't
want to be pursued by him or Lord anyone.

71
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,640
Well, that's a pity - he's asked me
to help him in his courtship.

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,800
What?
He doesn't want to pester you,

73
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
so he's asked if I could give another
luncheon party.

74
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh, dear.
Oh, why the lamentation?

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,160
You don't have to see him.

76
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,840
Well, you make it sound so easy.

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,520
There's nothing simpler than avoiding
people you don't like.

78
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,480
Avoiding one's friends - that's the
real test.

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
But I do like him.
I think he's very nice.

80
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,240
It's just, he wants something from
me that I cannot give.

81
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,160
He just wants what all men want.

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

83
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
I was referring to companionship.

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
As I hope you were.

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,600
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you.

86
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm sorry. It's a letter from Lady
Anstruther again.

87
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,040
Blimey. She doesn't give up easily.

88
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,640
Well, you know me.
'Irresistible' is my middle name.

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Well, was she like this when you
were working for her? Not as bad.

90
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,280
She had to be more discreet with the
other servants.

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,280
Hadn't you better go up to London
and put her out of her misery?

92
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,760
Oh, don't tempt me...

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,960
because I know this: If I weaken,
I'll pay for it.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,200
This sounds very like the kind of
boys' talk I do not allow.

95
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,960
If you can both tear yourselves away
from your smutty deliberations,

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I need you both upstairs.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,840
Where is she?
I hope I'm not late.

98
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,320
No, Carson hasn't come in yet.
That reminds me.

99
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,000
We're to receive a village delegation
tomorrow. I ran into the Postmistress.

100
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
She asked if they might pay us a
visit.

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,720
Mrs Wigan?
What was it that reminded you?

102
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,400
She asked for Carson to be present.
Why? What's it about?

103
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,560
They want to erect some kind of
memorial to the war. What?

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,720
Well, not to the war, but to the men,
the local men, who died in it.

105
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,920
They'll be all over the country.
I suppose they want me as chairman.

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,600
Who was it?
Tony Gillingham.

107
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,320
He had some business up here, and
you told him he could stay.

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,480
When does he want to come?
That's the problem. The 16th.

109
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
And...?
It's our anniversary.

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,480
Oh, that doesn't matter.
Ring him and say yes.

111
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,960
We don't have to.
No. I'd like to see him.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,280
Right. That's dinner, everyone.

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,160
You don't mind Tony coming, do you?
Not if it's what you want.

114
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,080
I'll tell you what I want.
I want to inspire Tony Gillingham
with thoughts of marriage.

115
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,920
So, does that mean Lord Gillingham
wins and Mr Blake can go whistle?

116
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm glad for them. Viscountess
Gillingham - it sounds quite smart.

117
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,320
I think they'll be happy, and it'll
be good for Master George.

118
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,920
It's a big thing, to take on the
task of raising another man's son.

119
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,600
There's nothing to worry about
there. His Lordship's a kind man.

120
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,960
I wish you'd tell me what you know
about those two.

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
I don't know anything.

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,840
What you suspect, then. And don't
deny it, because I've seen you.

123
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,800
You can't stop looking at them when
you think no-one's looking.

124
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,040
Can I join in?
Do you have to?

125
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,120
How was it in York? Did you find
what you were looking for?

126
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,080
I did. Took a bit of a search,
but I think I'm suited.

127
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,280
What's that, then?
Oh, just something.

128
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,000
A group's arriving from the village
tomorrow morning.

129
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,400
Can you get one of the footmen to
bring coffee and something to eat at 11?

130
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,520
Well, find me when you want it.
I can't. I'm in the meeting myself.

131
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,360
That's why I'm telling you now.

132
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,960
What's it for? I don't know, but His
Lordship asked me to be there.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,680
Well, I think it's fantastic.

134
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,440
When did we last have a Prime Minister
who understood the working class? Never.

135
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,920
It's a qualification that is
meaningless in terms of government.

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,040
I'm not sure I can agree with you
there. I think it's important.

137
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,800
Me too. Mr MacDonald will have real
experience of a hard life.

138
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
He knows what most people go
through.

139
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,160
Up the workers.
So, James is a revolutionary now!

140
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,520
He's not a revolutionary. He believes in justice
for the majority. What's wrong with that?

141
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,600
Nothing, but I suppose he can fight
his own battles.

142
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,480
We'll have no fighting here,
thank you very much.

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,160
You wouldn't mind heading
the war-memorial appeal, would you?

144
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,520
I feel a bit embarrassed. I wasn't wounded.
I wasn't even allowed to fight.

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,800
They should ask a man like General
McKee or Johnnie Raymond. Someone who
did their bit.

146
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,440
You're their traditional leader and
they like you to pray with them, in
mourning and in gratitude.

147
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
But I should be praying in the back
row, not the front. That's all.

148
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,520
Please don't think us too forward.
You have no need to worry.

149
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,280
I'm happy to play my part.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,680
But we don't know yet where we want
the memorial to be, m'lord. So...?

151
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,640
Well, if you're to give us a piece of land, you'd
better know where it is before you agree.

152
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm sure I will agree, but is that
why you're here?

153
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
To ask for a piece of land as the
site for this thing?

154
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,960
That's why we're here to see you,
m'lord.

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,240
But we'd also like to offer the
position of Chairman of our Committee -

156
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,920
I'll take over now.
You were saying...?

157
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,840
We'd like Mr Carson to be Chairman
of our Committee.

158
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,640
But surely, His Lordship...?

159
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,960
No, Carson.
They don't want me - they want you.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
I wouldn't put it like that, m'lord,

161
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,160
but Mr Carson knew more of the young
men that died than you did.

162
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,840
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Well, he knew them better.

163
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
That's it. And he's a considerable
figure in the village.

164
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Tea, please.

165
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Carson? What do you say?
I am honoured by the invitation,

166
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,440
but I shall have to think about it.

167
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Of course you will.
But please don't take too long.

168
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,000
Can you put my milk in first,
if that's for me?

169
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,920
Did that come in the second post?
It did.

170
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
From Lady Anstruther.

171
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,920
Not again? What's stoked her up?

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,320
My fault. I shouldn't have sent her
the Valentine.

173
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,400
Yes, but that was -
And I sent her another this year.

174
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,880
How did she know they were from you?
Because I bloody signed them. Oh!

175
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,320
I don't know what I was thinking.
It was supposed to be a joke.

176
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,120
But, well, now it's got out of hand.

177
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,440
Don't worry.

178
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
One day I'll be a good boy and
settle down. We all settle down one day.

179
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
We don't all have the option.

180
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Heavens! I wasn't expecting you.

181
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,880
I've been to see Smithers at Oak
Field Farm. I just thought I'd look
in on my way home.

182
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm glad you did.

183
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,120
I had a delegation from the village,

184
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,440
about the new war memorial
they're putting up.

185
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,880
Oh, they want you to head it?
No.

186
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,160
They've invited Carson to be the
Chairman.

187
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,920
Well, why not you?
The village wanted Carson.

188
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,640
Your father always told the village
what they wanted.

189
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,000
Hmm.

190
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Is it true old Dicky Merton
is paying court to Isobel?

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,880
Isn't it absurd?

192
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,320
Oh, it might be rather fun for her to reinvent
herself as a great lady of the county

193
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
and put us all in our proper place.

194
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Yes, I suppose it would be fun.

195
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
But you don't think she's keen?

196
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Oh, no, far from it. She never tires
of telling me.

197
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,544
Daisy, this came for you in the
post.

198
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,744
Thank you, Mr Carson.
Oh, what is it?

199
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:25,865
Something I ordered.

200
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:28,785
May we know what, O Queen?
Something I need.

201
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,785
Why must it be a secret?

202
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:34,305
Well, it would be a bit sad if she
had no secrets at her age.

203
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,105
Have you made your decision about
the memorial?

204
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:41,385
Oh, not yet.

205
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:45,585
I'm not comfortable being placed
ahead of His Lordship.

206
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,945
You should have seen his face,
Mrs Hughes. He felt very let down.

207
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,545
It's the Committee's choice,
and they've chosen you.

208
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:56,185
And the country's chosen a Labour government,
so people don't always get it right.

209
00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:58,985
What are you afraid of?

210
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:02,825
I feel a shaking of the ground
I stand on.

211
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:07,345
That everything I believe in will be
tested and held up for ridicule
over the next few years.

212
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:11,385
Mr Carson, they've been testing the
system since the Romans left.

213
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,185
Oh, I suppose that's true.

214
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:17,665
The nature of life is not permanence
but flux.

215
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:19,945
Just so...

216
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:22,465
even if it does sound faintly
disgusting.

217
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:38,185
There you are, m'lady.
Madge said you were going out.

218
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,625
We were giving a turn-out to the
blue room,

219
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:43,345
and this had been put on the shelf
with the other books.

220
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:48,305
What is it? A German primer, but the
point is, it's not ours.

221
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:53,985
Mr Gregson's written his name
in the fly-leaf. I see.

222
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:57,465
I nearly gave it to Her Ladyship,
but it seemed more suitable -

223
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:00,305
No. I'm the one who should have it.

224
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,705
Can you please put it on the table
beside my bed?

225
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,745
Of course.
Thank you.

226
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:12,545
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. Thank you, Molesley.

227
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,745
It's good of you to come with us.

228
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:16,825
I must have something to do.

229
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:19,465
Where's your mother?
In the library.

230
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,385
I'm not sure Tom's visiting the
school is such a good idea.

231
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:30,545
He made a friend there of one of the
schoolmistresses when we were in London.

232
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:32,345
What's wrong with that?

233
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:37,265
I don't intend to explain, but I was
rather disappointed in him.
I would have hoped for better.

234
00:14:37,305 --> 00:14:40,105
You're being very mysterious.
Can't I know the details?

235
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,145
You really don't need to.

236
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,225
There you are. How were they?

237
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,825
As dull as ever. They sent love.

238
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,105
What was the meeting like?
Have you accepted?

239
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:54,225
It wasn't me they came to see.
Well, they want me to give them some
land for the thing,

240
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:56,305
but they asked Carson to be the
Chairman.

241
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,665
Carson? Well, how nice.

242
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:02,865
I'm going upstairs to take off
my hat.

243
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,785
Well, she's pleased, anyway.

244
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:10,145
Congratulations.

245
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:18,665
I'm sure you will want me to thank
Lady Rose for consenting to present
the prizes today.

246
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:21,185
We're always glad of interest from
the Abbey.

247
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:23,585
And finally, thank you all for
coming.

248
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,625
It is most appreciated.

249
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:42,505
I'm glad Peter won a prize for
Geography. Well done, him.

250
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:44,545
He didn't get that from his father.

251
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:49,185
Is Mrs Drewe with you? No, she's at
home, looking after the young 'uns.

252
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:51,985
We ought to talk, but not here.

253
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:55,025
Tomorrow. At 11. By the stone barn.

254
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:02,465
You've been away.
I've been on a course.

255
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:05,705
I nearly wrote to tell you, but
I thought it might be presumptuous.

256
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:09,425
Well, I'm pleased to see you back.
That's a relief.

257
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:13,625
I thought I must have earned a black mark, making
you take me up to the house that night.

258
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:16,945
Hello, Miss Bunting.
Lady Rose. Well done.

259
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:21,145
Oh, it's not exactly difficult - giving out prizes.
I think we get thanked too much.

260
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:23,025
But that's the custom, isn't it?

261
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,625
We ought to head off, if we're to be
back before the gong.

262
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:29,105
The Rule of the Gong. It sounds like
life in a religious order!

263
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,425
Goodbye.

264
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:35,145
I'll see you again.
I hope so.

265
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,545
Spratt...

266
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,665
Offer Dr Clarkson some cake.
Then you may go.

267
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,345
Thank you.

268
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,865
I'm afraid serving me is a bit
beneath his dignity.

269
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:03,345
Even Spratt cannot always
live for pleasure.

270
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:07,025
how well do you know
Lord Merton?

271
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:08,865
Erm... I don't, really.

272
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:10,105
Oh.

273
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:14,945
Because I thought you might be
amused by how friendly he and Mrs
Crawley have become.

274
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:19,185
What Mrs Crawley chooses to do with
her private life is her own affair.

275
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:22,105
Oh, dear. I've annoyed you.

276
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,145
No, no, no, I'm not annoyed...

277
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,865
..although I am surprised to learn
that she entertains notions

278
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:30,465
of passing her time at drawing-room
receptions

279
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:32,625
and taking carriage rides in the
park.

280
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:37,145
Well, no-one takes carriage rides in
the park any more.

281
00:17:37,185 --> 00:17:39,505
That's quite gone.

282
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:41,585
I wouldn't know.

283
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:45,305
You ought to meet Lord Merton
properly.

284
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:48,625
Come to luncheon on Saturday.

285
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,705
Mrs Crawley will be here
and so will he.

286
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:53,465
Well, that's quite an honour,
Lady Grantham. Are you sure?

287
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:58,025
Oh, it'll be fun. I'm hoping to
persuade dear Lady Shackleton

288
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,065
to be one of our number.

289
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:09,025
Mama's gone to bed. She wanted an
early night. I might go up too.

290
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,065
Come and sit here for a minute.

291
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:18,705
It doesn't really bother you they
want Carson, does it?

292
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:20,745
They'd be lucky to get him.

293
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,665
Even so, it makes you think.

294
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:26,825
Would a village delegation have
arrived in my grandfather's day

295
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:29,705
to ask his butler to head an appeal?

296
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:33,505
We're not living in your
grandfather's day. No, we are not.

297
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,705
So, they don't want me at the school
and they don't want me for the memorial.

298
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:39,745
Well, I want you.

299
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,905
I think you, Tom and I make a pretty
good team.

300
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:49,505
By the way, I've been looking into
crop rotation and grain sales -

301
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,345
And not every father hears that from
his daughter.

302
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:58,945
Mr Barrow...

303
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,025
I'm tired of waiting, Miss Baxter.

304
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,065
I'm tired of being bullied.

305
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:11,585
I got you this job and you knew what
I wanted in return.

306
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,465
So don't complain about it now.

307
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:22,505
Thank you, Madge. Good night.

308
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:39,425
Did you know Dicky Merton was in hot
pursuit of Isobel?

309
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,985
Mama says she's desperate to throw
him off.

310
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,385
I wonder.
What do you mean?

311
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:48,945
I don't believe your mother would enjoy the
transformation of Isobel into Lady Merton,

312
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:52,865
complete with a living husband, a proper
house and a solid position in the county.

313
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,825
That would not suit Mama at all.

314
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:59,065
Oh, don't be ridiculous. She'd be
thrilled, if that was what Isobel wanted.

315
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:08,145
Daisy, whatever are you doing up at this
hour? I thought you'd gone to bed long ago.

316
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:10,545
I just wanted to look at these.

317
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,585
What is it?

318
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,705
You can tell me.

319
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:19,105
Arithmetic Part 1?
Cost Accounting? What is this?

320
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:20,985
I was rubbish at numbers at school.

321
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:23,825
Well, all the best people were
rubbish at numbers at school.

322
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:28,665
But I don't know anything.
You talk about my working at
Mr Mason's farm, but how?

323
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:31,305
I couldn't balance the books if my
life depended on it.

324
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:35,465
Why do you need to? Because I want
to be grown up, Mrs Patmore.

325
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:38,185
I want responsibility.
I want to be an adult.

326
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,545
I can't just stand here, following
orders, for the rest of my life.

327
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:42,985
Well, I do see that.

328
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:45,785
The trouble is, I'm too stupid to
make out one solitary word.

329
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,585
You're not stupid, Daisy.
Far from it.

330
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,305
Then why can't I understand what's
written? Why can't I follow it?

331
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,065
Because...

332
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:57,385
Because I'm a pig-ignorant idiot.

333
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,425
Good night, Mrs Patmore.

334
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,145
Is this your secret lair?

335
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:37,505
It's not very secret,
but this is where I work.

336
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:40,745
And where you can hide away from the
rest of us?

337
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:45,105
Why do you never ask that
Miss Bunting up to the house?

338
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:46,945
Maybe I will. One day.

339
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:50,465
You live there too, you know.
I'm not sure where I live.

340
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:52,585
I feel sometimes I'm hanging in
mid-air.

341
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,545
Well, you mustn't think we don't
want you to have your own life.

342
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:57,865
I don't think that of Mary or Edith
or you.

343
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:00,105
But it would be hard for Lord and
Lady Grantham.

344
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:03,225
They'd have to get used to it.
Easier said than done.

345
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,265
I'd better get on.

346
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:13,705
So, I have your permission to
accept?

347
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:16,465
You don't need it.
It has nothing to do with your work.

348
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:19,665
No, but I wouldn't want to think it
was disagreeable for you.

349
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,905
We'd be delighted, Carson.

350
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:25,225
You'll be able to steer it through
the perils of village politics.

351
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:29,185
But traditionally, I feel it should
have been you, m'lord.

352
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,225
Maybe this will be a new tradition.

353
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:39,105
I know you hate not to be wanted,
but you're on so many committees.

354
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:42,065
What do you mean,
I hate not being wanted?

355
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,825
You think I'm taking too much
of an interest in Marigold.

356
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:55,305
It's Margie.
She thinks I'm there too often.

357
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:57,985
Because you've got a crush on me.

358
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,505
Well, that's better than the real
reason...

359
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:07,225
The real reason is a good reason to
love a child, m'lady.

360
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:10,545
Mothers should love their children.

361
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,625
How long have you known?
Since you asked me to take her in.

362
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,905
But you're quite safe.

363
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:21,945
It's not my place to judge you, and I
wouldn't, anyway.

364
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:25,145
But I should control my feelings?

365
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:27,985
I could say yes, but I don't believe
it's realistic.

366
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,025
I don't believe you could.

367
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:32,465
Then what are you saying?

368
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:37,065
We need a way for you to live the
truth, without telling the truth.

369
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,370
The die is cast. I've accepted.

370
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:47,292
His Lordship told me to take it.

371
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:49,852
There you are, then.
But he was sad.

372
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:53,012
Not with me, but maybe because
things are changing.

373
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:56,652
Well, they are,
whether we're sad about it or not.

374
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:01,252
I hope you're right about
Lord Gillingham.

375
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,932
What would I have felt if I'd
inherited a family with you?

376
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:05,892
You'd have loved them, I hope.
I would,

377
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:11,052
but I can't deny I'd prefer one of my
own. You'd feel the same.

378
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:14,452
Well, they do say a mother's love is
the strongest love there is.

379
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:17,292
But that's all in God's hands.
There's nothing we can do.

380
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:21,772
I can think of one thing. Mr Bates,
that sort of talk is beneath you.

381
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:23,812
I stand corrected.

382
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:29,252
I'll have it out of you. Fancy a
breath of air before the gong?

383
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:31,292
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

384
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:36,012
What's the matter with you? You've
not said a word all afternoon.

385
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:39,532
I went to the village and telephoned
her, to reason with her,

386
00:24:39,572 --> 00:24:41,572
and I think it were a mistake.

387
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,612
It was never going to put her off.

388
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:45,652
Exactly.

389
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,692
The trouble is, she hates getting
older,

390
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:50,572
and I think that's at the bottom of
it.

391
00:24:50,612 --> 00:24:54,172
Still, it's pathetic for a lady to
be pining over a footman.

392
00:24:54,212 --> 00:24:56,012
Excuse me!

393
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,052
I think it shows very good taste.

394
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:03,892
My dear Lady Shackleton, how kind.
And you're on your way somewhere?

395
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:06,932
I am and I can't stay.
I'm dining with Philip,

396
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,612
and his wife sulks all night if
you're a minute late.

397
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:13,732
You should write a book:
Daughters-In-Law And How To Survive Them.

398
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:16,652
I like yours.
Yes, Cora does very well,

399
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:19,892
even if one cannot always rely on
her instincts.

400
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,292
I'd exchange her for mine in a trice.

401
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:26,372
Tell me: how well do you know
Lord Merton?

402
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:30,772
Oh, you know. We've seen each other
at parties for 40 years.

403
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:35,292
I worry that he's finding things
difficult since his wife died.

404
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:37,772
You're a widow.
You know what he's going through.

405
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:40,732
I suppose so, but I never saw them
as very devoted.

406
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,772
I should have thought he was glad to
be rid of her. I would be.

407
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:46,852
Then his sons are quite difficult.

408
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:48,852
I know what that's like.

409
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:54,212
Could you come to luncheon on
Saturday? Help me cheer him up?

410
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,972
Well, I'd love to.
Oh!

411
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,012
Of course, a single peer with a good
estate won't be lonely long,

412
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:01,052
if he doesn't want to be.

413
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,452
You sound like Mrs Bennett!

414
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:09,652
But what's he on about? He thinks
I know something about Mr Bates.

415
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,852
And do you?
Maybe.

416
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:14,492
Mr Bates may have done something he
wouldn't want known.

417
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,332
Do you mean a crime or...?

418
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:20,012
I'm not sure. I know he took a
journey, which I think he'd deny.

419
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:22,132
Look, I don't want to know any
more...

420
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:26,412
..but a pound to a penny,

421
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,092
Mr Barrow thinks he can use it
against Mr Bates.

422
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:33,692
Report him to Her Ladyship.
She'd soon put a stop to it.

423
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:35,732
I can't.

424
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:38,892
It's complicated, but I can't.

425
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:43,652
What is it?

426
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:47,612
What's what? You're doing something
funny with your head.

427
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:49,892
Sort of... tilting it.

428
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:53,292
I'm not, am I?
How do you think I look?

429
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:55,572
Why? Have you got a rash?

430
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,292
No, I've not got a rash.

431
00:26:58,332 --> 00:27:01,012
That's all right, then.
No, what I meant was...

432
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,772
How old would you say I am?

433
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:08,932
I don't know. Maybe... 52?

434
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:13,372
Oh.
Why? How old are you?

435
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:16,012
51.

436
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:19,852
I've just had the strangest
telephone call.

437
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:22,332
Oh?
Do you remember Lady Anstruther?

438
00:27:22,372 --> 00:27:24,612
You mean Jock Anstruther's widow?
That's it.

439
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:27,572
Her sister's Lady Renton and
her brother's Harry Mountevans.

440
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:31,012
I do remember her. Good-looking and
half Jock's age, and rather silly.

441
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:34,612
Well, silly or not, she's just rung
up and asked herself for tea. Oh.

442
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,452
Do people think we're a public house
on the Great North Road?

443
00:27:37,492 --> 00:27:39,452
It certainly seems like it.

444
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,012
She's driving through the village on
Saturday and would love to see us.

445
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:45,732
What did you say?
Well, it's only tea.

446
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:48,132
Are we doing anything for your
anniversary?

447
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:50,772
What had you in mind?
Well, now that Tony's staying,

448
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:53,892
I thought we could invite some
people, make an evening of it.

449
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,172
Well, you girls ask some friends.

450
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:59,492
I'd like a young party for once,
instead of all those old duffers.

451
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:01,132
Hello.

452
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:03,292
Oh, Mary, I've got an idea.

453
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:11,292
I think it's sharp of Daisy to want
to learn to manage figures.

454
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:13,492
I'm afraid I agree with Mrs Patmore.

455
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:15,852
Why does she need to? She's a cook.

456
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:17,772
Cooks have to balance their budget.

457
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:21,132
She can learn enough for that
without being an expert in algebra.

458
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:22,892
She may not always be a cook.

459
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:25,692
Possibly not, but she won't be
Archimedes, either.

460
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:27,972
Sorry, but I don't think we should
encourage it.

461
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:33,252
I'm going up. I want to read a bit
before I turn out the light.

462
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:35,332
Oh, well done with your studies,
Daisy.

463
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:37,972
It's good to have more than one
string to your bow.

464
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:41,732
It's even better if you don't have
the brain of a kipper. Good night.

465
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:45,732
See? What did I tell you? She's lost
her confidence because of it.

466
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:48,772
And no mathematical skill
is worth that.

467
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:54,132
Why must Lady Anstruther choose
Saturday, of all days?

468
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:55,932
Ought we to invite her to
the dinner?

469
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:58,092
Isn't she staying somewhere else?

470
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:01,252
Tell me tomorrow who's coming, of
your pals. Keep the numbers even.

471
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:04,772
Well, Rose wants to invite a friend
of Tom's. He must feel so outnumbered.

472
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:08,372
Not that brother, I hope.
Someone local. Rose has met her.

473
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,412
So have I. She's quite respectable.

474
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:12,452
I think it would be nice.

475
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:19,492
Looking forward to seeing
Lord Gillingham?

476
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:22,852
I only saw him in London last week,
so I can remember what he looks like.

477
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:25,652
But I expect it's difficult to get
time alone in London.

478
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,492
Less difficult than when
I was a girl.

479
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,092
But yes, it'll be good to see him
here.

480
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:34,812
I haven't made up my mind, if that's
what you're thinking.

481
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:38,852
I wasn't thinking anything, but I
suppose you'll have to some time.

482
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:44,452
The older I get, the more I feel we
do these things very oddly.

483
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:48,412
Even now we must decide whether to
share our lives with someone

484
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:51,492
without ever spending any real time
with them.

485
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:54,212
Let alone... you know.

486
00:29:56,132 --> 00:29:58,252
Of course, these days, some women do.

487
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:00,652
I was talking to Lady Cunard's
daughter last week,

488
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:02,972
and she was so graphic,
I almost fainted.

489
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:07,652
But then, what could be more
important?

490
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:10,972
To make sure that that side of things
is right...

491
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,692
..before we tie ourselves to someone
for ever?

492
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:17,532
I'm afraid I'm too old-fashioned
for you, m'lady.

493
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,772
I need hardly say you're not to
repeat a word to Bates.

494
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:22,812
Of course not, m'lady.

495
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:29,612
What do you make of this?

496
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:31,572
Blimey. What does that mean?

497
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:36,172
As you know, Lord Gillingham arrives today,
but there's been no mention of a valet.

498
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:39,932
There was enough mention of the last
one. Poor Mr Green. A terrible end.

499
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,012
Let's not rake over that now.

500
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:46,092
As I say, His Lordship may have a valet,
but these days we can't be sure, so...

501
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:47,812
Yes, Mr Carson?

502
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:51,572
Not you. Mr Bates, would you keep
an eye on him, if necessary?

503
00:30:51,612 --> 00:30:53,332
Certainly, Mr Carson.

504
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:56,532
Mr Molesley, have you...?
Have I what, Mr Carson?

505
00:30:57,532 --> 00:31:00,652
Er... never mind.

506
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:07,852
Arms down. Relax.

507
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:10,772
I'm sorry. They've only just told me
you were waiting.

508
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:12,812
Oh, I've not been here long.

509
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:15,532
I wanted to see you after I read
your letter.

510
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,812
It wasn't meant to be confusing.

511
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:19,852
No. But why won't you come?

512
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:24,212
Because I don't want to be part of
some sort of a... prank.

513
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:26,172
What prank?

514
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:29,452
I may not have been presented at
Court, Lady Rose,

515
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:33,492
but I do know it's usual to be
invited to dinner by the hostess.

516
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:35,852
And shouldn't Mr Branson have played
a part in it?

517
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:40,132
Lady Grantham asked us to invite some
younger guests to liven up the evening,

518
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:43,852
so Mary and I thought it would be nice
for Tom to have a friend there. That's all.

519
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:46,932
I'm right, then? He doesn't know.

520
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:51,012
No, it would be a surprise for him,
but a nice surprise.

521
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:53,412
And Lady Grantham is aware of this?

522
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:55,852
Completely. She wants you to come.

523
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:01,972
I could have managed Lord Gillingham.
No need to burden Mr Bates with him.

524
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:05,052
I think Mr Carson forgets that
I'm a valet, too.

525
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,772
I know, and it seems a bit ironic
for Mr Bates to dress him.

526
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:12,052
Why is it ironic?
I don't know why I said that.

527
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:14,092
Why did you say it, Miss Baxter?

528
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:18,012
Er... it was rubbish. Nonsense.

529
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:20,652
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late.

530
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:35,732
Oh, how nice. I wanted to call on
you, but I didn't like to be a bother.

531
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:39,012
I've been quite busy lately, helping
with the out-patient clinic.

532
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:41,572
Dr Clarkson.
Oh. Lady Grantham.

533
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:44,572
May I present Dr Clarkson?
I think you know Lord Merton.

534
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:47,132
I think we have met, yes.

535
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:50,052
We were talking about your clinic.
Oh, you mustn't bore him.

536
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:52,972
As a matter of fact, I'd be
interested to - The Lady Shackleton.

537
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,172
Oh, my dear, how prompt you are.

538
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:57,892
Your daughter-in-law has trained you
well.

539
00:32:57,932 --> 00:33:00,052
Now, you remember Lord Merton?

540
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,372
Of course. How are you?

541
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:04,332
And how's that lovely garden of
yours?

542
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:08,612
Oh, still lovely. Largely because
I have the same lovely gardener.

543
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:11,492
I don't think we've met since dear
Lady Merton's funeral.

544
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:14,012
I do hope things are sorting
themselves out.

545
00:33:15,012 --> 00:33:19,092
You've gone to a lot of trouble.
Mmm. I like to help where I can.

546
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:23,372
Oh, Spratt. Shall we go in?

547
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:27,492
Lord Gillingham.
Ah, here he is.

548
00:33:27,532 --> 00:33:31,092
Tony, welcome.
Lovely to see you all.

549
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:33,772
I'm afraid you've missed luncheon.
I ate on the train.

550
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:36,332
A cup of coffee, then?
That would be perfect.

551
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:39,972
Carson, I must congratulate you.

552
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:43,332
They're building a memorial in the
village, and Carson is the Chairman.

553
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:47,772
I like the idea of these things.
To give people a solid focus for
their grief and gratitude.

554
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:52,212
I agree, My Lord. I hope
His Lordship's happy about it.

555
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,892
My being Chairman, I mean.

556
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,972
He is. Or, at any rate, he will be.

557
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:59,772
So, how are the famous pigs doing?
Pretty well.

558
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:01,892
They're earning their keep and more.

559
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:05,612
I'm going out this afternoon, to get
some rabbits for Mrs Patmore. Come with me.

560
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:08,132
I'll find you a gun and you can see
what we've been up to.

561
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:11,732
I'll come too, although I warn you -
I'm not very good at picking up.

562
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:14,292
Well, if I'm shooting,
you won't have to.

563
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:16,332
That I do not believe.

564
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:25,652
Could you spare me for an hour?
I think everything's under control.

565
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:29,932
I just want to run down to the post
office. I won't be long.

566
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:34,692
So, will you be travelling north in
August for the grouse?

567
00:34:34,732 --> 00:34:38,052
You talk as if my sole concern is
the sporting year, Dr Clarkson.

568
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:41,172
The truth is, these days, I hold a
book more often than a 12-bore.

569
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:45,612
You must miss it.
Not particularly. Thank you. Er...

570
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,732
As a matter of fact, he's more
interested in medicine than sport.

571
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:50,612
I find that hard to believe.

572
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:53,332
You sound a little prejudiced.
Not at all.

573
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:56,772
He seems a nice enough example of
the type, I grant you.

574
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:58,812
Er...

575
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:02,972
But, as you say yourself, we're not
members of that tribe, you and I.

576
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:04,612
Spratt...

577
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:06,972
I think Dr Clarkson would like
some coffee.

578
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,452
And don't be such a snob.

579
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:12,452
I'm determined to get you over to
Sheriff Hutton.

580
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:15,972
The children are in the main house
now. I've been banished to a cottage.

581
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:18,012
Did you move before Hubert died?
No.

582
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:21,412
To be honest, I didn't want to go at
all, but I've got used to it.

583
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,932
Apart from anything else, I've never
been warm before!

584
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,172
Morning.

585
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:56,052
So, why did you talk about Mr Bates
and Lord Gillingham's valet?

586
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:58,092
What's the connection? Tell me.

587
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:01,732
There's no point trying to find
Mr Molesley...

588
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:06,132
..because he can't help you now.

589
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:13,052
If that's how you want to play it,

590
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:15,572
I'll give you until upstairs dinner
has finished,

591
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:20,532
after which I will ask to speak to Her Ladyship
and I will tell her your story.

592
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:22,572
Do you hear what I'm saying?

593
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,372
I can't tell you what I don't know.

594
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:28,412
But you know something.

595
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:32,852
And I think it links Mr Bates to the
dead valet.

596
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:49,705
I'm impressed by what I've seen.

597
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,770
Tom's a good partner,
so I'm lucky.

598
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,450
I'm the lucky one.

599
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,650
Tom, what about your American plans?
Oh, I don't know. Nothing's fixed.

600
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,370
But never fear. Mary is more than
ready to manage without me.

601
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,370
That's your man.

602
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,730
So, you're not frightened of being
left on your own to control your Papa?

603
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,930
I understand him better now,
and I think he'd say the same of me.

604
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,850
So he's not fighting all change,
then?

605
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,890
No, but he likes proper research.

606
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,690
You see, I want to improve
how we sell our grain.

607
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,370
If I make a good case for it,
he'll agree.

608
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,370
How positive you are.

609
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,250
I've decided to live in the present
and not spend my life

610
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,850
regretting the past or dreading the
future.

611
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,170
I shall try to follow your example.

612
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,330
Do you dread the future?

613
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,370
Only if I have to live it
without you.

614
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,810
Tony, I do love you, you know.

615
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,570
In my cold and unfeeling way.

616
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,530
Then why not say yes?

617
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,610
I don't want to get it wrong.

618
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,530
I'd like to marry again.
I've come that far.

619
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,690
But I intend to be as happy with my
second husband as I was with my first.

620
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,210
It's bound to be a risk on some
level.

621
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,570
You have to take a chance.

622
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,770
The stable clock's fast.
We ought to get back.

623
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,450
By the way, Bates will look after you,
if you haven't brought a man of your own.

624
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,890
Oh, that's rather a luxury for me
these days. I have no valet now.

625
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,930
Our butler takes care of me at home,
but when I travel I usually fend for myself.

626
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,810
Do you mind?
It makes things simpler.

627
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,170
I'd love to make our lives simpler.

628
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,290
Hm.

629
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,210
It's a nightmare when guests are a
nuisance and I feel so guilty,

630
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,250
but I wasn't sure we were even going
to make it down the drive.

631
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,410
But what happened, exactly?
Well, there was this terrible noise.

632
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,490
A sort of rattle, rattle, bang,
bang.

633
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,330
And then the engine just seemed to
lose its power.

634
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,650
We'll get Tom to take a look at it.
Oh, how kind.

635
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,370
But I think my chauffeur, Weaver,
seems to have it in hand.

636
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,290
Could I just use your telephone

637
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,890
and tell my hosts I won't be able to
get to them tonight?

638
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,170
But what will you do? Oh, we passed
a public house in the village,

639
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,570
and I asked Weaver to see if they
had any rooms.

640
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,890
You can't possibly stay at the pub.
Why not? I'm tougher than I look.

641
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,370
You must stay here. We have people
coming to dinner, so it'll be easy.

642
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,650
Oh, yes, it's perfect.
Oh, that's sweet.

643
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,330
Molesley,
you look very Latin all of a sudden.

644
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,290
Do you have Italian blood?

645
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,130
No, m'lord. Not that I'm aware.
Or Spanish? Or Irish?

646
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,370
James... please tell Mrs Hughes that
Lady Anstruther will be staying.

647
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,370
If she could prepare
Princess Amelia.

648
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,410
Very good, Your Ladyship.

649
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:57,770
Go now. Tell her everything.
You don't know what you're asking.

650
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:02,610
I may not know your story, but I do know
it'll be worse if Mr Barrow tells her first.

651
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,650
Yes. You're right.

652
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,370
Thank you.

653
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,570
Why is she here?
They don't know her, do they?

654
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:24,370
Well, if they do, she never told me.
What are you going to say to her?

655
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,410
Who says I'll get the chance to say
anything? Go on. Have it out.

656
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,570
She's playing with you
like a cat with a vole.

657
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:36,130
James... did you know about
Lady Anstruther's visit?

658
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,890
No, Mr Carson. Why should I?
Didn't you work for her one time?

659
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,250
I'm sure I've got a reference
from her somewhere.

660
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,330
But that was quite a while back,
wasn't it?

661
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,370
Well, she's made extra work for
everyone.

662
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,410
That's all I know.

663
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,530
What do you mean, you need to tell
me something before Barrow does?

664
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,570
Mr Barrow wants to tell you about
something in my past, m'lady.

665
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,770
I've a secret, you see.
A bad secret.

666
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,370
I don't understand. What secret?
How does he know it?

667
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,690
I was a friend of his sister's
when we were young.

668
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,210
But if he knew something wrong about you,
why would he put you forward for the job?

669
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,410
I think you had better tell me.

670
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,650
Very well.

671
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,850
A few years ago, I worked in London,
as a lady's maid

672
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:27,730
for a Mrs Benton who... lived with her
husband in Ovington Square.

673
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,530
Go on.

674
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,450
I was there for about six months,
and then I...

675
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,210
And then you what?

676
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,250
I...

677
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,890
..took some jewellery belonging to
the mistress.

678
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,810
A necklace, a couple of bracelets,
some rings.

679
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,530
You took them?

680
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,410
I tried to make it look like a
burglary, but it didn't work.

681
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,450
And Mrs Benton reported the theft?

682
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,890
They took me up a few hours later.

683
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,930
My fingerprints were everywhere.

684
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,730
And to make it worse...

685
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,250
..I never gave the stolen things
back.

686
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,290
Why not?

687
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,610
Because, by then, I didn't have them.

688
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,570
What happened?

689
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,210
I went to prison. For three years.

690
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,770
Thank you, Baxter.

691
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,810
Very good, m'lady.

692
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,730
What do you make of our
mysterious visitor?

693
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,450
Tom said he went to look at the car
and could find nothing wrong.

694
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,130
Maybe the chauffeur mended it.
Maybe.

695
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,170
We ought to go down.

696
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,090
Will there be anything else?

697
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,090
I don't think so. Thank you.
It's been quite a treat.

698
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,730
You don't travel with a valet
these days, m'lord?

699
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,210
No, no. When Green died,
I never replaced him.

700
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,330
We were all shocked by the death of
Mr Green so soon after he was here.

701
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,370
Yes. Of course.

702
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,490
Had he been with you long?
Not very long, no.

703
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,210
Right. Thank you.

704
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,210
Well...?
I told her.

705
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,290
Now, I'm not asking what you said, but I
want to be sure that you held nothing back.

706
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,730
Good.

707
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,490
How was she?
I don't know.

708
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,930
Shocked, but not unkind.

709
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,250
Then His Lordship walked in,
so that was that.

710
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,770
The point is, if she allows you to
stay,

711
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,530
you're here in a truthful way and
not in a lie.

712
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,570
And if I'm not allowed to stay?

713
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,570
Well, you're still not caught
in a lie.

714
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,610
That's what matters.

715
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,290
I will tell you the story one day.

716
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:12,610
But I'm loath to... forfeit your
good opinion, and I know I would.

717
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,650
No, you won't.

718
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,770
You don't trust me yet,
but I'm on your side.

719
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,170
Mr Molesley, I need that up in the
servery. Now.

720
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,210
Yes, Mr Carson.

721
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,090
Jimmy... I ought to scold you.

722
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:37,610
Why did you ignore my letters?
You're a very naughty boy.

723
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,610
Show Her Ladyship where to find the
drawing room, James.

724
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,530
Of course.

725
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,570
Will you come this way, m'lady?

726
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,450
I feel so guilty, pushing into
a family celebration.

727
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,530
You'd be an ornament at any
gathering. Oh, how nice. Thank you.

728
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,130
No cocktails?
I thought everyone had them now.

729
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,650
Not at Downton. Our butler tried
them once and he hasn't recovered.

730
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,650
Oh, look at your parents.

731
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,290
34 years. I'd never manage it.

732
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,490
That's the advantage of an older
husband. One gets an early release!

733
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,530
Miss Sarah Bunting.

734
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,570
What on earth is she doing here?

735
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,050
I asked her. Cora said I could.

736
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,810
Have I done something wrong?
She's the teacher I told you about.

737
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,650
After her behaviour while we were in London,
I don't think she's a suitable guest.

738
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:40,130
Let me introduce you.
Kitty Colthurst. Sarah Bunting.
Miss Bunting's a teacher.

739
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,930
Oh, golly! How clever.
What do you teach?

740
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,730
The usual things. Writing.
Mathematics.

741
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,370
Crikey. Writing's almost beyond me,
and I wouldn't know where to start
with mathematics!

742
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,610
Well, then, you must marry someone
rich enough to ensure you never need to.

743
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,930
Oh...
What are you doing here?

744
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,770
Lady Rose invited me.
Rose, did you ask Lord Grantham?

745
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,810
Wasn't Cora's permission enough?

746
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,290
How are you?
I'm exhausted.

747
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,530
Two parties in one day
is too much for me.

748
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:19,090
Was your luncheon a success?
You must ask Cousin Isobel.

749
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,490
We've cast the net wide tonight.

750
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,090
Can't Tom have a friend of his own?
Oh, of course.

751
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,810
But it's time he decided whether he
is fish, flesh, fowl or good red herring.

752
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:32,970
Well, I think it's nice to see
an intelligent face here.

753
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,410
Miss Bunting has been shocking us
with her support for the Prime Minister.

754
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:42,530
But surely, most of the country must support
him, or he wouldn't be Prime Minister.

755
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,210
There is an unanswerable logic in
that. Oh, quite.

756
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,770
There's an alliance that does not
bode well.

757
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,090
I quite agree with you.
Aren't you being very snobbish?

758
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:57,690
We're being realistic - something
your generation has such trouble with.

759
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,650
Her chauffeur says there's nothing
wrong with the car that he could
find, so there's a mystery.

760
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,530
See? She's here to see you.
I don't know what she wants.

761
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,690
Don't you? Because I do.
It's embarrassing.

762
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,210
I have a feeling it could get a lot
more embarrassing

763
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,450
if you don't find a way to keep her
quiet.

764
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,650
Take that.

765
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,810
Marriage is a lottery, as we are
often told,

766
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,570
but I am a man who has drawn
a winning ticket.

767
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,530
I have been awarded a bumper prize:

768
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:34,010
beauty, brains, a heart,
a conscience, all in one.

769
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:39,050
I give you my Cora, the best
companion in the world.

770
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,090
Mama.
Lady Grantham.

771
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,410
What a tribute.
Indeed. If only it were true!

772
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,450
What's happened to Molesley's hair?

773
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:55,210
Carson, Lady Mary tells me that
you're to lead the Memorial Committee.

774
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,290
That is so, madam. Yes.
You'll drive it splendidly.

775
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,490
Rose, is that friend of yours
terribly clever?

776
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,450
She's Tom's friend, not mine,
but I think so. Yes.

777
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,570
She certainly thought I was
terribly stupid.

778
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,930
Well, let's not shoot her down
for that.

779
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,730
No, thank you.

780
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,410
Do you know that footman?
Yes, he used to work for me.

781
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,690
It's always nice to see
a friendly face.

782
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,290
Especially a friendly, pretty face.

783
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,610
I'm not convinced these memorials
are a good idea,

784
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,890
but I suppose that's a different
issue.

785
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,010
Why not? Won't they give people
a focus for their sorrow?

786
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,330
And a reminder of the sacrifices
that were made.

787
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,530
If it were a memorial service,
then I might agree,

788
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,450
but a stone edifice on the green,

789
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,970
to remind us for ever of death and a
pointless war - what's the good of that?

790
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,970
To say nothing of the waste of
money.

791
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,610
Forgive me, but you're talking
nonsense.

792
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:57,130
Forgive me, but I suppose
she's allowed an opinion.

793
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,650
Not that opinion. Not in this house.
I think what she means is -

794
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,090
She is here as your friend,
so of course you must defend her.

795
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,810
But was the war worth fighting?

796
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,490
What did it achieve, beyond the
Russian Revolution?

797
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,650
Millions of men dead and no more
'justice' than there was before.

798
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,890
You are wrong, both of you.

799
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,650
But we must strive to keep things
light.

800
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,130
It's a pity they didn't want you
on their Committee.

801
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,770
You put up a stout defence of
their intentions.

802
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,210
They do want His Lordship on the
Committee.

803
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,810
Forgive me, My Lord.

804
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,970
I'd have told you later, but they
held a meeting this afternoon,

805
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:38,290
and they would like you
as their patron.

806
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,170
Oh, how nice. I dare say that was
always their plan.

807
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,210
I dare say it was, Your Ladyship.

808
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,250
I should be glad to accept.

809
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,290
Now, if you can all put
your swords away,

810
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,810
perhaps we can finish our dinner
in a civilised manner.

811
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:55,650
But I admire it, when young people
stand up for their principles.

812
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,690
Principles are like prayers.

813
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:01,850
Noble, of course,
but awkward at a party.

814
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:10,681
James, did my eyes deceive me,

815
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:14,041
or did Lady Anstruther pass you
a note during dinner?

816
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:17,441
Yes, Mr Carson.
Can I see it?

817
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:22,961
He's thrown it away.
She just wanted to remind him that
he once worked for her, Mr Carson.

818
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,601
Even so, it's most irregular.

819
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,801
But it wasn't his fault, was it? He
could hardly slap her hand away.

820
00:50:27,841 --> 00:50:30,641
Get that up to the drawing room.

821
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:36,321
I gather from Mr Molesley that you
gave the good news to His Lordship.

822
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:39,601
Ah, that is correct.
How did you get them to agree?

823
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:42,201
I said I wouldn't serve if they
didn't make him Patron.

824
00:50:42,241 --> 00:50:43,881
And have you told him that?

825
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:46,561
He doesn't need to know everything,
Mrs Hughes.

826
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:48,841
Nobody has to know everything.

827
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:53,921
I've enjoyed myself.

828
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:57,601
Both gatherings were interesting,
in their different ways.

829
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:00,561
You get on well with Lord Merton.
I know that.

830
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:04,641
I do, but Cousin Violet had other
plans for him at luncheon.

831
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:06,121
Where is Granny?

832
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:09,201
She said goodbye to your mother, but
she wanted to slip away.

833
00:51:09,241 --> 00:51:12,041
The day of parties had taken
its toll.

834
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:14,961
Before I go, I want to meet the
staff downstairs.

835
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:17,361
You don't think you've made enough
of a statement?

836
00:51:17,401 --> 00:51:20,881
What about you?
I know. I got a bit carried away.

837
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:22,841
I thought you were splendid.
Cheer up.

838
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:25,241
You're putting quite a dampener on
the evening.

839
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:28,921
Really? I thought only imbeciles
were happy all the time.

840
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:32,841
Here she comes.
The Boudicca of the North Riding.

841
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,801
Thank you so much for having me.

842
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,601
It was a pleasure.
Wasn't it, Robert?

843
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:41,441
I want to thank your cook before I
go, and the other servants.

844
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:45,321
I'm afraid they'll be sitting down to
supper, and we don't like to disturb them.

845
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:48,721
I won't be more than a minute.
Of course you must go down.

846
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:50,761
They'd be delighted.

847
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:54,801
I assume you heard the way she spoke
to me at dinner.

848
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:58,801
Of course, but how does it help to
answer rudeness with rudeness?

849
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:05,001
Is everything satisfactory, m'lord?
No, it is not.

850
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:09,721
And can you please keep Molesley in the
kitchens until his hair stops turning blue?

851
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:17,921
What are you doing?

852
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:20,961
Setting out the breakfast trays for
Her Ladyship and Lady Mary.

853
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:22,961
Not Lady Rose and Lady Edith?

854
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:27,041
Unmarried young ladies eat breakfast
in the dining room. Oh, do they?

855
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,841
Thank you again, and I'm glad to
meet you.

856
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:32,081
I felt I had to put faces to
his stories.

857
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:34,841
What stories are those?
Oh, that's a dangerous question.

858
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:36,561
We may not like the answer!

859
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:40,521
Do you work in the school? I teach mathematics,
handwriting and spelling, mainly.

860
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:42,881
You must be so clever.
I wouldn't say that.

861
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:45,321
Come and meet the others.
Goodbye.

862
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,801
That's such a different path.
It is,

863
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:51,121
but it doesn't mean it's better than
the one you've chosen.

864
00:52:52,721 --> 00:52:55,641
Your Ladyship, might I have a word?

865
00:52:59,161 --> 00:53:01,641
I'm very sorry to say it,

866
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:05,561
but I've learned something that
makes me feel both responsible and guilty.

867
00:53:05,601 --> 00:53:07,601
Would this have to do with Baxter?

868
00:53:08,441 --> 00:53:12,681
Because, if it concerns her criminal
record, then I know all about it.

869
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:14,601
Do you, m'lady?

870
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:17,641
What I don't understand is why you
placed a convicted felon

871
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:19,721
in my household, in my bedroom,

872
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:22,241
when you knew every detail
of her past.

873
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:24,841
I wanted her to have another chance.

874
00:53:24,881 --> 00:53:28,241
Don't you think that should have
been my decision, in my own house?

875
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:30,041
Yes, m'lady. Perhaps it should.

876
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:35,841
So... why tell me now? Because, if you have
been using your knowledge against her,

877
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:38,001
I'll have to consider your future
here.

878
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,041
Indeed, whether you have one at all.

879
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,721
I just thought I'd been wrong and
you ought to know.

880
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:45,761
I see. Well, now I do.

881
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:48,201
Good night.

882
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:58,281
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

883
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:04,521
Has Miss Bunting gone?

884
00:54:06,281 --> 00:54:10,081
Yes. She got a lift down to the
village with Mrs Crawley.

885
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,121
That was nice of her.

886
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:20,801
I wanted to apologise, for arguing
with you at dinner.

887
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,121
You were nothing, compared to her.

888
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:25,081
She has her views - that's true.

889
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:27,881
But I must confess, they remind me
of how I used to feel.

890
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:31,961
Is that what you want, Tom?
To go back, when you've come so far?

891
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:34,201
I've come a long way from who I was.
That's true.

892
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:36,241
And is it a bad thing?

893
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:45,161
- We're not lovers, you know.
- What?

894
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:47,001
That time when you were in London,

895
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:50,121
you thought that we'd got up to
something. We never did.

896
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:55,001
As Sybil's father, this is not an
easy conversation for me,

897
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,961
but if I was wrong, then I am sorry.

898
00:54:59,441 --> 00:55:02,881
The truth is, I worry less about that

899
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:07,041
than if Miss Bunting is taking you
back into the role of rebel and hater.

900
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,001
I'm not a hater.

901
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:12,041
I don't hate anyone.

902
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,561
Least of all you.

903
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:21,281
Well, that is a more cheerful note to
say 'good night' on.

904
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:28,601
Isis!

905
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:31,201
But why didn't you give the jewels
back?

906
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,201
You say you didn't have them by
then, but who did?

907
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:37,081
More than that,
why did you do it at all?

908
00:55:37,121 --> 00:55:40,521
You don't strike me as being greedy.
You were working. You were earning.

909
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:42,681
Did you dislike Mrs Benton?
Was she harsh?

910
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:46,681
No, m'lady. She was a kind woman.
That only makes it more mysterious.

911
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:50,881
I won't start concocting excuses for
myself. There are no excuses.

912
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:54,241
There may not be excuses, but there
is missing information.

913
00:55:57,201 --> 00:56:00,321
You've shocked me, Baxter.
Profoundly. I can't deny it.

914
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:06,441
You have every reason, m'lady. So, am
I to take it that I am dismissed?

915
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:11,201
Your work is excellent, and I have
never sacked a servant

916
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,441
that gave me no cause for complaint.

917
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:18,441
Have I your word you will not commit
this crime again?

918
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:22,521
I will never commit any crime again.
Not as long as I live.

919
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:27,281
You may stay until I make
a decision.

920
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:29,801
I cannot tell you how long
that will be,

921
00:56:29,841 --> 00:56:32,641
and I do not at all promise
I'll keep you on.

922
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,241
No.

923
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:36,281
Very well.

924
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,881
I think we should leave it there
for now.

925
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:53,761
I hope we don't have to see too much
more of Miss Bunting.

926
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:56,001
Lady Rose told Madge she liked her.

927
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,241
And she seemed nice when she came
downstairs.

928
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:02,401
Maybe, but she makes Papa say things
he doesn't mean,

929
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:05,041
and I know he hates himself for it
afterwards.

930
00:57:06,921 --> 00:57:08,921
Mr Molesley...

931
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:13,481
I do not know why you have treated
your hair with a special substance -

932
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:15,201
Well, I -
But I can only say

933
00:57:15,241 --> 00:57:18,401
that the effect on your appearance
is not what you would have it.

934
00:57:18,441 --> 00:57:21,111
Take steps, Mr Molesley. Take steps.

935
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:24,419
You will remain below stairs
until you do.

936
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:39,893
Well... So, Lady Mary's not quite so
ladylike, after all.

937
00:58:40,492 --> 00:58:42,492
Me next.

938
00:58:49,053 --> 00:58:52,293
You think I'm mad, don't you?
It doesn't matter what I think.

939
00:58:52,332 --> 00:58:55,732
Maybe she just wants to talk.
Maybe I'm the missing Tsarevich!

940
00:58:55,772 --> 00:58:59,172
The trouble is, I can't resist it.
Not when it's offered on a plate.

941
00:58:59,212 --> 00:59:01,012
Well, you're not alone there.

942
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:03,012
Now, if you can stay with her
until three,

943
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:05,572
you'll get back to your room
without being noticed.

944
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:10,493
I'll watch until you're in there. If you hear
me speak, just keep walking past her door.

945
00:59:11,693 --> 00:59:13,733
Thanks, Mr Barrow.

946
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:15,773
Thomas. I mean it.

947
00:59:17,653 --> 00:59:19,733
You're a real pal.

948
00:59:19,772 --> 00:59:21,772
Well, I try to be.

949
00:59:33,732 --> 00:59:36,932
But, Tony... you really shouldn't be
in here.

950
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:40,092
Of course I shouldn't.
Why are you, then?

951
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:43,053
Because you're in love with me.
Am I?

952
00:59:43,092 --> 00:59:47,172
Well, you said so yourself. You were
torn between me and Charles Blake,

953
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:49,972
but I think you've decided
and I'm the winner.

954
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:53,012
Well, thank goodness that's settled.

955
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:56,892
The trouble is, you want to be sure.

956
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:01,812
Well, surer than the customs
of well-bred courtship will allow.

957
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:04,652
Go on.
I want you to come away.

958
01:00:04,692 --> 01:00:07,332
Just for a week, maybe less.

959
01:00:07,372 --> 01:00:12,772
But on our own, and we'll spend
the days... talking.

960
01:00:14,532 --> 01:00:16,452
And the nights?

961
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:18,492
We'll spend those together, too.

962
01:00:20,372 --> 01:00:22,372
I want us to be lovers, Mary.

963
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:28,012
I want us to know everything there
is to know about each other.

964
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:31,732
And then after that, I believe you
will be sure.

965
01:00:32,812 --> 01:00:35,332
If Papa was here,
he'd hit you on the nose.

966
01:00:35,372 --> 01:00:37,292
I'm trying to convince you
to marry me.

967
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:39,652
That's not the normal purpose of
seducers.

968
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:41,692
I don't think he'd see it that way.

969
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:45,132
What do you say to my scandalous
suggestion?

970
01:00:48,452 --> 01:00:50,452
No-one must ever find out.

971
01:01:10,012 --> 01:01:11,772
Fire!
What?

972
01:01:11,812 --> 01:01:14,052
Fire!
Oh, my God. George!

973
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,452
I've got Sybbie and George.

974
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:35,932
Thank God! Mary, you take them.

975
01:01:35,972 --> 01:01:38,292
Tony, go with her. Tom, come with me.

976
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:40,612
You know where the sand buckets
are kept.

977
01:01:42,012 --> 01:01:44,332
Good god! Barrow, is she all right?

978
01:01:44,372 --> 01:01:47,132
I think so, m'lord.
We must get her outside.

979
01:01:48,492 --> 01:01:50,492
Quickly, Tom!

980
01:01:52,412 --> 01:01:53,892
Tom, get the hose!

981
01:01:53,932 --> 01:01:56,612
Rose, wake Mrs Hughes and the maids.
She'll do the rest.

982
01:01:56,652 --> 01:02:00,012
We must alert the firemen. Who knows
where to find Drewe's number?

983
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:01,732
I do.
And save the dog!

984
01:02:01,772 --> 01:02:05,292
Barrow, hurry up! Get her away from
the smoke. I'll check the bedrooms.

985
01:02:05,332 --> 01:02:07,972
Let me check the rooms, m'lord.
Now, man!

986
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:14,412
Fire!

987
01:02:19,212 --> 01:02:20,772
There's a fire.

988
01:02:20,812 --> 01:02:23,172
Well, I'll see you both downstairs.

989
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:27,452
Everybody outside. There's a fire.

990
01:02:27,492 --> 01:02:30,892
James? James? Where's James?

991
01:02:30,932 --> 01:02:33,012
Peter, look in the bathroom
for James.

992
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:35,052
Mr Molesley, hurry along, please.

993
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:45,132
Here, Tom!

994
01:02:49,452 --> 01:02:51,452
Mrs Patmore, do be careful.

995
01:02:52,052 --> 01:02:54,692
Don't worry. Don't worry.

996
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,212
We'll take over now, m'lord.

997
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:12,932
Thank you.

998
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:18,292
How are you feeling?
All right, I think.

999
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:20,132
But I've been terribly stupid.

1000
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:22,172
Don't worry about that now.

1001
01:03:22,892 --> 01:03:26,052
Lord Grantham, I may sneak away
before breakfast.

1002
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:28,252
Would you forgive me?
I have quite a way to go.

1003
01:03:28,292 --> 01:03:30,172
Perhaps that would be a good idea.

1004
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:32,212
M'lord...

1005
01:03:33,972 --> 01:03:37,372
Barrow, we have to thank you -

1006
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:41,572
for raising the alarm and rescuing
Lady Edith so bravely.

1007
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:43,892
What were you doing on the gallery?

1008
01:03:43,932 --> 01:03:47,492
Oh, just keeping an eye on things.
Well, thank goodness you were!

1009
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:51,172
I was angry with you before and
I was tempted to take it further,

1010
01:03:51,212 --> 01:03:55,172
but I accept that you have earned
our goodwill by your actions tonight.

1011
01:03:55,212 --> 01:03:57,212
Thank you, m'lady.

1012
01:04:03,252 --> 01:04:05,532
What's going on? What's happening?

1013
01:04:05,572 --> 01:04:07,332
Don't worry. It's almost over.

1014
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:10,372
Mr Bates wanted to come, to see you
were safe. We were so worried.

1015
01:04:10,412 --> 01:04:14,892
We're fine. Lady Edith chose to set
fire to her room, but we're fine.

1016
01:04:14,932 --> 01:04:17,012
I'll see if there's anything
I can do.

1017
01:04:17,372 --> 01:04:20,052
He's calmed down now, but he was in
a real state.

1018
01:04:21,332 --> 01:04:24,012
He does get so worked up about
things.

1019
01:04:24,052 --> 01:04:26,052
I can imagine.

1020
01:04:30,172 --> 01:04:32,252
I don't wish to be harsh,
but I have a feeling

1021
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:34,692
James would be better
employed elsewhere.

1022
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:37,212
Oh?
Please don't ask me why I think so,

1023
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:41,252
but I suspect his ambitions rather outstrip
what a career as a footman will yield.

1024
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:43,772
As Your Lordship wishes.
Give him a good reference.

1025
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:45,572
We don't want it talked about.

1026
01:04:45,612 --> 01:04:47,572
Understood, m'lord.

1027
01:04:47,612 --> 01:04:50,812
All clear now, m'lord. No real
damage beyond Lady Edith's bedroom.

1028
01:04:50,852 --> 01:04:52,852
Well, that's something.

1029
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:56,772
We can all go back inside!

1030
01:04:56,812 --> 01:04:58,812
The excitement is over.

1031
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:06,052
Might Lady Edith sleep in His
Lordship's dressing room tonight, m'lady?

1032
01:05:06,092 --> 01:05:07,612
Since the bed's made up.

1033
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:08,892
Of course.

1034
01:05:08,932 --> 01:05:11,652
I'm just going to thank the firemen,
Papa. Right.

1035
01:05:18,492 --> 01:05:21,772
Have you had any ideas?
Yes, and it's a simple one.

1036
01:05:21,812 --> 01:05:25,012
You are going to take a great
interest in little Marigold, m'lady.

1037
01:05:25,052 --> 01:05:28,012
Of course. We just need to introduce
the notion carefully,

1038
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:30,132
so everyone accepts and believes it.

1039
01:05:33,252 --> 01:05:35,972
You're to sleep in His Lordship's
dressing room tonight,

1040
01:05:36,012 --> 01:05:38,412
and we'll see what can be saved
tomorrow.

1041
01:05:38,452 --> 01:05:40,452
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

1042
01:05:57,392 --> 01:06:00,172
You have heard the voice of
His Majesty King George V.

1043
01:06:00,258 --> 01:06:01,578
I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

1044
01:06:01,618 --> 01:06:04,778
And the mist is clearing around the
lithe figure of Tony Gillingham?

1045
01:06:04,818 --> 01:06:07,498
You do know she's a thief?
There must be more to it.

1046
01:06:07,538 --> 01:06:09,738
Mrs Crawley has been distracted
lately,

1047
01:06:09,778 --> 01:06:12,138
with Lord Merton frisking around
her skirts.

1048
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:15,258
I didn't kill him personally.
I didn't shoot the Imperial Family.

1049
01:06:15,378 --> 01:06:17,404
Is this what they call a lively
exchange of views?

1050
01:06:17,405 --> 01:06:52,779
