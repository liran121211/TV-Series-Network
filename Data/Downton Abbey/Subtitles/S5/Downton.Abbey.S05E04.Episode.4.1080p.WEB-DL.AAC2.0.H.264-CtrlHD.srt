1
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,540
Oh, Mr Barrow, you're back.

2
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:00,438
I'm afraid you've missed luncheon,
but you're in time to help upstairs.

3
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:03,750
Maybe there's something left. Don't bother. I'm not hungry.

4
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,808
Charming as ever! How's your father doing?

5
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:10,442
Oh, much better, as it happens. In fact, he's quite well again.

6
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:12,616
That's good news. Yes. It is.

7
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:18,540
You remember we're meeting Mr Wavell at three? Pip's Corner.

8
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,711
Yes, but I don't see the point in it, since I'm not going to agree.

9
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:24,120
He's driven all the way from Leeds.

10
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,780
I had a letter from your father. He says he's in London for a visit.

11
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:30,805
Shrimpie's in England? Have you made any plans to see him?

12
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,254
Not yet. He wonders if you might let him stay here.

13
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:36,287
Of course, whenever he wants.

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,467
Is Susan with him? No.

15
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:41,659
Their time's up soon and she couldn't face another voyage.

16
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,573
Where will they send him, do you think? After Bombay.

17
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:49,852
How are your Russians getting on?

18
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,030
Oh, it's so sad.

19
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:57,358
They talk about the old days - dances at the Winter Palace,
picnics on the banks of the Neva -

20
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,106
but there are holes in their shoes,
and they've got no money for food.

21
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:03,739
This is where Tom says it serves them right.

22
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,742
Well, I don't approve of how things were managed in Russia,

23
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:10,593
but I'm still sorry for people who have
to make a new life in a foreign land.

24
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:14,770
Honestly, Papa, every time you challenge Tom,
you sound much more unreasonable than he is.

25
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:16,508
Do I?

26
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:19,781
How's your old beau managing, Mama? Prince Thingummyjig.

27
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,967
He is not my old beau.

28
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,503
Your father would have called out any man who said such a thing.

29
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,734
Even so, I do hope you see him again. Poor old boy.

30
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,943
You don't know anything about it.

31
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:38,806
How far would the houses stretch?

32
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,837
Well, the whole field, really.

33
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:45,204
But why can't they be built in a row, like the other streets?

34
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:49,951
They'd sell more quickly as separate dwellings,
and we'd get a percentage of the sales.

35
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:53,373
So, we're paid once, and in return the field is lost,

36
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,830
the village is spoiled and Mr Wavell
moves on in search of his next victim.

37
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,890
Why didn't you tell them we were coming here today?

38
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:12,729
Oh... They'll find out as soon as Rose gets home.

39
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:16,183
I didn't want to be a 'topic' for the rest of luncheon.

40
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,203
But what are we here for'?

41
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:21,358
Well, somethings been troubling me.

42
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,471
Oh, why on earth didn't we get a taxi from the station?

43
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,421
We must be mad.

44
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:30,176
Well, we'll get a taxi home - that's for sure.

45
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,195
It's saying it's in the crypt.

46
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:41,989
Oh, Isobel, I didn't think it would be like this.

47
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,904
No, neither did I.

48
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:59,861
Aunt Violet? Mrs Crawley? You never said you were coming.

49
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:01,797
We wanted to surprise you.

50
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,866
Well, you've succeeded.

51
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,828
Ah, there he is.

52
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:13,550
I must be the last person you expected to see.

53
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,576
No. I thought you would come.

54
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,797
I've brought my cousin, Mrs Crawley.

55
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:24,327
Do you remember Rostov?

56
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,395
Count Rostov, I think.

57
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:29,340
Thank you. Yes. Please, ladies. Please.

58
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:38,602
I'm sorry I didn't say very much...

59
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,513
Thank you... at Downton.

60
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:43,356
But I was... I was so surprised.

61
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,781
You haven't changed. I have.

62
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:50,629
It's true.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,887
Then, you were the young and beautiful Countess of Grantham,

64
00:04:54,894 --> 00:05:00,101
turning eyes in a ballroom or out in your carriage.

65
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:05,412
Now you are the great lady - imperious, magnificent.

66
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,569
But these are two sides of the same coin.

67
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,295
Your life has not much altered in half a century.

68
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,945
It doesn't seem so to me.

69
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:20,845
Whereas the handsome and powerful Prince Kuragin,

70
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,019
with his thousands of acres and his golden palaces...

71
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:30,015
That man does not exist. Not any more.

72
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:36,417
Ah, Mr Molesley. I've put out some silver to be cleaned.

73
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,558
I'd be grateful if you could see to it.

74
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,639
Very good, Mr Carson. I was looking for Mr Barrow.

75
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:43,467
He's gone out. Precisely.

76
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,529
But then I thought: No. This is down to Mr Molesley.

77
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,709
After all, he is the First Footman.

78
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,207
I have thought a good deal about what you said the other day,

79
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:08,072
when I asked after the Princess.

80
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,894
That I don't know how or where she is?

81
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:12,946
It's true.

82
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,735
We were arrested together,

83
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:23,764
and when I came out of prison,
I heard she'd been exiled a year earlier.

84
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:27,097
There must be someone in authority who - Who?

85
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,783
The Soviet Ambassador.

86
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:34,943
Do you think he cares where Princess
Irina Kuragin is presently lodged?

87
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,239
Well, what about the Foreign Office?

88
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,728
Do they help the losing side in any revolution? No.

89
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,774
You mustn't give up hope.

90
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:45,724
When you go through a storm like ours,

91
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:49,378
you give up hope quite early on in the proceedings.

92
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:56,695
I agree. Hope is a tease, designed to prevent us accepting reality.

93
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,942
Oh, you only say that to sound clever.

94
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,998
I know.

95
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,057
You should try it.

96
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:13,159
I want to call on the blacksmith. I'll see you back at the house.

97
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,657
Mrs Patmore?

98
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:22,621
Oh, good afternoon, m'lord. M'lady.

99
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:27,078
I wish I knew what that was about.

100
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:31,280
And why the funny look when I asked after Shrimpie at luncheon?

101
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:35,134
I suspect he's come to tell Rose they're getting a divorce.

102
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:38,250
Are you serious? I'm afraid so.

103
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:40,434
He's hinted at it in his letters, apparently,

104
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,534
and I gather things have not been improving.

105
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,372
That's the end of his career.

106
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,886
Well, the Martboroughs have survived divorce.

107
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:51,305
Well, the Martboroughs are very rich. Shrimpie hasn't got a bean.

108
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,602
People will drop them like hot potatoes.

109
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:57,571
Will we drop Shrimpie? Susan's your cousin, not him.

110
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,957
No, I won't take sides, whatever Susan wants.

111
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:11,575
Would you give me a hand with these?

112
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:17,427
When are you leaving? Lady Mary wants to get the eight o'clock.

113
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:21,025
She's going to a dress show with Lady Rosamund in the afternoon.

114
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,070
I'll miss you. So I should hope.

115
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,035
Are you all right? I hope you haven't let the sergeant worry you.

116
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:31,084
No, he doesn't worry me.

117
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:35,369
I just wish we could all forget about Mr Green.

118
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,384
Why did you want me to go with you today?

119
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:49,361
Oh, it was just in case things turned mawkish.

120
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:54,155
I prevent Lord Merton saying anything to embarrass you -

121
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,459
I wanted the same protection myself.

122
00:08:56,475 --> 00:09:01,801
I presume you and Prince Kuragin were once...
attracted to each other.

123
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:05,007
'Attracted to each other'? Is that what you call it?

124
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:11,686
As it happens, he asked me to run away with him.

125
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:16,800
But you didn't go. No, Lord Grantham gave me a frame by Faberge,

126
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:21,606
with two pictures of the children in it, and I saw sense.

127
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,589
Lord Grantham sounds rather more subtle than I'd realised.

128
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,179
Well, like all Englishmen of his type.

129
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:31,872
He hid his qualities beneath a thick blanket of convention,

130
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:35,765
so I didn't see who he really was at first.

131
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,736
It was lucky you found out in time.

132
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,728
If it was in time.

133
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:43,216
I forget.

134
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:48,789
Daisy! Will you put those bally books away and come and help?

135
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:50,771
And where are the pastry casings?

136
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:53,458
I'll make them now. You should have made them before!

137
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:57,214
What is all that? I'm studying the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

138
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,989
Well, there'll be a glorious revolution
down here, if you don't watch it!

139
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:02,954
Did you hear that in there?

140
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:07,136
I mean, mathematics is one thing.
She's studying to be a revolutionary now!

141
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:11,401
I hope there's no cooking going on up in your room.

142
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:14,988
I should find out what he's up to. I'm sure it's nothing.

143
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,422
Lord Merton?

144
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:43,577
Well, that is...

145
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,559
You're here.

146
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,053
Well, hadn't you better come in? Thank you.

147
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,434
Well, how can I help?

148
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,802
I nearly flunked it,

149
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:10,416
but I've put it off so many times,

150
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:14,090
and as I was sitting all alone at luncheon today, I just thought:

151
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,946
'No. I'm jolly well going over there to say it. '

152
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:19,667
I do hope this won't be something you'll regret.

153
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:21,583
You may regret it. I won't.

154
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,869
Very well. I'm listening.

155
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:34,703
I really should go down on one knee,
but I fear I'd never get up again.

156
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,628
I'm sure you realise by now - I'm asking for your hand in marriage.

157
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:44,926
Dear Lord Merton, you see -

158
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:47,107
Please. Please.

159
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:53,031
I want to be quite dear.

160
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:56,804
I'm not speaking out of loneliness or with a view to my comfort.

161
00:11:56,814 --> 00:12:00,065
I'm sure - No, you're not.

162
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:05,785
When men of my age marry, that's usually the reason.

163
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,618
But my proposal is a romantic one.

164
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:12,462
I state freely and proudly, Isobel,
that I have fallen in love with you.

165
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:16,684
And I want to spend what remains of my life in your company.

166
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:20,220
I believe I could make you happy.

167
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:24,425
At any rate, I... I should very much like the chance to try.

168
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,758
Well, goodness, Lord Merton...

169
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,418
I freely admit you have taken me by surprise.

170
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:40,147
Not with your proposal, but with your... talk of love.

171
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,439
I mean it.

172
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,630
And before you refuse me...

173
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,521
...I'd like to ask you to leave it on the table, so to speak.

174
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,746
Say nothing for the time being.

175
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:56,420
Just think about it.

176
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,393
I'm not sure it would change my answer,

177
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:02,133
but after such eloquence,

178
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:05,436
to refuse your request would seem ungenerous.

179
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,781
I will think about it.

180
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,305
Well...

181
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,277
Now I think I'll take my leave.

182
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,945
I suspect ordinary conversation would be difficult after that.

183
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:35,273
What do you mean, that man Bricker is coming back? Why?

184
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:38,675
'That man Bricker'? What has he done to deserve such a welcome?

185
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,841
Hasn't he seen what he came to see?

186
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:45,492
He wants to investigate a possible link between
our picture and a later work by Della Francesca.

187
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,312
Shrimpie is coming this week.

188
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:51,747
Well, then, he and Mr Bricker will
get to know each other, won't they?

189
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:55,161
Edith, darling, why so glum?

190
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,319
I'm not glum, am I?

191
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:59,478
How's your prodigy child?

192
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,679
I haven't seen her for a while.

193
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:06,086
I was getting rather under their feet,
so I thought I'd give them a rest.

194
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,593
I knew that would happen.

195
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:11,000
Why don't you leave it for a few months?

196
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,813
A few months? I should.

197
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:15,671
Then they'll be pleased to see you when you do go back.

198
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:17,628
Any thoughts on Pip's Corner?

199
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,860
I'd love to understand the merits of the argument.

200
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,691
You want us to do it, don't you?

201
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,782
Well, it's capital with no outlay. We have to consider it.

202
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:27,519
Consider it, yes. But it's complex.

203
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,506
Do we really want to start breaking bits
off the estate and selling them piecemeal?

204
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:34,231
You wanted to sell land when Matthew died.

205
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:37,772
And I was wrong. I didn't see how many
owners would chip away at their land

206
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,806
until there was nothing viable left.

207
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,748
Anyway, we can talk about it tomorrow.

208
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,336
Not me. I'm going up to London first thing.

209
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:46,759
Aunt Rosamund's taking me to a dress show.

210
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,799
It's good to know you've got your priorities straight.

211
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:01,303
Hello? Who's in there?

212
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:05,880
Please, let me know who's in there.

213
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,918
Go away.

214
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,958
Mr Barrow?

215
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:12,678
Would you like me to fetch a man to help you?

216
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:17,564
Mr Barrow...

217
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,435
What man?

218
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,263
There isn't a man in this house who'd help me.

219
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:26,808
What's the matter with you?

220
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,343
Just mind your own business!

221
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:40,347
Now, you're sure there's no big evening event?

222
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:42,855
No, and we're only there one night.

223
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:45,837
When are you seeing His Lordship? Friday morning.

224
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:47,740
Before we catch the train home.

225
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,083
It's right to do it face to face.

226
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,122
But of course I'm dreading it.

227
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,893
Daddy! Hello, Sybbie, my love. Kiss.

228
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,918
Thank you, Nanny. Morning, George.

229
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,420
Morning, Donk.

230
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,440
Morning, Sybbie. Morning, George.

231
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:20,889
Do we think Lady Mary made the train? She was cutting it fine.

232
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,524
Mr Stark saw them both on board.

233
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,576
Carson, may I ask you something?

234
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,850
Is Mrs Patmore quite happy?

235
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,236
I'm afraid there is a particular matter that has upset her, m'lord.

236
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:35,149
May I know what it is?

237
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:38,407
But why make him wait?

238
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,691
You mean I must refuse him now?

239
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,589
Well, you said yourself the whole idea was ridiculous.

240
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:49,917
Yes, but I can only tell you,
when it came to it, he was not... ridiculous.

241
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:53,012
You surprise me.

242
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,394
One kind word and your judgment takes flight.

243
00:16:56,435 --> 00:17:00,171
Surely Prince Kuragin has reminded you what one kind word can do.

244
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,727
He's asked me to think about it.

245
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:08,147
And I will think about it.

246
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:15,558
- It was Michael's office on the telephone
- there's been a development.

247
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:20,000
Apparently, there's a trial going on in Munich.

248
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:23,991
Of the leader of a group of thugs there.

249
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:28,095
I've read about this. They wear brown
shirts and go around bullying people.

250
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,041
The leader tried to start a revolution.

251
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,289
That's it. It was absurd.

252
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,372
Maybe. But I'm afraid we're going to
see a lot more of this sort of thing.

253
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:39,689
We pushed Germany too hard with our demands after the war.

254
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:44,332
It seems it was this gang that got into a fight with Michael.

255
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,991
I can easily believe it. They're a
horrid bunch, from the sound of it.

256
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:51,277
Yes, but we might be dose to finding out what happened to him.

257
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,138
That's why his office telephoned?

258
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,778
It will be very hard for you, my darling,

259
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:07,693
but I promise it's better to know the truth

260
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:10,758
than to live in a cloud of mystery and despair.

261
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:15,644
But as long as I don't know for sure,
then, in a way, I'm keeping him alive.

262
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,957
I hate to let go of that.

263
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,080
Can you keep this to yourself, Papa?

264
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,019
Until we're told for certain.

265
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,136
I don't want to put up with Mary's pity any longer than I have to.

266
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:35,105
She will pity you, and God knows, so do I.

267
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,723
I'm fearfully late.

268
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,168
Where are my gloves? Don't worry.

269
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,534
It will all be unpacked before you get back.

270
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,937
You're a dream. I must run.

271
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:55,394
Oh, wait a minute. Could you post this?

272
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:58,927
Or give it to Mead if he hasn't emptied the box in the hall.

273
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:03,249
I never said where to meet me,
and Kensington Gardens would be nice and neutral.

274
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,408
I thought about dining with him tonight,

275
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,127
but midday seemed more appropriate for bad news.

276
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,056
Very good, m'lady.

277
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:32,724
And how is Edith getting on?

278
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:36,498
Actually, she's rather gloomy at the moment. Do we know why?

279
00:19:36,502 --> 00:19:39,776
She's taken an interest in a child of one of the tenants,

280
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:42,072
and now the parents are sick of her.

281
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:44,785
And why this child in particular?

282
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:47,051
I don't know. She took a fancy to it.

283
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,554
Now she seems to have overplayed her hand.

284
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,634
Golly. That'd be useful.

285
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:55,750
So, tell me more about this farmer and his little girl.

286
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:58,483
How did you know it was a girl? Well, you must have said.

287
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,407
He looks after the pigs.

288
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:03,343
Oh, yummy.

289
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,251
Good heavens. There's Charles Blake.

290
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:10,161
What's he doing here?

291
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,190
Excuse me. Is this right for Lord Gillingham?

292
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,581
That doorway. First floor.

293
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:56,634
Thank you.

294
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,817
Hello.

295
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,013
Nice to see you. Are you shopping for your trousseau?

296
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:26,517
Ha-ha.

297
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:29,782
Oh, I think you know Lady Mary Crawley. Miss Lane Fox.

298
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:31,985
Oops.

299
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,240
I've suddenly remembered the significance.

300
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:36,086
Try not to be an ass, Charles.

301
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,128
Well, we don't know each other, exactly.

302
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:40,842
But we certainly know OF each other. Don't we?

303
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,488
It's not often you meet the woman you were jilted for. Well, I -

304
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,918
Don't worry. I wouldn't want a man who preferred someone else.

305
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,948
You're quite over him, then? Absolutely.

306
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:53,253
Now I must go. I'm meeting Ralph Kerr later.

307
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,398
He's very tetchy if he's kept waiting.

308
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:00,877
I thought you knew each other. No.

309
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,750
And I must say, she wasn't at all what I imagined.

310
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,432
What was that?

311
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:08,875
I don't know. Someone meeker and more virtuous.

312
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:11,817
I don't think Mabel's very meek. No. Obviously not.

313
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:16,383
How long are you in London? I go home tomorrow.

314
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:19,333
I'll see Tony in the morning and then catch the train.

315
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:21,376
Why? What are you doing tonight? Nothing.

316
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:24,220
Then why not have dinner with me? Don't you have plans?

317
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:27,165
None that I want to honour. I'll come for you at eight.

318
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,334
Nowhere too swanky. I haven't brought the right clothes.

319
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:07,376
I'll do them! Mrs Patmore, His Lordship is asking for you.

320
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:09,194
Come up to the library, please.

321
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:12,463
Oh, my heaven! What, now? Oh, Lord!

322
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,887
You look fine. Give me your apron.

323
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:19,210
Ah, Mr Molesley. Just the man.
Can you cast your eye over the dining table?

324
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:22,405
I won't have time before dinner, and you're the First Footman.

325
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:24,455
I was just going to - While you're up there,

326
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:27,308
check the bedrooms for Lord Flintshire and Mr Bricker.

327
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:30,948
I haven't got a moment and, as Mr Carson says,
you are the First Footman.

328
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:32,988
Right. I'm ready.

329
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,835
Go on, then, Mr Molesley. It doesn't seem quite fair.

330
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,684
You wanted to be First Footman. What did you think?

331
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:45,830
That you'd spend all day with your feet up?

332
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:56,582
I thought I'd pop in and see how Marigold's getting on.

333
00:23:57,565 --> 00:24:00,542
I'm afraid I'm just taking her up for a rest, m'lady.

334
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:04,188
They've been playing outside and she's tired.

335
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:07,255
Does she have to go up right away? I think so, yes, m'lady.

336
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:18,262
M'lady?

337
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,734
The... the trouble is, Margie thinks you're unsettling the child.

338
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:38,883
There are laws that govern the whole business of war memorials.

339
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,416
So Mr Carson's told me, m'lord.

340
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:44,478
I appreciate how distressing this is for you and your family.

341
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:46,426
Do you, m'lord?

342
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,925
Because I'm not sure Mr Carson does.

343
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,988
Carson is as sorry about it as I am. Aren't you, Carson?

344
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:56,430
I'm sorry that Mrs Patmore should be distressed, m'lord.

345
00:24:56,441 --> 00:25:00,296
But you're not sorry Archie's name's to be left off the memorial.

346
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:04,273
He volunteered. He didn't wait to be called up.

347
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:09,496
He went to the Front to fight, and as for his so-called cowardice...

348
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:14,211
that were like a wound in battle, a wound to his brain,

349
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,257
so he didn't know what he was doing.

350
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,311
He were a good and decent lad.

351
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:22,946
Of course he was. But doesn't that
make him a casualty of war, m'lord?

352
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:25,023
Same as our William or any of them.

353
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:30,130
He could have stayed here, safe and well, until they came for him.

354
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:34,103
But instead, he chose to fight for his country.

355
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:38,102
It may surprise you to learn, Mrs Patmore, but I agree with you,

356
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,399
even though I can do nothing about it.

357
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,758
It's not helpful, but I do.

358
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,731
No, it is helpful.

359
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:48,915
It helps to think that decent folk can see our Archie was a victim.

360
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,653
Even if Mr Carson can't.

361
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:56,557
Thank you, Carson.

362
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:01,876
When does Shrimpie get here? And your ghastly art dealer.

363
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:06,893
They're on the same train and the car's meeting them,
so they'll have time to change.

364
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,072
And he isn't a dealer. He's a historian.

365
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,456
Is he, indeed? Lawks a-mercy.

366
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:15,326
I wish I knew why he was coming.

367
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:17,825
He wants to discuss the painting. With you?

368
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:19,861
Yes. Is that so shocking?

369
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:23,055
I'd better get on.

370
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:31,294
Oh, Mr Molesley. I've not been told

371
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:34,723
whether Lord Flintshire and Mr Bricker will be bringing valets.

372
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:37,471
Could you see they're properly attended?

373
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,690
Well, I've got a lot on my plate, Mr Carson.

374
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:42,207
I am sorry, Mr Molesley, but you are -

375
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,366
Yes, I know. I know. I'm the First Footman.

376
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:50,731
50, you're happy?

377
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:55,988
Well, I'm not delirious, but who is? I have a pretty good life.

378
00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:57,904
Well, I'm glad.

379
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,712
I was never the type to die of a broken heart, you know.

380
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:06,218
I'm sorry if that offends you.

381
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:10,098
On the contrary. I only hope Tony feels the same.

382
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,400
Goodness. I wasn't expecting that.

383
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:22,475
I wish I could work you out.

384
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:24,533
I wish I could work me out.

385
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,782
When will you tell him? Tomorrow.

386
00:27:30,675 --> 00:27:32,632
I'm meeting him at noon.

387
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,850
By the Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens.

388
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:38,110
Won't that make him dream of happy families?

389
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,041
Well, it's too late to change it now.

390
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:42,510
What's he done wrong?

391
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,571
Nothing.

392
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:47,589
I'm very fond of him. I'll always be fond of him.

393
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:53,923
I want him to be the godfather of my children.
Just not their father.

394
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,366
How will he take it? Not as well as you.

395
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:07,017
Well, you've got a way to soften the blow. If you want to.

396
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:09,160
I don't see how. Don't you?

397
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:17,155
You seem a little subdued tonight. Do I, Granny?

398
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:19,756
How strange. I wonder why.

399
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,820
I know it sounds hard, but you must learn to leave things behind.

400
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:27,981
I suppose you mean I'm to leave Michael behind now,

401
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:31,282
as you've already made it quite clear I'm to leave the baby behind.

402
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:35,370
I would never suggest anything that is not in your interest.

403
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:38,408
In my interest? Or the family's?

404
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,972
To me, they are the same.

405
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:42,870
And that is where we differ.

406
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,718
I've been thinking about your missing person.

407
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,426
Oh, I don't want to be a nuisance,

408
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:56,348
but aren't there departments devoted to finding people who are lost?

409
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:59,751
Alas, not at my command. And the Russians who were driven out

410
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:01,910
have spread to the four corners of the earth.

411
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:04,178
Who is this woman? An old friend of yours?

412
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,501
No, she's the wife of an old friend.

413
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,718
Oh, just see what you can do, Shrimpie.

414
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:16,132
Aunt Violet - if I can still call you Aunt Violet -

415
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:18,517
I ought to warn you about something.

416
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:21,473
I can guess what it is. You won't approve.

417
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:22,992
No. I don't.

418
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:27,264
You may even feel the need to take sides. Susan is your niece.

419
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:31,972
Well, I think you're making a serious mistake,
but you may rest easy on that score.

420
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,767
I never take sides in a broken marriage.

421
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:36,871
Why is that?

422
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:40,628
Because, however much the couple may strive to be honest,

423
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:44,451
no-one is ever in possession of the facts.

424
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,732
Are you in a hurry to leave tomorrow?

425
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:49,904
Not at all. In fact, at the risk of being a burden,

426
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,986
I thought I might stay another night.

427
00:29:52,005 --> 00:29:55,184
When are you off tomorrow? He's staying for a couple of days.

428
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:59,024
Is he? Well, I hope we've got enough here to amuse you.

429
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,555
Come into the library. Excuse me.

430
00:30:06,315 --> 00:30:09,411
Why not invite Miss Bunting to dinner tomorrow night?

431
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:13,271
Mary will be back - we'll be quite a party. Edith, persuade him.

432
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:15,679
I don't think Papa would think it a very good idea.

433
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,319
What's this? I wanted Torn to invite
Miss Bunting to dinner tomorrow,

434
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,598
but Edith says Robert won't allow it.

435
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,870
Nonsense. Of course you must bring her, if you like. I insist.

436
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,808
So, you've enjoyed Bombay for the most part? Oh, yes.

437
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:34,821
It's a wonderful city, the gateway to the glories of the East.

438
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:36,849
I felt very privileged.

439
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:41,955
I gather things have not improved with Susan.

440
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,677
No.

441
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:47,059
The times I've blessed you and Cora for keeping Rose out of it.

442
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,061
What happens now?

443
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:52,542
Divorce, I'm afraid. I can't see any other way.

444
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,525
But my dear chap, is it worth it?

445
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:58,338
Why can't you just live apart?

446
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,999
If you'd ever been as unhappy as I am, you'd know why not.

447
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:11,801
Has Molesley gone to bed?

448
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:14,734
Yes. Why?

449
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:18,520
Mrs Patmore needs two more chafing dishes first thing tomorrow.

450
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:21,223
You can tell him in the morning.

451
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:23,740
You're not so pally now, are you?

452
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,784
Why are you still up?

453
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:29,198
I just want to get this finished.

454
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:34,352
Your father was never ill, was he?

455
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,395
I'm sorry?

456
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,800
Are you the one who's ill? Is that it? Is that why you went away?

457
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:45,375
What's it to do with you? I'm right, aren't I?

458
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:47,674
You're ill, and you went away to be treated,

459
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:50,956
and now you're trying to carry on with the treatment yourself.

460
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:54,132
Well, it has nothing to do with you, so just leave me alone.

461
00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:00,301
Robert asked why we couldn't stay together,
for the look of the thing.

462
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:02,334
I hope you see that we can't.

463
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:05,435
But Daddy, where are you going to live?

464
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:07,695
Your mother will keep Upper Brook Street.

465
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:10,862
I'm not sure where I'm going to go yet, but I'll find something.

466
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,643
Oh, can I live with you?

467
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:17,060
To be honest, I think you should stay here for a while.

468
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:19,793
The next part could be quite unpleasant.

469
00:32:19,794 --> 00:32:22,127
I'm learning from it, though.

470
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:25,924
- I don't care how eligible some chap may be
- I'm not going to be bullied.

471
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:29,086
Fighting talk. I mean it.

472
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:34,549
You all think that now I'm officially 'out',
it's time to find my man.

473
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:38,543
But I'm only going to marry if I'm totally, absolutely in love.

474
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:42,515
Of course.

475
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,700
When I find him, will you promise to be on my side?

476
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:51,290
Promise you won't try to force me into a
'suitable' marriage, like you were forced.

477
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:54,714
In other words, you're asking for a blank cheque.

478
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,447
Yes.

479
00:32:56,448 --> 00:32:58,807
That's just what I want.

480
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:01,318
Oh, my dearest one.

481
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,507
On the subject of marriage, I have no right to give advice,

482
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,555
let alone orders.

483
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:15,041
'You must make haste to reach Dieppe,

484
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:18,705
where you are to seek out a Mr Avebury.

485
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:22,708
He will arrange for you to be taken
aboard a packet and conveyed to safety,

486
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:26,352
but do not delay, if you hold your mother dear. '

487
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,627
Poor woman. I know how she felt.

488
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:34,451
'As for your collection, Mr Avebury will do what he can,

489
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:39,006
but I'd rather every canvas or carving were tossed in the sea

490
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:43,337
to your being one extra hour in that unhappy country. '

491
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,865
I'm glad he didn't take her advice.

492
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:50,934
He did not. He brought crates and crates over,

493
00:33:50,944 --> 00:33:53,897
then went back after the Reign of Terror to buy more.

494
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:57,671
And you have preserved them safely in this beautiful place.

495
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,940
I'm glad you think it's beautiful.

496
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:04,037
I think everything about Downton is beautiful,
including its mistress.

497
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,337
You mustn't say such things. I have to, or I'll burst.

498
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:09,975
What's burst?

499
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:12,683
I was just saying that...

500
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:17,405
being allowed to touch a painting like this will make me burst.

501
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:21,242
It's wonderful to show it to someone so appreciative. Yes.

502
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:24,177
No-one could say you're not appreciative, Mr Bricker.

503
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:36,610
I can't be hearing this correctly. I'm afraid you are.

504
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,917
So, you sleep with a man because he wants to marry you,

505
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:42,274
but now you change your mind. It's insane!

506
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:44,123
I'm sorry if you think so.

507
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,839
Well, I won't let it happen. I love you and you love me.

508
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,571
At least, you told me so in Liverpool.

509
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,859
I know, and I thought I meant it.

510
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,359
Well, what's changed? I can't explain, exactly.

511
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,488
But something has. That's all.

512
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:58,424
Am I a bad lover'? Is that what you're trying to tell. me?

513
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,718
Don't be silly. It's not that at all.

514
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,373
It's just, I feel I've sort of... woken up out of a dream.

515
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:07,823
How flattering! We go to bed together and you wake up!

516
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:11,109
I'm just not sure we have enough in common, to make a go of things.

517
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:13,024
Well, I refuse to accept it.

518
00:35:13,038 --> 00:35:15,968
I refuse to believe that a woman like you, a lady,

519
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:19,645
could give herself to a man without
first being certain that he was the one.

520
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:23,178
So, what are you saying? This is something we've got to get through.

521
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:26,265
And we will. We will get through this together.

522
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:41,013
Mr Molesley. You wanted to see me?

523
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:44,702
Only to say

524
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:48,441
that I'm not sure I should be called the
First Footman, after all, Mr Carson.

525
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:50,481
Are you not? No.

526
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:53,118
Well, it's not like the old days, is it?

527
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:58,790
I mean, the duties of the First Footman are
shared between a lot of people now, aren't they?

528
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,637
Are they? Well, they should be...

529
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:05,497
because I've got the duties of the
Second and Third Footman to deal with.

530
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:10,402
So, you don't feel you need the precedence
that the title 'First Footman' confers?

531
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,399
Well, not really, no.

532
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:18,241
Very well.

533
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,088
I'll see what I can do.

534
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,969
I wasn't sure you'd want to come. Nonsense.

535
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:36,238
I'm flattered to be asked.

536
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,680
I didn't think I would be again. Not after last time.

537
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:41,694
Try to be nice to him tonight.

538
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:46,597
I will be, if he's nice to me.

539
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:51,070
I know you don't like him, or any of them, much,

540
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:54,212
but you forget one thing - they are good to me, in their way.

541
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,509
And I love them.

542
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,615
I don't want you to hate them.

543
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:06,407
Just to realise that you're more than a retainer.

544
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:10,265
I can't bear for you to waste your
life propping up a system that's dying.

545
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:14,025
Well, it won't die before dinner.

546
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:20,645
Someone's dropped this in the passage. The London Magazine.

547
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,646
Does it belong to any of you? Mr Barrow was reading it earlier.

548
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:28,273
Would you give it to him when he comes down, Miss Baxter? Of course.

549
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:44,781
Where did you get this? Have you been in my room?

550
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:47,982
Of course not. You dropped it in the passage. Mrs Hughes found it.

551
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:51,624
Mrs Hughes found it, but Miss Baxter read it.

552
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:55,018
I'm sorry for what you've gone through, if what I think is correct.

553
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,082
Don't you pity me.

554
00:37:57,724 --> 00:37:59,680
Don't you dare pity me.

555
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,913
Did you bring the photographs of Della Francesca's Nativity?

556
00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:11,196
I certainly did. We can compare them to the painting tomorrow.

557
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,705
It would be so lovely if it does turn out to be a study for it.

558
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:17,800
Yes. It would be absolutely lovely.

559
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:22,001
Mr Bricker, one more word and I will ask you to sit somewhere else!

560
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:25,556
He flatters her. He keeps asking her opinion on everything.

561
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:27,580
Well, don't you ever ask her opinion?

562
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,681
Of course I do. Sometimes.

563
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:33,283
Did you have a good time in London? Quite good.

564
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:35,712
I set myself rather a difficult task,

565
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,496
and it's always a relief when it's done, isn't it?

566
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:44,907
- How are your lessons going?
- What's this?

567
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:48,218
Miss Bunting is giving instruction to Mrs Patmore's undercook.

568
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:50,129
Oh, yes. I heard about that.

569
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:53,133
You sound as if you don't approve. I approve.

570
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:56,617
As long as you're not making... her unsettled.

571
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,808
You don't know her name, do you?

572
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:02,663
Sarah, please. Of course he does.

573
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:04,679
Daisy.

574
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:10,155
Well, he knows it now. I knew it before.

575
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:13,808
And it sounds as if you're upsetting her and Mrs Patmore.

576
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:16,186
I think you should drop this.

577
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:20,670
Why don't you send for her'? Bring Daisy in and ask her yourself.

578
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:24,545
I'm sure she's too busy. Not too busy to answer a summons from you.

579
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:26,432
We don't want to embarrass her.

580
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,198
Carson?

581
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:34,200
This is the busiest time of their day, m'lord.
Maybe it would be better -

582
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:36,474
No. Fetch her.

583
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:38,518
And ask Mrs Patmore to come up, as well.

584
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,148
Very good, m'lord.

585
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,758
Your father may regret this.

586
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:58,019
I wondered if you wanted a hand. Almost done.

587
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,363
You could put the cases away, if you've a mind.

588
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:06,286
Did you enjoy yourself? We weren't there long enough.

589
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:10,879
I went to deliver a letter to Lord Gillingham in Albany.

590
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,668
Oh, yes?

591
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:15,077
Then I walked into Piccadilly.

592
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:17,086
His Lordship's lucky to live there.

593
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:20,759
Do you recall Mr Green saying that? Saying what?

594
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:24,964
Jimmy heard where he lived and called him a lucky tyke.

595
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,565
He wasn't very lucky in the end, though, was he?

596
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,426
No. He wasn't lucky in the end.

597
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,533
Right. I'll take these up to the luggage room.

598
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:52,891
Is something wrong with the dinner, m'lord? Not at all.

599
00:40:52,892 --> 00:40:55,129
We apologise, Mrs Patmore,

600
00:40:55,145 --> 00:41:01,053
for interfering with your duties in
this strange and inconsiderate way.

601
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,226
Mrs Patmore, Carson tells me

602
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:07,213
you feel Daisy's lessons have disturbed the peace of the kitchen.

603
00:41:07,224 --> 00:41:10,270
Did you say that? I don't know what I said.

604
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,568
I was upset about that other business.

605
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:15,194
I wondered if it were true. Daisy?

606
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:17,568
Well, I'm sorry if I've made trouble downstairs.

607
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,527
Well, you haven't. Not really.

608
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:21,821
But I must say this, m'lord.

609
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:26,199
Miss Bunting here has opened my eyes to
a world of knowledge I knew nothing of.

610
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,494
Maybe I'll stay a cook all my life,

611
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:33,516
but I have choices now, interests, facts at my fingertips.

612
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,311
And I'd never have had any of that
if she hadn't come here to teach me.

613
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:39,179
Brava. Well said.

614
00:41:41,025 --> 00:41:43,989
Quite a testimonial. May we go, m'lord?

615
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:46,269
We've still got the pudding and the savouries.

616
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,307
Of course. Thank you.

617
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:54,592
Obviously, the lessons have proved successful.

618
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:56,628
I'm pleased to hear it.

619
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:58,904
Are you, Lord Grantham?

620
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:01,862
Oh, for heaven's sake, let it go. You've proved your point.

621
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,718
Have I, though? All I've proved is that Lord Grantham

622
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,112
would like us serfs to stay in our
allotted place from cradle to grave.

623
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:10,744
There is only one thing I would like...

624
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:13,115
and that I would like passionately.

625
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:16,536
It is to see you leave this house and never come back!

626
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,855
Happy now?

627
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:31,133
Edith, dear, are you still writing that very interesting column?

628
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,700
Yes, Granny.

629
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:35,000
Oh, you must show me some of them.

630
00:42:35,016 --> 00:42:36,914
What is the latest one about?

631
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,035
What are they all about? The way the world is changing.

632
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:49,432
What's happening? What's all the commotion?

633
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:53,097
He just left the room.

634
00:42:53,312 --> 00:42:55,127
Oh, I don't mean to interrupt.

635
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:58,255
No, no. We were just discussing the Battle of Little Bighorn.

636
00:42:58,256 --> 00:43:00,039
The Battle of Little Minx, more like.

637
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:03,445
To speak to His Lordship in that manner! In his own house.

638
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,534
It's true, then? I thought Mr Barrow might be exaggerating.

639
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:08,469
It seems he wasn't, for once.

640
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,994
Mr Branson must be horrified to have brought her here.

641
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:13,849
I don't know.

642
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:18,250
I like him, but sometimes I think we've forgotten
the Mr Branson that was down here with us,

643
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:21,439
spouting Keir Hardie between every mouthful.

644
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:24,496
They've made him one of them in a way,
but it's not who he really is.

645
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,857
Then it makes me wonder whether Downton is the place for him.

646
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:31,120
A question I'm sure he's asked himself many times.

647
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:35,578
I can't stand that woman. No great surprise there.

648
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,959
I suppose you think I made a fool of myself.

649
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:41,376
What does it matter? I don't see that you were much better.

650
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,872
Flirting and twinkling with that ghastly travelling salesman.

651
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:52,602
Go to sleep, and when you wake up,

652
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:56,620
make sure you get out of bed on the right side.

653
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:15,313
Good night, Tom.

654
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:18,279
And cheer up. You gave Granny a wonderful evening.

655
00:44:27,694 --> 00:44:29,724
Well, what a to-do!

656
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,977
It seems to me your friend Miss Bunting is out to make trouble.

657
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:36,801
She's brought me to life, Mrs Patmore.

658
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:41,033
All the same, she wouldn't win a popularity contest upstairs.

659
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,509
Would you like to write a letter to the War Office?

660
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,265
Oh, don't be daft. I mean it.

661
00:44:46,277 --> 00:44:50,120
If you think Archie's been badly treated, you must protest.

662
00:44:50,132 --> 00:44:53,110
I wouldn't know how to write a letter like that.

663
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:56,055
I can write it for you. It won't do any good.

664
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:59,293
His Lordship says there are rules in place. He wouldn't lie.

665
00:44:59,294 --> 00:45:03,197
No, but if you protest and then,
over the years, more and more others protest,

666
00:45:03,223 --> 00:45:05,501
then they might change their blessed rules.

667
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:07,981
This is your learning, isn't it?

668
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:10,740
That's what you're trying to show me - you're not afraid.

669
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,763
No, I'm not.

670
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,527
Well, go on, then.

671
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,432
We'll do it tomorrow.

672
00:45:29,856 --> 00:45:33,723
How can we help you this time? It's an odd business.

673
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:36,934
Since all this started, they've kept a plain-clothes man on watch

674
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:39,083
at Lord Gillingham's set in Albany,

675
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:43,664
and now I'm told that Mrs Bates was seen there, loitering outside.

676
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,135
Well, I know why that would be.

677
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,030
Lady Mary must have wanted to see Lord
Gillingham while she was in London.

678
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:52,971
No doubt, Anna was sent with a message to arrange a meeting.

679
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:56,624
I knew you'd have something sensible to say. Sergeant?

680
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:59,019
Well, it seems likely.

681
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:02,532
But from there, Mrs Bates walked into Piccadilly,

682
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:05,370
to the spot where Mr Green died.

683
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:08,373
There's no possibility she might have a grudge against him,

684
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:10,251
that Mr Bates might share?

685
00:46:10,278 --> 00:46:14,259
Not that I'm aware. As I recall, she rather liked him.

686
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,140
Mrs Hughes? Yes, she liked him. So she said.

687
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:21,996
They may want to question her, but before they do,
they want me to check one thing.

688
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:25,864
She was definitely here on the day of his death? Here at Downton?

689
00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:31,366
I believe so. Surely, you can't think that Mrs -

690
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:34,595
I'm not paid to think, Mrs Hughes. Just to record the facts.

691
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:40,354
Hong Kong? A lot of the Tsarist sympathisers ended up there.

692
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:44,565
How did they survive? As servants and taxi drivers.

693
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:49,066
Milliners and prostitutes. Anything they could lay their hand to.

694
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:54,150
I will not suggest to which of those callings
the Princess Kuragin was most suited.

695
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:57,283
If you dislike her so much, why are you going to all this trouble?

696
00:46:57,294 --> 00:46:59,441
Because I owe it to her. Why?

697
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:02,971
By the way, Susan has written to Annabel

698
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,937
to say that she's furious that you've all taken me in.

699
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:10,498
Oh, dear Susan has been in a rage
since she was playing with her dolls.

700
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:12,778
I am proof against her tantrums.

701
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:15,662
I would rephrase that if you want to stay neutral.

702
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:18,235
I won't take sides - it's true.

703
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:22,370
But I don't think I could ever be described as 'neutral'.

704
00:47:26,772 --> 00:47:29,849
Have you apologized to Tom?

705
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,943
I never knew anyone who could provoke me
into saying so many things I don't believe.

706
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:36,802
But I am sorry, Tom. Please forgive me.

707
00:47:36,803 --> 00:47:40,108
She knows how to goad you. With the precision of a surgeon.

708
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:42,971
Why do you go on with her? Since Sybil. died,

709
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,918
I've forgotten what it's like to be with
someone who feels about things as I do.

710
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:49,797
That's why. Or that's been why.

711
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:53,755
To me, it's as if you'd joined us and now you're backing away.

712
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:01,627
What are we doing here?

713
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:05,381
I want to explain why I think we should turn down Wavell's offer.

714
00:48:05,392 --> 00:48:09,271
I know. We are only the caretakers of Downton.

715
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:11,292
But Papa, some things have to change.

716
00:48:11,303 --> 00:48:15,040
True. But we mustn't destroy what we're trying to protect.

717
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:19,392
Wavell would wreck this lovely place for ever,
with his ugly, cheap houses.

718
00:48:19,393 --> 00:48:22,352
But you can't block all development. I won't.

719
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:25,295
I intend to expand, but without spoiling.

720
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:27,692
I'm going to make a plan and find a solid builder

721
00:48:27,702 --> 00:48:30,525
who can fit in to the village and not ruin it.

722
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:32,956
That may be hard to achieve. It may be harder

723
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:36,898
than cashing Wavell's cheque, but does that mean we shouldn't we

724
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:38,848
No.

725
00:48:39,172 --> 00:48:41,816
We will build.

726
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,742
We'll even make money for the estate.

727
00:48:43,743 --> 00:48:47,178
But we won't destroy what people love about this place.

728
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:49,094
Do you think that's wrong?

729
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,496
No. It's not wrong.

730
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,529
That's all I'm asking.
