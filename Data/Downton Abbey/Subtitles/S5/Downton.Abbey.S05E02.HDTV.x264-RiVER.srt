2
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,900
Wait one moment.

3
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:49,216
She can decide whether or not she
wants to throw these away.

4
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:51,296
Quite right.

5
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:06,676
But how would it be funded?

6
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:10,337
There's quite a lot in the kitty
and we'd have another campaign.

7
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:13,457
There'll be plenty of volunteers to
keep up standards.

8
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,778
For how long? And what about the
cricket?

9
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:19,338
We'd have to re-site the pitch, My
Lord. Of course it would take work

10
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:22,622
but we've got until the summer.
Think what we're gaining.

11
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,703
A beautiful garden of remembrance.

12
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:29,068
Where people can walk and sit
and think about their loved ones.

13
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,749
They can come here from all around

14
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:34,413
and spend an hour with their sacred
memories in peace and at rest.

15
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:36,653
This pitch has been prepared over
years

16
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:38,774
with a great deal of work for the
cricket.

17
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:42,025
That field below Peckham wood could
be made into a pitch.

18
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:45,865
Surely the right place is in the
village where people pass every day.

19
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:49,065
Will it be peaceful and quiet?
A fit place for mourning?

20
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:53,585
It's what they're doing in Sowerby
and I'm certain it's where most of
them will be.

21
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:56,505
And is our memorial to be no better
than most of them?

22
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:59,105
It comes down to priorities,
Lord Grantham.

23
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:03,706
Which is more important, a game of
cricket or the loss of a son in the
course of his duty?

24
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:15,185
Well, this is it, then.

25
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:17,146
There's something I wanna say.

26
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:20,945
I'm sorry I put you through all that
trouble.

27
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:23,025
Forget it.

28
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:26,465
It's in t'past. Well, you've been a
good friend to me, Thomas.

29
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:29,626
If anyone had told me that I'd have
been friends with a...

30
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,746
man like you I'd have not believed
them.

31
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,386
But we have been friends.

32
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,666
And I'm sad to see the back of you.
I am.

33
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,825
We can always write.

34
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:46,426
I'm not much at letter writing.
I'll do me best.

35
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:49,345
But in case we don't meet again...

36
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,946
I hope you find some happiness.

37
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:56,385
I do, truly.

38
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,425
I hope the same for you too, Jimmy.

39
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,386
I'll be dandy.

40
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,026
I'd best be off.

41
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:29,585
I'm sorry Jimmy's gone.
I know.

42
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,305
It were nice having a bonny face
about the house.

43
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:34,985
We'll have to make do with Mr
Molesley.

44
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:37,105
How are you studies going?

45
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:40,985
Slowly. It's bound to be hard when
you've not been at school for a while.

46
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:43,025
It's not hard, it's impossible.

47
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:45,065
But what's the answer?

48
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:47,026
Is the pudding ready to go up?

49
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:51,105
Mrs Patmore? The pudding.
Sorry. I was miles away.

50
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,066
There's a sauce to go with that.

51
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,305
On one tray or will Mr Barrow help?

52
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:59,225
One tray, please. I can't be
bothered to fight with him.

53
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:01,226
Jimmy, where are you when we need
you?

54
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:09,305
Ooh, Mr Carson.
What is it now?

55
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:12,865
Now that Jimmy, erm, James, has
gone,

56
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,265
do I take it that I am now
first footman?

57
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:20,385
Since you are the only footman, you
are first, second, third and last.

58
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,465
Make what you will of it.

59
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:25,305
Mr Moseley, we are nearly at the end
of those distinctions.

60
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,066
There will come a time when a
household is lucky to boast any footman.

61
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,026
Now get that up to the dining room.

62
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:34,705
Did it not go well this morning?

63
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,785
I was disappointed, if you must
know.

64
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,746
But it's early days.

65
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,625
George is coming on so fast.

66
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:45,025
It's wonderful how they seem to
change week by week at his age.

67
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:47,265
He's rather sweet, isn't he?

68
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,705
How are you getting on with repairing
the fire damage?

69
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,025
Oh, they're all being marvellous
but I do feel such an idiot.

70
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,345
Maybe because you behaved like an
idiot.

71
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:58,265
The good thing is it'll be sorted
out in a day or two.

72
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:01,385
I got this letter from Charles
Blake? What does he want?

73
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:04,906
An art historian he knows is writing
a book on della Francesca.

74
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:07,905
He wasn't aware we had one of his
paintings at Downton.

75
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,985
He's desperate to see it.

76
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:13,345
I assume it's just an excuse so
Charles can pay court to Mary.

77
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,385
He doesn't want to come. He wrote to
introduce his friend Simon Bricker.

78
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:20,786
I can invite Charles if you'd like.
I don't mind either way.

79
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:25,105
I will ask him. We don't know Mr Bricker.
It might be easier if Charles was here.

80
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:29,065
Don't forget I'm away from Tuesday.
I wish I knew where you were going.

81
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:32,105
I haven't a clue. I expect we'll
drive around for a few days

82
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:34,625
and stop and sketch when we see a
view we like.

83
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,746
Who's this with?
Annabelle Portsmouth. It'll be fun.

84
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:41,705
How was your morning, Papa? Have you
decided where to put the memorial?

85
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,705
No.
Carson?

86
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:45,745
Not yet, my lady.

87
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,706
It's difficult to please everyone.

88
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:53,705
Bella Davis telephoned to talk about
her work with Russian refugees in York.

89
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:56,786
Are there many Russian refugees in
York? I'm afraid so.

90
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,905
They're scattered all over Europe.

91
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:03,385
Trying to establish communities to save
their culture after the ravages of revolution.

92
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,465
Ghastly for them, eh, Tom?

93
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,466
I feel sorry for anyone exiled from
their own country.

94
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,545
I pity those who stayed behind

95
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:13,465
only to be tortured and murdered in
their thousands.

96
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:15,505
Leave him alone, Papa.

97
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,585
I was at the hospital today

98
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,466
and Mrs Henderson has done the most
generous thing

99
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:23,985
and given a wireless to the ward so
that they can listen to music and the news

100
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:27,905
and sometimes even a play. I can't
tell you how it brightens things up.

101
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:30,425
I'm told that they're far more
efficient now

102
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,465
and much easier to tune.
No.

103
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:35,066
But... I haven't asked anything.
No.

104
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:39,426
Shall we go through and let the
servants get in here?

105
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,985
Hello.

106
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:50,946
Dawn raid?

107
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,305
Look who it is. Come on, my lady.

108
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:57,345
Hello, Mrs Drewe.

109
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,306
I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

110
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,185
Hello, darling.

111
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:05,706
Hello. How are you?

112
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:08,265
Why don't you sit there, my lady?

113
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,825
Have they started cleaning up after
the fire?

114
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:13,825
They're doing it now. Thank heaven it
was only my room.

115
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:15,905
God, I was stupid.

116
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:18,865
It's wonderful the interest you take
in her, my lady.

117
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:21,306
Perhaps you'll keep an eye on her as
she grows.

118
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,585
I'm sure I will.

119
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,665
It would be a blessing if you would.

120
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,986
After all, she's almost a foundling.
No parents of her own.

121
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:34,785
No family, no-one to turn to.
What are you saying?

122
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:36,865
We're her family now?

123
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:40,425
I know. But there's a limit to what
we can do with three of our own.

124
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,866
I don't understand you. Marigold is
one of our own.

125
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:48,665
Or very nearly. All I'm saying is her
ladyship could prove to be a real blessing

126
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,745
if she'd only take an interest.

127
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:52,746
She seems a bright little thing to
me.

128
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,786
Well, I'd have to think about it.
Course you will.

129
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:06,786
Because if people get used to seeing
you together, you can't just duck out.

130
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:11,945
That's why we must think carefully
and only take it on if I'm sure.

131
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:14,545
You could be a sort of godmother.

132
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,625
That's it.

133
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,145
Yes, I could be Marigold's godmother.
She's got a godmother.

134
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,305
We had her christened and my
sister's -

135
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:24,986
Talk it over with his lordship,
why don't you?

136
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:29,625
See what he thinks. Maybe I could
take her up to the house to visit my
niece and nephew.

137
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:32,905
My eye. How lucky would she be?

138
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:35,305
It is all very good of you, my lady,
I'm sure.

139
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,266
Give it a thought. Then we'll see.

140
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:49,345
Sorry. Dr Clarkson has just been
telling me about the latest report
of the drug insulin.

141
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,465
Oh. It's going to make a great
difference to many lives.

142
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,025
I'm quite sure of that.
I agree.

143
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:58,985
We're a backwater here but, heaven
knows, we've our share of diabetes.

144
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:01,506
A diagnosis will no longer be a
death sentence.

145
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:05,865
I'm glad to see your old interests
are reasserting themselves.

146
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:09,185
Why do you say that? Mrs Crawley's
been distracted lately.

147
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:13,465
With Lord Merton frisking around her
skirts and getting in the way.

148
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,545
You make too much of it.

149
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:20,185
Do I? We've been invited to tea with
Lord Merton at Cavenham.

150
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:22,306
I opened the letter this morning.

151
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:26,705
Maybe you're the real quarry and he's only
hunting me to throw you off the scent.

152
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:30,465
I may be older than I was but I can
still tell when a man is interested.

153
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:33,425
I believe Cavenham Park has some
beautiful gardens.

154
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:35,986
Though it's the wrong time of year
to see them.

155
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:39,905
The promise of the gardens in summer
will be the final worm on the hook.

156
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:42,825
Honestly, I'm as good at being
teased as the next man

157
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:45,066
but even my sense of humour has its
limits.

158
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,786
Off you go, Miss Goody Two Shoes.

159
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:55,745
You can play the holy mother all you
like, you still nearly got me sacked.

160
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:57,825
Leave her alone.

161
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:01,346
Oh, gallant Mr Molesley. She's never
told you though, has she?

162
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:04,305
Miss Baxter has had troubles in the
past

163
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:08,225
which you tried to use against her.
Until her ladyship put a stop to it.

164
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:11,066
That is all I need to know.
I knew she hadn't told you.

165
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:15,145
Barrow. Could you please tell Mrs
Patmore I'm here?

166
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,185
Very good, my lady.

167
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:19,146
Mrs Patmore, Lady Rose.

168
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,185
A delicious dinner, Mrs Patmore.

169
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,225
Thank you very much.

170
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,345
You wanted a word?

171
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:33,265
Only if it's convenient, my lady.
But, you know that young woman who
works at the school?

172
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:38,385
Miss Bunting. Mr Branson's friend.
Yes. I didn't like to ask him in
case he found it awkward.

173
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:42,826
I was wondering if she might be
prepared to take on some extra work.

174
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,705
But suppose they telephone Lady
Portsmouth.

175
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,786
She's promised she'll cover for me.

176
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:51,345
I feel quite nervous. And I'm not
even going.

177
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:55,425
We'll choose the clothes carefully
so you can take them on and off
without my help.

178
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,505
Well, I'll have his help.

179
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:01,025
Honestly, my lady. You'd better hope
I never write my memoirs.

180
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,145
There is one thing I've got to ask
you.

181
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:06,026
I'm really sorry, but I must.
Go on.

182
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:10,825
I have to sure there aren't
any... consequences.

183
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:12,865
What sort of consequences?

184
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,905
Well, you know.

185
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,945
No, I don't.

186
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:20,145
Oh, my God. Er...

187
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,226
I mean, I beg your pardon, my lady.

188
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:25,305
But you see I can't just go into a
shop and buy something.

189
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:27,266
What if I were recognised?

190
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,865
But I wouldn't know what to buy.

191
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,826
I've thought of that.

192
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:36,305
I have a copy of Marie Stopes's
book.

193
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:38,345
It tells you everything.

194
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:41,265
Well, won't he take care of it?

195
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,706
I don't think one should rely on a
man in that department, do you?

196
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:48,425
But suppose I'm recognised?
But you won't be?

197
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,465
And even if you are, you're married.

198
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:52,545
With a living husband.

199
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,506
Why shouldn't you buy one?

200
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,625
Is it true that Lady Rose wants his
lordship to buy a wireless?

201
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:04,905
Whether he will or not's another
matter.

202
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:06,985
I like the idea of a wireless.

203
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,905
To hear people singing and talking in
London and all sorts.

204
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:12,985
What's so good about that when you
can go to a music hall in York?

205
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:15,065
I'd rather hear a live singer.

206
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:18,305
If you're looking for Miss Baxter,
she's still upstairs.

207
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:21,106
Why do you have to make everything
sound so nasty?

208
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,385
I'm nasty about Miss Baxter because
she came here to help me and she's
broken her word.

209
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,346
I doubt that's how she'd put it.

210
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:31,905
Do you think with her past she'd
come near a house like this?

211
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:34,465
She'd be lucky to get work in a
public laundry.

212
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,786
I'm sure she's grateful. Then she's
a funny way of showing it.

213
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,906
You do know she's a thief.

214
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:46,665
Stole her mistresses jewels.

215
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,745
There must be more to it than that.

216
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:51,985
No. She sneaked up to the bedroom,
snatched up the pieces,

217
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:55,505
pearl necklaces, diamond bracelets,
put them in her pockets.

218
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,346
Then tried to make it look as if
someone had broken in.

219
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:04,425
She was obviously unsuccessful.
They gave her five years but she
only served three.

220
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:08,825
Came out a few months before I
brought her up here so don't say she
doesn't owe me.

221
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:10,945
Has Mrs Bates come down yet?
Not yet.

222
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:14,665
We were just discussing your friend.
Miss Baxter.

223
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,705
Is she my friend particularly?

224
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:18,825
She seems to think so.

225
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:24,025
I know you mean to lead me into
further inquiry but I couldn't care
less what you think, Thomas.

226
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:26,145
On that subject or any other.
I agree.

227
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:28,225
No, you don't.

228
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:31,386
Cos you listened to the story,
didn't you?

229
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,946
What was that about?

230
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:42,986
Oh, nothing.

231
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:59,669
I must remember to organise a car to
meet Charles Blake and his friend.

232
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:04,003
They'll be here at teatime. Are we a
hotel that never presents a bill?

233
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,179
You've already made that joke.

234
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,098
There you are. I need your advice.
How flattering. What is it?

235
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,498
Should I go?
No. No, it's not a secret.

236
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:19,219
I've been talking to Mr Drewe. Did
you know they've taken in a child?

237
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,260
The daughter of a friend who died.
How kind of them.

238
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:28,978
The girl is very endearing and I
think I'd like to be involved in her
future. To help her in some way.

239
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:31,139
Maybe with school fees or something.

240
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,018
I've money from my articles and
Grandpapa's trust.

241
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,218
Has Drewe put you up to this?

242
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:39,859
No. But I'd like to take an active
interest.

243
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,818
It'd be good for me.

244
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,698
It's your money. Do what you like
with it.

245
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,698
But you can't just give the child up
when you get bored.

246
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,818
I won't get bored.

247
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:56,299
Cousin Robert, did you see this
article about how wirelesses are
getting cheaper and more reliable?

248
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,419
No. I just thought it was
interesting.

249
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,500
No.

250
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:07,618
What's Mr Branson's pal doing down
here?

251
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:09,698
Why? Don't you approve?

252
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:12,338
Last time she came, she gave them
all an earful.

253
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:16,178
I cannot solve the mystery. How are
you getting on with the memorial?

254
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:19,699
His Lordship is resisting the idea
of the garden.

255
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,938
You don't agree with him?
Well, as it happens, I do.

256
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,018
What? I don't believe in your garden
of remembrance.

257
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,098
In a town, maybe.

258
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:34,899
But the Yorkshire scenery is our
garden of remembrance.

259
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:40,978
I'd prefer to see a memorial at the
heart of village life so we'd pass
it on the way to church or the shop

260
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:44,738
and give a thought to the boys who
fell. You surprise me, Mrs Hughes.

261
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:49,218
I was disappointed in his Lordship,
but I'm more disappointed in you.

262
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:52,499
Every relationship has its ups and
downs.

263
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,458
Yes, miss.

264
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,419
Erm...

265
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,779
Is there a lady I could deal with?

266
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,299
Very good, madam. If you'll just
wait there.

267
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:21,699
I've not quite made up my mind.
Why not serve the gentleman first?

268
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,899
That's kind of you. Packet of safety
razor blades, please.

269
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,579
That's sixpence, sir.
Thank you.

270
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:37,018
If we keep this up we'll have another
customer along soon.

271
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,579
Yes. Erm...

272
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,539
I would like to buy...

273
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,619
..one of these.

274
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,858
I can see you're married.

275
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:53,138
I am married, yes. But you don't
with for any more children.

276
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,178
That's it. That's right.

277
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:57,139
There is always abstinence.

278
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,618
Of course there is but...

279
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,458
I don't want to take any risks
because of my health.

280
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:08,339
Oh, I see. Well, that does put a
slightly different colour on it.

281
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,779
Three and eleven.

282
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:18,818
Keep the change.
What about the instructions?

283
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,779
They can be very difficult to manage.
I'm sure it's perfect. Thank you.

284
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:29,658
I'll take half a crown a lesson.
That's five shillings a week.

285
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,858
You can use my sitting room if you
need somewhere private.

286
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,938
See you after school. Goodbye.

287
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:38,018
Wait a minute! That is Daisy's
busiest time.

288
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:41,578
I can't come any earlier. Oh, well,
then. Perhaps - I'm excited.

289
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,298
But I'll pay. It's not right that you
should waste your money on me.

290
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,218
No, I want to pay.
That's a nice thing you're doing.

291
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:52,418
Is it? Well, I think I've been a
damn fool and doubled me workload!

292
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:55,058
I wondered who was in here.

293
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,178
We're just sorting out some things
for Rose's refugees.

294
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:00,258
Poor Rose.

295
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,659
Why are you so against getting a
wireless?

296
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,938
I wish she'd just say it. "Cousin
Robert, please buy a wireless for Downton."

297
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:09,858
I wouldn't mind.
That's because you're American.

298
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,339
I find the whole idea a kind of
thief of life.

299
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:18,018
People waste hours huddled around a
box listening to someone burbling
inanities from somewhere else.

300
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,098
But surely now with the latest news

301
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,258
and it must be a boon for the old.
What do you think, Bates?

302
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,938
I can't see the Dowager with a
wireless, my lady.

303
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,978
It's a fad. It won't last.

304
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,939
Oh, no. Not that one.

305
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,578
This is nice.

306
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,778
Lord Grantham said it was the
coldest house in Yorkshire.

307
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:47,858
Ah, you're here. I'm so pleased.

308
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,899
How charming it is.
Oh, we do our best.

309
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,778
I know it's the wrong time of year
but I would love to see the gardens.

310
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,618
Shouldn't we allow Lord Merton to
tell us how he's planned our visit?

311
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,618
Of course.
It is his house.

312
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,579
Yes. I know that.

313
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,258
You've been very quiet all day.

314
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,819
Have I?
I wish you'd tell me what it is.

315
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,059
Very well.

316
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:25,738
Last night Mr Barrow chose to give
me an account of your history.

317
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,818
He was bound to, sooner or later.

318
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:30,938
His version is a bleak one, which
will not surprise you.

319
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:34,338
What did he say? Well, for a start,
he seemed to suggest

320
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,858
that you were in some sort
of... privileged position.

321
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,538
I was a trusted senior ladies maid
to a good woman

322
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,418
in a rich and respectable household.

323
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:49,858
But then he said that... you just
took your employer's jewels.

324
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,579
Snatched them up and put them into
your pocket.

325
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,738
I stole a pearl necklace with a ruby
clasp.

326
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,898
Two diamond bracelets and four
rings.

327
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:02,179
Did he tell you I tried to pretend
it was a burglary?

328
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:07,618
Well, then. I think you have all the
relevant information.

329
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:09,698
There must be something more.

330
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:13,858
There must have been a cause, a
reason for you to do such a thing.

331
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:19,298
What sort of cause? I don't know.
Someone that you cared for

332
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:23,618
needed money for an emergency and
you were desperate to help.

333
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:28,578
I was a common thief, Mr Molesley.
A convicted criminal. A jailbird.

334
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:31,219
I don't believe you.
Because you don't want to.

335
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,659
I would only say that I am not that
person now.

336
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,858
When you've finished your tea, we
can walk the terraces, if you like.

337
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:51,938
That sounds ideal.

338
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:54,778
I recently read a book on the
science of quarantine

339
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,898
and I've been looking forward to
discussing it with you.

340
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:00,018
We mustn't bore Lady Grantham.

341
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:03,938
Oh, you're right. You see, I need
your guiding hand to keep me in check.

342
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:08,778
Mrs Crawley is never happier than when
she has a chance to use her guiding hand.

343
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,739
Are you, dear?

344
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,178
How pretty this room is.
Thank you.

345
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,498
Mama re-did all these rooms in the
'80s. She had good taste, I think.

346
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,858
Is one allowed to brag about one's
mother?

347
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,698
So the late Lady Merton didn't
change it?

348
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,578
Ada didn't use it much.

349
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:28,698
She thought it was draughty being so
near the front door.

350
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,659
I suppose she had a point.

351
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:34,418
If you don't like being quite so
near the front door.

352
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,018
Well, I think it's enchanting.

353
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,058
It's a woman's room, though.

354
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,138
Of course.

355
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,698
The library and the dining room are
masculine

356
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:47,618
the drawing rooms and the music rooms
are feminine. Or so I was taught.

357
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:51,498
I meant that it needs a woman's
presence to make sense of it.

358
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:55,099
When I'm on my own in here I feel
like a bull in a china shop.

359
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,138
Why aren't you going with her?
What?

360
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:03,899
With Lady Mary? She'll be away for
almost a week.

361
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,298
Yes but they're driving round. They
don't know where they'll stay or anything.

362
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,818
She and Lady Portsmouth? Yes.
It doesn't sound like Lady Mary.

363
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:13,898
It sounds a bit bohemian.

364
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,338
I suppose she's allowed to get away
from it all if she wants to.

365
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,819
Like anyone.
Yes. I suppose she is.

366
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,338
What do you make of Edith's burst of
generosity with the Drewe girl?

367
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:31,018
In all probability her beloved
Gregson is dead and she has to sit
and watch her sisters' children play.

368
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:33,778
She wants someone to love. It's as
simple as that.

369
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:37,538
The problem will come when she has a
child of her own to distract her.

370
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,898
Let's cross that bridge when we come
to it.

371
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:43,299
And let's hope the Drewes don't get
sick of her in the meantime.

372
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,979
Was it ghastly?
I didn't know where to look.

373
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,338
But when I thought about it
afterwards it seemed unfair to
punish me like that.

374
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,858
Suppose I had eight children and
didn't want any more? Wouldn't I
have the right?

375
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,818
I agree completely. I feel like
going back and ordering a baker's dozen.

376
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,779
One's enough for now.

377
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:07,539
Mr Bricker.
This is wonderfully kind of you.

378
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,618
You can see the painting now or
after dinner or wait until tomorrow.
It's entirely up to you.

379
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:15,458
I think I'd like a glimpse of it
later this evening.

380
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:18,818
I can take a proper look in the
daylight with my wits about me.

381
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,258
You look as if you've spent the
winter away from these shores.

382
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,178
I've been in Alexandria.
Really? I don't envy you.

383
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,059
I'm not very good at abroad.
she's in the kitchen?

384
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,738
I don't know what room she's in. She was giving
a lesson to Daisy and she's still here.

385
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,898
Shouldn't we invite her to dinner?
As she's your friend.

386
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:39,418
I don't think Lord Grantham would
like it. Not after last time.

387
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,939
But it seems terribly grand and
unfriendly not to. I'll ask Cora.

388
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:48,938
How are you? I haven't seen you for
ages.

389
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:52,098
Have I neglected you? I'm sorry.

390
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:57,378
No need to apologise. Although I
think you might perhaps have told me
I was not the lucky winner.

391
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,618
Why would you say that?
Because it's perfectly obvious.

392
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:03,098
Well, I don't seem to have broken
your heart.

393
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,059
You sound disappointed.

394
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,858
Who is this fellow, anyway.

395
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,938
Simon Bricker? Just a chap I know.

396
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,339
He was talking about his book in
Boodle's.

397
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,419
I mentioned the painting here and
that was it. He's very brown. Lucky chap.

398
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:22,018
Charles, I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

399
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:27,178
It's just only lately that I've
started to come out of the mist.

400
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,538
And the mist is clearing around the
lithe and supple figure of Tony Gillingham.

401
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:35,858
Maybe. Well... Good luck to you both.

402
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:37,938
I mean it.

403
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:41,579
That's why I came here. So I could
wish you luck in person.

404
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,739
We should give her the option.
If you're certain.

405
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,578
I don't want to feel I'm imposing.
Don't be silly. This is your home.

406
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:54,338
Where's Tom going?
Miss Bunting is downstairs.

407
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:57,578
What? She's been teaching one of the
maids in the kitchen.

408
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,179
Tom's gone to ask if she'd like some
dinner. You're not serious.

409
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,058
She's the first friend Tom's made
that has nothing to do with us and
we must respect that.

410
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,938
So every time we entertain we must
invite this tinpot Rosa Luxemburg.

411
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:12,018
Who's she?

412
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:15,138
A German communist who was shot and
thrown in the canal.

413
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,179
We wouldn't wish that on Miss
Bunting.

414
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:22,258
I didn't see the time. I've left
Mrs Patmore cooking for everyone.

415
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,379
Tell her from me, you'll prove a
talented mathematician.

416
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,738
Whose idea was it to ask me? Yours?

417
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:35,938
No, it was Rose. Although it's a new
sensation for me not to be alone in
my opinions at the table.

418
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:39,019
If I've encouraged you to stand your
ground, I'm glad.

419
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:44,298
But I don't feel like putting either
myself or Lord Grantham through
another test of strength.

420
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:46,619
Please thank them and say good night
for me.

421
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,379
I don't need a car. I'm perfectly
happy to walk.

422
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,458
When in Rome.

423
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,618
But do you ever think you might have
been in Rome too long?

424
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:01,498
Why do you say that? You needn't
always do what the Romans do.

425
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:03,699
There's more in you than that.
I wonder.

426
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:08,539
You could do anything you want if
you put your mind to it.

427
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:15,378
I can't deny it. It's good to hear
you talk as if I had a real future.

428
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:17,418
You do have a future. But not here.

429
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,538
Not with these people.

430
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:24,338
Your link to them is Cybil but from
the way you talk I think she was
unique in this family.

431
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:28,098
Free of prejudice, free from narrow
thinking. That's true enough.

432
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:31,978
She was unique. I just want you to
remember that you are the man

433
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:35,098
who tempted her over the park wall
to run away to freedom.

434
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,178
I was that man.

435
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,298
But I'm not sure I can be that man
again.

436
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,018
You can be. I know it.

437
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,979
Good night.

438
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,578
Where's your friend?

439
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,738
She couldn't stay. She had to get
home.

440
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:00,699
What a relief.

441
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,333
What were you doing in Alexandria?

442
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:14,308
Escaping the winter and looking at
beautiful things.

443
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:17,227
Beautiful and very ancient things.

444
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:21,067
I don't agree. You're collecting
clothes for the Russian refugees.

445
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:24,427
I said no at first because, well, it
didn't feel terribly me.

446
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:28,148
But then I thought about them
leading their lives before the fall.

447
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,507
Doing everything you would do.
Exactly.

448
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:34,147
Dancing and shopping and seeing
their friends and then suddenly

449
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:37,147
being thrown out to fend for
themselves in the jungle.

450
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,307
Well, I thought I had to help if I
could.

451
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:43,147
It's lucky Miss Bunting refused our
invitation or she'd give tell us

452
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:45,707
how they're aristocrats and they
deserve it.

453
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,987
She believes the old regime was
unjust.

454
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:53,708
She hopes the new system will be an
improvement. Does that make her a
firebrand? Because I agree with her.

455
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:57,148
Don't acts of savagery forfeit
sympathy for the perpetrators?

456
00:27:57,388 --> 00:28:01,468
It was terrible, of course. But the
English killed King Charles the first

457
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:04,587
to create a balance between the
throne and parliament.

458
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:08,307
I didn't kill him personally. I
didn't shoot the Imperial Family.

459
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:12,667
Goodness. Is this what they call a
lively exchange of views?

460
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:15,308
It's about now that Papa usually
fetches his gun.

461
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:19,387
Mary, don't tease Mr Bricker.
He's come to see a painting

462
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:21,907
and finds himself in the middle of a
civil war.

463
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,027
I don't think we'll split tonight.

464
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:27,867
They'll only fight if we do. You want to
see the picture and delay is torment.

465
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,828
You read my mind.

466
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:35,348
Carson, how are we to move forward
with the memorial?

467
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:37,707
I suppose your position has not
changed.

468
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:41,948
I can see that I'm losing. I would
rather be convinced than defeated, my lord.

469
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:43,987
And I am not yet convinced.

470
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,067
Cousin Robert?

471
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:49,107
Did you see that the King is going
to speak on the wireless?

472
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:51,307
It was in the paper today.
Don't be silly.

473
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:54,947
No, it's true. For the opening of
the British Empire Exhibition.

474
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:58,787
It's being broadcast on the 23rd.
I just thought you'd like to know.

475
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:01,307
Is this true, Carson?
I believe so, my lord.

476
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:03,667
Talking about the Empire too.
I wonder.

477
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:08,148
If the King wants to use the wireless to speak
to his people maybe we have to listen.

478
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:10,267
I wouldn't say that, my lord.

479
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:15,748
Is it not a case of the King being
forced into accepting a humiliating
assignment by his ministers?

480
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:19,387
Are you saying the King is a weak
man, Carson? Never that, my lord.

481
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:22,027
But even kings must bow to pressure
sometimes.

482
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:25,587
And should we not support him in his
hour of endurance?

483
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:28,347
Oh, cheer up. We can always hire one.

484
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:31,748
Surely we won't be corrupted if it's
only in the house for a day.

485
00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:43,028
They said you were out here.

486
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:47,028
I thought I'd get some air before we
have our dinner.

487
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:50,227
I've let you down, haven't I?

488
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:52,788
No, I wouldn't say so.

489
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:56,587
You are who you are.

490
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,267
You made choices and you paid the
price for them.

491
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:03,027
Still, I'm not who you thought me.

492
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:05,827
It is not for me to pass sentence.

493
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:08,227
You've had enough of that.

494
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:10,307
I've changed.

495
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,147
I'm different now. I wish you could
believe me.

496
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,227
But you won't tell me why you did it

497
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:20,907
because I am not persuaded you could
have acted on your own.

498
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:25,987
Maybe not. But I don't want to talk
about that.

499
00:30:25,988 --> 00:30:30,948
Because, alone or not, in the end,
I made the choice to steal.

500
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:35,267
And there's no point trying to pass
the sin along.

501
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,347
Then you won't allow me an opinion.

502
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:40,747
You see, you wouldn't have done it.
No matter who asked you to.

503
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:42,708
No matter what the provocation.

504
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:48,347
I don't claim that. If a man must
watch his loved ones starve,

505
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,387
who's to say what he'll do?

506
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:52,427
But I wasn't starving, was I?

507
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:54,388
Believe me.

508
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:02,428
I'd give a limb to rewrite that
whole chapter of my life.

509
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:06,108
But I can't, Mr Molesley.

510
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:09,388
Even for you.

511
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:13,708
I can't.

512
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:25,627
Do you have a clear record of how it
came to be here?

513
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:27,707
The second Earl was our collector.

514
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:31,227
He bought it when he was quite a
young man on his grand tour.

515
00:31:31,228 --> 00:31:35,107
Which was when? 1789. We've a letter
from his mother.

516
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:39,468
She's heard about the fall of the
Bastille and her son was going
through France.

517
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:41,507
She sent it by special messenger.

518
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:44,547
Mothers. Some things never change.

519
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:46,508
Lots of things never change.

520
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:55,188
Tomorrow I can show you some other
pictures he brought back if you have time.

521
00:31:55,189 --> 00:31:58,547
I have all the time in the world.
I should enjoy it very much.

522
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:01,227
There's coffee in the drawing room.
Thank you.

523
00:32:01,228 --> 00:32:03,267
We'll be right in.

524
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,228
Isis, come here, girl.

525
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:11,067
I can't believe it. When she
explained how it all worked,

526
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:14,907
I could see it at once. Well, this
is our lady of the numbers.

527
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:18,788
If I'd had a teacher like her,
things might have turned out different.

528
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:21,227
They've not turned out so badly,
have they?

529
00:32:21,228 --> 00:32:23,987
I'm glad to see some smiles at the
end of a long day.

530
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:27,507
Daisy's singing the praises of Miss
Bunting and her teaching.

531
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:31,267
I should keep it to yourself. She's
not a favourite with Mr Carson.

532
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:35,988
Why, what's she done? It's not what
she's done it's what he calls her
dangerous ideas.

533
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:38,547
Dangerous or not I'm sure they're
good ideas.

534
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:41,107
Careful, he'll think you've been
infected.

535
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:46,468
What's this? Daisy's worried she's
been infected with a cold from the
delivery boy.

536
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:55,708
Oh, his lordship and I are walking
down to the village tomorrow to look
at possible sites.

537
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:01,268
Erm, I don't like it when we're not
on the same side.

538
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:05,747
We're different people, Mr Carson.
We can't always agree.

539
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:07,787
I know.

540
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:09,748
But I don't like it.

541
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:18,067
I can't make a decision, Baxter,
until you tell me the whole truth.

542
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:20,147
I have, my lady.

543
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:23,548
I don't mean you tried to shield
yourself, quite the contrary.

544
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:29,027
To be honest, I don't know why I
haven't dismissed you out of hand.

545
00:33:29,028 --> 00:33:32,867
I employ a jewel thief to look after
my jewels. It doesn't make sense!

546
00:33:32,868 --> 00:33:36,387
I don't know what to say. I should
sack you for just concealing it.

547
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,987
Should I take this as my dismissal?

548
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:42,868
I don't know. I don't know why not
but I don't know.

549
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:49,707
What was the matter with Tom?

550
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:54,628
Papa will blame his friend Miss
Bunting for filling his ears with
poison but I'm not sure.

551
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:58,387
He has so little life away from us.
He's had no life since Cybil died.

552
00:33:58,388 --> 00:34:02,227
But I've a feeling he's turning back
into who he really is.

553
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:04,948
Is that a bad thing?
For us, maybe. But not for him.

554
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:08,868
Well, I'm going up.
Good night, you two.

555
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:13,827
Do you think there's a chance
cousin Robert might get a wireless?

556
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:17,227
Well, if he won't get one for the
King, your cause is hopeless.

557
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:19,188
That's true.

558
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,227
I loved Rose's definition of
ordinary life.

559
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,828
Dancing and shopping and seeing one's
friends.

560
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:30,507
I'm going to bed too.

561
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:32,468
I'm worn out.

562
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:36,828
But I hope you'll be happy for me.
If it is Tony in the end.

563
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:45,827
Nothing will make me happier than
seeing you happy.

564
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:49,147
But please be absolutely sure before
you decide.

565
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:52,307
Why do you say that?
Because you're cleverer than he is.

566
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,667
That might have worked in the last
century

567
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:58,627
when ladies had to hide their brains
behind good manners and breeding.

568
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:02,187
But not now. I don't agree. I think
Tony is quite as clever as I am.

569
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,667
Then one of us is right...
and one is wrong.

570
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:10,867
I'm not some overheated housemaid drooling
over a photograph of Douglas Fairbanks.

571
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:14,587
Plantagenets are as susceptible as
housemaids when it comes to sex.

572
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:17,387
Are we talking about sex or love?

573
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:21,108
That is a question mankind has
wrestled with since the dawn of time.

574
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:23,068
Good night.

575
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:30,627
Poor Tom. He's nothing more than a
ventriloquist dummy

576
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,267
for that terrible woman's ideas to
come spewing out of his mouth.

577
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:37,787
Maybe she's given him confidence to
say what he really thinks.

578
00:35:37,788 --> 00:35:41,827
Not to sit in silence listening to a
thousands things he disagrees with.

579
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:45,668
She'll steal him away from us. She's
pulling him back to the other side.

580
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:49,227
I hope not. But if he feels he has
to go, that's what he must do.

581
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:51,867
Well, he's not taking Sybbie.
Don't be silly.

582
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:55,547
I mean it. I am not having Cybil's
only child

583
00:35:55,548 --> 00:35:57,627
snatched from everyone she loves

584
00:35:57,628 --> 00:36:00,307
to be brought up by some harpie in
an American sewer!

585
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:03,547
If the time comes, then we will talk
to Tom.

586
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:06,467
And I suggest we try to be a little
more calm about it.

587
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:09,987
For heaven's sake! Can't I be angry
when our eldest grandchild

588
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:12,548
is about to be stolen from us for
ever?

589
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:17,787
And tell your friend Bricker to stop
flirting with Isis.

590
00:36:17,788 --> 00:36:22,868
There is nothing more ill-bred than
trying to steal the affections of
someone's else's dog!

591
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:24,907
Very well. I'll tell him.

592
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:26,868
To stop flirting.

593
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:31,107
I think I've put everything in.

594
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,427
Your packet's here, my lady.
Thank you.

595
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:36,547
I don't think there's anything too
difficult to fasten.

596
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,508
Lord Gillingham can always help.

597
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:42,227
Are you certain you know what you're
doing?

598
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:44,188
I believe so.

599
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:50,547
Anna, the way things are going,

600
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:53,507
life will be lived in much closer
quarters in future.

601
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:58,267
My grandparents lived in vast rooms
surrounded by staff.

602
00:36:58,268 --> 00:37:00,868
If they disagreed, they'd hardly have
known it.

603
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:03,628
But it won't be like that for us.

604
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:07,827
I must be sure I'm right to want this
man.

605
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:09,788
As my friend...

606
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:12,307
..as my lover...

607
00:37:12,308 --> 00:37:14,347
as my husband.

608
00:37:14,348 --> 00:37:16,308
Well, I think it's a big risk.

609
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,987
Please. I can't be lectured twice in
one evening.

610
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,507
I've already had a ticking off from
Mr Blake.

611
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:27,228
You didn't tell him. Only that I
thought Lord Gillingham was the one.

612
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:30,507
The point is I want to marry again.

613
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:33,388
And I absolutely don't want to
divorce.

614
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,148
Well, I wish you luck, my lady.

615
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:53,419
Morning.

616
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:59,515
There you are. I'm afraid it's the
perfect position for me.

617
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:04,206
Millions of men killed, my lord,
and we'll remember them

618
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:07,567
with a stone cross for women to stop
by and gossip?

619
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:12,448
I prefer to say that as people go
about their business, we remind them
of the men who died.

620
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:16,168
They gave their lives for our
freedom and we'll remember them with

621
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:20,047
a convenient step to sit for a
moment and tie up your shoelace.

622
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:25,568
Afternoon, my lord. Hello,
Mrs Elkith. What are you up to?

623
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,647
I'm just waiting for our Robbie.

624
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:30,968
He likes to say hello to his father
sometimes after school.

625
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:33,327
It's good of you to make a special
journey.

626
00:38:33,328 --> 00:38:36,247
Oh, no. He comes with me when I'm on
the way to the shop

627
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:39,647
or the post office and takes a
chance to visit the grave then.

628
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:44,128
My Bob was a lovely man and a
wonderful dad and I don't want our
Robbie to forget him.

629
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:46,727
Not if I can help it.

630
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:50,127
No. No, of course you don't.

631
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:54,007
Thank you, Mrs Elkith. Your words
have made quite an impression on me.

632
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:56,047
Don't you agree, Carson?

633
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:59,328
I do, yes. Quite an impression.

634
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:02,608
My lord.

635
00:39:09,688 --> 00:39:12,687
Why is it called a wireless when
there's so many wires?

636
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,648
I don't know.

637
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:28,647
Nothing's happening.

638
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,608
It's just warming up, my lady.

639
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,848
Is that Jack Hylton?!

640
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:43,448
Oh, golly, isn't this thrilling?!

641
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:46,887
What's this I see?

642
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:50,647
Servants loitering in the hall with
her ladyship due at any moment.

643
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:54,007
Look at that. If I touch it,
will I get a shock?

644
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:56,967
You'll only get a shock if you
listen to it.

645
00:39:56,968 --> 00:40:00,047
I think it's exciting.
We're catching up, Mr Carson.

646
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:04,208
Whether you like it or not, Downton
is catching up with the times we lived in.

647
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:06,888
That is exactly what I am afraid of.

648
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:21,648
Hello.

649
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:28,087
Before I go, I hope we're all united
in the plan.

650
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:32,328
It's very kind of you, my lady.
Isn't it, Margie? Very kind.

651
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:36,928
I just want every opportunity for
little Marigold.

652
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:40,368
It's very generous. And you won't
mind me being part of her life?

653
00:40:42,368 --> 00:40:46,968
She needs a chance to dream. You
mustn't fill her head with too many
dreams, my lady.

654
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:50,367
This is a wonderful opportunity
you're offering. Thank you.

655
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:52,328
I'll see you soon.

656
00:40:56,408 --> 00:40:59,008
Bye-bye.
Bye.

657
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:09,527
What's the matter?
Why should anything be the matter?

658
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:11,607
You could have been more gracious.

659
00:41:11,608 --> 00:41:14,167
I don't want this place to be her
doll's house.

660
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:16,727
And Marigold her doll. To be kissed
and petted

661
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:18,967
and cast aside when she loses
interest.

662
00:41:18,968 --> 00:41:22,087
She won't lose interest.
How can you be sure? I am sure.

663
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:25,727
I'll be in the yard. Tell me when
the food's ready.

664
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:27,807
Hands, please.

665
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,007
"It gives me the greatest pleasure
and satisfaction

666
00:41:33,008 --> 00:41:36,767
to come here today with the Queen

667
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:41,607
for the purpose of opening the
British Empire Exhibition."

668
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:46,047
I suppose he can't hear us.
No, it doesn't work like that.

669
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,168
..the board of management."

670
00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:57,888
Miss Mary Crawley.

671
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:02,647
Welcome to Liverpool, Miss Crawley.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

672
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:04,608
I'm sure I will.

673
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:31,727
Well, you have heard the voice of
His Majesty King George V.

674
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:35,287
What do you think, Carson? Mrs
Hughes, the King on the wireless?

675
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:37,847
I prefer to think of him on his
throne, my lord.

676
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:41,887
To me it's a good thing. To make him
less of a myth, more of a man.

677
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:44,928
Well, I hope you've all taken
something of value from it.

678
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,727
Mrs Hughes is right. The radio
somehow makes the King more real.

679
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:58,007
The monarchy has thrived on magic
and mystery.

680
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:02,367
Strip them away and people may think
the royal family is just like us.

681
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:04,447
Well, would that be so wrong?

682
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,488
Well, only if they want to stay at
Buckingham Palace.

683
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:11,808
It was as though he was right in the
room with us.

684
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,567
Cheer up, Mr Barrow.

685
00:43:20,568 --> 00:43:22,608
Weren't you pleased to hear the King?

686
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:26,887
I expect it's difficult for you with
Jimmy gone.

687
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:29,407
We all need a special friend from
time to time.

688
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:32,727
I wasn't special to him. Not truly.

689
00:43:32,728 --> 00:43:35,527
I don't agree. I think he liked you.

690
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:38,367
Maybe. A little.

691
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,167
But I don't think I'm very likeable
to people here.

692
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:43,247
Do you want to be?

693
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,368
There are times when I'd like to
belong?

694
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:49,808
Does that sound funny?

695
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:52,568
Not to me. Not at all.

696
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:07,087
Shall I have it collected in the
morning, my lord?

697
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:10,847
Must he? Do we need to get rid of it
in quite such a hurry now it's here.

698
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:14,367
Put it in the small library.
Thank you for changing your mind.

699
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:16,487
I wasn't aware I'd decided against
it.

700
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,567
You can clear this for now.

701
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:21,968
It's such a pity Mary had to miss it
for a boring sketching trip.

702
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:41,527
It's mad not to give a false name.

703
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:44,768
Always make a lie as truthful as
possible.

704
00:44:45,688 --> 00:44:49,407
If you're seen, you have the right
name, you're alone in your room.

705
00:44:49,408 --> 00:44:51,448
And why shouldn't you be in
Liverpool?

706
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:57,287
How did you manage to get the rooms
connected?

707
00:44:57,288 --> 00:44:59,248
Well, I'm not a complete halfwit.

708
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:02,048
Nor, happily, is the manager.

709
00:45:03,688 --> 00:45:06,647
So, what's the plan?

710
00:45:06,648 --> 00:45:11,727
It's a simple one. We'll go down to
Church Street for a delicious dinner.

711
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:15,167
After which, we'll come back.

712
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:17,207
And... make love?

713
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,247
Exactly.

714
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:21,327
We'll make love all night.

715
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:24,568
And, in fact, for as long as either
of us has any stamina left.

716
00:45:25,448 --> 00:45:27,408
And who can say fairer than that?

717
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:38,367
I meant to ask how you got on this
morning.

718
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,407
Oh, we've settled it.

719
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:42,368
It's going to be in the village.

720
00:45:43,128 --> 00:45:45,807
Well, I hope you're not too upset.

721
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:47,887
I only asked to be convinced.

722
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:50,407
My walk through the village
convinced me.

723
00:45:50,408 --> 00:45:53,767
And... there's a bonus.
What's that?

724
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:57,607
It puts us back in agreement,
Mrs Hughes.

725
00:45:57,608 --> 00:46:00,608
I'm not comfortable when you and I
are not in agreement.

726
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:04,447
You're very flattering.

727
00:46:04,448 --> 00:46:08,248
With talk like that you make me want
to check to see that my hair's tidy.

728
00:46:08,408 --> 00:46:10,968
Get away with you.
No, I mean it.

729
00:46:13,048 --> 00:46:17,487
There's a policeman to see you,
Mr Carson. A policeman?

730
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:19,687
It's just Sergeant Willis,
Mr Carson.

731
00:46:19,688 --> 00:46:21,767
Hello, Mr Willis.

732
00:46:21,768 --> 00:46:25,967
Thank you, Mr Barrow. You're
scaremongering has not succeeded.

733
00:46:25,968 --> 00:46:28,647
That'll be all. Sit down, Mr Willis.

734
00:46:28,648 --> 00:46:30,767
Have a cup of tea.

735
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:36,287
How can I help you?
Well, it's an odd business but we
may as well get down to it.

736
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:41,607
A man stayed here last year, Mr Alex
Green. Worked for Lord Gillingham.

737
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:46,167
I remember him well. Why wouldn't I when
he died so very tragically not long after?

738
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:50,888
Well, that's all I need. I've just been told
to check that you remember him. Thank you.

739
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:54,207
And to give warning that we might
need to ask some questions.

740
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,247
I don't understand.

741
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:58,367
Well, something's turned up.

742
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:02,807
And before they take it further, they're
trying to establish its significance.

743
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:04,768
But what is that? What's turned up?

744
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:07,448
A witness.

745
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:22,687
What would it be like to go somewhere
no-one knows us? Why do you say that?

746
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:27,327
If a man seduced me, I would not let
any grass grow under his feet.

747
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:30,848
I want you to tell me the missing
element of your story? If I don't?

748
00:47:31,288 --> 00:47:33,727
She can't have our child and that's
flat!

749
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:36,407
Allow me to present Prince Kuragin.

750
00:47:36,408 --> 00:47:38,768
Goodness! Granny has a past.

751
00:47:38,893 --> 00:48:12,880
