1
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,332
- Cora.
- Hello, Rosamund.

2
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,500
You made good time.

3
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,844
- I say!
- What?

4
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:05,930
Some man has opened a nudist colony at Wickford in Essex,

5
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,474
called the Moonella Group.

6
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,226
What do you mean, a man has opened a colony in Essex?

7
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,269
Not that sort of colony, Mama.

8
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:14,937
It's for people who want to take all their clothes off.

9
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:18,315
In Essex? Isn't it terribly damp?

10
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:22,110
- Would that make a difference? - Well,
yes, if you had no clothes on.

11
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:24,028
Well, I think it's a mad idea.

12
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:27,239
Oh, I doubt they were aiming it at you.

13
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:30,408
I wanted to come after Mary told me about the farmer's child

14
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,618
you're taking such an interest in.

15
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,995
Come to my room when you're changed.

16
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:38,456
- How long are you here for?
- About a week, if I'm allowed.

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,709
Good. We're giving a bash for my Deputy Lieutenants on Friday.

18
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,252
You can stay and help.

19
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:45,628
I'm afraid I'll be away on Thursday night.

20
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,297
It's another of my Lord Loot things.

21
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,634
I'm guest of honour at a dinner for all
the Yorkshire-based commanding officers.

22
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:54,969
- You're staying the night?
- It's in Sheffield,

23
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:57,846
and it'll be very late, so it seems sensible.

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,890
You'll just have to make do with Cora.

25
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:02,058
And Edith and Tom and Rose.

26
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:05,895
What news of your suitor?

27
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:07,771
I haven't heard from him lately.

28
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:11,482
Have you decided what answer you're going to give him yet?

29
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:15,027
Well, I think I should tell him
before I tell you. Wouldn't you agree?

30
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,447
Ellen Terry has nothing on you when
it comes to stringing out a moment.

31
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:25,702
- Oh, are you busy?
- No, no, no. Come in.

32
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:27,745
How can I help?

33
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:29,788
Would you like me to leave?

34
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:35,085
Oh, I'd love to think I had a secret that was
too indelicate for a lady's ear, but I haven't.

35
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:38,629
No, I've got some good news, for a change.

36
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,964
An old aunt's died.

37
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:44,216
No, that's not the good news, but she made old bones.

38
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,635
- Which is the main thing.
- Well, the point is,

39
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,470
she's left me a bit of money.

40
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:51,723
- Ah. - It's a few hundred quid,
more than I've ever saved.

41
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,474
I am glad for you.

42
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:57,394
Well, she was married to a baker and he did well,
but they had no children.

43
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,187
How nice of her to choose you.

44
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,190
Well, I think it was in memory of my dad, more than anything.

45
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:04,149
She and he were very close -

46
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:08,027
And you want my advice on what to
do with the inheritance? Is that it?

47
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:09,362
It is.

48
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:13,114
You'd do better asking Mr Branson's advice. Or Dr Clarkson's.

49
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,157
She's asking mine.

50
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,994
But we live so out of the way here.

51
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:20,537
You need to talk to someone who's still in the game.

52
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,539
I'll give it some thought, Mrs Patmore.

53
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:28,043
And now, if you'll allow me, I will go up and ring the gong.

54
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:34,548
Come and sit here and we can talk.

55
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,675
I'm not going to eat you.

56
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,426
But you are going to chew me up.

57
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,971
Why not just tell me about the dear little farmer's daughter?

58
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,849
- What did Mary say?
- No more than that.

59
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:50,269
You knew I'd bring her back.

60
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:52,312
I feared it.

61
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:55,898
And I still feel very sorry for poor Mrs Schroder.

62
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:59,359
I wrote to her. She told me she's adopted another baby.

63
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:01,862
Then she has solved her problem,

64
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:05,114
have you solved yours?

65
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:10,702
Am I at least going to be allowed to see the girl?

66
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,162
- Do you want to?
- Of course.

67
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:17,499
I gave up ten months of my life to make
sure she came safely into the world.

68
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,795
The trouble is, the farmer's wife, Mrs Drewe,

69
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,588
she just thinks I'm a nuisance.

70
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:28,632
She doesn't want me to see Marigold.

71
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:34,429
So, we have a situation of infinite danger to your reputation,

72
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:38,641
which brings you no emotional reward to compensate.

73
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:46,814
- Are we the first down?
- It looks like it. Want some?

74
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:48,857
Mmm.

75
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,568
How is Miss Bunting? Still teaching Daisy downstairs?

76
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:55,237
She is. But don't worry.

77
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,740
I won't ask her to join us in the future.

78
00:04:57,823 --> 00:05:02,118
Cora would overrule me in a moment
if she thought it important to you.

79
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,828
Which you don't think it should be?

80
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:08,706
I know you feel excluded at times, an outsider in your own home.

81
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,502
Look, I am very grateful to you and this family.

82
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:17,130
But my vision of this country is different from yours.

83
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,881
But not from Miss Bunting's?

84
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:22,717
I believe in reform and the moral direction of the Left,

85
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:25,511
and when I'm with her, I don't feel like a freak or a fool,

86
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,722
devoid of common sense.

87
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,559
In your time here you've learned both sides of the argument,

88
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:36,979
befriended people you'd once have seen as enemies.

89
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:39,397
- That's true.
- You should be proud.

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,276
Five years ago, would you have believed
you could be friendly with my mother?

91
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:46,903
I'm not sure I'd have believed it five minutes ago.

92
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:50,156
Don't make nothing of what you've achieved. That's all.

93
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:55,034
Drinks before dinner? Wait till Carson catches you.

94
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:57,662
You'll notice I poured them myself.

95
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:06,377
Anna, I've had a note from Sergeant Willis.

96
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,256
He says he's going to look in this morning at 11 o'clock.

97
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,299
- To see me?
- That's what he says.

98
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:14,717
- Anyone else, Mr Carson?
- I'm not sure.

99
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,344
He says he wants to talk to Anna and Lady Mary.

100
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,763
Lady Mary? Why her?

101
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,806
I don't know. But could you warn her?

102
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,601
I'll tell her when I take up the breakfast tray.

103
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,688
May I ask... to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?

104
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,856
I'll get straight down to it.

105
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,193
You know how Lord Merton likes to...

106
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,862
display his interest in all things medical?

107
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:45,200
At least, he likes to, when in the company of Mrs Crawley.

108
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:47,076
Your confidence is a compliment.

109
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:51,204
I confide in you, Dr Clarkson, because I must.

110
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,874
Only you can help.

111
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:58,836
- That is more flattering still.
- It's the family's fault, really.

112
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,298
We've trained her in our ways,
and the earnest and intellectual 'bonne bourgeoise'

113
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:10,095
has been replaced by... a rather less definable figure.

114
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:13,847
Are you saying you liked her better when she was more middle-class?

115
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:17,267
- No, I wouldn't go that far.
- But you understood her better.

116
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,561
Precisely. Now I do not know who she is.

117
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,480
I do not know what it is she wants.

118
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,398
Well, there are many who wouldn't be puzzled by the desire

119
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:28,567
to marry a lord and live in a palace.

120
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:31,570
Can I ask you a personal question?

121
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:35,072
I've lived through great wars and my share of grief.

122
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:39,159
I think I can manage an impertinent question from a doctor.

123
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:44,830
Do you perhaps resent the idea of a
change of position for Mrs Crawley?

124
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:48,291
I'm sorry. I do not quite grasp your question.

125
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:50,251
It bewilders me.

126
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:56,173
Do you wish to see her live a life

127
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:59,717
devoid of industry and moral worth?

128
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,594
- I do not.
- And when the glitter is tarnished,

129
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:04,762
you know, what then?

130
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:09,475
A hollow existence in a large and draughty house,

131
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:12,644
with a man who bores her to death.

132
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,938
- It's a terrible prospect.
- So our duty is clear.

133
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:25,029
Oh... It's you, m'lady.

134
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:28,907
Yes. I wanted to bring my aunt to meet Marigold.

135
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,951
This is Lady Rosamund Painswick. May I introduce Mrs Drewe?

136
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:37,664
How do you do, Mrs Drewe? We're sorry for
dropping in like this. I expect you're very busy.

137
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:40,458
I am busy, m'lady, yes.

138
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,835
This is Marigold.

139
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,462
Oh, I do see. She's very sweet.

140
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:48,630
Lady Edith seems to think so.

141
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:53,677
Hello.

142
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,138
Lady Edith has decided to show off the baby to her aunt.

143
00:08:57,221 --> 00:09:00,223
- Lady Rosamund Painswick.
- Pleased to meet you, m'lady.

144
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,225
Well, we don't want to disturb your day.

145
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,602
I've got to get the dinner started.

146
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,771
Yes, of course.

147
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,814
Goodbye, dear.

148
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:13,692
Remember your... Remember your friend, Rosamund.

149
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:17,195
I should take her inside.

150
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:19,364
Oh, I could always
I'll take her.

151
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,117
Of course.

152
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:30,956
Goodbye.

153
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:37,086
Well?

154
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,546
It's exactly what I said would happen.

155
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,381
She wants Marigold as her toy,

156
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:44,675
to be poked and prodded by every stray guest from the big house!

157
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,887
And you've done this. You've done it!

158
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,431
What did you mean by saying to Mrs Patmore

159
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:55,184
we were living our lives out of the way, not in the game?

160
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,685
Well, we are.

161
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:59,812
Why does everyone talk as if we don't live in the modern world?

162
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:02,607
- You don't agree with that, then?
- No.

163
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,901
Does the King not live in the world of today?

164
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,569
Does Mr Sargent not paint modern pictures?

165
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:11,863
Does Mr Kipling not write modern books?

166
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:19,161
- So, what are you going to tell her?
- I don't know yet. I shall consider.

167
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:21,913
Sergeant Willis is asking for you, Mr Carson.

168
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,082
He's got a man with him from London, he says.

169
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,840
- They're in the library now.
- They?

170
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:36,800
An Inspector's come from Scotland Yard.

171
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:39,344
What does he want with me?

172
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:42,846
What does he want with any of us? None of it makes any sense.

173
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,644
By the way, I'd like to catch the ten-o'clock train tomorrow.

174
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,230
I'm dining with Mr Blake and I don't want to be in a rush.

175
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:55,606
Will we stay at Lady Rosamund's?

176
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,483
She doesn't mind. She's told Mead.

177
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:02,487
- Will you see Lord Gillingham?
- I don't think so.

178
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,656
So you haven't changed your mind?

179
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,867
Right. Let's get this over with.

180
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:17,458
Have I finished us off before we ever really got started?

181
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,293
You've pitted yourself against them from the start.

182
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,336
How can you retreat from that position?

183
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,588
You mean I've made it 'them or me'?

184
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:27,090
Haven't you?

185
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:31,010
You despise the family, but I think
you forget my wife was one of them.

186
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:33,011
My child IS one of them.

187
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,846
Where does that leave me?

188
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,807
Don't you despise them? Really?

189
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,975
No, I don't.

190
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:45,396
I'd like things to change, but I don't
think in black-and-white terms any more.

191
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,731
- While I do?
- Look, I'm not going to pretend

192
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:50,192
I haven't enjoyed knowing you.

193
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:54,570
In fact, I'm relieved to know I'm not
the only Socialist left on this earth.

194
00:11:57,031 --> 00:12:01,367
But maybe we should call it a day, before one of us gets hurt.

195
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:19,736
I don't know what else to add, Mr Vyner.

196
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,655
I remember we had to race to catch the train.

197
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:25,866
I'd had lunch with Lord Gillingham and I needed to get home,

198
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,660
as the church fete was planned for the following day.

199
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:31,579
And it was during the fete that Lord Gillingham arrived

200
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:33,455
with the news of Mr Green's death?

201
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,623
That's right. And I told Anna.

202
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,083
Hmm.

203
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,751
Was it a great surprise?

204
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,254
I think I would have called it a shock.

205
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:44,047
She was very shocked.

206
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,091
Was she? Was she, indeed?

207
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:53,054
- Can I go now? - I think Lady
Mary has given what help she can.

208
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:56,057
Erm... will you confirm that Mrs Bates was in London

209
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,434
on the morning that Mr Green died and that you don't know where?

210
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:01,644
I only have to ask her.

211
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:04,063
Secondly, you have no reason to believe

212
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,940
that Bates was anywhere further south than York?

213
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,108
No reason at all.

214
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:17,323
I think they'd enjoy getting to know each other better.

215
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,867
I think it's a nice idea, but shouldn't I do it, for once?

216
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,161
I always seem to be taking luncheon off you.

217
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:24,913
No, I'd rather.

218
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:28,082
You see, Mrs Potter likes to have people to cook for.

219
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,627
And Spratt needs something to occupy his mind.

220
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,462
Oh?

221
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:39,883
We both have an inkling that my maid Collins is on the way out.

222
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,678
- Oh, I do hope not.
- No, I don't mean she's dying.

223
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:46,054
I mean she's on her way out of my house.

224
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:49,057
She keeps talking about her mother being infirm.

225
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,769
But I'm infirm. Why doesn't she think about that?

226
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:54,937
You're as infirm as Windsor Castle.

227
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:58,981
And why does Spratt mind, particularly?

228
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:02,359
Because he likes things to be just so.

229
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:08,031
But also, I think Collins was his creature

230
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,824
and does his bidding without qualm or query.

231
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:13,159
He can't be sure of that in the next one.

232
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:17,788
Well, never having had a lady's maid,
it's not a challenge I've had to tussle with.

233
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,957
- But you'll come on Thursday?
- I will.

234
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,626
I think it would be nice for Doctor Clarkson

235
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,754
to see beyond Lord Merton's position and get to know the man.

236
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,630
I agree.

237
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:32,049
Oh! I knew I had something to tell you.

238
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:37,888
Shrimpie thinks he may be on the trail of Princess Kuragin.

239
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:39,597
Oh, I am pleased.

240
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:45,059
Yes, he's heard a rumour of some Russian nurses working in...

241
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:47,353
Wan... Wan Chai?

242
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:50,398
- And that's in Hong Kong?
- Well, nearby, I think.

243
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,025
Well, it sounds much better than it might have been.

244
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:56,819
Yes. The idea of Princess Irina scrubbing the sick

245
00:14:56,902 --> 00:15:00,196
and emptying bedpans is a cheering one.

246
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,951
- Will you tell her husband? - No,
I'll wait until Shrimpie is certain.

247
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:08,620
These things must be managed carefully.

248
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:10,788
Yes.

249
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:14,333
Sounds as if this must be managed very carefully.

250
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:22,214
Why did Mr Carson try to hide that you were in London on that day?

251
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:25,133
I don't think he tried to hide anything. He just forgot.

252
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,803
Isn't it a big thing when a member of the staff goes to London?

253
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,596
- Not for a lady's maid.
- Mrs Hughes, please.

254
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,141
She's right. It's not a big thing for ladies' maids or valets.

255
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,976
I'm going tomorrow with Lady Mary.

256
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,144
And you liked Mr Green?

257
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:43,189
Yes. I did. Very much.

258
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:44,982
He wasn't so fond of your husband.

259
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:47,442
Well, there's no accounting for taste.

260
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:51,237
Don't go away, Mrs Bates.

261
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,864
You've said you'll be in London. I've no objection.

262
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,033
But don't go away.

263
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,624
I'm very sorry, My Lord. I wonder if you know
when we can get in here and lay the table.

264
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:09,460
The police have taken over the library,
and I needed to spread these out.

265
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:13,630
- What are they for? - I'm trying to
formulate my plans for the village,

266
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,673
and I'm looking into some builders.

267
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:18,009
You won't use the ordinary maintenance team?

268
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,718
It would be beyond them.

269
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:21,678
Have you made your choice?

270
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:26,432
I'll have to talk to Lady Mary, but I like the look of this outfit.

271
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:32,604
They're based in Thirsk, so they're local,
and their work is excellent.

272
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,855
Of course, we should all invest in building.

273
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:37,899
Fortunes will be made over the next few years.

274
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:50,076
Why don't I hold the bags, while you do that?

275
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,828
Oh, that's frightfully nice of you! Are you sure?

276
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,996
Quite sure.

277
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,046
- Erm... I can have them back now.
- I shouldn't dream of it.

278
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:06,714
Where are you going?

279
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,882
Erm... just to St Mary Magdalene's.

280
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:13,093
You must have a very sweet tooth!

281
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:15,846
No, they're not for me.

282
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,642
I give tea to some Russian refugees every
Tuesday and Thursday. They love cake.

283
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:25,186
- I love cake.
- Oh, come and have some, if you like.

284
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:38,322
- Are you interested in Russia?
- Not terribly...

285
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:40,240
although I am very sorry for them all.

286
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:41,741
Of course.

287
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:43,659
I should be more interested, really.

288
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:46,787
- Why?
- I have a bit of Russian blood.

289
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:49,581
- How extraordinary!
- It's true.

290
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:53,542
In a way, my family is Russian. Or, at least, they used to be.

291
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:55,877
Well, now I insist. Come and have some tea.

292
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:58,505
By way of a thank-you.

293
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:02,967
I suppose we ought to introduce ourselves, even if it feels funny.

294
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,968
Erm... Rose MacClare.

295
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:07,845
Atticus Aldridge, at your service.

296
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,680
That doesn't sound very Russian.

297
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:12,015
Well, we weren't called Aldridge back then.

298
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,358
Mrs Patmore, I think I may have a solution to your problem.

299
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:25,859
Oh, that's good to hear.

300
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,529
Why not invest in the building trade?

301
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:32,574
With the expansion that's going on everywhere,
you'd soon see a good return.

302
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:34,992
Oh. Well, that's a thought.

303
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,244
Had you any special firm in mind?

304
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,871
What about WP Moss?

305
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:45,501
They're based in Thirsk, they're expanding,
and I hear their name everywhere.

306
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:48,711
I expect you keep your ear to the ground about that sort of thing.

307
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,047
I like to keep abreast of what's going on in the world.

308
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,927
So, can you buy shares in WP Moss? I mean, have they gone public?

309
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,847
Well, erm... you'll have to make enquiries.

310
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,768
Miss Bunting? I must confess I am surprised to see you here.

311
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:10,395
Rest easy, Mr Carson. I've come to say goodbye.

312
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:12,272
She's leaving the school, isn't she?

313
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:16,859
She's leaving the school and the village,
because Mr Branson won't stand up to His Lordship.

314
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:19,361
You are nudging impertinence, Daisy.

315
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:23,238
I should think carefully before you say one more word.

316
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:24,865
Are you going? Honestly?

317
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:29,202
I am, but the situation's not quite as Daisy recounted it.

318
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:30,828
We already knew that.

319
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:34,581
I've had an offer, from a school in Preston, in Lancashire.

320
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:38,083
A grammar school, no less, so it's quite a step up.

321
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,504
I dithered a bit, but I've decided to accept.

322
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:43,880
Because she gets insulted when she comes here.

323
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:48,133
I am sure Miss Bunting is given the reception she deserves.

324
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:50,343
Mrs Patmore...

325
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:54,848
Don't let Daisy give up her studies. She's got potential.

326
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:57,183
- What's going on here?
- All sorts.

327
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:01,311
Mr Carson's giving me investment advice
and Miss Bunting's leaving Downton,

328
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:03,771
because Mr Branson won't stick up for her.

329
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,939
Well, that seems to cover it.

330
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:09,484
I'll be in my room.

331
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:13,946
Well, goodbye... and good luck.

332
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:18,241
Goodbye.

333
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:25,664
Ah, Mrs Hughes. Who is this Mr Vyner?

334
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,667
He's the London detective, looking into the death of Mr Green.

335
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,503
Why do they keep questioning Mr and Mrs Bates?

336
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,255
Who says they do?

337
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:38,382
This house has no secrets.

338
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:41,218
Then I suggest you ask Mr Vyner.

339
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:43,344
I may just do that.

340
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:47,013
Who knows? I might have something to tell him.

341
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:48,806
Don't make trouble, Mr Barrow.

342
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,725
Are you saying I shouldn't do my duty, Mrs Hughes?

343
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,895
No. I'm asking you not to make trouble.

344
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:58,564
Are you quite well? You look as if you could do with a lie down.

345
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,733
Don't worry about me.

346
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:07,739
- Who was that on the telephone?
- Simon Bricker.

347
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:09,782
Oh, God. What did he want?

348
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:12,200
I shall answer without commenting on your tone.

349
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:14,869
He wants the picture photographed for his book.

350
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:18,288
- When is this? - He comes tomorrow
and they take the pictures on Friday.

351
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:21,625
Well, you know I won't be here. I've got the dinner in Sheffield.

352
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,377
Since you don't like him, I don't see that as a drawback.

353
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,421
- And Mary's in London.
- What difference does that make?

354
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:30,381
It's not that I dislike him, exactly.

355
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:32,758
It's that this business has been dragging on.

356
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:36,303
Robert, it's a compliment. By referencing our painting in his book,

357
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:39,097
he'll increase its value, maybe by a lot. Is that so bad?

358
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,182
You're not forbidden from inviting him.

359
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:43,642
Good, because I already have.

360
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,775
Mr Branson, sir.

361
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:59,404
Hello, Daisy. What can I do for you?

362
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:03,490
You can do something for yourself.
You're making the biggest mistake of your life.

363
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,911
- Is this Miss Bunting, by any chance?
- She's an extraordinary person.

364
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,662
Clever and kind.

365
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,248
- She's all of those things.
- Then why turn your back on her?

366
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,583
Daisy
I mean it.

367
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,294
She's leaving tomorrow, but I know she loves you.

368
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:20,004
I can tell when she speaks of you.

369
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,839
She's leaving tomorrow? For good?

370
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:24,508
Won't you stop her? You're not a Crawley.

371
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:26,759
You belong with us.

372
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:28,886
We're the future. They're the past.

373
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,471
- Well, I can hear her voice in that.
- Daisy?

374
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:33,682
What are you doing here?

375
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:37,268
She was checking something in the dining room. I held her up.

376
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:39,436
Get back downstairs immediately.

377
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:44,398
Mr Carson.

378
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:50,028
Have any of you heard of someone called Atticus Aldridge?

379
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,989
He sounds like the hero of a novel by Mrs Humphrey Ward.

380
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,783
- I'm not sure. Any more clues?
- I met him today. In York.

381
00:22:56,866 --> 00:23:00,035
Marsha George told me his father's been made Lord Sinderby.

382
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,080
Now, wait a minute. I remember this.

383
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:06,750
When the title was created, the locals were furious,
but now I can't remember why.

384
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:11,003
Perhaps because Sinderby's a Yorkshire
village and they'd only just bought a house.

385
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:14,630
- Canningford Grange.
- Oh! Have the Wheelers sold up?

386
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:17,425
You knew that. I told you. What does My Lord Sinderby do?

387
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:19,343
Oh, I think he's a banker.

388
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,554
I don't know, really, but the son's nice.

389
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,847
Oh... nothing like that!

390
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:29,851
Barrow, are you quite well?

391
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,228
Carson, have you been over-working him?

392
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:34,563
Not that I'm aware, Your Ladyship.

393
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,065
Mr Barrow, am I ill-treating you?

394
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:41,277
- You are the soul of kindness, Mr Carson.
- Thank you, Mr Barrow.

395
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,195
I'm looking forward to your party.

396
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,573
It's very daring of the Lord Lieutenant to give a cocktail party.

397
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,033
Carson, what do you think?

398
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:53,328
Well, I agree with Carson. It seems very fast to me.

399
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:56,330
- Well, I love cocktail parties.
- Me too.

400
00:23:56,414 --> 00:24:00,501
You only have to stay 40 minutes,
instead of sitting for seven courses,

401
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:04,629
between a deaf landowner and an even deafer Major General.

402
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:08,131
Even so, they'll say you're not doing things 'properly' any more.

403
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:10,550
- Do you care what people think?
- Yes.

404
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,552
I accept change, but I want to navigate it gently.

405
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:17,514
I don't want to leap into it and put everyone's backs up.

406
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:20,933
But why do the rituals, the clothes and the customs, matter so much?

407
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:24,519
Because, without them, we would be like the Wild Men of Borneo.

408
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:29,149
I disagree. Manners and tradition are all very well,

409
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:33,235
but once they start to control us,
they've outlived their usefulness.

410
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,904
Well, there are more important things to worry about

411
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:38,906
than whether or not Carson minds serving cocktails.

412
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:42,158
Why is Carson in the line of fire? What's he done wrong?

413
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:46,746
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Mama. I've rather a headache.

414
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,168
- What was that about? - Rosamund,
you spent the afternoon together.

415
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,378
Did Edith say anything was bothering her?

416
00:24:56,461 --> 00:25:00,006
Oh, she's just very tired. She'll be fit as a flea tomorrow.

417
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:13,267
That's nice of you. I'll just let Mr Carson know.

418
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,936
Oh, could you leave it, for a moment?

419
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,480
He's given me his view, about my money.

420
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:22,899
He says I should put it into a building firm, WP Moss,

421
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:26,611
or, if not them, then into some other building opportunity.

422
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:30,030
- And you don't want to?
- It's not that, exactly.

423
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,073
But I don't know about building,

424
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,242
and I don't like to put money into something I don't understand.

425
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,329
- Then why did you ask him?
- Because he's a man, I suppose.

426
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,248
I'm not sure that's a good enough reason.

427
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,250
Nor am I now.

428
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,835
But I don't want to hurt his feelings.

429
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:51,630
I wish men worried about our feelings a
quarter as much as we worry about theirs.

430
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:55,801
You seem very thoughtful.

431
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:59,804
I'm on the brink of a decision.

432
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:02,055
I just hope it's the right one.

433
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:04,182
Well, I won't ask what it's about.

434
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:09,311
But remember, Tom - make the right choice for you and not for us.

435
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:12,314
You know, you're much nicer than a lot of people realise.

436
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:14,607
Not always. Good night.

437
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,775
Good night.

438
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:23,697
I don't know what you mean, Mama.

439
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,408
You question my motives every time I come here.

440
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:28,326
It's as if I weren't welcome.

441
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,830
Just tell me: what were you and Edith discussing in such a huddle?

442
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:35,498
Well, it is very hard -

443
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:39,961
Rosamund, you are addressing your mother,
not the committee of the Women's Institute.

444
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:43,672
I'm afraid you've read somewhere
that rudeness in old age is amusing,

445
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,548
which is quite wrong, you know.

446
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,301
It's about the child, isn't it? That is the secret you share.

447
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:54,514
We both know you are not leaving my house until I learn the truth.

448
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:58,976
So, shall I have a bed made up for you here,
or are you going to tell me now?

449
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:10,777
Mr Drewe... I have to see her.

450
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:17,240
It was a mistake to bring your aunt here.

451
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:20,492
Margie feels that you want the child to be your plaything.

452
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:22,661
How can she say that?

453
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,248
The fact is, I was wrong.

454
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:30,417
She won't have you here, not any more.

455
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,127
You must leave us alone.

456
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,421
If you don't stop coming, she'll make
me give up the farm and move away.

457
00:27:38,841 --> 00:27:40,801
But what about Marigold?

458
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:42,802
What do you mean? We'd take her.

459
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:44,970
But you can't. I won't allow it.

460
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,974
What would you suggest?

461
00:27:50,057 --> 00:27:53,561
We bring her up to the Abbey and leave her in the library?

462
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:56,897
I'm very sorry, m'lady. It's not what I planned.

463
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,025
But I see no way round it.

464
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:22,334
People always think how healthy we must be,
living out in the country,

465
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,710
but the water's not as good as it might be.

466
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:27,671
- You mean the iodine deficiency?
- I do.

467
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:29,631
I suppose you must get a lot of goitres.

468
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,757
Er... quite a lot, yes.

469
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:35,427
It's sad so few people know that the treatment is just iodine.

470
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:37,721
Too many suffer when the solution is simple.

471
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:40,681
- You've studied this?
- I've just read a lot.

472
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:43,600
I wish I had studied it.

473
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,478
Luncheon is served, m'lady.

474
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,189
Do cheer up, Spratt.

475
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:53,233
Spratt is downcast, because it is as I feared.

476
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:56,194
Collins has handed in her notice.

477
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:59,696
- You don't like change, Spratt?
- I detest it, madam.

478
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,781
Well, we all hate change, Spratt,

479
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:04,034
but we have to learn to live with it.

480
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,619
I don't hate change. I find it exciting.

481
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:10,914
- Remember
- those customs and ceremonies that people think are the soul of England

482
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:13,207
were almost all invented by the Victorians.

483
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,292
Quite right.

484
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:19,254
The truth is, they're well suited, whether we like it or not.

485
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:22,381
And I don't believe he's faking his interest in medicine.

486
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:24,549
I'm afraid I agree with you.

487
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,427
You must be off soon.

488
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:31,930
I'm just going to put him in his uniform, and then we'll go.

489
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:37,518
You never told me what the Inspector wanted yesterday.

490
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:40,645
Mainly because I'm not sure.

491
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:46,316
He asked me if I liked Mr Green and why he didn't like you.

492
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,027
And what did you say?

493
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:51,529
I said I don't know, because I don't.

494
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:58,117
I promise you this.

495
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,580
Nothing bad is ever going to happen to you again.

496
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:07,834
- I hope that's true.
- We'll sit by the fire,

497
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,961
with all our children around us,

498
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:13,505
and I'll make certain that you are safe.

499
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:17,050
I wonder.

500
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:21,470
We both want it so much, but do you believe it'll really happen?

501
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,097
I do. With all my heart.

502
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:32,020
Actually, I'm not sure about having children 'all around us'.

503
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:36,898
How many are you planning on, Mr Bates?

504
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,370
- You nearly missed me.
- You never told me you were going.

505
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:57,873
- Who did?
- Daisy.

506
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,209
My champion.

507
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,919
- The school must be sorry.
- Maybe.

508
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:06,881
I think I was rather a nuisance, but I hope they'll miss me a bit.

509
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:11,342
I hope you'll miss me a bit.

510
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:13,511
I'll miss you a lot.

511
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:17,056
I've loved you, you know.

512
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,392
I could have loved you more if you'd let me.

513
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,687
I'm glad we met.

514
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,607
You've reminded me of who I am, and I'm grateful.

515
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:32,067
And I won't lose touch with that again.

516
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:42,576
But I wish we'd met before you ever knew them.

517
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,705
We need to get started, if you're to catch the four o'clock, miss.

518
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:49,873
Let me.

519
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,315
- Did you have a nice journey?
- Excellent.

520
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,483
Thank you very much.

521
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:35,617
Hello, Lord Grantham. You look very splendid.

522
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:38,244
We're ships that pass in the night, Mr Bricker.

523
00:32:38,328 --> 00:32:40,997
I have to go to Sheffield, but I'll see you tomorrow,

524
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:42,832
if you're still here when I get back.

525
00:32:42,915 --> 00:32:45,000
Goodbye, Cora.

526
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:53,215
So, here we are again.

527
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:56,134
I'm beginning to find Downton quite home-like.

528
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:58,761
Good. You're very welcome.

529
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:01,972
As long as you behave.

530
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:24,490
What are you doing here?

531
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:26,992
In search of more cake?

532
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:31,745
I wanted to see you again, before I went up
to London to start my new job at the bank.

533
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:35,331
Do you think I should buy a bowler hat?

534
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:41,128
Let me introduce you. Prince Kuragin,
Count Rostov, this is Mr Aldridge.

535
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,463
I'm Mr Kuragin here.

536
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:49,801
- Have you heard from Aunt Violet yet?
- Even if your father finds her,

537
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:52,345
what happens next? To any of us.

538
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:55,640
We are strangers in a strange land.

539
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:58,308
Talk to Mr Aldridge.

540
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:00,185
His family were Russian,

541
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:03,979
but they've started a new life in England, and so can you.

542
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:06,856
Where did they come from?

543
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:09,026
Odessa.

544
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,737
His great-grandfather came with some of them in 1859.

545
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,988
See? I do remember what I'm told.

546
00:34:15,072 --> 00:34:18,741
- And then the rest of the family followed in 
- 1871.

547
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,284
How brilliant! That's right.

548
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:26,331
- He is not Russian.
- Nikolai. Nye nado.

549
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:28,833
No, he's not Russian now, but -

550
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,168
They were not Russian then!

551
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:35,254
I'm sorry about that.

552
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:37,256
Nikolai, podozhdi!

553
00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:41,801
I don't understand.

554
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:45,387
Erm... I think he said we're not Russian,

555
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:48,640
because we're... we're Jewish.

556
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,477
Well, how did he know?

557
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:58,356
There were two big pogroms to drive out
the Jews from Odessa, one in 1859...

558
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,524
And 1871?

559
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,943
But it's still odd.

560
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:06,988
I mean, you're English now, but you're still Jewish.

561
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,156
What's the difference?

562
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:16,995
Would you let me give you dinner when you're in London?

563
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:21,041
I might.

564
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:23,209
We'll have to see.

565
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:30,506
What a treat. I haven't been to Simpson's for ages.

566
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,257
We'll go straight to the table.

567
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:35,094
I've asked a friend to join us, and I want you to behave.

568
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,262
Why wouldn't I?

569
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:47,186
Goodness. I wasn't expecting you.

570
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:50,064
- Ditto.
- I, happily, was expecting you both.

571
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:57,027
What is your scheme? That we now hold hands
and take a house by the sea together?

572
00:35:57,111 --> 00:36:00,447
Not quite. But I have an idea that may be,

573
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,450
as The Times advertisements say, 'to your mutual advantage'.

574
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:12,456
You've got to stop this. You're poisoning yourself.

575
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,499
Just lay off.

576
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:17,711
Look at you. Sweating like a beast.

577
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:22,381
Just because Her Ladyship let you stay,
you think you can boss us all around.

578
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:24,674
Forgot the cream.

579
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:30,637
Oh, Miss Baxter, you may not think I have the right to ask,

580
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:37,435
but now that Her Ladyship knows the truth, might you tell me?

581
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:40,145
If you really want me to.

582
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:44,315
- Mr Molesley! Now.
- Yes, Mr Carson. Right away.

583
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:46,943
I don't think I can be hearing this correctly.

584
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:48,610
- No?
- No.

585
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:52,864
You seem to suggest I should take the
discarded leavings of Lady Mary Crawley,

586
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:55,907
dust off the fluff and put them on my own plate.

587
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:58,576
- That's not what Charles meant.
- Isn't it?

588
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:01,829
Good. What a relief. Now we won't have to quarrel.

589
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:05,415
Mabel, you're in love with Tony Gillingham. You know you are.

590
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:09,168
All I know is that Tony broke off our engagement,
which I had not deserved,

591
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:11,712
because Mary crooked her little finger at him.

592
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:14,422
- It was his choice, not mine.
- So you say.

593
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:17,342
But now you're bored. You want someone else to play with.

594
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:20,677
So, to dry his tears and keep him occupied, you toss him back to me.

595
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:23,805
- This isn't my idea.
- Well, it certainly isn't mine.

596
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,849
You know, you're cutting off your nose to spite your face.

597
00:37:26,932 --> 00:37:30,352
- I'm going.
- Well, what shall we do with your food?

598
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:32,520
Eat it, and I hope it chokes you.

599
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:38,942
That was a big success What's your next suggestion?

600
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:42,569
No, I don't think we need another plan.
This was just a scene we had to play.

601
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:44,989
Can you put the fricassee there? We'll share it.

602
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:48,491
Now, I'd like my beef pink, but not raw.

603
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:53,224
You didn't linger very long over your Port.

604
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:56,768
Because we'd both rather be with the ladies.

605
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:00,146
Edith, dear. There's something I'd like to show you in the library.

606
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,940
- What's that, Granny? - Oh,
it's just a particular book

607
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,942
you might find interesting.

608
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:07,360
How is your fiery friend, Miss Bunting?

609
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,862
I notice we don't see her here as much as we used to.

610
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:12,698
- Do you wonder at it? - Well,
it's good to be disagreed with.

611
00:38:12,782 --> 00:38:14,366
Keeps you on your toes.

612
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:19,078
Then Lord Grantham must have been on points
from the moment she walked through the door.

613
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:21,246
I hope you haven't broken with her.

614
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:25,374
She's gone. She left today.

615
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:27,543
Oh, I am sorry.

616
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:31,755
What about you, Rose? What happened to the young man you met?

617
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,049
He's gone too. He's starting a new job in London.

618
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:38,593
Oh, dear. What a sad conversation.

619
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:40,720
He was interesting.

620
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:45,516
He wasn't just the same old chap one's
supposed to dance with. His family was unusual.

621
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,268
- In what way? - They came
here from Odessa. 60 years ago.

622
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:52,187
They were driven out by the pogroms, but they've done well.

623
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:55,940
Well, yes, that is interesting.

624
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:59,068
I didn't tell you because I knew you'd think it was a mistake.

625
00:38:59,152 --> 00:39:02,529
I suppose it never occurred to you that I might be right?

626
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:05,114
What do you expect me to do? Send her back?

627
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:08,200
It's too late. We can't get the child back to Switzerland,

628
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:10,536
and there's no point in keeping her here.

629
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,662
- What do you mean?
- That woman, Mrs...

630
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:16,498
- Drewe. Mrs Drewe. - Well,
she's at the point of explosion.

631
00:39:16,582 --> 00:39:18,417
We must get the child away.

632
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,043
But where would we go?

633
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,212
Not 'we', my dear.

634
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:27,883
There are schools that will take children from any age.

635
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,218
We'll find one in France where she'll be properly looked after.

636
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:35,722
I dare say you can even visit,
as long as you never reveal who you are.

637
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:39,099
It'll be... quite manageable.

638
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:43,103
- And you agree with this, Granny? - Well,
I know it sounds very harsh.

639
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:46,772
But what else are we to do?

640
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:49,107
We're going up.

641
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:51,859
Mama, the car's ready whenever you want it.

642
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:53,987
Oh, thank you, Cora.

643
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,155
Good night.

644
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:01,451
We'll settle the details later.

645
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:04,495
But I promise you - this is for the best.

646
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:16,296
Well, in my eyes, that makes you innocent.

647
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:21,633
It makes you a victim of the crime, quite as much as Mrs Benton.

648
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:23,510
Why didn't you tell me this before?

649
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:27,346
Because I knew you'd say it proved my innocence,
when it does no such thing.

650
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,640
I'd rather not hide from the truth, thank you.

651
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:34,435
Don't hide, then. But don't punish yourself for ever, either.

652
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:36,436
No. But I have learned.

653
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,856
And I won't ever be controlled again.

654
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,442
I must go.

655
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,988
- Mr Barrow said you wanted me.
- Oh, come in and sit down.

656
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,577
- Mrs Patmore's got something to say.
- What's that?

657
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,038
Oh, just how grateful I am for your excellent advice.

658
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:02,332
- Oh, you've taken it, then?
- I have. In a way.

659
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:05,001
You've invested in building?

660
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:08,546
Well, she's invested in a building, yes.

661
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:11,840
I've found a cottage in Haughton-le-Skerne,

662
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,217
and I'm going to see it on Tuesday.

663
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,220
It's £300, so it's a big decision, but you've given me the courage.

664
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:21,348
Oh, that's not what I meant at all.

665
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:25,059
I thought you wanted to be in the market, to increase your capital.

666
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:31,272
Well, I'll rent it now and later I thought I'd
take in some lodgers. It's got three bedrooms.

667
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,273
Oh, this is very small beer.

668
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:37,944
Mr Carson, it's my kind of beer, and I know how to drink it.

669
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,947
But you gave her the idea, didn't you? She's very grateful.

670
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:46,951
Oh, I am. It's good to hear advice from a man of the world.

671
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:50,204
Well, I like to do what I can.

672
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:52,372
We feel thoroughly protected.

673
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,765
Have you forgotten something?

674
00:42:14,848 --> 00:42:17,433
It's not your maid.

675
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:19,853
I waited till she'd gone.

676
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:21,812
You must leave.

677
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:24,689
Mr Bricker, you must leave.

678
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:27,483
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No, not at all, m'lord.

679
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:31,569
Miss Baxter's only just come down,
so Her Ladyship will still be awake.

680
00:42:31,653 --> 00:42:34,364
Mr Bricker, I've asked you twice now. Will you please go?

681
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:37,074
You said yourself - who knows when I'll be back?

682
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:38,909
Mr Bricker
Don't pretend, Cora.

683
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:43,162
You know something's happened between us.
You know things have changed now.

684
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:45,330
I feel it and I know you do.

685
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,672
When did someone last cherish you?

686
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,925
When did someone even listen to you?

687
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:02,095
I've seen you with your family, ignored and passed over.

688
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:05,180
- None of this is any - - I'm
glad you're still awake...

689
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:15,729
The dinner was over early. It seemed easier to come back.

690
00:43:15,813 --> 00:43:17,940
I'm sorry if it's a disappointment.

691
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:21,568
It isn't. Mr Bricker was just leaving.

692
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:23,861
I'm not here at Lady Grantham's invitation.

693
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:26,655
Then will you please leave at mine?

694
00:43:31,451 --> 00:43:33,286
Robert, let him go.

695
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:35,663
You can't be surprised.

696
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,998
When you chose to ignore a woman like Cora,

697
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:41,542
you must have known not every man would be as blind as you.

698
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:47,214
Stop it!

699
00:43:47,297 --> 00:43:49,382
Stop it! Stop it!

700
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:54,177
Stop!

701
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,387
Mama?

702
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,141
Mama? Papa? Is everything all right in there?

703
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:08,355
I'm so sorry, darling. Your father
and I were just playing a stupid game

704
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,148
and we knocked over a lamp.

705
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,609
- Oh. If you're sure.
- I'm sure, poppet.

706
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,778
Good night. Sleep tight.

707
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:23,659
- I think that is my exit too.
- Wait.

708
00:44:36,627 --> 00:44:39,671
Golly. What a night.

709
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,965
I'll sleep in my dressing room.

710
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:52,348
Eat a proper breakfast and lunch.
There won't be time for more than a cup of tea later.

711
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:53,974
I'll try to make it up.

712
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:58,145
When you've finished your duties,
I'd appreciate any help you can give.

713
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,896
We'll clear the hall now.

714
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,190
But why aren't we giving a proper dinner here?

715
00:45:02,273 --> 00:45:04,233
I quite agree, Mrs Patmore.

716
00:45:04,316 --> 00:45:07,110
Mrs Hughes would say we must move with the times.

717
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,278
Yes. I would.

718
00:45:11,822 --> 00:45:14,241
Do you have a bandage I can have?

719
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:16,826
- Have you hurt yourself?
- I haven't, no.

720
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,370
Mrs Bates, have you heard any more from that policeman?

721
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:23,289
No.

722
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:25,583
Here we go. That's Lady Mary.

723
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,627
Do you think you will?

724
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,295
No. I hope not, anyway.

725
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:34,799
Why do you pester her with this?

726
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:36,967
Because I feel like it.

727
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:40,636
Mr Barrow. Upstairs, please.

728
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,805
You too, Mr Molesley.

729
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:09,827
The car is waiting, sir. Your case is inside it.

730
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,995
Thank you, Carson.

731
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:18,667
Thank you.

732
00:46:48,524 --> 00:46:51,943
The Lady Beaumont. The Lord Howard of Glossop.

733
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:54,571
- Lovely to see you.
- Good evening.

734
00:46:54,654 --> 00:46:57,489
- Howard.
- Lord Grantham.

735
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:59,658
I'd forgotten his father had died.

736
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:07,873
Thank you, Barrow.

737
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,333
Oh, thank you.

738
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,794
My dear, we can't leave things as they are.

739
00:47:13,877 --> 00:47:17,088
It's a tinderbox. It could go up at any moment.

740
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:19,006
Granny, if I was to take her to London -

741
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:22,093
Oh, don't be ridiculous, my darling. Think.

742
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,469
All I'm saying is, there must be another way.

743
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:25,929
Well, how can there be?

744
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:29,890
Mrs Reginald Crawley and the Lord Merton.

745
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:34,685
- Hello, Isobel.
- It's cousin Isobel.

746
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,854
And her follower.

747
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,732
The Earl and Countess of Woolton.

748
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,151
- I'm fine. May I sit down?
- Are you tired?

749
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:47,904
No, but I rather foolishly twisted my ankle getting out of the car.

750
00:47:47,987 --> 00:47:52,533
Oh, dear. Be careful - Lord Merton
will have you on the operating table

751
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:55,160
before you can say 'knife'.

752
00:47:55,244 --> 00:47:57,120
What about Lady Ingleby's pearls?

753
00:47:57,203 --> 00:48:00,664
I was so jealous, I wanted to snatch them off her throat!

754
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,752
Sir Henry and Lady Lawson.

755
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,672
Well, that's that.

756
00:48:10,756 --> 00:48:12,924
And you're back at your books, I see.

757
00:48:13,008 --> 00:48:15,009
I'm not giving up - don't think I will.

758
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,969
And I wouldn't want you to.

759
00:48:17,052 --> 00:48:19,429
Right, I'm going up. Don't forget the light.

760
00:48:19,512 --> 00:48:22,891
Oh, gracious! Good evening, m'lady.

761
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:26,852
I didn't expect to see you down here.
Mr Carson said you'd all gone to bed.

762
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:29,979
I wanted to make a telephone call without...

763
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:32,272
I wanted to make a private call.

764
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:34,525
And you thought you'd use Mr Carson's phone?

765
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:37,444
- I don't think he'd mind. Do you? 
- I'm sure he wouldn't.

766
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:39,862
Well, I'll leave you to it. Good night, m'lady.

767
00:48:39,946 --> 00:48:42,031
Good night.

768
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,293
I'd like to make a trunk call to London.
