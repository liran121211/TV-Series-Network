1
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,453
Did you sleep well? Very.

2
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,790
It hasn't taken me long to get used
to sharing a bed again.

3
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,585
Who is it? Breakfast, madam.

4
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,629
One moment.

5
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:04,014
Thank you so much.

6
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:06,059
I can manage.

7
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:15,525
Have you ordered something
for yourself? You can't have mine.

8
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:18,450
It'll be here any second.

9
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:22,532
You've worked up a good appetite.
I can't bear vulgar jokes.

10
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,492
I'll make note of that. I've made
note of everything.

11
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,746
How you look in the morning. How you
dress.

12
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:31,872
How you put on your make-up.

13
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:33,917
Why particularly?

14
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:37,925
Because I want to acclimate myself

15
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:41,215
with the routines and rituals that
will govern the rest of my life.

16
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:43,632
Are you governed by ritual and
routine?

17
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:46,928
I don't think I am. Do you really
have to leave today?

18
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:48,971
I'm afraid so.

19
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:53,016
Surely there are delights
in Liverpool we have yet to share.

20
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:56,894
We've driven round Cheshire and
dined in public for almost a week.

21
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:59,687
By some miracle, we have managed to
get away with it.

22
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:03,317
Let's not push our luck.
Does it matter if we get found out?

23
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:07,236
We're gonna be down the aisle before
you can say, "Jack Robinson. " No.

24
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,154
And yes, it does matter.

25
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:13,199
I've been tarnished once and I won't
be tarnished again.

26
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,369
Nothing is going to happen that
isn't properly announced

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,540
organised and executed.

28
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:23,043
Isn't that your breakfast?

29
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:44,394
Miss Bunting says I've quite a gift
for it now I've got started.

30
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:46,562
I left school when I were 11.

31
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:48,773
What were I supposed to learn by
then?

32
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:52,484
If I were at school now, I'd be
there at least till I were 14.

33
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,736
What's the matter?

34
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,322
Sorry, love. What were you saying?
Nothing.

35
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:06,247
Before he left, Mr Bricker said he
wants to show us the della Francescas

36
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:09,207
in the National Gallery when we're
next in London.

37
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,627
You go. Actually, I wouldn't mind
knowing if ours is any good.

38
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:14,962
We don't often see you for
breakfast.

39
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:17,757
We've got a meeting to organise the
church flowers.

40
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:20,473
The rota seems to have gone wrong.
Is Mary back today?

41
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,221
Supposed to be. Good. We've been
sent a proposition from a man in Leeds.

42
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:28,600
What's that? Let's wait till Mary
gets home then we can talk about it.

43
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,146
Do you have any plans? I may walk
down to Yew Tree Farm.

44
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:36,941
I'll give you a lift if you like.
Has Rose left? I think so.

45
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:39,567
She planned to get an early train to
York.

46
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:42,653
She wanted to spend the day with her
Russians which is nice.

47
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,488
Are you ready to go?

48
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,202
Edith is getting so fond of that
little girl.

49
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:54,581
I only hope she isn't driving
the mother mad.

50
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,709
Mr Carson, please may I make a
telephone call?

51
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,586
Don't make it a habit.

52
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:05,422
I'm sorry to ask but I wonder if I
might be alone.

53
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:08,218
If you wish.

54
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:24,731
Hello. I've read your advertisement
in the London Magazine.

55
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,275
Choose Your Own Path.

56
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,196
This is me. We'll talk soon.

57
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:36,868
We're settled now. We just have to
get organised.

58
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,927
Oh, what is the latest
from your ageing Romeo?

59
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,679
If it's of interest, I haven't heard
anything from him

60
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,183
since you and I last met.
Oh, how disappointing.

61
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:06,517
To you, perhaps.
Not especially to me.

62
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:11,063
By the way, how is Spratt?
He's well, I think. Why do you ask?

63
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:13,942
He wasn't there to open the door. I
wondered if he might be ill.

64
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:16,818
Oh, no. He's not ill. He's in
Liverpool.

65
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,154
His niece got married yesterday

66
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:21,870
and Spratt had to take her down the
aisle. Oh.

67
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:25,161
It seems unlikely to think of Spratt
with a private life.

68
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:28,620
Hm. Yes. Unlikely and extremely
inconvenient.

69
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:32,499
But you can't begrudge him that.
Servants are human beings too.

70
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,212
Yes. But preferably only on their
days off.

71
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,302
So they want to take this witness
business further?

72
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,596
I'm afraid so. It's a young woman,
apparently.

73
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:52,641
She was on her way to meet a friend
by the Statue of Eros in Piccadilly.

74
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:56,561
Now, she swears she heard Green
speak as she walked by.

75
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:59,439
There was clatter from traffic but
she heard him say,

76
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,608
"Why have you come?"

77
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:03,734
Who was he talking to? She couldn't
see.

78
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:06,945
She was quite short and behind his
back. She looked up when he spoke

79
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:10,825
but it was only to see him fall into
the road. She kept quiet.

80
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:14,160
Well, it was in the paper and they
said it was an accident.

81
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:17,628
But that phrase haunted her. "Why
have you come?"

82
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:21,918
Till she felt she had to report it.
I still don't see what brings you here.

83
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:25,295
Green complained of a quarrel

84
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:27,796
while he was staying at Downton.

85
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:30,592
He felt badly treated, was angry
about it and...

86
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:34,678
he told Lord Gillingham's other
servants. Why didn't they report it?

87
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,722
Because everyone thought his death
was an accident.

88
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:39,892
Until now.

89
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:43,852
I'm sorry but as I remember, he was
in high spirits while he was here.

90
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:46,647
Rather too high, if you get my
meaning.

91
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:49,901
He had the maids and footmen playing
Racing Demon

92
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:52,069
and screaming the house down.

93
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,446
So you had no reason to believe he
fell out with anyone? None at all.

94
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:58,198
He was rather a bumptious type

95
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,286
but if anyone objected to that,
it was me.

96
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:05,496
Isobel was asking about your
travels.

97
00:07:05,497 --> 00:07:08,750
She's coming for dinner this evening
so you can tell her yourself.

98
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,133
Another cup of tea, M'Lord?
Thank you, no.

99
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,839
You can show her your sketches.
Where are they anyway?

100
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,006
Can't we see them? Now that you're
back,

101
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,675
a building company has been in
touch.

102
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:21,844
They want to put up 50 houses. 50?

103
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:25,096
Modest ones. He's got his eye on
Pip's Corner.

104
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,057
He wants to widen the lane to the
green

105
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:30,894
to access the village centre.
They want to buy Pip's Corner?

106
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:34,230
They want to build on Pip's Corner.
We take a percentage of sales.

107
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:37,273
It's a good offer. I won't have 50
ugly modern houses

108
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,735
built over a field of mine.

109
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:42,071
Well, we don't have to make a
decision now.

110
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:48,284
Hello, darling. Hello, Sybbie. Now,
let's go and sit by the fire.

111
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:51,329
We want to hear all about your...

112
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,588
The police must have muddled Downton
with some other place. I expect so.

113
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:05,091
You don't remember any bad feeling
involving Mr Green, do you? No.

114
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:09,220
Well, better get moving. They'll be
down in a minute.

115
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:13,973
Oh, Mr Carson. There's a telephone
call for Mr Barrow.

116
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:17,769
Go and find him, Mr Molesley, seeing
as you're the First Footman now.

117
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,105
Are you free for a moment?
I've not got long.

118
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:25,610
No, well, it won't take long.

119
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:33,823
I've had a letter from my sister.

120
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,410
The mother of my nephew Archie.

121
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,913
He was shot, wasn't he, poor boy.
Yes. He was shot. For cowardice.

122
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:44,040
His parents live in Farsley near
Leeds.

123
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,670
Now, the Farsley people are putting
up their own memorial like we are.

124
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:50,588
That's nice. Well, it is and it
isn't.

125
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,759
You see, the locals only know that
Archie died in the War.

126
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,636
They'll expect to see his name among
the rest. Yes.

127
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:02,014
But the committee won't put him on
the list.

128
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:04,143
He's... He's not worthy.

129
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,979
Apparently. So says the War Office.

130
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,732
I am sorry. That must be terribly
upsetting for her.

131
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:16,445
Well, it brings it back for us, you
see.

132
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:20,114
It brings it back
and makes his death nothing at all.

133
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:24,660
I wish I could do something. Well, I
did just wonder...

134
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:28,788
I mean, if she were able to say he'd
been included in our memorial,

135
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:31,874
because of a family connection,
no-one would wonder

136
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,169
why he was missing from the one in
Farsley.

137
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,296
Have you spoken to Mr Carson? No.
I was hoping you might do that.

138
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:41,591
Me? Well, everyone knows you can
twist him around your little finger.

139
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,510
Then, EVERYONE is wrong.

140
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:46,637
Well, will you have a go, please?

141
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:49,472
We're about to start
the Hollandaise.

142
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:52,394
So we've got time if it curdles.
Right. I'm coming.

143
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:56,439
Please.

144
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:01,734
I hope you're not too tired after
your exertions.

145
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,987
Ooh, M'Lady. I'm not tired exactly.

146
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:08,782
Oh, good. I'm glad if the wedding was
a success.

147
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:12,660
Oh. The wedding was a success.

148
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,912
Yes.

149
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:19,666
Spratt, I have told you before, I do
not appreciate a man of mystery.

150
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,210
If you have something to say, say
it.

151
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:27,381
I would, Your Ladyship, but it may
not be quite right for me to tell.

152
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:29,842
Well, if that is the case then do NOT
say it.

153
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,845
Do you have some other business?

154
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,765
Only that it may not be mine to
tell,

155
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,600
but it is, in a way, yours.

156
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,602
You're testing me, Spratt.

157
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:45,147
And I warn you, being tested does
not bring out the best in me.

158
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:48,983
No, Your Ladyship. I will not repeat
myself.

159
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:52,445
Either impart this piece of
information,

160
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:55,156
if you can empower yourself
to do so,

161
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:56,698
or go.

162
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,742
Very well.

163
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:05,707
I hope Lady Mary enjoyed her time in
Liverpool.

164
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:10,002
What? I was standing outside the
Grand Hotel this morning, M'Lady,

165
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:14,255
when I saw her come out with her
suitcases.

166
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,133
She was accompanied by Lord
Gillingham

167
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,262
who had clearly also been staying in
the hotel.

168
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,350
Well, yes. They were both staying
there.

169
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:34,857
They were attending an informal
conference of northern landowners.

170
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:39,986
Lord Gillingham thought Lady Mary
might derive benefit from it.

171
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:42,113
So you knew about it?

172
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:44,157
Of course I did.

173
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:48,202
Why?

174
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:50,829
What do you imagine you were
witnessing?

175
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,041
Well... Nothing vulgar, I hope!

176
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,669
Nothing beneath the dignity of a
butler of this house.

177
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,923
Oh. Nothing... of... that... sort,
M'Lady.

178
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:05,801
I'm glad to hear it.

179
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:11,390
Now, if you'll be good enough to let
me drink my brandy in peace.

180
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:25,324
You don't think Mr Bates ever knew
it was Mr Green, do you?

181
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,987
What are you asking me for?

182
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,974
I don't know anything you don't
know.

183
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:35,666
Anyway, Mr Carson wasn't impressed
by the sound of the witness.

184
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,781
But they could make out he was
in London that day, couldn't they?

185
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,891
He left at dawn. He was back late.

186
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,811
They'll say he could have managed
it.

187
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:47,569
Even if Mr Bates was in London, we
have no reason to suppose

188
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:51,192
he had anything to do with it. What
do you mean, 'even if he was'?

189
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:56,447
Do you think he was? I don't know if
he was there or not.

190
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,490
Why would I if you don't?

191
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:04,244
They'll find out.

192
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,289
About Mr Green.

193
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,416
They'll find out what he did.
How?

194
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,086
There's no-one in this house knows,
except you, me and Lady Mary.

195
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:16,131
And she won't give it away.

196
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:21,300
No, I don't think she will. There
you are, then.

197
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,344
But they'll find out somehow.

198
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,435
Of course you must bring them. If
you want to.

199
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,982
They do so love an excursion.
It'll be fun. I'll come and help.

200
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,233
What are you going to do in London?

201
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:42,945
I have a fitting with Monsieur
Molyneux. He's over from Paris.

202
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:46,864
The Dowager Lady Grantham is on the
telephone for you, M'Lady. Thank you.

203
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:49,165
Will you stay at Rosamund's?
If she'll have me.

204
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:52,452
Robert, any chance you could come
to? I'm afraid I can't.

205
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:54,622
I've a dreary meeting all afternoon.

206
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:58,458
What about you, Edith? I'm taking Mr
Bricker up on his offer

207
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,961
to show me the National Gallery.
I'm watching little Marigold.

208
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:04,463
Mrs Drewe is taking the youngest boy
to the dentist.

209
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:08,258
Can't someone else step in? I said
I'd do it. Rose.

210
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:11,137
We're taking my Russians to Howarth
where the Brontes lived.

211
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:14,847
What will they make of the Brontes?
Good things surely.

212
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,683
Hopeless lovers wandering over a
desolate moor.

213
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:20,810
If it wasn't Emily Bronte, it could
be Tolstoy or Gogol.

214
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,813
That's why I want to bring them to
Downton.

215
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,815
They can compare the old Chekhovian
vie de chateau

216
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:29,235
with the way the English do it.
Won't that make them unhappy?

217
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,488
A little nostalgic maybe but they
seem to enjoy that.

218
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:37,283
We have some Russian things here from
when Papa and Mama went in 1874.

219
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:41,455
I shall look them out. What did your
grandmother want?

220
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:45,666
She wondered if I'll have time to
look in tomorrow. That's all.

221
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,210
I hope your flurry of telephonic
communication

222
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:51,298
does not involve bad news, Mr
Barrow.

223
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:54,549
My father's ill, Mr Carson.

224
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,093
Oh, I am sorry.
Will you need time off?

225
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:59,094
Well, I ought to leave in the
morning.

226
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:02,598
Really? If you want me to see him
alive. Oh, my heaven.

227
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,142
Of course I do.
Of course you must go.

228
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:09,603
I'm sorry to hear it.
I remember your father very well.

229
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,939
Don't pretend. You couldn't care
less.

230
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,483
I've known your family for a good
long time.

231
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:17,403
I may not want to be your spy but
nothing changes that.

232
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:21,656
If you say so. Your dad was always
kind to me. Was he?

233
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:23,782
Because he was never very kind to
me.

234
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:27,202
You're quiet. Am I? I don't mean to
be.

235
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:30,372
I was thinking we might get out for
a night when we're due time off.

236
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:32,874
Somewhere peaceful. Away from here.

237
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you ever wonder what it would be
like to go

238
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,169
to a place where no-one knows us?

239
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,547
And just start again. Why do you say
that?

240
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:43,008
I'm being stupid.

241
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,718
That's why.

242
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:48,054
I hear you're getting on well with
your mathematics, Daisy.

243
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:50,640
An extra feather in your cap.
Yes, it is.

244
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:54,810
But now I wonder... You wonder what?
Well, should I stop there?

245
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:58,773
That's enough, Daisy. Come and carry
the spotted dick.

246
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,112
Good night, Baxter.

247
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:12,075
M'Lady, I hope you don't mind but I
would like to know

248
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:14,201
whether I'm staying or going.

249
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,911
You're right. I have made you wait
an unreasonable time.

250
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:20,916
I just feel I need to plan if you've
come to a decision.

251
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,960
I have. I think I have.

252
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:29,300
Tomorrow I want you tell me
the missing element of your story.

253
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,343
If you do, I'll give you a decision.

254
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:41,309
Is everything planned for the trip?
It is.

255
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,144
I'm looking forward to it. Really?

256
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm afraid I find those journeys a
slog these days.

257
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,775
Do you ever think of the War?
What do you mean?

258
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,737
How it was. When the girls were
working with the officers

259
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:57,489
and I was running everything with
Barrow.

260
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,450
I don't remember Mary doing much.

261
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:04,662
Sometimes I find myself thinking how
busy we were. How useful.

262
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:07,291
You can't wish those days back again.
Well...

263
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,627
.. I wouldn't admit it outside this
room.

264
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:16,215
What was that business about
building houses at Pip's Corner?

265
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:18,425
Nothing to trouble you with.

266
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,139
So you had fun? Don't ask me to
elaborate.

267
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,684
Have you set the date?
For the wedding, M'Lady.

268
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:31,227
No. He's not trying to get out of it?
No.

269
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,979
But there's no hurry. We don't have
to rush into it.

270
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,899
By the way, would you do me
the greatest possible favour?

271
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,528
I will if I can. Would you hide this
in the cottage?

272
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,112
You mean the thing. Well, I can't
leave it here.

273
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:47,158
Suppose Mrs Hughes found it. Or
Edith. Or Mama.

274
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,618
Please take it. And the book.

275
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:52,829
There must be a corner cupboard
in the cottage where no-one goes.

276
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,458
Very well, M'Lady. Thank you.

277
00:17:57,293 --> 00:18:01,044
But I do feel I'm aiding and
abetting a sin.

278
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:03,882
I just hope I won't be made to pay.

279
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:08,468
I gather the local bobby was here
today.

280
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:12,471
Carson said a witness had turned
up who'd seen that man die.

281
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:16,850
But wasn't it a crowded pavement?
Surely there were hundreds of them.

282
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:20,563
This one says she heard Mr Green
talking just before he fell.

283
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:23,399
Sergeant Willis was asking if he'd
quarrelled with anyone

284
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,775
when he was at Downton. Why?

285
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:28,944
Mr Green had told the people he
worked with

286
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:31,613
that he'd been treated badly while
he was here.

287
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:35,367
HE was treated badly?! I know.
But...

288
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:38,119
.. we have to be on our guard.

289
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,496
I mean, I'm sure Mr Bates never knew
it was him

290
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:45,125
but if they find out what Mr Green
did, then...

291
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:49,046
There can't be any evidence against
Bates. They'd have found it by now.

292
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,725
What are you doing?

293
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,562
Nothing. Is this some mysterious
present for me?

294
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:10,771
No, it's something of Lady Mary's.
What is it?

295
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:13,483
That's private. For her.

296
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:16,443
Then why has she given it to you?
She wants me to keep it.

297
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:19,906
Why are you putting me off?
I'm not doing any such thing.

298
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:23,951
Add the name of a coward to our
memorial?

299
00:19:23,952 --> 00:19:26,119
Are you quite well?

300
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,790
Mr Carson, surely by now we know
enough about shellshock

301
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,293
to be more understanding than
we were at the start of the War.

302
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:38,588
Look, I don't mean to sound cruel but
the lad was troubled

303
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:40,758
and off his head for all we know.

304
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,843
I'm sorry for him. I'm sorry for his
family and for Mrs Patmore.

305
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:47,930
Well, then. But is it fair to the
millions of men

306
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:50,807
who stood by their posts up to their
waists in mud,

307
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:54,144
terrified out of their wits
yet determined to do their best

308
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:56,937
for King and country? What do you
mean?

309
00:19:56,938 --> 00:20:01,692
Is it fair to say to them,
"Your sacrifice weighs just the same

310
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:05,071
as the man who abandoned his duty
and ran for it"?

311
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:08,286
I... I'm sorry, Mrs Hughes, but I
don't think it's right

312
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:13,411
to make so little of the gift those
young men gave us when they died.

313
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,541
I see.

314
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,178
I hoped I'd catch you before we go.
Oh, yes?

315
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,222
She's given me an ultimatum.

316
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:43,478
What's she said? I must either tell
her the rest of my story or leave.

317
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:47,440
And if you do tell her, does that
mean you can stay?

318
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,568
She wouldn't commit herself.

319
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:52,194
So what will you do? I don't know.

320
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:56,239
There is a story, and maybe she has
a right to hear it.

321
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,159
But once it's told, I want it back
in the ground and buried.

322
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,245
Then make that your condition. What?

323
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:05,456
She's made conditions so can you.
The worst that can happen

324
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,625
is that she refuses and you go.

325
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:10,711
Which will happen anyway if you say
nothing. Oh.

326
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,222
You don't think he'll relent?

327
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:26,391
I'm afraid not.

328
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:30,312
I just wanted to be sure you knew
there'll only be four for dinner.

329
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:33,563
She's told you, then.

330
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:36,859
I have. They'd never have allowed
it.

331
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,070
Is that so? But I don't want you to
think I'm unsympathetic.

332
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:45,908
Yes, well... Sympathy butters no
parsnips.

333
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:48,035
I'd better get on.

334
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:50,161
What's the matter with her?

335
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:52,329
She's had bad news.

336
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,542
Oh, by the way, Mr Carson...
Yes, Daisy.

337
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:58,523
.. you wouldn't mind if I were to sit
an examination, would you?

338
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,504
Not now. But when I'm ready.
That's a question for Mrs Patmore

339
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:04,131
or Mrs Hughes. But you don't object?

340
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:07,802
Well, since you ask, I'm not
convinced any of this extra work

341
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:11,472
is necessary for your place in the
scheme of things.

342
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:13,598
Mr Carson, Sergeant Willis is here.

343
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,851
Hm.

344
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,232
My advice Daisy is to go as far in
life as God and luck allow.

345
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,362
Are you sure about this? I'm never
convinced surprises

346
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:30,948
are all they're cracked up to be.
Don't be silly.

347
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,493
I'll give her a treat.
I thought we might go dancing.

348
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,785
I hear the new band at Claridge's is
marvellous.

349
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:39,455
Does Aunt Rosamund know you're
coming? I'll tell her when I arrive.

350
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:43,208
They were just going to have supper
together and go to bed. Bates.

351
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:45,585
Mr Carson said you were looking for
me, M'Lord.

352
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:49,296
My meeting's been cancelled.
I've decided to run up to London.

353
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:51,965
Would you make up a bag for me?
Black tie not white.

354
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:55,510
Would you like me to come with you?
No need. I'll be back tomorrow.

355
00:22:55,511 --> 00:23:00,264
Mr Bates? Well, that's it. He didn't
like Mr Bates. Not at all.

356
00:23:00,265 --> 00:23:03,184
And we know now that he said so to
Lord Gillingham's butler.

357
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:06,770
Well, I don't remember that.
He mentioned Mr Bates by name?

358
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:10,616
He called him 'the valet' and there
isn't another, is there?

359
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:14,734
Not now. You do surprise me.
Mr Bates keeps himself to himself.

360
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:19,072
You won't mind if I talk to him?
Not at all. Be my guest.

361
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:22,326
You can take a seat and I'll send
for him.

362
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:24,370
Thank you, Spratt.

363
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,914
I trust you enjoyed your stay in
Liverpool, M'Lady?

364
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,171
You found it extremely interesting,
didn't you, dear?

365
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:38,131
Yes, I did.

366
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:41,134
I think we'll have some tea. Thank
you, Spratt.

367
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:43,304
Very good, Your Ladyship.

368
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:52,385
Obviously, it's very shocking
to someone of your generation.

369
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:56,575
Don't let us hide behind the changing
times, my dear.

370
00:23:56,576 --> 00:24:02,540
This is shocking to most people in
1924. Yes.

371
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:08,674
Can we be confident that there will
be no unwanted epilogue?

372
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,593
You can be quite sure.

373
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,804
Well, I must say that makes a nice...

374
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:18,188
A nice what?

375
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,975
A nice kettle of fish.

376
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:23,938
Is there any chance of a proposal?
Every chance.

377
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:28,564
He already has.
He wants to set the date.

378
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:32,569
Oh. Oh, I see.

379
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:37,323
Well, I'm not saying I approve
because I don't.

380
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:40,743
But it does put things in rather a
different light.

381
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:42,703
Yes.

382
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:46,748
When will you announce it?
I'm not sure. We haven't decided.

383
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:48,875
Then you'd better get on with it.

384
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:51,293
If I was seduced by a man,

385
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:54,588
I would not let any grass grow
under his feet

386
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:58,342
if he'd offered to do the decent
thing. I wasn't seduced, Granny.

387
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:02,178
A young woman of good family who
finds herself in the bed

388
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,348
of a man who is not her husband has
invariably been seduced.

389
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:09,727
She couldn't have gone to bed with
him of her own free will?

390
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:12,604
NOT if she was the daughter of an
Earl.

391
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:15,273
Oh, there you are, Spratt.

392
00:25:15,274 --> 00:25:18,443
Lady Mary's been telling me all
about her conference.

393
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:21,654
I hope you found it interesting,
M'Lady.

394
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:24,240
I learned a great deal that I never
knew before.

395
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:28,244
Thank you, Spratt.

396
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:46,676
You've had the journey to think
about, Baxter,

397
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:48,885
and I accept your condition. We have
time.

398
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:51,847
I don't have to be anywhere till
later.

399
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,060
At the house in Ovington Square,
there was a footman.

400
00:25:58,061 --> 00:26:00,104
His name was Coyle. Peter Coyle.

401
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:07,236
He was very handsome and after a
while,

402
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:09,530
I could do nothing but by his
permission.

403
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:13,867
He was a cruel man although I
couldn't see it then.

404
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:18,245
At least...

405
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,955
.. I could see it, really.

406
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,499
He was nasty. And he made me nasty.

407
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:26,085
And I embraced it.

408
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,253
Tell me about the robbery.

409
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,923
He handed in his notice and on his
last night, I took the jewels.

410
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,384
He wanted them all but I only took
some.

411
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,511
And you gave them to him and he
left.

412
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:40,722
He said where to meet him the next
day and I thought he'd be there.

413
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:45,477
But he never came. I never saw him
after. He got clean away.

414
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,438
And you took the blame but why?

415
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:51,023
I was ashamed.

416
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:55,320
I'd let him change me. I'd abandoned
everything I believed

417
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:57,487
to please a worthless man.

418
00:26:57,488 --> 00:27:00,365
Surely if you told the police now...
No, M'Lady.

419
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:02,909
I won't bring it back to life. Leave
him be.

420
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,870
As it is, he'll never know a day's
happiness

421
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:08,914
for there is nothing good in him.

422
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:16,629
So what might you have done in York
that would place you there?

423
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,549
Now, let me think. I posted a letter
to an old army pal.

424
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,907
Would he still have it? That I
couldn't tell you.

425
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:27,263
Anything else? I made enquiries at a
shoe shop.

426
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:30,099
Do you recall which one? Browns.
In Queen Street.

427
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,186
They were opening up. Then I had
a cup of coffee at the Royal York.

428
00:27:34,187 --> 00:27:37,355
I went back there for a drink later
on before I caught the train home.

429
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,523
In the middle of the day?

430
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:46,406
I walked around. I had a sandwich at
lunchtime in some pub or other.

431
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:49,199
Let me think.

432
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,912
Don't worry. I've got enough. Thank
you for your time.

433
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,001
No need to frown, Mrs Bates. Just
routine.

434
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:04,005
But why would Mr Green say such
things about Mr Bates?

435
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:07,966
Who knows? Anyway, everything seems
to be in order.

436
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:10,135
Good day to you.

437
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:15,682
I don't know why Mr Green would want
to make trouble for you.

438
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:19,891
Well, I never liked him so I suppose
he never liked me.

439
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:23,063
Yes, but to invent a quarrel then
tell the world about it.

440
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,274
It's as if he were expecting me to
make trouble first

441
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:29,776
and so he was covering himself in
case I did.

442
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,821
It does seem like that, doesn't it?

443
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:37,407
I have to get a mark out of His
Lordship's tails. Go.

444
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:39,453
Of course. You go.

445
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:47,625
Every figure shows a different kind
of reverence.

446
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:52,380
Some eager, some contemplative.

447
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:54,423
Some amazed.

448
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,719
Even the magpie seems to have been
struck dumb.

449
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,763
You're very sharp.

450
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:04,473
Umbria was full of magpies

451
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:09,061
so della Francesca chose a bird known
for its chatter

452
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:11,105
and made it silent in wonder.

453
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,742
How beautiful it is.

454
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:17,955
I think your picture may be a study
for this angel.

455
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:21,582
There are elements common to both.

456
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,667
It was painted at the end of his
life.

457
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:26,585
I envy him.

458
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:30,341
To be able to create something like
this when death was closing in.

459
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,925
I'd love to think I could still do
something

460
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:36,845
that people talk about more than
four centuries later.

461
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:38,598
You don't sound confident.

462
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,017
I doubt they'll remember anything
I've done by the time my body's cold.

463
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:45,645
I'm sure that's not true. You're not
but I like you for saying it.

464
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:47,689
Come and look at this one.

465
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:54,485
I'm afraid I'm taking up far too
much of your time.

466
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:56,780
Not true. I'm enjoying myself.

467
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:09,959
M'Lady.

468
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,503
M'Lady?!

469
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,466
Are you there?

470
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:24,971
M'Lady?

471
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:30,059
Wait here. Wait here.

472
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:51,243
I didn't know where you were.

473
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:54,203
Oh, you're back. She's been no
trouble at all.

474
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,165
She should have gone when Tim got
home, M'Lady.

475
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:00,084
I was enjoying myself. That's very
kind, I'm sure.

476
00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:02,379
Hey. Hello.

477
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:08,133
Well, I suppose I should be off.

478
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,927
Unless you'd like me to stay while
you settle Billy.

479
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:14,347
That's generous, M'Lady but there's
no need. Good.

480
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:18,266
Right. I'll be off then.

481
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:21,312
Can I look in tomorrow?
You must be so busy.

482
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:26,984
Why don't I come and then you can
turn me out if you like.

483
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:31,571
Goodbye, darling.

484
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:34,949
Bye. Bye.

485
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:36,616
Honestly, Tim!

486
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:39,035
She'll hear you. Let her get away.

487
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:40,703
I can't manage it much longer.

488
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:43,462
I'm sorry if she's lonely and
wants a child

489
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:46,084
but she can't have ours. You're not
being reasonable.

490
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:48,575
Just now, I thought she'd taken her.

491
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:51,952
I did, truly. I wish we'd never
started it.

492
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,539
Think what she could do for the girl
if she's a mind to.

493
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,459
In 10 years or 15. Are we all to live
together in a threesome until then?

494
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:00,089
Is that what you want? Me?

495
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:02,510
I thought she was soft on you
but it's the other way round.

496
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:04,954
You're the one who's soft. Soft in
the head!

497
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:13,960
She keeps being engaged. I wonder if
there's a fault on the line?

498
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:17,881
I'll send a telegram. I don't know.
I probably should go back.

499
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:20,885
I'm in quite the wrong clothes for
dinner. Please.

500
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:23,013
You said yourself she wouldn't mind.

501
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:25,597
As for your clothes, you'll be the
best-looking woman

502
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:29,060
in the Ritz dining room whatever
you're wearing. Oh, golly.

503
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,229
That's cheered me up. I mean it.

504
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,668
I so want to hear what you have to
say about it.

505
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:36,108
I can't think why. I don't know
anything. Nonsense.

506
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:40,362
You have an instinct for the key
elements of every picture.

507
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,155
They speak to you. I envy that.

508
00:32:43,156 --> 00:32:46,242
Well, I probably shouldn't but I
guess I will.

509
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:53,163
I won't stay out late, though.
Don't worry.

510
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:55,832
You'll be home and safe as the clock
strikes 12.

511
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,293
A lot sooner than that, please.

512
00:32:58,294 --> 00:33:02,297
But surely if Bates convinced Willis
he was in York that day...

513
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:05,097
I only said it may not be over.
Why not?

514
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:09,093
The sergeant's a nice man but he's
not the brightest button in the box.

515
00:33:09,094 --> 00:33:12,680
According to Mr Carson, Mr Bates
told the Sergeant

516
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:15,099
he visited a shoe shop as it was
opening.

517
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,726
The shoe shop is in Queen Street,
10 minutes walk from the station.

518
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:22,147
Oh. He also had a cup of coffee at
the Royal York

519
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:25,149
which operates as a station hotel.

520
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,529
You mean he still had time to get to
London and back?

521
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,239
Do you think Carson registered any
of this? I doubt it.

522
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,783
And he wouldn't give Mr Bates away
if he did.

523
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:38,537
But there's a danger that Sergeant
Willis or someone he talks to

524
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:42,122
may put two and two together. They'd
still have to prove it.

525
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:45,334
Yes, they would still need proof.

526
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:47,378
Let's keep a hold of that.

527
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:51,382
I had such a nice evening.

528
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:53,466
Me too. I love London.

529
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:57,595
Sometimes I forget how much but I
do.

530
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:00,638
I remember when I first arrived.

531
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,350
You don't want to hear about all
that. But I do.

532
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,729
London scared me at first.

533
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,189
I'd only been in a school room a few
months before.

534
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,317
But my mother was eager.

535
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,943
Why especially?

536
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:19,031
We weren't really in the first rank
in Cincinnati.

537
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:21,033
Still less when we moved to New
York.

538
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:23,826
My father was Jewish and the money
was new.

539
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:28,226
But there was a lot of it and I was
pretty.

540
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:30,875
I suppose I can say that now I'm an
old lady.

541
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,502
She thought you'd make a better match
over the Atlantic.

542
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:38,088
And suddenly, here I was in these
vast ballrooms.

543
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:41,675
And all the other girls seemed
to know what to do and what to wear.

544
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:45,595
And how to flirt. I bet you were
more beautiful than all of them.

545
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,807
More original. More real.

546
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:53,311
I certainly got a lot of
names on my dance card.

547
00:34:55,313 --> 00:34:57,480
Listen to me bragging.

548
00:34:57,481 --> 00:35:00,524
Please forgive me. I never talk
about myself.

549
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:03,568
Why did I say all that? Because I'm
interested.

550
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,155
Well, it's time for me to stop.
We're nearly there.

551
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:11,200
Can't we pretend we're not? And walk
round the square again?

552
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:14,704
The truth is, I am quite
light-headed.

553
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,872
Going out for a night on the town.

554
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,583
Seems more my daughters' territory
than my own.

555
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:25,047
You can't know what a good time I
had.

556
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:28,674
Please may we do it again.

557
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:30,718
I doubt it.

558
00:35:32,803 --> 00:35:34,806
But I hear the offer as a
compliment.

559
00:35:42,562 --> 00:35:44,981
Rosamund.

560
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:48,609
I hope you got my cable.

561
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:53,779
But I've had such a... Such a what?
.. nice time. Robert!

562
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:57,241
I didn't know you were coming up
to London. You never gave me a clue!

563
00:35:57,242 --> 00:36:00,076
It was meant to be a surprise. I got
a table at Claridge's

564
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:02,579
so we could make a night of it.
I am sorry.

565
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,749
Shall we telephone? Don't worry. I
cancelled everything

566
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:07,834
when we got Mr Bricker's telegram.

567
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:12,255
Where's Rosamund? Upstairs. She gave
me your dinner and went to bed.

568
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:16,507
I'm dreadfully sorry. So you said.

569
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,759
Wait a minute. I don't see I've done
anything to make you angry.

570
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,515
No? I travel to London in order to
give my wife a treat

571
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:26,280
only to find she's out dining with
another man.

572
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:29,927
Mr Bricker wanted to discuss the
paintings.

573
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,815
Rosamund said she needed an early
night.

574
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:34,458
Why was it so wrong to accept his
invitation?

575
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:37,659
Bricker was interested in discussing
the pictures with you?

576
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,204
Yes. Is that so difficult to
believe?

577
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:43,041
That an art expert would find your
observations on the work

578
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:46,167
of Piero della Francesca impossible
to resist? Yes.

579
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:50,254
It IS hard to believe. I'm going to
bed.

580
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,304
Cora. It's quite all right.

581
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,677
You've said what you think
and you've every right to do so.

582
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,459
Tell me, does Edith seem very
distracted to you?

583
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:13,643
I'm not sure I'd notice. Well, she
does to me.

584
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:16,964
As if she were always thinking about
something else.

585
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:20,927
I might say the same of you. It can
be hard to know what to do for the best.

586
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,284
You don't want to hurt people but
you may have to.

587
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:26,650
I know what you mean.

588
00:37:26,652 --> 00:37:29,070
Sorry. That just slipped out.

589
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,657
Are you talking about Tony?
Maybe.

590
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:37,119
I don't know. I'm not sure.

591
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,290
I was beginning to think you'd
settled on him. I had. I think.

592
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:44,417
But now, I seem to have unsettled.

593
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:48,087
Goodness! I haven't said it out loud
before.

594
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:55,050
So, what's he done wrong? Nothing.

595
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:58,311
We'd never spent much time together
until recently.

596
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:02,557
And when we did, I began to wonder
how much we really had in common.

597
00:38:02,558 --> 00:38:05,060
How recent was this time you spent
together?

598
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:08,772
VERY recent.

599
00:38:09,774 --> 00:38:12,649
Are we talking about your so-called
sketching trip?

600
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,901
Because I never believed in that for
a moment.

601
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:19,114
The point is, I wasn't seeing him
clearly but now I do...

602
00:38:20,824 --> 00:38:23,909
He's a nice man. A very nice man.

603
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,953
But not...

604
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:29,498
I mean, of course, we talked about
things.

605
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:32,374
But I think my judgement was rather
clouded by...

606
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:35,712
By what Miss Elinor Glyn likes to
write about in her novels.

607
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,588
Maybe.

608
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:40,716
But I seem to have got over that now.

609
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:43,259
Well, I won't ask how.

610
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,304
Please don't.

611
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:48,305
Well, I'll back you up if you
support me.

612
00:38:48,307 --> 00:38:51,350
Are we talking about Miss Bunting or
your move to America?

613
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:54,393
I'm not sure. Either or both.

614
00:38:54,394 --> 00:38:58,565
Well, you're asking a lot. I'm not
very keen on Miss Bunting

615
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:01,525
and I can't bear the thought of your
leaving.

616
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:03,736
Well, if you love me, you'll support
me.

617
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:08,575
Then I suppose I'll have to.

618
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:14,411
I was wondering about Rose's Russian
tea. Shall we go together?

619
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:16,455
Well, when is it?
This afternoon.

620
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:19,583
Oh, good heavens. I'd forgotten all
about it.

621
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:22,752
Well, I'm not sure I'll have the
energy. You must come.

622
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:26,673
You've been to Russia. None of us
have.

623
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:29,549
Did you get to know any when you
were there? Oh, yes.

624
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,718
Oh, yes.

625
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,345
Did you keep up with them?
Oh, I'm afraid not.

626
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:36,682
An unlucky friend is tiresome enough.

627
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:39,100
An unlucky acquaintance is
intolerable.

628
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:41,686
You're all heart!

629
00:39:56,783 --> 00:40:00,077
We're back. Phew. I was terrified you
were going to miss it.

630
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:03,496
No, not likely. By the way, before I
left, I asked Pattinson

631
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:06,791
to look out the Russian things from
my father's visit. Did it happen?

632
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,792
Oh, it did. And they'll be so
thrilled.

633
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:11,795
If we're going to do it, we might as
well do it properly.

634
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:13,964
Don't you agree, Mrs Patmore?
Yes, M'Lord.

635
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:16,967
What's the matter with her? Nothing
for you to worry about.

636
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:20,844
I'm not but what is it? Something
beneath your Lordship's notice.

637
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:24,348
She'll get over it.
There's not nearly enough lemon.

638
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:27,433
Well, shall I go down and tell them?
No, I'll do it.

639
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:30,520
Tony, I don't believe it.

640
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:37,109
What's going on? Don't ask. Rose
wanted to invite Russians for tea.

641
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,028
And it's turned into a Jubilee
celebration.

642
00:40:40,029 --> 00:40:43,114
How was London? How is it always?
Large and noisy.

643
00:40:43,115 --> 00:40:44,782
Lady Grantham. Isobel.

644
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:49,703
Well, I wanted to see you. You've
spent a day in a car for that. Yes.

645
00:40:49,704 --> 00:40:52,831
I didn't want to nag you over
the telephone when if I drove up

646
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:56,125
we could make our plans together.
Good afternoon, my dear.

647
00:40:56,126 --> 00:41:00,420
Granny. Now, Granny, there's
something I'd love to show you.

648
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:03,799
Hello, Lord Gillingham. It's
very nice of you to come for this.

649
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,467
I came to see Mary, really.
Of course you did.

650
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:10,346
And so you should.
You were always very kind to me.

651
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:12,890
Mrs Crawley. Thank you.

652
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:16,311
I don't think I am. Yes, you are.
I appreciate it.

653
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:22,941
I'm sorry to add to your labours.
Don't worry, M'Lady.

654
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,068
I'll have them sliced in no time.

655
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:28,613
Daisy, are you ready? Daisy's busy
I'm afraid. I've got too much on.

656
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:32,157
Why? What's happening? There's a big
tea for the Russian refugees.

657
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,995
Your displaced Tsarist aristos. You
could always stay if you like.

658
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,457
Lots to eat.

659
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:44,918
I hope his arrival means you intend
to make it public.

660
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,545
Darling, granny, you know how much I
value your advice...

661
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:51,132
Which means you intend to ignore it.

662
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,926
I won't be hurried into anything.
Not by you or him.

663
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:59,514
But if you weren't certain, why on
earth did you go to bed with him?

664
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:02,725
Well, in my day...

665
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:06,854
a lady was incapable of feeling
physical attraction

666
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:10,148
until she had been instructed to do
so by her mama.

667
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:12,316
I don't believe that.

668
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:15,987
Seriously, my dear, you have to take
control of your feelings...

669
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:19,700
.. before they take control of you.

670
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:32,584
Baxter...

671
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:36,004
M'Lady... I thought a lot about what
you told me yesterday.

672
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:39,090
And I still think you should report
Mr Coyle.

673
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:42,510
I won't, M'Lady. And if that makes a
difference...

674
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:45,054
It won't. You may stay.

675
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,142
Thank you.

676
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:53,020
Thank you so much.

677
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:04,988
Have you seen what we've dug out for
the Ruskies?

678
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:07,615
Well, I say, 'we', it was Pattinson
who did it.

679
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:10,494
Does it matter? You place no value
on my opinions.

680
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:14,275
Cora, I was cross. I had travelled
the length of England

681
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:17,150
to spend the evening with you and
you had gone out.

682
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:19,988
Aren't I allowed to be cross? Cross
but not unjust.

683
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:22,324
Would you excuse me? I think they're
here.

684
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:28,085
M'Lady. Mr Drewe is at the back door
downstairs.

685
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:31,707
He's asking for you. Should I ask
him to come up? No, I'll go down.

686
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:36,752
They told me you were here. I didn't
know you were entertaining.

687
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:40,130
It doesn't matter. What is it?
Tell me there's nothing wrong.

688
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:42,673
Please. There's nothing wrong with
Marigold.

689
00:43:42,674 --> 00:43:46,636
Thank God. No. What's wrong is
Margie.

690
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:50,263
I know I've annoyed her. I'm afraid
you must stay away, M'Lady.

691
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:53,183
That's all. Not forever.

692
00:43:53,184 --> 00:43:55,228
But for now, you must stay away.

693
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:09,573
M'Lady.

694
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,673
You have Russian connections, Miss
Bunting? No.

695
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:26,754
I'm here under false pretences.
Nonsense. You're welcome.

696
00:44:26,755 --> 00:44:30,548
What is THAT woman doing here? Rose
found her in the kitchen

697
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:33,761
and asked her to join us. Why?
Don't be silly. She had to.

698
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:35,887
Why do you let her irritate you so?

699
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:38,265
How dare you say such things to me?!

700
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:43,020
I don't think she meant any... She
curses the name of our Holy Father.

701
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:46,564
The Tsar. I said he was misguided in
his policies.

702
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:48,773
No. No. I can't listen to this!

703
00:44:48,775 --> 00:44:53,904
Lady Rose, would you please arrange
for us to return to York immediately.

704
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,448
Oh, but before you go, won't you
come and see the mementoes

705
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:01,492
of the wedding of Tsar Alexander
II's daughter?

706
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:04,162
Lord Grantham had them put out
especially for you to see.

707
00:45:04,163 --> 00:45:06,456
You have Romanov's relics here?

708
00:45:06,457 --> 00:45:09,250
My parents went to St Petersburg in
1874.

709
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:12,384
When Queen Victoria's son, Prince
Alfred,

710
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:16,547
married the Grand Duchess Maria.
Grand Duchess Maria.

711
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:21,217
Those words... They already make...

712
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,803
me weep. Oh, dear.

713
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:24,931
Oh, we can't have that.

714
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:27,598
Thank you.

715
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,810
Now do you see why she irritates me?

716
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,897
Tom, keep her under control.
She only wants...

717
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:41,905
I feel rather guilty. I thought
they'd enjoy the things we found.

718
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,072
Oh, dear, no. They ARE enjoying
them.

719
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:46,365
What were you doing in Russia?

720
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:49,951
Lord Grantham was in the household
of Prince Alfred.

721
00:45:49,952 --> 00:45:53,247
And we went to St Petersburg for
their wedding.

722
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:56,707
I suppose it was very splendid.
Oh, you've no idea.

723
00:45:56,708 --> 00:46:00,294
Receptions and balls. Glittering
parades.

724
00:46:00,295 --> 00:46:06,008
Rides in a horse-drawn sleigh.
Flying across the snow at midnight.

725
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:11,347
Excuse me. Make way. Make way.

726
00:46:14,932 --> 00:46:16,850
Oh. Oh, how funny.

727
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:19,275
I wondered what had happened to that
fan.

728
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:24,106
That wasn't given to your father. It
was given to me. Who by? The Tsar?

729
00:46:24,107 --> 00:46:26,733
No. No. Not by the Tsar. No.

730
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:29,945
No, we were at a ball.

731
00:46:29,946 --> 00:46:32,155
In the Winter Palace. And it was
so...

732
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:36,742
Oh, it was so hot. There were
icicles hanging outside the window.

733
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:40,204
But the rooms were as hot as the
tropics.

734
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:43,956
I was wearing pale blue velvet.

735
00:46:43,957 --> 00:46:46,125
Trimmed with silver lace.

736
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:50,338
And when I gave you this fan you hid
it in your reticule

737
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:53,550
in case Lord Grantham should be
angry.

738
00:46:54,675 --> 00:46:57,385
Good heavens.

739
00:46:57,386 --> 00:46:59,763
I hope you can forgive me.

740
00:46:59,764 --> 00:47:05,017
When I knew the others are coming, I
could not resist the temptation.

741
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:08,437
This is amazing. You know each other.

742
00:47:08,438 --> 00:47:10,564
You met in St Petersburg?

743
00:47:10,565 --> 00:47:12,566
We did.

744
00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:15,901
Allow me...

745
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:18,155
to present my son, Lord Grantham.

746
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:21,032
Prince Kuragin.

747
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,160
I am flattered to be remembered.

748
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:28,747
How is the princess? Well, I hope.

749
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:32,626
I don't know.

750
00:47:35,377 --> 00:47:39,714
Why don't we go back to the hall and
have some more tea?

751
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:42,509
Yes. Thank you.

752
00:47:43,468 --> 00:47:45,094
Thank you.

753
00:47:49,724 --> 00:47:51,891
Granny has a past.

754
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:54,935
Thank heavens Papa and Aunt Rosamund
were already born

755
00:47:54,936 --> 00:47:57,439
or we could spin all sorts of fairy
tales.

756
00:47:59,065 --> 00:48:03,317
How's it going? There seems to be a
good deal of emotion being vented

757
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:06,239
among the guests in the library but
then they are foreigners.

758
00:48:07,281 --> 00:48:09,532
Right. Now, I must get on.

759
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:15,912
Stop giving me such knowing looks.

760
00:48:15,913 --> 00:48:19,124
I met the prince when I was
travelling with your grandfather.

761
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,375
Nothing could be more respectable.
Whatever you say.

762
00:48:22,376 --> 00:48:25,254
Away with your impertinent
conclusions!

763
00:48:25,255 --> 00:48:27,422
My only conclusion is this -

764
00:48:27,423 --> 00:48:31,051
I know you understand my predicament
far better than you let on.

765
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:43,061
Have you made plans to see your
admirer again?

766
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,401
Drive on.
