1
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,259
I don't want to disturb you. Don't be
silly. You couldn't disturb me.

2
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,263
Thank you, Baxter.

3
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:26,381
I wouldn't have bothered you. Stop
talking like that and move back in.

4
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:30,633
I only came to tell you that Edith's
about to receive some bad news. What?

5
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:33,188
How do you know?
Her editor's on his way here.

6
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:35,270
It's what we've been waiting for.

7
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:38,809
However much you expect it,
it's still painful when it arrives.

8
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,415
You don't think it's good news?
If it were, he'd have telephoned.

9
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,836
When you see Madge, warn her.
Are you all set for tomorrow?

10
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:53,413
What's this?
I'm going to see the cottage again,

11
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,538
and then I have to make up my mind.

12
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,302
Mrs Hughes is coming with me.
I'll leave you to it.

13
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,575
What's it like, this cottage?
I don't know.

14
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,982
You can ask me after tomorrow.

15
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:08,567
Unless you want to come with us?

16
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,987
She wouldn't want me.
You know that's not true.

17
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:14,757
It'd be good to
bury the memorial business.

18
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:17,276
See what she says -
but don't force her.

19
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,722
Of course it's terrible,
but what did she think he was doing?

20
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:25,850
Living in a tree?
You mustn't make jokes, Milady.

21
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:28,866
Only in here. I'll be
as solemn as a church when I go down.

22
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:32,179
No, I am sorry, truly.

23
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,873
He was a nice man.
Though what he saw in Edith, I...

24
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,100
Goodness. The York and Ainsty
are holding a point-to-point

25
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,324
at Canningford Grange on Saturday,

26
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:46,114
and Mr Blake has persuaded Lord
Gillingham they should ride in it.

27
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:51,091
Don't you have to follow the hunt to be eligible?
They've been out with the York and Ainsty.

28
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:55,652
They'll have wangled it. I might join them.
Are ladies allowed to race with the men?

29
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:59,087
It changed just before the war.
Papa thinks it terribly fast.

30
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:02,283
Do they want to stay here,
Mr Blake and Lord Gillingham?

31
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:06,966
They want to meet at Canningford
and then come here that night. Golly.

32
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:10,314
Why would His Lordship come here
after you've broken it off?

33
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,151
Because he still won't accept
I know my own mind.

34
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:17,005
Anna, do you think
I'm looking rather frumpy?

35
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:18,954
Certainly not, Milady.
Hm.

36
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:21,780
I'm tempted to remind them
of what they're missing.

37
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,727
You'd never be that heartless.

38
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:31,141
Shrimpie says he's narrowing the list
of possibilities,

39
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:34,061
and he thinks he'll track her down
before long.

40
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:37,359
Are you going to tell the prince?
I think I should, don't you?

41
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:43,214
Would you like me to come?
No. I'll go alone this time.

42
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:50,071
Oh. I'm ever so sorry, Milady,
I didn't know you had company.

43
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:54,105
This is Mrs Crawley, my cousin.
You'll find she's a frequent visitor.

44
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,171
Good day, Madam.
Hello.

45
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:59,379
Denker is my new maid.
She's trying to find her way around.

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,752
Did you have a question, Denker?
It can wait, Milady.

47
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,731
Well, I was going to ask you about
the luggage,

48
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,200
and which cases you prefer
when you travel.

49
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:12,630
Why, I don't travel much these days.

50
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,139
Why don't you ask Spratt?
He'll help you.

51
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,268
Oh, he'll help me, will he? Hmm.

52
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,469
That's good to know.

53
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,486
If you'll excuse me.

54
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,622
Honestly, Mr Barrow, take some time
off and have a rest. You look awful.

55
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:32,813
I'm fine, thank you. I've never felt
better. You've never looked worse.

56
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,769
Since you are indifferent
to my opinions, Mr Bates,

57
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,695
it's only fitting I am indifferent to
yours. I'm nipping to the cottage.

58
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,859
- I've left my button box there.
- Oh, that's Lady Mary.

59
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,157
She must want something before lunch.
You go, I'll fetch it.

60
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:48,983
Would you? Thank you.

61
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:59,100
Do we know when he'll get here?
Later this afternoon.

62
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:05,717
I should have some drawings for you all to
look at before long. What sort of drawings?

63
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:11,088
Ideas for how we could renovate the run-down village
houses. Why is there such a building spurt?

64
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,342
The war showed how half
the population were badly housed.

65
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:18,300
They were shocked by how unhealthy
some of the new recruits were.

66
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:21,568
"You cannot expect to get an A1
population out of C3 homes. "

67
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,690
Who said that?
I think it was on a poster.

68
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:28,036
I heard from Charles today.
He and Tony are competing

69
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,865
in the point-to-point at Canningford
on Saturday.

70
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:33,196
Atticus was talking about that.
Atticus?

71
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:37,118
Atticus Aldridge, the chap I met in
York. Has he become a friend?

72
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,909
Yes. His parents, the Sinderbys,
have bought Canningford Grange.

73
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,451
Now they're wooing the county.
Lord Sinderby's rich, isn't he?

74
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,574
Who'd take it on if they weren't?

75
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:50,293
Why don't we all go, make a day of
it? We could ask Granny and Isobel

76
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:53,748
and take the children. Shall I tell
Charles they can stay here?

77
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,752
Course, if you want them to.

78
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:05,428
When this fellow arrives, it would be nice if you
could leave Edith and me to see him on our own.

79
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,827
This must be it. Ah.

80
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:44,959
Really, Milady? You do surprise me.

81
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:50,723
I hope your standards are
not so high as to prevent you

82
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,500
remaining in my employment, Denker.

83
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:56,348
No, not at all.
Not as high as that, Milady.

84
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:59,785
Where's the...?

85
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,802
Where's the knocker?

86
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,474
You... You stay here.

87
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,279
I've shown him
into the drawing room,

88
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,308
but I'm afraid it is as we feared.

89
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,592
Oh, I am sorry.
His Lordship's with them now.

90
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:37,595
He's here, then?
Yes, and it's not looking hopeful.

91
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:41,752
Oh, dear. Mrs Hughes says
you want to come with us tomorrow.

92
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:46,014
Only if you wouldn't mind.
This is the olive branch, I suppose?

93
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:49,208
If it's too much trouble -
No, no.

94
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,237
You can buy the tea.

95
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,350
Mr Carson wants to see the cottage.

96
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:00,675
He wants you to forgive him.

97
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:03,230
Why don't you come too?
I've got work to do.

98
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:06,782
You seem to be working harder
than when Miss Bunting was around.

99
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:09,407
I am.
I'm determined not to let her down.

100
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:16,234
Some tea? I can just about make tea.

101
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:24,058
How did you find me?
Rose gave me your address.

102
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,822
And you came alone
to this part of the city?

103
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:30,843
I was accompanied by my maid.
She's waiting outside.

104
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,898
How wonderful to be back in a world

105
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,840
where ladies are
accompanied by their maids.

106
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,299
Why didn't your son provide you
with a car?

107
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:48,296
Oh, he would have done. I just didn't
choose to tell him where I was going.

108
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,561
It is not our first
secret assignation.

109
00:08:55,384 --> 00:09:00,139
I always feel more comfortable...
leaving the past in the past.

110
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:04,098
Then why have you come?

111
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:07,558
Because Rose's father,
Lord Flintshire,

112
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,240
thinks he's close
to finding the Princess.

113
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,099
She's alive, then? She was alive
when she left Russia. That they know.

114
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,634
They think she was put on a boat
headed for Hong Kong.

115
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:23,592
You'll know more soon.

116
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:38,979
I wanted you
from the moment I first saw you.

117
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:43,044
More than mortal man
ever wanted woman.

118
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:45,061
That is an historical detail.

119
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,081
Nonsense.

120
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,905
If Irena were dead, I would ask you
to run away with me now.

121
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:55,063
You couldn't run away

122
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:57,448
when there's no-one left
to "run away" from.

123
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,823
I loved you more than I loved her.

124
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:06,009
Even today.

125
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,039
Even this afternoon.

126
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,815
Please don't.
Why not,

127
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,025
if it's true?

128
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:17,051
Because you'll make it sound as if
we were both unhappy,

129
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,654
and I don't believe you were -
and I certainly was not.

130
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,888
You wouldn't admit it
if it were true.

131
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:31,795
You think to be unhappy
in a marriage... is ill-bred.

132
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,047
You do know me, Igor.

133
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,394
That I must concede.

134
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,423
Yes.

135
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:52,030
Who was that?
Sergeant Willis.

136
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:59,110
He wants to come back with that man
from Scotland Yard.

137
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:02,293
I don't like the sound of it.
Is it to see Mr Bates again?

138
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,355
That's the funny thing.

139
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:07,326
He wants to see Miss Baxter
this time. Miss Baxter?

140
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:10,177
What's she got to say about it?
Search me.

141
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:13,997
When are they coming?
Tomorrow morning.

142
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:17,379
I hope they don't stay all day -
or we'll miss our appointment.

143
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,919
He's gone.
Didn't he want some tea?

144
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,278
I offered him tea, dinner and a bed for
the night, but he had to get back.

145
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,704
Gregson's dead, I'm afraid.

146
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,421
How terrible that is to hear.

147
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,839
And was it this Herr Hitler?

148
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,769
Apparently.
Or at least his gang of thugs,

149
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,990
during the so-called
Bierkeller Putsch in Munich.

150
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:50,521
It took days for the police to get
the city back under control,

151
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,974
and by then any trace of Gregson
was buried.

152
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:56,002
They've found him now, of course -
or what's left of him.

153
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:58,771
It's too horrible to think about.

154
00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:02,002
At least they've locked Hitler up
for five long years.

155
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:05,278
Coombs says he won't serve
five years, or anything like it.

156
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:09,706
There's another thing.

157
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:14,207
Edith inherits Gregson's publishing
company. I think I expected that.

158
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,963
I hope, somehow, it helps her
get through this.

159
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:20,892
It was very generous of him.
I suppose they loved each other.

160
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:23,361
Oh, poor Edith.
How is she taking it?

161
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:27,208
Hard to say.
It wasn't a surprise, of course.

162
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,183
But there's always a shred of hope,
isn't there? Shall I go and see her?

163
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,163
She's gone for a walk.

164
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:36,160
She wanted to be on her own.

165
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:50,039
I'm sorry, Milady, I'm afraid
it's not convenient just now.

166
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,292
L- I only want a moment.
As I said, it's not convenient.

167
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,718
What's this?
I don't want her to come in.

168
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,668
Well, there's no need to be rude.
Of course not.

169
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:01,056
Well, she's not coming in -
and that's flat.

170
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:09,053
I'm trying to bring her around, but
I wish you hadn't jumped the gun.

171
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:13,377
I know, but I had some bad news today
and I needed to see her.

172
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:16,098
You mean you were right about
Marigold's father?

173
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,832
I'm very sorry to hear it.

174
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,700
But if you could just give me some
time. I don't have time, Mr Drewe.

175
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:31,542
Of course I'm sorry, but let's face
it - he's been dead for over a year.

176
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,742
That's when he went missing.

177
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:37,306
Yes, but he didn't die for
Lady Edith until this afternoon.

178
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,934
That's what matters, isn't it?
I suppose so.

179
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:44,176
What are you studying now, Daisy?
The War of the Spanish Succession.

180
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:46,184
Oh. As a matter of fact, I'm Ve...

181
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:51,246
Very what, Mr Molesley?

182
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,048
Er... Oh, never mind.

183
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:03,589
Ohh... I'm sorry to disturb
Your Ladyship. What is it, Spratt?

184
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,185
We are having rather a problem
with Miss Denker.

185
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:10,616
She does not seem to grasp
the laundry arrangements here.

186
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:15,282
She wants it all to go to the big
house, even the... smaller items.

187
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:18,360
You're losing your sense of
the appropriate, Spratt.

188
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,703
You're losing your sense of occasion.

189
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:23,248
But she's back there
in the kitchen now,

190
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:27,189
shouting at the top of her voice,
and refusing to wash your... things.

191
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,454
Well, I'm sure this is
all very interesting to Mrs Crawley.

192
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm sorry, Milady, but I can't
help it. May I send her in?

193
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:41,027
I do apologise. Oh, don't.
I'm enjoying it immensely.

194
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:43,347
Oh, that's what I was afraid of.

195
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:47,724
Are you going to the picnic at Canningford
Grange on Saturday? I think I might.

196
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:51,208
Oh, I'm glad, because...
No, never mind.

197
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,375
What were you going to say?

198
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:56,069
Only that I've asked
Lord Merton to tea tomorrow.

199
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:59,786
Have you decided at last?

200
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:03,001
Yes, I think so. Oh.
But please don't pester me.

201
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,416
- I'll let you know on Saturday.
- Oh.

202
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:10,053
I'm having rather a problem
with Mr Spratt, Milady.

203
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:13,142
I do not know if Miss Collins
pandered to him,

204
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:17,365
but he seems to have no knowledge of
the proper role of a lady's maid.

205
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:21,386
Well, we all pander to Spratt
in this house, Denker.

206
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:25,566
He rules us with a rod of iron.
All except me, Milady.

207
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:29,541
But I see you have company, so we'll
discuss this at some other time.

208
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,961
And you wonder why I have
neither lady's maid nor butler.

209
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,797
When I've done these,
I might go back to the cottage

210
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:44,987
and read until our dinner.

211
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:48,490
Madge says Lady Edith is
dreadfully cut up,

212
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:52,004
and it's extra hard because
he was killed so long ago.

213
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:56,006
And I suppose she can't expect the
whole household to go into mourning

214
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:58,867
when he was no relation
and he's been dead for so long.

215
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,824
Will you please tell me
what is the matter?

216
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:10,068
I couldn't find your button box.
I'd forgotten all about it.

217
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,155
Oh, well, never mind.
It'll turn up. I did look.

218
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:16,094
I looked in all the cupboards,

219
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,084
and I found some other things.
Oh, yes? Yes.

220
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,156
I found a book by Marie Stopes

221
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:27,896
and a box containing
a cunning piece of equipment

222
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:31,356
to ensure there would be
no Baby Bates.

223
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,086
And I'm supposed to applaud your
poking around in my things, am I?

224
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:38,131
Now, just a minute. It is not for
you to be angry with me -

225
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:41,265
it is for me to be angry with you.
How do you make that out?

226
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,324
You tell me
you are longing for a child,

227
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:47,326
that it's in the hands of God,
but you seem to have

228
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:51,214
put it in the very practised hands
of Miss Stopes.

229
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:54,406
You're wrong. It's not like that.
Then what is it like?

230
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,594
Come in, Lily.

231
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,540
I'll leave these on the table
for you.

232
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:04,160
Ah, Daisy, there you are. I wondered
if you'd like to borrow this.

233
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,716
What is it? The fifth volume of
The Cambridge Modern History.

234
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:10,377
My dad gave me the whole set
for my 40th birthday.

235
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,881
I don't know.
I've got so many books already.

236
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:15,882
Don't be churlish.
Mr Molesley's offering to lend you

237
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:17,936
one of his prized possessions.

238
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:21,946
There's a good chapter on the war
and politics in Queen Anne's reign.

239
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:25,022
But if it's not interesting to you,
I quite understand.

240
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:26,993
No, I will look at it. Thank you.

241
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:35,022
He's very kind, you know.
We should always be polite

242
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:37,784
to people who are kind.
There's not much of it about.

243
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,648
What have you told Bates?
Nothing.

244
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,610
And he hasn't asked why you're
sleeping in here? Certainly not.

245
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,007
I wondered if you might like to
change your mind and come back.

246
00:17:56,703 --> 00:18:00,582
You heard Mr Bricker say he was
not in my room by my invitation.

247
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,382
How do I know that wasn't
just his gallantry?

248
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,436
Because I'm telling you.
Nothing happened.

249
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,712
I'll tell you what did happen. You
allowed him into your private life.

250
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:15,131
A man who thought he could
step into my place, just like that.

251
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:18,469
He thought it - and he was mistaken.

252
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:28,133
Very well. If you can honestly say
you have never let a flirtation

253
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:31,841
get out of hand since we married,
if you have never given a woman

254
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:34,802
the wrong impression,
then by all means stay away.

255
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:37,392
Otherwise, I expect you
back in my room tonight.

256
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:59,716
But why me?
What have I got to do with it?

257
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:02,345
I wasn't working here
when Mr Green first came.

258
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:05,388
That's right. She only came -
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

259
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:08,232
Even so, we understand
you have some information

260
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:11,029
concerning Mr and Mrs Bates.
What information?

261
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,111
That's what we hope you'll tell us.

262
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:16,728
I want to talk about your past.
Would you prefer we were alone?

263
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:19,774
I can't allow you
to question a maid in this house

264
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:21,912
without my being present.
Miss Baxter?

265
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:25,050
Let her stay.
Very well.

266
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:28,114
When you served your prison
sentence for theft - What?

267
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:30,269
They released you after three years,

268
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,482
leaving the remaining two years
to lie on the books. Yes.

269
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:36,122
You know that if you break the terms
of your release,

270
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:39,069
you can return to prison
without a trial? That seems -

271
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,474
Mrs Hughes, one more interruption
and I will ask you to leave.

272
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,751
You think I know more than I do.

273
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:50,319
I believe there was an incident
when Mr Green was staying here.

274
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,950
And there may have been a journey
to London that no-one knew about,

275
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:56,678
but I couldn't swear to any of it.

276
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,166
Not even whether it was
Mr Bates who made the journey?

277
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,734
Not even that.

278
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,380
Thanks for your help, Miss Baxter.

279
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,396
Who told you I knew anything?

280
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:11,866
We had a letter.
From whom?

281
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,263
Good day, Mrs Hughes.

282
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:19,225
I am going to ask one question.

283
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,199
Does Her Ladyship know your story?

284
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,893
Yes, she knows everything.

285
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,279
Then we'll say no more about it.

286
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:40,377
Come and see these.
Oh, yes,

287
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:43,775
this is just the kind of work
we're looking for, isn't it?

288
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,642
I knew you'd say that.
Why? They'd cost the most.

289
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:50,041
And these designs? They'd be
much cheaper. Much nastier.

290
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:54,005
A lot of the renovated cottages will
be occupied by lifetime tenants.

291
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,253
We'd have no real income
for 20 years.

292
00:20:56,254 --> 00:21:01,089
So instead of Mr Wavell's horrid houses, we'll
make our own? Tom's protecting the estate.

293
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,929
What's the matter, darling?
She's very listless.

294
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,971
I wonder if she's picked up a germ?

295
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:09,345
She'd have eaten a dead squirrel
or something equally fell.

296
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:12,779
She's quite fat. Perhaps she's
pregnant. No, she can't be.

297
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,182
So, what do we say about
these drawings?

298
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:19,044
I suppose we should go for the
cheaper option, but it's a shame.

299
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,497
Anyway, I must fly. I've got
an appointment in York in an hour.

300
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,870
Mrs Hughes,
have you seen Miss Baxter?

301
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:29,790
It's not like you to seek her
company. I'm serious, Mrs Hughes.

302
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,184
It's all right. I heard.
Could I talk with you, please?

303
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,059
Come in here.

304
00:22:03,942 --> 00:22:07,583
I'm sorry about this.
Go on. I can take it.

305
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:14,084
God in heaven.

306
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:18,631
I thought it would pass,
but it just keeps getting worse.

307
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,861
I can't sleep.
I'm not surprised.

308
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,867
Help me.

309
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:30,064
You were always asking if I need
help. Well, now's your chance.

310
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:35,457
I don't know what to do.
We're going to the doctor,

311
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,759
now, and we'll show him the syringe,

312
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,127
and the liquid you injected, all the
pills you've been taking, all of it.

313
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,430
Follow me down in five minutes,
and we'll meet by the backdoor,

314
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,197
and bring everything with you -
do you understand?

315
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:58,273
I've done something
that I shouldn't have.

316
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:01,821
And if you knew what it was, you
wouldn't want to be part of this.

317
00:23:01,822 --> 00:23:03,590
I know what it was.

318
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,366
Now, come down in five minutes.

319
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:14,017
Ahh.

320
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,664
It is wonderful on you, My Lady.

321
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,739
I hope so. My father will explode.

322
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,769
Mais superbe.

323
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:27,593
Thank you.

324
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:30,796
You've made me feel very strong.

325
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:35,600
Does this cover it?
My Lady is very generous.

326
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:44,381
At least she can carry it off.

327
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,707
Most of them look like
bald monkeys.

328
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:51,924
Hold on.

329
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:55,040
And it won't trouble him further?

330
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,534
Not as long as he stops
poisoning himself.

331
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,108
You've had a look at the things
he brought, then?

332
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:05,839
You've been injecting yourself
with a solution of saline.

333
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,142
That's not harmful, though, is it?
It obviously wasn't sterilised.

334
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:14,692
Repeated injections would cause
fever, and abscesses at the site.

335
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:18,156
I assume this is a course of
treatment you've spent money on?

336
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,351
Yes, a lot of money.

337
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:23,484
I went to London
for what they call electrotherapy.

338
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:28,555
And the pills and injections were
supposed to continue the process.

339
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:30,526
The purpose of which was...?

340
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:38,235
To change me.

341
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:41,276
To make me more like other people.

342
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:44,512
Other men.

343
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:51,388
Well, I'll not be coy and pretend I
don't understand. Nor do I blame you.

344
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,782
But there is no drug,
no electric shock,

345
00:24:54,783 --> 00:24:57,232
that will achieve what you want.

346
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:59,522
You mean I've been taken for a mug.

347
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:02,372
My advice to you, Thomas,

348
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:06,679
would be to accept the burden that
chance has seen fit to lay upon you.

349
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,304
And to fashion as good a life
as you are able.

350
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:12,735
Remember - harsh reality is
always better than false hope.

351
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,180
Well, that will give you
a good laugh. It won't.

352
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,158
And I don't expect you
to understand,

353
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,783
but I think it shows you
to be a very brave person.

354
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,424
What?

355
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:34,989
To inflict such pain on yourself
to achieve your goal.

356
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:38,491
Think what you
could do in this world

357
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:40,440
if you just set your mind to it.

358
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,867
You're daft - do you know that?

359
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:52,492
I must telephone Atticus
to warn him we're all coming.

360
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,798
Ask him for dinner tonight
if he's free.

361
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,769
Could I? I mean, just as a friend.
Well, just as a friend, absolutely.

362
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,845
I wish Isis would perk up.

363
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,989
I might ask Stapeley
to have a look at her.

364
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,967
It can't hurt.

365
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:16,971
I think it's very nice, very solid.

366
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:19,816
Oh, I hope it is solid,
at this price.

367
00:26:19,817 --> 00:26:23,707
What's the kitchen like? Oh,
not quite the scale you're used to.

368
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,175
Well, I wouldn't mind -
it'd be my own.

369
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:30,023
I could live here later
when I stopped working.

370
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:32,243
There's only one flight of stairs,

371
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:35,662
so I'm sure I could manage that,
no matter how old I get.

372
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,842
Oh, an outside privy, I see.
That'll bring back memories.

373
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:42,057
Well, Lord knows
I've seen one of them before.

374
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:46,757
But 'appen I could change things
round when I move in.

375
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:48,759
I'm sure you could.

376
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:55,215
Well, that's it. I'm going to take
it. Now, if you'll come outside,

377
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:57,557
I'll take the key back
and give him my answer.

378
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:03,265
I envy her.

379
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:06,149
Have you ever thought about
your life in retirement?

380
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:10,081
Who says I'll live to retire?

381
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,515
Is everybody ready? What is this?
Oh, it's my cousin Mary.

382
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:20,818
She says she's got a surprise
for us. You'll love her.

383
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,847
I intend to love everybody.
Ready or not, I'm coming in.

384
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:29,943
Pola Negri comes to Yorkshire.

385
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:33,611
Well, we really are
living in the modern world.

386
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:36,875
Golly, I'm jealous.
Mary, this is Atticus Aldridge.

387
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:40,055
At last, Mr Aldridge.
Rose has talked of nothing else.

388
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:44,537
Oh, she's only teasing. Can't I take
it as a compliment?

389
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,164
Granny, what do you think?
Oh. It is you.

390
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:51,106
I thought it was a man
wearing your clothes.

391
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:54,074
It suits you.
Papa, do you agree?

392
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:58,065
It's certainly just the sort of
thing I would expect of you.

393
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:00,777
I suppose you disapprove?
Not especially.

394
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,569
I'm just amazed that even you
would choose the day after I learn

395
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,409
the man I love is dead
to try out a new fashion.

396
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,494
I don't believe that's quite fair.
And you've planned a jolly picnic

397
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:14,171
for Saturday.
Am I really expected to join in?

398
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:16,927
Hopefully not,
as you usually spoil everything.

399
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,021
Huh. Yes, I do.

400
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:22,867
It seems I do.

401
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,299
Goodnight, Mama.
I'll have a tray in my room.

402
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,960
I'm sorry, Mr Aldridge, but you
might as well know what we're like.

403
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:38,169
Poor darling. She's so unhappy. She
hasn't clapped eyes on him in years.

404
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,130
She must have known long ago
he was dead - we all did.

405
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:44,468
But should we go on Saturday?
Please don't cancel.

406
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,438
Rose and I are going,
whether you're coming or not.

407
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:50,737
Maybe it would be good for her to
have time on her own to think.

408
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:54,349
All this endless thinking.
It's very overrated.

409
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,521
Oh, Aunt Violet, I do love you.

410
00:28:56,522 --> 00:29:02,533
I blame the war. Before 1914, nobody
thought about anything at all.

411
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:09,424
But what would I want
with such a thing?

412
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:11,852
I'll tell you.

413
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:15,157
It's quite simple.
To avoid bearing my child.

414
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:19,215
How can you believe that...
when it's all I've ever dreamed of?

415
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,266
Because you think I'm a murderer.

416
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:32,067
What are you saying?

417
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:36,768
We know how Vera died.
Not Vera.

418
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:38,763
But...

419
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,776
...Mr Green.

420
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:53,486
How long have you known it was him?

421
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:56,491
I've known since the first day
I heard that it happened.

422
00:29:57,815 --> 00:30:01,161
You can't have. You may have
suspected, but you didn't know.

423
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:03,570
I knew when he came back.
I knew when he said

424
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:06,501
he went down to the kitchens
during the concerts.

425
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:13,327
And I kept telling myself you didn't
know, so it couldn't have been you.

426
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:17,541
Who killed him, you mean?

427
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:23,714
I wanted to.

428
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,968
I was going to.

429
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:35,302
I went into York very early, and
I bought a return ticket to London.

430
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:38,434
I planned to get there and back
in the same day.

431
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:42,605
I went onto the platform,
but I never got onto the train.

432
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,785
Because I knew...

433
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:53,994
...if I saw him,
I would have killed him.

434
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:58,796
And if I killed him...
I would hang.

435
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:01,873
I couldn't do that to you.

436
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:04,949
Thank God.

437
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,638
The next day, when I heard what had
happened, it was like...

438
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:10,635
the hand of fate.

439
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:15,664
I had the ticket in my coat pocket,

440
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,947
like a talisman.
What for?

441
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:20,501
Because if I'd have travelled,
I'd...

442
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:24,477
I would've handed in both halves.
The fact that it was in my pocket,

443
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:27,893
untorn, was proof
that I never travelled.

444
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:30,931
Which is why you were so angry
when I gave it to Mrs Hughes.

445
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:37,828
If the clerk in York
remembers selling me

446
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,776
a return ticket to London,

447
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,653
I'm a dead man.

448
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,429
Why are you smiling?

449
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,826
Because you're innocent.

450
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:52,799
I have lived in such fear...

451
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:55,915
...and such trembling,

452
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,200
and all the while
I couldn't tell you why.

453
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:02,789
And now I'm just so happy.

454
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:07,643
Mad as it sounds, I'm so happy.

455
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,929
What do you make of Lady Mary's hair?

456
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,595
They were all talking about it.
I hope she comes down to show us.

457
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:30,744
Miss Bunting
loved the new hairstyles.

458
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:34,686
She said women were being set free.

459
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:37,172
I'm sorry Miss Bunting's gone.

460
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:41,434
She gave me such confidence.
She'd tell me how sharp I was,

461
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:43,678
how quick.
I agree with her.

462
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,690
It's harder on your own,
harder to believe.

463
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,957
Well, could I help?

464
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:54,944
Not with mathematics, probably,
but I know a bit about history

465
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:59,781
and I've read a few books. How old
were you when you left school? 12.

466
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:02,210
It was a shame, really.
I was quite bright.

467
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,218
And my dad wanted me to stay on.

468
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:09,167
He thought I could be a teacher,
if that doesn't make you laugh.

469
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:12,019
But he couldn't manage it.
We had no money, you see,

470
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,085
and then my mother got ill and
so I had to earn as soon as I could.

471
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:18,177
Why don't you take Matric now?

472
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:20,882
No, I've missed it.

473
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:23,718
But I'd like to help.

474
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,735
Make sure somebody got away.

475
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:33,527
Mrs Hughes?

476
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:37,329
Do you remember that overcoat
I gave you, for the refugees,

477
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,062
when we were in London
for Lady Rose's ball?

478
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:42,628
I do. They were very glad of it.

479
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:46,672
It sounds mad, I know,
but did you find a ticket in it,

480
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:48,773
in the pocket?

481
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:53,459
Of course. You won't remember.
No, I do.

482
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,034
I did find one, a return to London.

483
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,109
That's it.

484
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,139
Come...

485
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:05,051
You see,

486
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:10,128
Mr Bates does know
that it was Mr Green. Oh, my Lord!

487
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:13,014
But he didn't do it, Mrs Hughes.
I know that now.

488
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:15,426
And if we had that ticket
we could prove it.

489
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:19,614
We could prove that he never went to
London. I don't understand. How?

490
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:21,600
Because it wasn't torn.

491
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:27,683
Of course, you threw it out.
Why wouldn't you?

492
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:30,810
I must have done. I'm so sorry.

493
00:34:30,811 --> 00:34:34,002
It's not your fault. It's mine.

494
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,566
I gave it away.

495
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:41,129
I gave away the proof of
my husband's innocence.

496
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:58,761
Come on,
get your pies, get your pies!

497
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:35,578
Well, I think you are very brave.

498
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,164
Brave? I'm petrified. I don't even
know the horse I'm riding.

499
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:41,208
How long is the course?
Three miles.

500
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,717
Twice round a course of
a mile-and-a-half.

501
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:46,509
To where you can see
that steeple over there.

502
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,089
Well, hello.
What on earth are you doing here?

503
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,688
What do you think?
Riding the point-to-point.

504
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:59,345
Won't someone introduce us? This is
Mabel Lane Fox. Lord Grantham.

505
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:03,088
Where are you staying? Last night
I was with the Lawsons at Brough,

506
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:06,059
but they're away tonight
so I'll head back to London.

507
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,021
What a trek. You'll be exhausted.

508
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:11,217
Stay with us. Lord Gillingham
and Mr Blake will be there.

509
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:15,456
Have you brought enough clothes?
Oh, I think so. I know so.

510
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:18,850
Are you riding?

511
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:21,182
What's this? Where have you been?

512
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:25,543
Mr Aldridge and I fixed it last night. His
nice parents let me change at the house.

513
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:28,313
I do wish you'd call me Atticus.
I admire you.

514
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:31,747
It'd be a poor show not to ride at
our own event. Quite right.

515
00:36:31,748 --> 00:36:35,488
I shall cheer you on. What about
you? When did you decide to ride?

516
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:39,419
Yesterday, when I was having my hair
done in York. What about a horse?

517
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,455
Stephen rode Trumpeter over earlier.
They're down by the starting post.

518
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:47,433
This does seem like too much of
a coincidence. Are you stalking me?

519
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:50,651
I shall ignore that as I'd
hate to think of you as a vain man.

520
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:53,678
Well, you certainly know
how to surprise.

521
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,072
That sounds like a compliment.
I must say hello to Charles.

522
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,850
Well done. You seem to have
got things off to a good start.

523
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:07,357
What would you have done if Lady
Grantham hadn't asked me to stay?

524
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,422
I'd have suggested it myself.

525
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:20,635
Oh, I thought you'd gone with them.

526
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:23,948
No, I've a lot to do. To be honest,
it's not really my thing.

527
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:29,414
Are you going out again? No.
I've a new tenancy contract to check,

528
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:32,474
and I want to go through the figures
for the repair shop.

529
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:35,554
You see, I'm going away.

530
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:39,101
I didn't know that.
No, well, I haven't told anybody.

531
00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:41,517
I don't understand.

532
00:37:41,518 --> 00:37:46,729
You don't have to, but when they get
back, tell them my mind was made up

533
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,746
and I wasn't hysterical or anything.

534
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,817
And give them my love.
Oh, God, Edith.

535
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:55,416
Won't you wait
and talk to them about it?

536
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,904
If I talked to anyone, it'd be you.

537
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:00,336
Then talk to me, please.
I can't.

538
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:05,213
But good luck.
You're a fine man, Tom.

539
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:09,171
You mustn't let them
flatten that out of you.

540
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:11,789
Won't you tell me where you're going?

541
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,666
Or can't I at least drive you
somewhere? No.

542
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,271
But I will take one of the cars
to the station

543
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:19,813
and leave the keys
with the station master.

544
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:22,228
I just wish -
I can't stay, Tom,

545
00:38:23,174 --> 00:38:25,190
not if I'm ever
going to be happy at all.

546
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,778
It's lunacy! You've lost your mind!

547
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,455
Tell her.
It's true.

548
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,798
Marigold's her daughter.
It's a lie!

549
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:51,143
I don't know
what she's holding over you,

550
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:53,357
but you can't
let her get away with it!

551
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:55,617
I have a copy of
her birth certificate.

552
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:59,382
It's in French, but you can read
my name. Which was brave of you.

553
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:03,558
My aunt wanted me to use a false one, but I
knew I might need proof. Give that to me!

554
00:39:05,918 --> 00:39:09,587
I have others. You've cooked this up
between you. That's enough.

555
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:12,723
We've nothing formal that gives us
any claim over her.

556
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:15,538
Only a note from her dying father.
Which I wrote.

557
00:39:18,886 --> 00:39:20,855
How could you do this?

558
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:28,101
I'm your wife, yet you have lied and
cheated and used me shamefully.

559
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:31,903
If you'd have taken a mistress
you couldn't have been more false.

560
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:37,423
Mrs Drewe, I know you don't want to hear this, but
I'm very grateful. No, I don't bloody want to hear it!

561
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:39,943
Fetch her things.
I will not!

562
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,960
Then don't.

563
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:47,258
My baby. No...
There we go.

564
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:51,274
Wait! just wait, wait.

565
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:53,291
Wait.

566
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:11,448
She'll not sleep, else.

567
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,221
Don't be afraid, my darling...

568
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:23,397
This nice lady is your new mummy.
She loves you,

569
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:27,208
more than anyone else could.

570
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:29,344
But don't you forget...

571
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,396
...that we love you, too.

572
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,422
Best of luck!
Let me not fall in front of Rose.

573
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:05,467
I'm glad her opinion matters.

574
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:08,908
I'd rather not look a fool quite
yet. She can discover it gently.

575
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:14,691
I'm dying to ride astride.
Why don't you?

576
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:16,903
Not if my grandmother's watching.

577
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:19,235
You surprise me.
You seem more than able

578
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:23,168
to choose which laws to keep and
which to break. Don't be spiky,

579
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:25,461
when I only want what you want.
Which is?

580
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:29,259
For you and Tony to walk into the
sunset together. I do resent you.

581
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,865
I resent your ability to take him
off me, when I know how to make him

582
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,498
happy, and I certainly love him more
than you do. That's all true.

583
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:40,125
Then why turn up looking like a
cross between a Vogue fashion plate

584
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:42,977
and a case of dynamite?
I can't make it too easy for him.

585
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:46,098
They're just about ready to go.

586
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:48,764
Can I have a look, Donk?

587
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:55,193
Can you see Aunt Mary?
Yes.

588
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:01,857
I think she's splendid.

589
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:05,751
I think she's cracked.

590
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:08,681
It's good to do some crazy things
when you're young.

591
00:42:08,682 --> 00:42:11,558
As long as you survive them.

592
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:14,452
Some do crazy things
all their lives. Hmm.

593
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:19,084
What answer did you give?

594
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:23,801
I'm going to tell them
when we're all together.

595
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:25,851
You won't give me away?

596
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:29,300
You mean you've accepted him? Huh.

597
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,166
I know you'll think me foolish,

598
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:36,811
but I feel it's my last chance
of a new adventure before I'm done.

599
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:43,474
Huh. Well, now you've accepted him,
you'll hear no more argument from me.

600
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:18,210
Go on!

601
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:20,994
Go, Atticus, go!

602
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,849
Come on, faster!

603
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:54,318
Tony!

604
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:21,377
You might have allowed her to be
the first woman. Nonsense.

605
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:23,636
I don't believe in
letting people win.

606
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:27,058
Even if it's in your own interest?
Mm-hm. You rode well.

607
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:32,028
If I make it across the finishing line at all
it's a miracle, as far as I'm concerned. Nonsense.

608
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:34,280
You're a positive centaur.

609
00:44:34,281 --> 00:44:38,290
See? He's nearly there - if you'd
just stop jerking his lead.

610
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:43,276
Well done, but thank God you're all
back in one piece. Who's this?

611
00:44:43,278 --> 00:44:48,371
My parents. Mother, Father, this is Lord and
Lady Grantham. Lady Mary you already know.

612
00:44:48,372 --> 00:44:52,698
Lord Gillingham, Mabel Lane Fox,
Charles Blake and, of course, Rose.

613
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:55,282
Lady Rose,
how lovely to see you again.

614
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:57,746
Come back to the house to bathe
and change.

615
00:44:57,747 --> 00:45:01,178
I'm going to leave it until we get
back to Downton, but thank you.

616
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:03,164
I can't tempt you
to stay for dinner?

617
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:05,212
Not today. We're covered in dust.

618
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:09,305
Come to Downton tomorrow for dinner.
That seems rather an imposition.

619
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,060
Not at all.
Then we'd be delighted.

620
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:17,199
You haven't met my mother-in-law and our
cousin, Mrs Crawley. Good afternoon.

621
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,605
If the parents of Rose's young man
are coming for dinner,

622
00:45:20,606 --> 00:45:23,964
things must be
more advanced than I realised.

623
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:27,820
He seems a nice boy, and it's not
like the Catholics, is it?

624
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:30,166
She won't be expected to convert.

625
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:33,262
Con... Convert to what?
Judaism.

626
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,439
I read in an article, Lord Sinderby

627
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,124
is a leading figure
in the Jewish community.

628
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:42,074
There's always something,
isn't there?

629
00:45:46,346 --> 00:45:49,055
What do you mean, gone?
She's gone.

630
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:53,308
She didn't say where, but I doubt
it's to Lady Rosamund's. Why?

631
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:56,537
Of course she was very upset about
Gregson, but why run off?

632
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:02,659
I think I'll slip away, Carson.
Is the car still outside?

633
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:06,185
They're just unloading it now,
My Lady. I'll - You stay here.

634
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:08,112
I can manage.

635
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:10,621
Could you take those two down?
Yes.

636
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:14,172
Whose cases are these? Lady Mary's.
They're her riding things.

637
00:46:15,952 --> 00:46:19,011
These are Miss Lane Fox's.
If you could take them in.

638
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:23,832
Home, please. Can you
first stop at Yew Tree Farm?

639
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,423
Yes, Milady.

640
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:33,318
Lady Edith has taken off.
What do you mean? She's gone.

641
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:35,290
She left her car at the station.

642
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,115
Mr Branson's walking down there now
to pick it up.

643
00:46:38,117 --> 00:46:40,952
Oh, it must have been
the news from Germany. Tsk.

644
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:44,381
Poor thing. Well, I ought to
go and ring the gong.

645
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:51,154
Mrs Hughes,

646
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:55,450
may I make a suggestion that I think
you'll find a strange one,

647
00:46:55,451 --> 00:46:57,741
but I ask that you consider,
none the less.

648
00:46:57,742 --> 00:47:00,234
Heavens. I'm all agog.

649
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,216
Do you think that we should... um...

650
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,768
...invest in a property together?

651
00:47:08,752 --> 00:47:10,910
What on earth do you mean?

652
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:15,663
I was thinking, if Mrs Patmore
can do it, then we might buy

653
00:47:15,664 --> 00:47:18,855
somewhere jointly,
as a business venture, mind,

654
00:47:18,856 --> 00:47:21,886
spruce it up
and share the rental income.

655
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:24,105
We'd have a tidy sum
by the time we retired.

656
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,156
Go and ring that gong.

657
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:38,649
Well, so the birds have flown?

658
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,007
I won't say anything about it,
Your Ladyship. Not to anyone.

659
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,145
Nor will she.

660
00:47:47,146 --> 00:47:49,126
Do you know where she's gone?

661
00:47:52,734 --> 00:47:57,799
Well, thank you so much,
Mr Drewe, Mrs Drewe.

662
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,263
I mustn't take up
any more of your valuable time.

663
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:23,444
They'll bring a cot for
the young 'UN, madam.

664
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,897
Ring down if there's anything else.
I will do. Thank you.

665
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,288
Thank you.

666
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,292
Well, we're together, darling.

667
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:44,939
I know it's not ideal, but it's such
an improvement on being apart

668
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,753
that I think we should celebrate.

669
00:48:47,754 --> 00:48:51,217
I'll order ice cream,
and a glass of Champagne,

670
00:48:52,372 --> 00:48:54,436
and we'll be as jolly as you like.

671
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,029
Yes?
