1
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:39,727
Take them straight to the wagonette.

2
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,420
The inventory, Mr Carson.

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,592
Oh. Thank you.

4
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:59,037
Mrs Hughes. Oh. Thank you, Mr Barrow.

5
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,604
How can we get it up to London?

6
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,635
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to make repairs.

7
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:10,541
I must say, you're a real artist.

8
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,051
Well, it's as much Daisy's work as mine.

9
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:17,548
Now, how much should we take and what can we buy when we get there?

10
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,244
I'm happy to tell you that most things you can buy in Ripon

11
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:22,763
are also available in London.

12
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:24,698
But you don't trust them quite the same.

13
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,415
Well, YOU don't.

14
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:31,239
Why is she coming to London? Haven't they replaced Mrs Bute?

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,275
Oh no, no, they're not going to.

16
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:37,612
There'll be no permanent housekeeper at Grantham House in future.

17
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:40,072
Another clang in the march of time.

18
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:43,619
- Ta dah!
- Oh, that's lovely.

19
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:46,602
- You don't think it's a bit mumsy?
- No!

20
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:50,484
It's very chic. Can we see it with the hat?

21
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:00,149
Are you looking forward to London? I am.

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,186
Mr Bates and I need to inspect our house,
so the timing couldn't be better.

23
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:08,794
I'm sorry Susan's missing all this. She doesn't care about clothes.

24
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,242
I still don't understand why they didn't come two months ago.

25
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:16,250
The Government changed the date for the hand-over. They were stuck.

26
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,833
I'd have come back if it were my daughter's wedding.

27
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,381
I do not suggest a career in the Diplomatic.

28
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:23,714
- Will they be there before us?
- No.

29
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:26,167
They're spending the night in Southampton.

30
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:28,640
We'll all arrive in St James's on the same day.

31
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,983
Are we to pretend they're a happy couple?

32
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,896
Yes, we jolly well are. Why cast a shadow?

33
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:36,606
I quite agree. I'm sorry it can't be here.

34
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:39,851
I don't think a registry office wedding and a church blessing

35
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,600
would be what the county expects,

36
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:45,238
and London makes more sense for Susan and Shrimpie.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,456
And I want a blessing in a synagogue.
Would you find a synagogue in Ripon?

38
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:52,581
I do admire the way you just take it all in your stride.

39
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:55,077
It would make it easier for Lord Sinderby.

40
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:58,304
Oh, I'm not sure Lord Sinderby deserves your concern.

41
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:01,404
Atticus loves him and I love Atticus.

42
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:05,772
Love may not conquer all, but it can conquer quite a lot.

43
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:11,019
I worried about her ladyship having to face the traitor,

44
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,413
but Miss O'Brien's got herself taken on by the new Governor's wife.

45
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:19,800
Typical, but I've been told they've neither maid nor valet,

46
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:22,948
which seems odd for a Marquess and Marchioness.

47
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,370
I don't think they have two pennies to rub together. It's all gone.

48
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,460
So, the Sinderby millions must be a cheering thought.

49
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:35,053
I wonder. Lady Flintshire's not the
most liberal being on the planet.

50
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,579
No. Then again...

51
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,001
Madge says Lord Sinderby's none too keen. So I gather.

52
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,764
Hurrah for intolerance on both sides.

53
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,196
I'm worried about running it with only Messrs Barrow and Molesley.

54
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:50,319
You think we'll look a bit dingy? Don't you?

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,974
Could we borrow a spare footman? I don't know.

56
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:57,036
Borrowing footmen sounds like something out of the last century.

57
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,813
Even to me!

58
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:01,507
Hire a lad for the week. It wouldn't cost much.

59
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:06,915
That's to be it for the Big Parade?
The Big Parade's passed, Mr Carson.

60
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,432
We're just trying to keep up as best we can.

61
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:12,262
My turn.

62
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,930
What would my father say?

63
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:22,004
That you were building a very solid
friendship with your granddaughter.

64
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:26,374
No, darling. You've landed on a snake
so you have to go back to there.

65
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,845
No!

66
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:30,189
Don't be so mean. Let her stay where she is.

67
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,074
It won't be very helpful later on if we don't teach her how to lose.

68
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,927
Go ahead and cry, darling.

69
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:39,160
Make Donk feel guilty. Don't call me Donk!

70
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,862
Oh hurry up, Donk! It's your turn.

71
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:46,553
What's that? It's from my cousin in Boston.

72
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:50,316
He sells cars but he wants to expand into farm machinery.

73
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:52,612
Well, you know about both.

74
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:54,885
Exactly. He'd like me to come in with him.

75
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,440
Oh, is he opening a branch over here?

76
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:01,143
No. He's asked me to join him in Massachusetts.

77
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:04,511
As a partner. Oh, I see.

78
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:09,444
How's Lord Sinderby? I think he dreams of my changing my mind.

79
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:11,360
You'd think with a father like that

80
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,608
Atticus would have a more Jewish name.

81
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:16,275
His real name is Ephraim Atticus,

82
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,171
but his mother called him Atticus as a baby and it stuck.

83
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,685
She's your ally.

84
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:24,117
Yes, but not because she thinks it's all unimportant,

85
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:27,263
just that she thinks her son's happiness is more important.

86
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:28,632
Thank you!

87
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,926
I like the sound of that.

88
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:35,046
Mr and Mrs Bates. Might I take up a moment of your time?

89
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:38,101
I had a call earlier from Sergeant Willis.

90
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:41,227
Mr Vyner is back up here and wants to come by in the morning.

91
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,367
To see me. To see both of you.

92
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,858
I don't understand. Why?

93
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,426
I dare say it will become clearer after he's been.

94
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,522
We hoped this was over.

95
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:54,501
So did I, Mr Bates. So did I.

96
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,206
I'm going up.

97
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,915
Good night.

98
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,131
I'll check on the children so you don't have to.

99
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,725
She's keen. I'll give her that.

100
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:18,649
Why does she have to carry on as if she'd invented motherhood?

101
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,031
I'm going to bed, too.

102
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:23,028
Before you do, have you thought about the work in the village?

103
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,698
Those cottages are in quite a state and we ought to get on with it.

104
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,118
I know, I know, but how are we going to find the money?

105
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,418
Let's think about it while we're in London and make a decision.

106
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,648
Is it true that London Inspector is coming back tomorrow?

107
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:47,989
How do you know that?

108
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:56,438
Just remember I'd be happy to swear I saw that ticket in one piece.

109
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,667
Her ladyship's on her way to bed. Right. Thank you.

110
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:09,870
I hope Miss Baxter's not all we've got between us and trouble.

111
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:16,135
I want to use London this time because I always resolve

112
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:19,320
to visit theatres and galleries and museums.

113
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:22,085
Then I get home and I've not done anything.

114
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:23,364
I'll join you.

115
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:28,704
We'll go together. I'll hold you to that.

116
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:33,160
Ah. The date of the unveiling. Of the memorial? When is it?

117
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,501
On the 25th, so we'll just be back from the wedding.

118
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,578
Everyone, we will be unveiling the war memorial in the village

119
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,498
at twelve noon on the 25th.

120
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,564
I'd like the house to be well represented.

121
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:47,525
I hope you won't object if I don't come, Mr Carson.

122
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:51,103
Oh? You'd be missed.

123
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,441
I don't want to drag it up again, but it would be painful.

124
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,018
Mr Carson understands.

125
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,383
Yes, that's as may be.

126
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,115
Poor woman.

127
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,331
You heard her. Let's not drag it up again.

128
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,618
Have you quite finished, m'lady? Yes, thank you, Denker.

129
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,307
Who was that at the door?

130
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:17,861
A gentleman called Prince Kuragin, m'lady.

131
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,813
He's in the drawing room.

132
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:24,040
I told him you weren't downstairs but he said he'd wait.

133
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,424
He was most insistent. Yes I...

134
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:30,376
I don't think I'll wear what I chose last night.

135
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,163
I suspected that might be the case
so I put out the lavender day dress.

136
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,548
Goes very well with your ladyship's colouring.

137
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,408
The Prince is an old friend, Denker, nothing more.

138
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,597
Oh, I'm sure, m'lady, but it never hurts to look your best, does it?

139
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,764
No. I don't believe it does.

140
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,874
We'll need representatives of the regiments involved and a band,

141
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,225
but I dare say that's all under control.

142
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:01,453
I dare say it is, m'lord.

143
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:07,447
Oh, I'd like William Mason's father to have a good place.

144
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:11,070
William left this house to give his life for his country.

145
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,488
I feel that very deeply. We all do, m'lord.

146
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:17,081
Will you tell the staff? Already done.

147
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:19,036
We should have a good turnout.

148
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:22,917
Mrs Patmore has asked to be excused but that's understandable.

149
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:25,031
I'm sorry, but not surprised.

150
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,432
M'lord.

151
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:33,134
I don't know what you mean by "our last chance".

152
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:37,680
We left any chance we had behind us, many years ago.

153
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:40,695
I don't accept that. And what about the Princess?

154
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:43,312
They haven't found her yet.

155
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:46,399
We've been apart for a long time.

156
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,476
Are you proposing to divorce?

157
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,375
Why? Do you want more children?

158
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:55,805
I wish to spend my final years with you.

159
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:01,697
As a friend, as a lover.

160
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:05,969
I don't seek scandal, only love.

161
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:10,509
The last years have been ugly.

162
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,610
I don't want what remains to be ugly.

163
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,504
No.

164
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,403
So...

165
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,102
...what do you say?

166
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:25,223
You want an answer just like that?
I know my own feelings. You do too.

167
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,214
I can't make a decision now!

168
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:31,335
I won't change.

169
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:36,877
Don't proclaim your intransigence as if it were a virtue.

170
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,462
Things have advanced a little.

171
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:47,439
It seems Mr Green was not quite the
sunny soul that Mr Carson depicted.

172
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,639
He appears to have carried out a series of attacks on women.

173
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,560
They were too nervous to come forward before now,

174
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:58,959
but with a little encouragement some of them have spoken out.

175
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,942
We've formed a picture of his behaviour.

176
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:03,193
But nothing happened here!

177
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:06,624
His victims were generally small, slight women,

178
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,596
who'd given little or no encouragement.

179
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:11,741
How very unpleasant. It is rather 'unpleasant'.

180
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:15,488
Wouldn't you agree, Mrs Bates? Yes.

181
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:18,384
We also have news which may put Mr Bates in the clear.

182
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:21,328
A second witness has come forward.

183
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,115
His evidence suggests whoever was arguing with Green on the pavement

184
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:26,565
was shorter than him.

185
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,718
Shorter than yourself, Mr Bates.

186
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:31,845
What do you think, Mrs Hughes? I don't know a thing about it.

187
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:39,893
We'll leave it there.

188
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:45,594
If we need Mrs Bates to come to London, could that be arranged?

189
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:48,506
We'll be in London next week for Lady Rose's wedding.

190
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,331
Could you pop in to Scotland Yard on Tuesday at ten o'clock?

191
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:56,261
If she comes, I'll be with her. As you wish. Now I'll say goodbye.

192
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:02,468
What on earth was that about?

193
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:04,835
He's trying to bully it out,

194
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:07,161
but it's best not to stand in his way.

195
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:13,257
Bully what out?

196
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,755
You're required upstairs, Mr Carson.

197
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:28,697
Mr Evans. It's good of you to come. I'm pleased to, m'lord.

198
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:32,001
Your father carved many stones for our dogs over the years.

199
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,086
I'm glad you're prepared to go on with it.

200
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,937
These are like the ones we've made for you in the past.

201
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:41,773
Is this a book of pets' tombstones? A parallel universe.

202
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:45,108
No, m'lord. You've examples of everything we do.

203
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:48,781
Oh, I see. What's this?

204
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:50,752
A memorial, m'lord.

205
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:55,415
We made it for a garden in Hinckley.
Near Leicester? You do get about.

206
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:03,568
There you are! You took your time.

207
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,217
I thought you'd rung by accident.

208
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,647
How would you like to be summoned, by Joshua's trumpet?

209
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:12,484
I prefer not to be "summoned" at all.

210
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:14,039
At any rate, not by you.

211
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,697
Take these down to the car.

212
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:19,225
I'm going to fetch her galoshes and umbrella.

213
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:36,271
I've been thinking.

214
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,814
Should I tell them everything when
we get there and have done with it?

215
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:43,666
No. I'm not one to give up my secrets unless I have to.

216
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,871
They have nothing if the man who killed him can't have been you.

217
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,442
Even so.

218
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:50,037
Daisy?

219
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,622
Yes, Mr Carson.

220
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:56,921
Before we go, his lordship wants to extend an invitation to Mr Mason

221
00:13:56,922 --> 00:14:00,474
for the unveiling, which will include you as William's widow.

222
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:02,926
Thank you, Mr Carson. I'll write to him as Chairman.

223
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,776
It might be nice if you were to mention it in your next letter.

224
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,640
Of course. Right.

225
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,955
Well, we'd better get up to the cars.

226
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:15,271
I hope you can manage a few days without Denker, Spratt.

227
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,408
A hope that will be fulfilled and gladly, m'lady.

228
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:21,061
Are these all the cases, Denker?

229
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:24,024
Your ladyship is very sharp-eyed.

230
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:25,508
We are missing one.

231
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:30,757
Since Mr Spratt was given the task of bringing them down,

232
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,349
no doubt he's put it somewhere for safe keeping.

233
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,985
Oh, how very considerate of you, Spratt.

234
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:40,289
Fetch it now, please. But your ladyship, I don't...

235
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,634
Fetch the case, Spratt.

236
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,309
I feel so guilty, leaving Marigold on her own.

237
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,719
Oh, she's surrounded by nannies and children!

238
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,867
I know. She'll have a whale of a time.

239
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:16,657
Edith is obsessed with that child.

240
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:19,358
She's a dear little thing. So she is.

241
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:22,728
But as a matter of fact, there is something about her.

242
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:27,493
About Marigold? What? I don't know. A sense of deja vu.

243
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,855
I can't quite put my finger on it.

244
00:15:57,704 --> 00:16:02,917
All of you, Andy will be an extra footman while we're in London.

245
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,242
Please be helpful to him.

246
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:07,408
Starting at dinner tonight? That's the idea.

247
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,083
How did Mr Carson find you? I was working as a hall boy.

248
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,167
Mr Carson rang my old butler.

249
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,500
It's only a week's work. Will he take you back?

250
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,348
I don't want to go back as a hall boy.

251
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:19,104
I want to be a footman now and this is the first step.

252
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:22,356
I think that's brave. You've got to be brave these days.

253
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:26,083
Do you know London well? Not here. I grew up in the East End.

254
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,686
I've only ever worked in Bayswater. Bayswater?

255
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,725
North of the park. Oh yes, I know where it is.

256
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,777
So you're not known round here then? No.

257
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,966
You're just with us 'til after the wedding?

258
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:40,999
That's it. I dare say you enjoy a bit of fun.

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,963
I s'pose so. As much as the next man.

260
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:45,990
There's fun to be had round here if you know where to look for it.

261
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:49,678
You know this area, then? Oh, yes. I've come home.

262
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,234
I spent many a year in St James's Square.

263
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,443
Before we get drawn into Miss Denker's past adventures,

264
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:58,568
why don't you come with me and I'll show you how it all works?

265
00:16:58,569 --> 00:16:59,859
Chop, chop.

266
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:06,113
Welcome the hunter, home from the hill.

267
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:08,428
How are you both? Worn out!

268
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:09,900
The train from Southampton

269
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,910
was almost as bad as the voyage from Bombay.

270
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:13,871
You must lie down before you change.

271
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:17,262
Do you remember Carson?

272
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:20,704
I gather you haven't brought any personal attendants, m'lord.

273
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,172
Those days are done for us. We needn't tell the world.

274
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,391
You will have Lady Mary's maid Anna, to help you, m'lady.

275
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:32,294
His lordship will have Mr Molesley. Now I'll show you to your room.

276
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:35,218
We're not in one room? Together?

277
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:39,348
The thing is, we're very squashed. I'm not sharing a room.

278
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,798
I'll go to an hotel. Come on...

279
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,608
Don't worry m'lady, we'll manage. If you'd like to come this way.

280
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:53,617
Maybe Lady Rose could share with Lady Edith?

281
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,526
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

282
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,202
I knew she'd be trouble.

283
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:05,460
Mummy.

284
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,004
They said you'd arrived. Yes. What a journey.

285
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,855
I seem to have been travelling for as long as I can remember.

286
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,708
Well, you're here now.

287
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,260
Won't you give your poor old mother a kiss?

288
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,607
Of course.

289
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,522
This is quite a choice you've made. I hope you'll like him.

290
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:26,661
They're all coming for dinner tonight.

291
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:30,023
And you're quite, quite sure?

292
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,241
Absolutely.

293
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,295
Well then, that's all I needed to hear.

294
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:41,165
Has Mr Carson announced dinner? They're not all here yet.

295
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,950
I found a letter from Mr Vyner when we arrived,

296
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:46,673
confirming I'm to be at Scotland Yard in the morning.

297
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:48,420
Try not to worry about it.

298
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,606
Why not go to see your house afterwards? You'd enjoy that.

299
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,039
Now, in London, we supervise,

300
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,316
but they help themselves to coffee and drinks from a side table.

301
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,181
Once they settle, we leave them to it.

302
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,940
In my last place, the footmen stayed 'til they went to bed.

303
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,999
If they want a second drink, it's up to them.

304
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:09,615
There we are.

305
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:12,389
I hope Anna was helpful.

306
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,579
She will be, I'm sure.

307
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,520
Where are the Sinderbys?

308
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:20,725
Oh?! We thought you might be Lord and Lady Sinderby.

309
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,788
'Fraid not.

310
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:24,945
Hello.

311
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:28,521
What are they like? She's very nice and fond of Rose.

312
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:32,348
He's less convinced. Rose is more than a match for him.

313
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:35,188
It does make me smile that they should be the ones objecting.

314
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:37,730
They have as much right as we do. Mummy, Daddy...

315
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:40,026
Can you try to behave like a happy couple?

316
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:43,197
Wouldn't that be rather dishonest? You haven't separated yet.

317
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:46,406
We separated the moment we walked down the gangway at Southampton.

318
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:49,816
It won't kill us to put on a show for a few more days.

319
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:54,510
The thing is, I don't want to give Lord Sinderby any ammunition.

320
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:57,587
So, Lady Rose MacClare is a mesalliance.

321
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,830
I'm not sure that's helpful, Granny.

322
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:04,836
Lord and Lady Sinderby and Mr Atticus Aldridge.

323
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,282
Do come in. How lovely to see you.

324
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:13,124
Daddy, Mummy. This is Atticus.

325
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,056
How do you do? What a peculiar name.

326
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:24,804
How's it going?

327
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:28,923
Lady Flintshire is not a push-over. I told you that.

328
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:33,168
I must ask, because I can't get it out of my mind,

329
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,923
why has the Inspector summoned Mrs Bates?

330
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:41,812
Would it help if I swore neither of them has done anything wrong?

331
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:46,140
I never doubted it, but it's a relief to hear.

332
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:49,248
I'd better go up.

333
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,541
What made you choose Yorkshire? Was it a historic reason?

334
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,604
Not really. I used to go there as a
girl and of course it's beautiful.

335
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,852
Do you have any English blood?

336
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:00,875
We only date from the 1850s,

337
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:04,513
but Lady Sinderby's family arrived in the reign of King Richard Ill.

338
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:08,730
Really? I think of you as nomads, drifting around the world.

339
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:12,622
Talking of drifting round, is it true you're starting your honeymoon

340
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:14,758
at the Melfords' in Coningsby?

341
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,799
Oh yes. Lady Melford is Mother's cousin.

342
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,345
Is she? I never knew that.

343
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:23,405
You wanted a synagogue blessing? I'd like to respect both sides.

344
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,823
You don't understand our customs. Then again, why should you?

345
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:30,656
So it won't be possible? No. He should have told you.

346
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:34,778
I thought we could have a dinner on Wednesday night

347
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:37,720
so you could meet some of the relations.

348
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,368
And show them how lucky they are!

349
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,577
Have you got many staying? We're crammed to the gunwales.

350
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,801
Atticus has had to move into the Halnaby Hotel.

351
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:47,209
I love the Halnaby.

352
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,354
It makes sense and he can have his... What do they call it now?

353
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:54,884
His stag party there, without disturbing us.

354
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:57,678
- Will you be going, Lord Sinderby?
- Hardly.

355
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,411
Stag parties are high on Father's disapproval list.

356
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:05,187
Is it a long list, Lord Sinderby, the things you disapprove of?

357
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:09,910
No, as long as I can steer clear of
card sharps and undercooked fish,

358
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,603
and divorce, I think I'm fairly easy.

359
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:17,390
Is divorce so terrible? Is it worse
to stay together and be miserable?

360
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:21,354
I am clearly old-fashioned but to me divorce signifies weakness.

361
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:25,710
Degradation, scandal and failure.

362
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,804
Are you glad to be in London again?
I will be when I get the house back.

363
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:33,251
When do the tenants go? Next week in theory.

364
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,906
I need to pull the real pictures out of storage. What a palaver!

365
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:39,173
I know, but think of the relief

366
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:43,188
when I can shut the door at last and be alone in my own home.

367
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:46,667
Won't Lord Flintshire be with you? Of course he will.

368
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:50,644
Of course I will. What a funny thing to say, Susan.

369
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,699
Funny is one word for it.

370
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,591
Well, I want you to know that you'll
always be welcome at Canningford.

371
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,038
How kind.

372
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,278
Tell me, do you find it difficult these days to get staff?

373
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:04,576
Not very.

374
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:07,141
But then we're Jewish, so we pay well.

375
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,814
If I don't get an early night, I'll never make it through the week.

376
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:21,953
Is Dicky Merton coming to the wedding?

377
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:23,900
I don't think so.

378
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,361
Oh, oh I'm sorry.

379
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:29,041
You've changed your tune.

380
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:33,599
I've been reminded recently that one
is not given many chances in life

381
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,706
and if you miss them,

382
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,970
they may not necessarily be repeated.

383
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:47,218
Sinderby's as stiff as a board. What more can I do?

384
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:52,349
May I ask, do you two worry about
Sybbie and George when you're away?

385
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,049
Why should we?

386
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,575
No reason, but I think about Marigold all the time.

387
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:00,246
What are you going to be like when you have your own?

388
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:02,577
I intend to leave it all to Nanny. You say that.

389
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:05,683
I'm used to the way the children live at Downton, but it seems odd.

390
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:09,272
Will it be different in America? He isn't going and that's flat.

391
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,682
Mary... Stop!

392
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,392
This is my wedding and I'm not having it spoiled.

393
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:15,439
Quite right. I tell you what.

394
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,704
Why don't the four of us go for lunch on Wednesday? Even you, Edith.

395
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:22,124
To mark Rose's last days of freedom and the end of an era.

396
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,631
Let's go to Rules. My treat.

397
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:26,397
Yes. Why not?

398
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,263
Sinderby's going to be quite a challenge for Rose.

399
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:30,538
No doubt about that.

400
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,703
And what possessed Susan? "Do you have any English blood?"

401
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:36,356
Really! She speaks without thinking.

402
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:40,455
Did you know Bates and Anna are going
to Scotland Yard tomorrow morning?

403
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:44,292
Certainly not! Why? Bates didn't really give a reason.

404
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:48,969
Do they want character testimonials? I offered,
but he said no. Not yet.

405
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,416
The stone mason has sent his bill. Is Mrs Patmore downstairs?

406
00:24:58,434 --> 00:25:00,894
I believe so, m'lord.

407
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:04,107
And is Bates back? Not yet, m'lord.

408
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,125
A strange business, Carson.

409
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,697
Can I help? I'm trying to find the letter box.

410
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,047
It's through there, but the post may have gone.

411
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:15,285
Is it crucial? A bit crucial.

412
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:18,495
I hate saying, "the cheque's in the post" when it isn't.

413
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:20,470
I'll walk up to Jermyn Street.

414
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:23,501
Here's Carson. Is Lady Flintshire too late to give you a letter?

415
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:25,772
No, m'lord. I'm collecting them now.

416
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:28,467
Thank you, Carson.

417
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:31,460
Miss Baxter and Mr Molesley have asked me

418
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,143
to see the Wallace Collection with them tomorrow.

419
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:37,456
Daisy, the wedding is on Friday! That's what I said.

420
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:40,450
But, it's only Tuesday now and we've done most of it

421
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,993
apart from the stuff we can't do before the day.

422
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:46,710
I don't know. Is this a kitchen or a holiday resort?

423
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,573
Oh, go but...

424
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:51,219
If you're not back by teatime, I'll call the police.

425
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,745
Oh, my God!

426
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:56,788
I do apologise for interrupting your work, Mrs Patmore.

427
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,841
That's quite all right, m'lord. I'm afraid I'm a bit of a mess.

428
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,890
Not at all, please.

429
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:05,977
I just wanted to ask you if you might reconsider

430
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:08,198
coming to the unveiling of the memorial.

431
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:12,234
I don't mean to be rude, m'lord... I know that.

432
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:15,611
But, it's important reconciliation is the spirit of the day.

433
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:19,543
I should feel I had failed if you
were to be absent from the ceremony.

434
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,684
Please. I ask it as a favour.

435
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:25,306
Very well. If it means that much to your lordship.

436
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:27,629
It does. Thank you.

437
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:45,477
If you'll come this way, Mrs Bates. I'm staying with her.

438
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,500
Suit yourself. Through here please.

439
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:55,439
Take your place in the line.

440
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,891
But why? What have I done? This is madness.

441
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:00,743
Come along.

442
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:11,312
Hold the cards in front of you.

443
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,095
Thank you very much. You may go.

444
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:55,268
What is this about?

445
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:57,978
She had nothing to do with it. You know that!

446
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:01,605
Calm yourself. You must be aware that
most of this stuff is just routine?

447
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:03,829
So we can cross people off our lists.

448
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,333
Let's go. We have some business to attend to, while we're here.

449
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:09,529
You'll want to get on with it, then.

450
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:17,239
Have you got the hang of it now?

451
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,210
I think so. Dinner's done and dusted without incident.

452
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:23,016
I'll take you for a walk later, show you the sights.

453
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:26,510
What about Lady Grantham? She'll be in bed before then.

454
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:29,354
Would you mind taking the coffee up while it's still hot?

455
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:31,033
Or is that too much to ask?

456
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:39,828
I hope you're not planning to lead him into bad ways, Miss Denker.

457
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:42,286
No. Andy isn't a country lad, is he?

458
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:46,356
I expect he knows his way around better than I do.

459
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,982
I doubt that.

460
00:28:47,983 --> 00:28:50,409
She's got a plan in mind, that one,

461
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,800
a plan to her own advantage and I'd like to know...

462
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:58,061
Daisy? Are you listening? London's full of possibilities.

463
00:28:58,062 --> 00:29:00,882
Life's full of possibilities.

464
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:05,640
Really? Sometimes I think my life has no possibilities at all.

465
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,631
Where's Aunt Violet?

466
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:14,387
MY Aunt Violet has gone up. So has Mrs Crawley.

467
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:18,850
And Atticus? Where is the lovelorn swain tonight?

468
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:22,672
Don't you remember? He's got his bachelor party.

469
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:28,411
Do you like him, Daddy? Please say you do.

470
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:31,113
Certainly I do. Very much.

471
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:32,947
Did you get to Bond Street?

472
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:36,087
The chap I need to see was busy. I'm going tomorrow afternoon.

473
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,926
Please don't make us late for Lady Sinderby's dinner.

474
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:42,762
What are you doing in Bond Street?
It's an idea I've had, that's all.

475
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:44,912
An idea he is clearly not going to share with us.

476
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,905
That's it. I'm going to bed.

477
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:53,194
You said we'd have one more drink and I've had one more.

478
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:55,127
So now I'm off to bed.

479
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:00,452
You can stay as long as you want. Put it on my bill.

480
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:07,418
Champagne!

481
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:18,833
No, not tonight.

482
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:22,074
I'm sorry if I misled you, but it's not going to happen.

483
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:32,676
- Who is it?
- Your tea, sir.

484
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,458
But I didn't order any tea.

485
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,581
What on earth?

486
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:44,332
Is this a joke? Did Mr Ryecart pay you to come up?

487
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:48,127
Just wait, one moment...

488
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:49,729
Bye.

489
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,090
Andy? How was last night?

490
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:04,333
Did you go for your walk with Miss Denker?

491
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:07,907
Yes, I bloody well did, the more fool me.

492
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:14,472
Is everything all right, Mr Barrow? Just fine,
Mrs Hughes, thank you.

493
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,956
Michael and I had luncheon here on our very first date.

494
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:26,147
One day you'll be glad to think of the times you spent together.

495
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:30,720
You're the only member of the family that seems to understand.

496
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,791
Sorry we're late.

497
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,525
How did you get on? So well!

498
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:37,942
If I show you, the women here will be too jealous to eat.

499
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:41,259
Oh. Er, this came for you by messenger.

500
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,978
Carson asked me give it to you. Thank you.

501
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:48,048
Who's it from?

502
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:51,656
It's not signed. There's just a note that says "Last night".

503
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:00,541
What is it? Atticus.

504
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:04,304
Picking up a tart of some kind and letting her into his room.

505
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,318
What?!

506
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,655
Oh, God. Have some water.

507
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:13,690
Are you ready to order? May we have a few more moments?

508
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:22,263
What are you going to do? I'm not sure.

509
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:26,206
Maybe I'll chuck tonight, but what should I do about the wedding?

510
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:27,874
I'll tell you what you'll do.

511
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:31,211
Go and telephone Atticus now. Arrange to see him this afternoon.

512
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:32,841
Mary, go with her.

513
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:40,659
This is classic stag party stuff.

514
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,965
You mean they got him drunk, set him up,

515
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:45,887
and booked a photographer to maximise his embarrassment?

516
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:48,983
I'm sure he's regretting it bitterly this morning.

517
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:52,274
But is "regretting it" enough? It wouldn't be for me.

518
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,981
There is a man who'd rather this marriage didn't take place

519
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:57,500
and his name's Lord Sinderby.

520
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:00,233
Would he do something so grubby?

521
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:04,470
You'd be surprised what people can sink to, to get their own way.

522
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:11,551
They're talking now. He'll meet her in St James's Park at three.

523
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:18,763
This is to confirm there'll be no upstairs dinner tonight.

524
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,938
The family is dining with Lady Sinderby.

525
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:26,762
I can't see why we bothered to get an extra footman.

526
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:30,684
We should've just hired some help
for the wedding and left it at that.

527
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:33,095
It's unusual for a bridegroom's parents

528
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,599
to entertain just before a marriage.

529
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,798
It feels quite foreign. Maybe that sort do it differently.

530
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,834
Oh, don't you start! I am not prejudiced, Mrs Hughes.

531
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,813
There are many things you could accuse me of, but not that.

532
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:49,395
How about lack of self knowledge?

533
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:56,681
Mr Carson, could Andy have some time off tonight?

534
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,421
If the family don't need him?

535
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:02,937
He's only been here a couple of days
and he's asking for extra time off?

536
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:05,100
He wants me to show him a bit of the town.

537
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:06,453
And the Dowager?

538
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:09,152
I'll be back in time to put her to bed.

539
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:12,123
I want everyone here until the family leaves,

540
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:15,440
and make sure you're back by ten o'clock.

541
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:18,953
What were you going to show him that you didn't show him last night?

542
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:21,801
Why? What did he tell you?

543
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:26,244
Only that he didn't enjoy himself. Oh poor Diddums.

544
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:29,876
I hope he's made of sterner stuff than that.

545
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:38,268
I never even knew it existed. Oh, I like these smaller museums.

546
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:42,355
The Wallace Collection or the Mauritshuis near the Hague.

547
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:45,751
Have you been to Holland? No, I've just read about it.

548
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:49,958
It's as if the intimacy, being near the paintings,

549
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:52,732
makes them more powerful.

550
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:55,777
I feel the same. Do you, Daisy?

551
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:58,582
I feel as if I've been down a coal hole

552
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:02,015
and someone's opened the lid and brought me into the sunlight.

553
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,685
Well, that's very gratifying. Is it, though?

554
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,926
I feel so resentful, so discontented.

555
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:11,729
It's as if my old life were a prison I have to go back to.

556
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,164
Don't say that! I don't want to think I've made things worse.

557
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:17,196
Isn't that Lady Rose?

558
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:22,369
This doesn't even make any sense! Stop!

559
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,736
Let's leave them to it.

560
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:28,345
I don't know. You're never safe 'til the ring's on your finger.

561
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:34,330
Do you want to be safe, Miss Baxter?

562
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:36,396
I might.

563
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:44,895
You really believe I would stoop so low?

564
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:47,477
You think that of me? I am satisfied it was not a prank.

565
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,079
Rather a plan to induce Lady Rose to withdraw from the marriage?

566
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,322
Call her Rose, for heaven's sake.
And you think I am the perpetrator?

567
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,346
You are opposed to my marrying her,

568
00:35:57,347 --> 00:36:00,030
much more so than I have confessed to Rose or her family.

569
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:03,123
Very well. Let us be honest.

570
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:04,854
I am against it.

571
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:08,558
Our family has achieved a great deal since we came to this country

572
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,430
and not just for ourselves, for our people.

573
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:13,541
We have a proud history

574
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:16,607
and we've taken our place among the leaders in this land.

575
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,742
And now, you want to throw all that away for this little shiksa.

576
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:22,415
Don't call her that! I'm sorry.

577
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,858
I don't mean to insult the girl. She seems decent enough.

578
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,685
But she is English and Anglican and so will her children be...

579
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:33,449
She's Scottish. British, then.

580
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,869
The second Lord Sinderby may be Jewish, but the third will not.

581
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,041
Soon our family will be one more British dynasty

582
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:43,428
with all the same prejudices as everyone else who shops at Harrods!

583
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:46,589
Any children will be brought up to
know both sides of their heritage.

584
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,083
Your children will not be Jewish! Don't you understand that?

585
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:53,965
Their mother will not be Jewish and neither will they!

586
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:56,036
They may choose to convert.

587
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:59,561
Or are you implacably opposed to giving anyone a free choice?

588
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:02,179
How easy you make it sound,

589
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,391
and how little you've had to fight.

590
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,278
You must come.

591
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:08,680
They're here.

592
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,108
I need your word it wasn't you.

593
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,287
Of course it wasn't me!

594
00:37:15,288 --> 00:37:17,341
Don't you know me at all?

595
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:26,147
Atticus says it must have been a practical joke.

596
00:37:26,148 --> 00:37:28,618
Do you believe him? I don't think it was a joke.

597
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,773
It was either true and he's lying,

598
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:33,536
or someone is trying to stop the wedding.

599
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:36,353
I'd like to know which. Preferably before Friday.

600
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:40,411
Rose, may I introduce you to my cousin, Sir John?

601
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:42,175
Come.

602
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,263
Edith, darling! Excuse me.

603
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:48,817
We'd better act fast before it all hits the rocks.

604
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:51,999
Everything seems to be hitting the rocks at the moment.

605
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,510
That's a bit sad. I mean it.

606
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:57,515
Sybil was my ally and she's gone. Now Rose.

607
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,904
You're about to leave and take Sybbie with you.

608
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:03,373
It's too much to bear. Mary, I must live my life.

609
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:05,874
What? And leave me alone with Edith?

610
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:09,380
When you read I'm on trial for murder, it'll be your fault.

611
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,959
Maybe you're right and it wasn't a joke,

612
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,254
but all I care about is you should believe me.

613
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:20,091
Of course I do, but it's almost worse
to know there's someone out there

614
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,542
who hates us enough to concoct such a lie.

615
00:38:22,543 --> 00:38:26,649
Tell us more about British India. It's a wonderful country.

616
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,684
Bombay is a marvellous city.

617
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,727
I'm not sure how long British India has to go.

618
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:34,440
We heard about that terrible Amritsar business.

619
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:36,936
Amritsar was a very unfortunate incident,

620
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:39,008
ordered by a foolish man.

621
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:42,378
I can't agree. General Dyer was just doing his duty.

622
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:47,278
You haven't got that quite right. We're entitled to our own opinion.

623
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:52,309
Are we? I hesitate to remind you that
Shrimpie knows India and you don't.

624
00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:59,020
You look very serious.

625
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:00,803
Granny, do you think Lord Sinderby

626
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:03,309
would try anything horrible to prevent the wedding?

627
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,634
He'd certainly like it stopped.

628
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,438
But he does love Atticus.

629
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:13,853
My dear, love is a far more dangerous motive than dislike.

630
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,606
Go on. It's no fun on my own.

631
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,059
You never talked to me from the time
we got there. Go and get changed.

632
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:30,795
Why are you bullying him, Miss Denker?

633
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:32,879
Can't you pick on someone your own age?

634
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,582
He'll have fun when he gets there.

635
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:38,124
Maybe, but I suspect you're a bad influence all the same.

636
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,415
Then I suspect we have something in common, Mr Barrow.

637
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:45,833
Cheeky.

638
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:49,432
If it was so lovely, why have you
been in a gloom since you got back?

639
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:51,392
It showed me what I've been missing.

640
00:39:51,393 --> 00:39:55,051
Before I started studying I thought history, art or 'owt like that

641
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:57,313
were only for the family, not for us.

642
00:39:57,314 --> 00:40:00,170
Surely it's a good thing, if your horizons have expanded?

643
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:03,926
In a way, but it's shown me how empty my life's been until now.

644
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:06,599
You've learned a trade. You're skilled.

645
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,590
You're an artist yourself. Look at this wedding cake.

646
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:12,771
What for? So I can skivvy in a kitchen that isn't even mine?

647
00:40:12,772 --> 00:40:16,418
Wasn't it your plan to study so you could help run Mr Mason's farm?

648
00:40:16,419 --> 00:40:20,130
But even if I do that in the end,
wouldn't I be better studying here,

649
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:24,091
with galleries and libraries and theatres all around me?

650
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:26,600
I could get a job in London, I know I could.

651
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:29,215
I'm sure you could. Then that's it.

652
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:33,084
I've made my mind up. I'm handing in my notice.

653
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:37,391
Oh... Oh, Daisy.

654
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:40,311
You've been very good to me, Mrs Patmore,

655
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:44,181
and I'll be sad to say goodbye, but I think it's right.

656
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,469
Hasn't she brushed it off as a malicious trap?

657
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,839
Yes, she has, but who would do it?

658
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,135
Granny thinks it might be Lord Sinderby.

659
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,643
Ought we to challenge him?

660
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:04,129
Can I give you a nightcap? Yes, please.

661
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,424
Not for me. I'm tired.

662
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:09,374
Ah, and you?

663
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,736
No, but I'll look in to say good night.

664
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:17,323
Where are Miss Denker and Andrew? Not back yet, Mr Carson.

665
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:19,875
I said I wanted everyone in by ten o'clock.

666
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:22,681
I'm sure they won't be long. Hmm!

667
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:26,385
Where have they got to? God knows. It's hard for Mr Carson.

668
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:28,467
Miss Denker's not under his jurisdiction.

669
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:31,025
Andy won't be round long enough to mind a black mark.

670
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:34,455
She's using him in some way, that lad, to her own benefit.

671
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:36,853
Which I do not like to see.

672
00:41:36,854 --> 00:41:38,970
Cocoa if anyone wants it?

673
00:41:38,971 --> 00:41:40,732
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

674
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:42,671
You should have let me do that.

675
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:45,511
I shall have to manage without you. I may as well get used to it.

676
00:41:45,512 --> 00:41:46,906
Don't be like that.

677
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:49,885
I'm not 'like' anything. I'm just facing facts.

678
00:41:57,367 --> 00:41:59,670
What are you doing in here?

679
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:02,685
Waiting for you. I can't think why.

680
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,126
Did you enjoy this evening?

681
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:10,359
Not really, no. In fact, I hated it.

682
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,288
Having to play act in front of those people is so degrading.

683
00:42:14,289 --> 00:42:17,315
It's not for much longer.

684
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:22,989
Did you know that Anne Melford was Jewish?
I neither knew nor didn't know. What difference does it make?

685
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,710
No need to parade your pseudo-tolerance here.

686
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:28,726
We are quite alone. I don't feel as you do about it.

687
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:31,175
Or about anything else.

688
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:33,347
I want no more of your tricks. Is that clear?

689
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,261
I don't know what you mean.

690
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:38,101
Yes, you do, and if you don't promise to behave,

691
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:41,186
I will tell Rose and we'll see what she makes of it.

692
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:44,596
You're talking in riddles. You set up Atticus.

693
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:48,735
The whole cheap, dirty episode began and ended with you.

694
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,979
Just because Rose was too clever to be taken in,

695
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,701
doesn't mean she'd forgive you.

696
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:55,140
Are you ill?

697
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:57,715
I was curious to know about the payment you spoke of.

698
00:42:57,716 --> 00:43:02,282
I read the chequebook stub and telephoned the firm.

699
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:05,012
Get down, you cat!

700
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:10,134
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

701
00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:12,734
That we have lost our money...

702
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:16,715
...that we have lost our position

703
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:20,347
that we have lost everything the children have grown up

704
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,898
expecting as their right.

705
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:28,102
And now you want Rose to be an outcast?

706
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:31,069
I'm not saying everything will be easy for them,

707
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,778
but who has a life where everything is easy?

708
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:39,250
Not us. And God knows not her.

709
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:42,327
Don't mention the divorce until after she's tied the knot.

710
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,049
Do you think he'd put his foot down at the eleventh hour?

711
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,126
I'm warning you, if this marriage does not go ahead,

712
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:50,203
Rose will know the part you played.

713
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:06,865
Since we're all here, I've decided what to do about the cottages.

714
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:09,065
I'm going to sell the Della Francesca.

715
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:12,337
I've been to Sotheby's and we'll get a good price.

716
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:14,752
Are you sure? You've always been so proud of it.

717
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:17,074
I don't enjoy it as I did.

718
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:22,288
My Papa always said one should only sell for a purpose and I agree.

719
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,271
The good of the village can be that purpose.

720
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:29,237
I'm pleased. Now we can get on with the work as soon as we're home.

721
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:30,363
Shall we?

722
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:37,283
I've spoiled the painting for you, haven't I, with Mr Bricker?

723
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:40,235
That's why you're selling.

724
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:41,862
Yes.

725
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:44,118
But not in the way you think.

726
00:44:45,743 --> 00:44:49,173
Every time I look at it, I am reminded that I didn't trust you

727
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:53,090
and I feel so angry with myself, I want to be rid of it.

728
00:44:56,786 --> 00:44:58,684
Oh, that is a horrid trick!

729
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:01,551
Whoever thought it up has a nasty mind.

730
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:05,930
What shocks me most is that anyone could want me to be so unhappy.

731
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:07,299
Excuse me.

732
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:12,280
This is what troubles me, would I be right to marry Dickie

733
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:14,504
when I know his sons would hate us to be happy?

734
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:17,936
That's all very well, but let them cheat you of your future?

735
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:22,388
I am sorry to disturb you, m'lady, but Miss Denker is not well,

736
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:25,181
so Miss Baxter will look after you tonight.

737
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:27,914
Will she be all right? It's nothing serious, m'lady.

738
00:45:27,915 --> 00:45:29,843
Thank you.

739
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:33,795
At last I have a plan, start the work in the village,

740
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:37,664
find the new agent and set off for America.

741
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:40,334
But won't all that take months?

742
00:45:40,335 --> 00:45:42,696
Why don't we say I'll stay for Christmas then go?

743
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:46,050
It's a dagger in my heart.

744
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:47,977
I don't know what I'll do without you.

745
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:52,360
Did you ever think you'd say that when I drove you to your fittings?

746
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:56,205
And Sybil got her to make evening pyjamas and Granny almost fainted.

747
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:03,245
We have our memories, you and I.

748
00:46:03,246 --> 00:46:06,749
But now you'll take them away with you to Boston.

749
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,219
And I'll cherish them when I get there.

750
00:46:11,443 --> 00:46:14,860
It's a long way to Tipperary. I think you need to calm down.

751
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:18,460
You need to calm down, Miss Denker. To go...

752
00:46:18,461 --> 00:46:21,547
Go and get Mrs Hughes.

753
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:23,549
To Tipperary...

754
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:27,522
Oh, I must get up to my lady. No, I'm doing it.

755
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:30,122
Mr Carson's told her you're ill. Ill?

756
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:33,247
Really, Miss Denker. And in front of the maids, too!

757
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,372
Well, who gives a tinker's curse about the maids?

758
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:38,931
Right. That's quite enough of that.

759
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:41,796
And as for you, where have you been? You don't want to know.

760
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:44,071
Put on your livery and get to the drawing room.

761
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:46,436
Maybe if I made her coffee, it might sober her up.

762
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,851
Anything's worth a try.

763
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,893
Mrs Patmore? Whatever's the matter? Don't mind me.

764
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:03,771
Tell me! No. It wouldn't be fair.

765
00:47:03,772 --> 00:47:05,502
Fair to who?

766
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:08,617
To you, you daft ha'porth. I don't understand.

767
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:11,874
I'm crying because I don't want you to leave.

768
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,788
I'll miss you.

769
00:47:15,274 --> 00:47:18,716
Don't... don't concern yourself. I'll get over it.

770
00:47:18,717 --> 00:47:20,988
I'll work out a month's notice.

771
00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:23,261
I have to come back for the memorial ceremony,

772
00:47:23,262 --> 00:47:25,554
and I haven't got another job yet.

773
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:29,581
Forget the coffee. She's gone up, thank the Lord.

774
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:32,548
We should go, too. You're right.

775
00:47:37,634 --> 00:47:41,146
Has something happened? No. Not yet.

776
00:47:45,569 --> 00:47:49,738
Ah, you've come back, then? We thought you'd run away to sea.

777
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:52,711
I'm very sorry, Mr Carson, but Miss Denker was taken ill.

778
00:47:52,712 --> 00:47:56,048
Never mind "taken ill," I wish she'd been taken away.

779
00:47:56,049 --> 00:47:58,615
By the men in white coats.

780
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:00,265
Go down, Mr Carson. We'll manage.

781
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,674
What happened?

782
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:09,344
She took me to this horrible club somewhere off Shaftesbury Avenue.

783
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:12,222
And I suppose you gambled. I lost the lot.

784
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,729
I paid for it on the note but it'll take all my savings.

785
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,468
I bet she didn't lose a thing? Hmm.

786
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:21,024
One question, she's not made a play for you?

787
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:22,663
Done anything improper?

788
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:25,872
No! God no. No, nothing like that. She just sat and drank.

789
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:28,407
They gave her whatever she wanted. I see.

790
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:32,379
At least, I think I see. Next time I'm coming with you.

791
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,841
Does there have to be a next time? Yes. just one more.

792
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:38,313
I'm fairly sure you're gonna enjoy it.

793
00:48:46,648 --> 00:48:49,952
I dare say this is a first for you, Granny,

794
00:48:49,953 --> 00:48:52,777
to sample the joys of a registry office.

795
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:56,647
You'd be quite wrong, no, in 1878

796
00:48:56,648 --> 00:49:00,973
I attended the wedding of Lord Rosebery and Hannah Rothschild

797
00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:03,920
held in the Board of Guardians, very much the same.

798
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:06,367
It seems almost sad in a way.

799
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:10,438
But in marrying a Rothschild, there are certain compensations.

800
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:12,905
Is Lady Flintshire all right?

801
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:17,059
Cora, would you go and help Susan? She seems in rather a queer way.

802
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,923
There is something that you must know

803
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:23,594
and I feel most uncomfortable not having told you before now.

804
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:26,521
We don't want any deathbed confessions, Susan.

805
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:28,275
Remember, this is not your day!

806
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,938
I'm sorry, Aunt Violet. I think it's time.

807
00:49:30,939 --> 00:49:32,698
In fact, it's long overdue.

808
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:34,105
What is? No, please.

809
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:37,478
Shrimpie and I are in the process of getting a divorce.

810
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,727
What?!

811
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:42,335
I'm afraid it is going to be all
over the papers and as things stand,

812
00:49:42,336 --> 00:49:45,109
it must involve you and your family.

813
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,720
God if I... Thank you, Lady Flintshire.

814
00:49:47,721 --> 00:49:49,748
Or may I call you Susan?

815
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:54,212
We are forewarned and so now we will be forearmed.

816
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:56,306
You can't mean... Father, I beg you...

817
00:49:56,307 --> 00:50:00,134
Do anything to stop this marriage,
anything at all, I will leave you,

818
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:03,852
and then you will have a scandal worthy of the name!

819
00:50:15,488 --> 00:50:19,397
Oh, I doubt you expected to take your beloved child

820
00:50:19,398 --> 00:50:22,674
through the portals of Caxton Hall Registry Office.

821
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:25,546
There are lots of things in my life I never anticipated,

822
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:28,116
but if you're sure, I'm sure.

823
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:32,922
By the way, Atticus was blameless.

824
00:50:32,923 --> 00:50:35,790
I'm ashamed now that I wobbled.

825
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:39,002
I know he was blameless. How can you know?

826
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:42,340
Well I do, beyond a trace of doubt.

827
00:50:42,341 --> 00:50:45,468
Who did my enemy turn out to be?

828
00:50:45,469 --> 00:50:49,732
Never mind about that. You don't know him. Not properly.

829
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:52,830
Then I don't want to know.

830
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:56,062
I don't want to hate anyone today.

831
00:50:56,063 --> 00:50:58,667
You do realise this is my real wedding?

832
00:50:58,668 --> 00:51:02,172
Not the blessing this afternoon? This is where I become his wife.

833
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:08,235
And I hope you will be very, very happy, my dearest darling.

834
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,557
I don't believe it. Is that it?

835
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:22,276
Am I just expected to be a good loser?

836
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:25,831
It's too late for that, my dear, far too late.

837
00:51:28,747 --> 00:51:29,963
Please stand.

838
00:52:00,308 --> 00:52:03,915
Er, listen everyone, as soon as they've finished lunch,

839
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,430
they'll get ready for the blessing at half past two.

840
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:08,132
Those going to the Savoy Chapel,

841
00:52:08,193 --> 00:52:10,779
there'll be a coach to bring you for the reception.

842
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:13,013
What about dinner, Mr Carson? Just family.

843
00:52:13,014 --> 00:52:15,698
Her ladyship wants a buffet of what's left over.

844
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,551
I might add some hot soup.

845
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,801
I should go. I'm helping Lady Rose to change.

846
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:22,043
I don't think it's right to put on a wedding dress

847
00:52:22,044 --> 00:52:23,691
when it's only a blessing.

848
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:27,519
She won't wear a veil. You're right. We should get on.

849
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,818
So, we should be able to get away later on if you're up for it.

850
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:35,238
After her ladyship's gone to bed. You mean you want to come?

851
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,698
You've been having lots of fun, Miss Denker.

852
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:41,248
Unless you feel the worse for wear? I don't know what you mean.

853
00:52:41,249 --> 00:52:43,569
I had a headache, that's all.

854
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:48,116
If he's coming, you needn't bother. No! We want Andy with us.

855
00:52:48,117 --> 00:52:51,130
With you for what? Nothing, Mrs Hughes.

856
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:53,907
Andy, you take your life in your hands

857
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:57,230
if you throw in your lot with these two.

858
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:22,831
Lord Sinderby, please believe that I love your son very much

859
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:26,492
and whatever I can do to make him happy, I will do.

860
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:30,137
We know that, my dear, and we wish every blessing on your head.

861
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:36,317
Well, well, the thing is done. Let us go forward in hope.

862
00:53:40,832 --> 00:53:43,939
Ah, look who's coming your way.

863
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,903
Hello, Tony. How lovely to see you. And you of course, Mabel.

864
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:51,709
Welcome. Are we welcome? I hope so.

865
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,569
You're as welcome here as I trust I will be at your wedding.

866
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,059
Is it just me who's embarrassed? I'm not embarrassed.

867
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,448
We're getting married in December.
We'd be delighted to see you there.

868
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:05,765
Oh, I am so pleased. Truly. It'll be in London.

869
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:08,426
Country weddings in the winter can be such muddy affairs.

870
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:14,297
I don't suppose we'll ever know who did it now but who cares?

871
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:17,015
It wasn't my father. Oh, I never thought it was.

872
00:54:17,016 --> 00:54:19,583
I mean, I know he's against me,

873
00:54:19,584 --> 00:54:22,147
but that sort of thing's not his style.

874
00:54:22,148 --> 00:54:26,215
You see? She already knows you better than he does.

875
00:54:26,216 --> 00:54:29,103
I'm not sure it's what she really wanted,

876
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:31,304
a registry office and the Savoy chapel.

877
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:35,165
But, I think she'll be very happy. I agree. They're well matched.

878
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:38,642
When are you going home? First thing. I can't wait.

879
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:43,631
The call of young Marigold. You sound as if you don't approve.

880
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:45,801
Oh, it's not that...

881
00:54:45,802 --> 00:54:50,503
Oh, look. It's Tony and Mary. They make a handsome couple.

882
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:53,316
Give it up, Papa. It's a pipe dream.

883
00:54:56,677 --> 00:54:59,913
So, it turned out as you planned.

884
00:54:59,914 --> 00:55:03,147
You were just what I needed when I needed it.

885
00:55:03,148 --> 00:55:06,133
I hope you know that. Well, I know a lot of things.

886
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:08,982
One of them is not to mess with Lady Mary Crawley.

887
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:11,231
But everything's come right?

888
00:55:11,232 --> 00:55:15,433
Hmm, it has for me. I hope it does for you, too.

889
00:55:16,978 --> 00:55:18,106
Good luck, Mary.

890
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:28,891
Lord Sinderby has taken Brancaster Castle for the grouse this year.

891
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,169
In Northumberland?

892
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,224
Yes, and we wondered if you might like to join us there?

893
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:36,862
That's very kind. All of you. It would give us great pleasure.

894
00:55:36,863 --> 00:55:39,431
All of us? I wonder if you know what you're taking on!

895
00:55:39,432 --> 00:55:42,624
I'll telephone Lady Grantham and we'll talk dates.

896
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,203
I look forward to it.

897
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:48,273
That wasn't too hard, was it?

898
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:52,238
Not hard for me, since I was allowed
no say in the matter. None at all.

899
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:55,584
He seems like a wonderful boy. Thank you, that's very kind.

900
00:55:57,492 --> 00:56:00,507
I heard about your declaration at the registry office.

901
00:56:00,508 --> 00:56:03,308
All I want is your happiness, my darling.

902
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:08,286
Whatever I said or did was done from love.

903
00:56:08,287 --> 00:56:12,274
I'm afraid we must have different definitions of the word.

904
00:56:16,128 --> 00:56:17,472
Hmm.

905
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:19,808
How are you two bearing up?

906
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,814
Well, thank you, Lady Manville.

907
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:23,187
I do feel for you.

908
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:25,429
It must be very trying,

909
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,762
but I so admire you for putting on a good face.

910
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:30,591
I wonder if you remember that my father was Jewish?

911
00:56:30,592 --> 00:56:32,114
Oh.

912
00:56:32,115 --> 00:56:34,500
I'm afraid I...

913
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:37,677
That is... How interesting...

914
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:42,938
Ah, Louise, I wasn't expecting to find you here.

915
00:56:54,754 --> 00:56:59,124
Is everything all right, m'lady? I thought I'd sneak away.

916
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:03,638
I don't think I'll be missed. Oh, I wouldn't say that.

917
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:07,278
I feel as if our household is breaking up, Carson,

918
00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:10,365
but I suppose that's what happens.

919
00:57:10,366 --> 00:57:14,453
People grow up and move away and things change.

920
00:57:14,454 --> 00:57:17,790
I hope Lord Gillingham hasn't upset you?

921
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,615
Oh, no.

922
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:23,247
He's happy with Miss Lane Fox and I'm happy for them.

923
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:26,341
Because if I might be permitted to say so?

924
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:30,471
He wasn't good enough for you, m'lady, not by half.

925
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:33,391
I don't think anyone else would agree with you.

926
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:35,707
But the difference is that you agree with me.

927
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:39,272
I watched you realise it as time went on.

928
00:57:39,273 --> 00:57:41,514
Reluctantly perhaps,

929
00:57:41,515 --> 00:57:45,404
but you came to see that he wasn't up to the mark.

930
00:57:45,405 --> 00:57:48,553
I'm not sure if that's alarming or reassuring

931
00:57:48,554 --> 00:57:50,954
coming from someone who knows me so well.

932
00:57:50,955 --> 00:57:55,700
Reassuring I hope, for I'm confident
that you will triumph in the end.

933
00:57:55,701 --> 00:58:00,873
Thank you, Carson. That means more to me than you know.

934
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:06,824
Oh no, it was a funny marriage.

935
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:09,316
No proper service, no veil!

936
00:58:09,317 --> 00:58:11,838
You'd have thought one of them was divorced.

937
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,761
I wish them well. I don't mind Lady Rose, me.

938
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:18,477
Is this it? Welcome to the Velvet Violin.

939
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,007
Thank you.

940
00:58:22,008 --> 00:58:23,832
We'll go in separately.

941
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,910
Don't talk to me 'til we're at the tables.

942
00:58:30,372 --> 00:58:32,957
Back again, Miss Denker?

943
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:35,806
I've brought two with me. The new boy and another one.

944
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:39,983
So I see. Give yourself a drink and help 'em find the tables.

945
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:41,354
Thank you.

946
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,949
What's his name? The one she was talking to.

947
00:58:45,795 --> 00:58:47,932
Erm, Basil Shute. Why?

948
00:58:47,933 --> 00:58:49,851
You'll see.

949
00:58:49,852 --> 00:58:52,312
Are you going 1:0 play?

950
00:58:52,313 --> 00:58:55,305
I might have a go. Pontoon's my game.

951
00:58:55,306 --> 00:58:58,699
But don't you. Right?

952
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:04,126
That was quite a marathon, but I think a happy one.

953
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,756
Oh, yes. They're well suited.

954
00:59:06,757 --> 00:59:09,894
They were bound to find out in the end about Lady Rose's parents.

955
00:59:09,895 --> 00:59:12,722
At least it's out in the open. They'll have to lump it.

956
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:16,475
Now that Lord Sinderby and Lady Flintshire both have a reason

957
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:19,455
to look down on the other, that should keep them quiet.

958
00:59:21,012 --> 00:59:23,222
Yes?

959
00:59:23,223 --> 00:59:27,789
I beg your pardon, m'lady, but Anna's wanted downstairs.

960
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,394
What do you mean, Mrs Hughes? I haven't dismissed her.

961
00:59:30,395 --> 00:59:33,868
I know, m'lady and I feel most uncomfortable but...

962
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:38,065
What is it? What's happened? Mr Vyner's downstairs.

963
00:59:38,066 --> 00:59:39,705
What? But he hasn't...

964
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:41,212
He says he's come to arrest you.

965
00:59:54,646 --> 00:59:57,684
Does that always happen? Not always, no.

966
00:59:57,705 --> 01:00:00,667
Right. Cash them in and pay your bill.

967
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:03,524
I couldn't let you do that. Why not?

968
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:06,672
You want to get out of here alive? I'd have to pay you back.

969
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:09,358
We'll argue later. Off you go while I see to Mr Shute.

970
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,800
What do you mean? Go.

971
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,280
Excuse me,

972
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,520
can you tell me which of these knuckleheads is a Mr Basil Shute?

973
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:22,973
Why?

974
01:00:22,974 --> 01:00:26,308
There's a woman who's boasting of a
trick she's played on him all week.

975
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:28,417
Oh, yeah? What's that, then?

976
01:00:28,418 --> 01:00:32,072
Yeah, she erm, she waits outside until someone's coming in,

977
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:34,007
then she enters with them

978
01:00:34,008 --> 01:00:37,105
and claims free drinks all night for bringing in new punters.

979
01:00:37,107 --> 01:00:39,012
Oh, she does, does she?

980
01:00:39,013 --> 01:00:41,608
It's the woman I arrived with.

981
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:42,651
Bye!

982
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:44,455
No! Wait!

983
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,597
Bye.

984
01:00:49,598 --> 01:00:51,869
She chose me because she thought

985
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,260
I was too young and stupid to see what she was at.

986
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:58,924
And she was right, wasn't she? So, next time, ask your Uncle Thomas.

987
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:01,652
Right, let's go.

988
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,886
Oh, thank you.

989
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:08,879
Haven't you forgotten something?

990
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,642
What?

991
01:01:10,643 --> 01:01:14,701
Your bill for three nights' worth of drinking, Miss Denker.

992
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:17,899
That'll be four pounds and ten shillings.

993
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,320
I must wait for Mr Bates. I can't go without telling him!

994
01:01:21,321 --> 01:01:23,542
It might be kinder if you let him hear the news

995
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:25,696
when he can't say anything he'll regret.

996
01:01:25,697 --> 01:01:29,454
I forbid you to take her! Correct forms have been observed.

997
01:01:29,455 --> 01:01:32,675
What is this? What's happening? Don't make trouble, Mr Bates.

998
01:01:32,676 --> 01:01:34,649
You can't do this! Try to keep calm.

999
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,131
Can't I stand surety for her? I'm afraid not, sir.

1000
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:40,240
Mrs Hughes, will you fetch her coat? No! I can't let her go.

1001
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,845
A witness has identified Mrs Bates

1002
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:45,388
being on the pavement near Mr Green before he fell.

1003
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:49,099
I insist on telephoning our lawyer! Telephone all you like, Miss.

1004
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,612
He'll find Mrs Bates at Gerald Row Police Station.

1005
01:01:51,613 --> 01:01:53,853
I suggest you leave it 'til the morning.

1006
01:01:53,854 --> 01:01:57,536
I will ring him now because she is innocent and I am not "Miss"!

1007
01:01:57,537 --> 01:01:59,373
I am Lady Mary Crawley!

1008
01:01:59,374 --> 01:02:02,227
I don't care if you're the Queen of the Upper Nile.

1009
01:02:02,228 --> 01:02:04,676
I'm going and she's coming with me.

1010
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:06,084
NOW!

1011
01:02:08,363 --> 01:02:09,347
Bates!

1012
01:02:22,764 --> 01:02:25,881
"They fell with their faces to the fold.

1013
01:02:25,882 --> 01:02:30,220
"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.

1014
01:02:30,221 --> 01:02:33,744
"Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.

1015
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:37,645
"At the going down of the sun and in the morning.

1016
01:02:37,646 --> 01:02:40,627
"We will remember them. "

1017
01:02:40,628 --> 01:02:43,025
We will remember them.

1018
01:03:29,954 --> 01:03:32,258
Stand at ease.

1019
01:03:32,259 --> 01:03:33,695
Stand easy.

1020
01:03:35,262 --> 01:03:41,435
Before you disperse, I would beg your indulgence for a moment.

1021
01:03:41,436 --> 01:03:44,783
Can I draw your attention to one more gallant chap

1022
01:03:44,784 --> 01:03:46,411
who volunteered to fight?

1023
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:50,742
He wasn't local to Downton and so his
name does not appear on the memorial,

1024
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,990
but his memory is cherished by some here,

1025
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:58,267
and so it seems right to us to mark his passing.

1026
01:03:58,268 --> 01:03:59,692
Mrs Patmore?

1027
01:04:23,399 --> 01:04:24,633
Oh!

1028
01:04:27,821 --> 01:04:29,957
"Sacrifice" is right.

1029
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:36,830
I think that's lovely, Mrs Patmore. I'm so pleased for you.

1030
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,500
It's just as it should be.

1031
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,553
I believe so.

1032
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:47,887
I'd like to see William's name now. If you've a moment, Daisy?

1033
01:05:18,034 --> 01:05:22,079
My sister's going to find it a real comfort.

1034
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,996
It'll be nice for you too, Daisy, to have the memorial so near.

1035
01:05:25,997 --> 01:05:31,933
I thought I'd feel sad when I read William's name, and so I did.

1036
01:05:31,935 --> 01:05:34,979
But I felt proud, too.

1037
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,887
Very proud. Of course.

1038
01:05:36,888 --> 01:05:38,826
Daisy may not be here forever,

1039
01:05:38,827 --> 01:05:41,954
but that won't mean she's any the less proud of our William.

1040
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:45,415
What? Are you going away, Daisy? Well no, there's nothing wrong.

1041
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:46,974
She's got a taste for London,

1042
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:50,287
so we'll have to learn to manage without her.

1043
01:05:50,288 --> 01:05:54,821
At her age, it's right she should have a new adventure, isn't it?

1044
01:05:54,822 --> 01:05:58,129
Is this true, Daisy? No, she's just teasing!

1045
01:05:58,131 --> 01:06:00,768
At least, I did think about it,

1046
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:03,051
but I've decided I'm not going anywhere,

1047
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:05,700
or not until after I've passed my exams.

1048
01:06:05,701 --> 01:06:07,265
I'm glad.

1049
01:06:07,266 --> 01:06:11,217
I hate it when people who love each other must be far apart.

1050
01:06:23,732 --> 01:06:26,640
I know what you're thinking.

1051
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:31,041
It is not hard to guess, m'lady.

1052
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:35,746
She won't be convicted. I don't even think she'll be tried.

1053
01:06:35,747 --> 01:06:39,272
They have nothing to go on. Nothing they're sharing with us.

1054
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:42,276
But you're right, m'lady, she will not be convicted.

1055
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:47,118
Now we're back, do you really think
I should put up a fight for Dickie?

1056
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,449
You said you wouldn't do anything 'til after Rose's wedding.

1057
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:56,236
But, it's over, so it's time for action.

1058
01:06:56,237 --> 01:06:59,459
Fighting talk, indeed.

1059
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,639
And will you put up a fight for Prince Kuragin?

1060
01:07:04,164 --> 01:07:07,541
Well, you forget, you hold the winning card.

1061
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:10,127
Lord Merton's wife is dead.

1062
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:14,381
I always forget how much I enjoy London.

1063
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:18,146
You should go up more often, take an interest in your publishing.

1064
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:20,807
You should get involved in the running of the business.

1065
01:07:20,808 --> 01:07:23,786
You're clever and a good writer. They're lucky to have you.

1066
01:07:23,787 --> 01:07:27,021
Mary always talks like she's the only one

1067
01:07:27,022 --> 01:07:30,475
who'll miss you when you go, but you know I will, too.

1068
01:07:30,476 --> 01:07:32,162
And I'll miss you.

1069
01:07:32,163 --> 01:07:36,865
Poor Mr Bates. They locked him up when he was innocent.

1070
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:39,265
Why shouldn't they do the same with his wife?

1071
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:43,229
I have faith in British justice. Mr Bates was released in the end.

1072
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,708
After he'd served time.

1073
01:07:45,709 --> 01:07:51,016
Sorrow seems to shadow them both and in their wake, it shadows us.

1074
01:07:51,017 --> 01:07:54,354
Come, Mrs Hughes. This isn't like you.

1075
01:07:54,355 --> 01:07:59,101
Take courage for their sake. We must always travel in hope.

1076
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,514
I realised what it is about Marigold that keeps catching my eye.

1077
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,231
Oh, yes? What's that?

1078
01:08:06,232 --> 01:08:08,416
She reminds me of Michael Gregson.

1079
01:08:10,748 --> 01:08:12,854
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

1080
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,552
You're not wrong.

1081
01:08:16,661 --> 01:08:19,048
Don't tell Edith you've guessed. Why not?

1082
01:08:19,049 --> 01:08:21,592
It makes things a good deal clearer than they were.

1083
01:08:21,593 --> 01:08:24,470
Just don't. Not yet. Mary doesn't know either, nor Tom.

1084
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:26,704
Let it be Edith's secret a little while longer.

1085
01:08:28,591 --> 01:08:30,718
Very well.

1086
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,689
I must admit it's an unusual sensation

1087
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:36,918
to learn there's a secret in this house I'm actually privy to.

1088
01:08:36,919 --> 01:08:39,702
But, I'll be silent if you wish.

1089
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:45,029
And you'll love her? Your new granddaughter?

1090
01:08:46,517 --> 01:08:49,999
As a matter of fact, and perhaps to my surprise,

1091
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,670
I rather think I will.
