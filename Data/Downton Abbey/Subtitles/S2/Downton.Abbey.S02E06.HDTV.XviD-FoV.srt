1
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,369
I shall have arms like Jack Johnson
if I'm not careful.

2
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,163
I'm strong enough to wheel myself.

3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,123
I'll be the judge of that.

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,085
Morning.

5
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,087
I keep thinking about William.

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,381
How he should be here...

7
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,633
not exactly instead of me,

8
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:53,095
but sacrifice should be rewarded.

9
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,097
He was the brave one.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,099
You were both brave.

11
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,979
I don't think we can say 'should'
about things that happen in war.

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,273
It just happens
and we should live with it.

13
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,985
Ought I to be jealous?

14
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,198
I'm sorry,
what were we talking about?

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,994
I was asking about Haxby Park. I'm
taking Mary over there tomorrow.

16
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,247
Our Haxby Park?
Why? Are the Russells selling?

17
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,125
Not officially, but I am told
they're open to offers.

18
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,087
Sad. The Russells and the Crawleys
have been neighbours for centuries.

19
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,215
They're not living there any more.
It'll be strange for Mary.

20
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,385
She's been going to that house since
she was a girl in a party dress.

21
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,180
We all have. There's nowhere better
near Downton.

22
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,140
I'm not sure how comfortable it is.

23
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,642
It'll be comfortable
when I'm finished with it.

24
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,394
Central heating, modern kitchens,

25
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,897
bathrooms with every bedroom,
it's all possible.

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,982
Sounds more like an hotel.

27
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,775
Major Clarkson.

28
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,819
Good morning, Lord Grantham.

29
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,113
Lady Edith. Sir.

30
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,365
We've had a request.

31
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,826
A Canadian Major has asked
to come here

32
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,245
because of a family link
with the house.

33
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,497
We've taken officers
from his regiment before,

34
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,708
but I wanted to be sure
you'd no objection.

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,919
What's his name? Gordon.

36
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,546
Patrick Gordon.

37
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,217
He was with Princess Patricia's
Canadian Light Infantry at Passchendaele.

38
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,678
Caught in a blast and burned,
rather badly, I believe.

39
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,681
Poor fellow.
Well, he's perfectly welcome.

40
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,809
I'm not aware of how we are
connected, but you never know.

41
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,811
Sir.

42
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,359
I've never worked in a house where
a valet and a housemaid were wed.

43
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,152
It'll be unusual, I agree.

44
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,862
I hope it doesn't break us up.

45
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,823
Having you two set apart
in a home of your own, all special,

46
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,076
while the rest of us
muddle on for ourselves.

47
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,078
You sound as if you're jealous.

48
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,331
I'm not jealous. I just
don't want it to spoil things.

49
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,584
Why, because we've all been
such pals until now

50
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,637
Give her time.

51
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,890
Matthew's making such progress.

52
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,227
I think so,
but are we doing enough for him,

53
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,896
for all of them,
when it comes to rehabilitation?

54
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,316
They're going to have to face a
very different world after the war.

55
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,903
I agree, but they'll all
be leaving Downton soon.

56
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,031
Leaving?
Well, Turkey's about to capitulate

57
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,868
and Robert says
Vittorio Veneto will finish Austria,

58
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:25,122
so it's only a matter of weeks,
even days, before it's over.

59
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,041
We wouldn't send anyone home
too soon, of course,

60
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,003
but some time in the new year,
we will have our house back.

61
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,547
So you want it just to be
a private house again?

62
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,340
Shouldn't she?

63
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,385
Or would you like to abolish
private houses?

64
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,972
Well, that life of changing clothes
and killing things and eating them,

65
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,640
do you really want it again?

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,769
Wouldn't you rather Downton
was useful? The house is useful.

67
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,897
We provide employment. Oh, please...

68
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,066
Let me look into keeping it open
as a centre of recovery.

69
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,445
I could run it. The house could be
so much more than it was before.

70
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,155
What about you, Molesley?

71
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,740
Are you looking forward to

72
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,701
this brave new world of
Mrs Crawley's imaginings?

73
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,204
I'm glad of my job, m'lady,

74
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,456
and I should very much like
to hold onto it,

75
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,416
with Mrs Crawley's permission.

76
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,172
Servants are always far more
conservative than their employers.

77
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,216
Everyone knows that.

78
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,219
Then I must be
the exception that proves the rule.

79
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,525
Hello.

80
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,445
My name's Edith Craw-

81
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,656
Lady Edith Crawley, I know.

82
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,783
Second daughter of the house.

83
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,827
In charge of non-medical welfare.

84
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,122
So whatever you need, in the way
of errands run or books to read,

85
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,999
then I'm your man.

86
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,626
Thank you.

87
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,837
I hope this doesn't put you off.

88
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,257
I can assure you, at this stage,
there isn't much that puts me off.

89
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,426
Did they tell you we're related?

90
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:07,432
Er... Er yes, but I'm afraid
I'm not much good at family history.

91
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,854
Although Papa's found an aunt
in 1860 who married a Gordon.

92
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,941
Perhaps that's a clue.

93
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,943
No, that isn't it.

94
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,320
Well, as I say, I'm hopeless.

95
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,200
I- I thought
you'd recognise my voice

96
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,870
but, of course,
I sound Canadian now.

97
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,998
You mean we've met before?

98
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,000
It was a long time ago.

99
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,086
Edith, I need you.

100
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,804
It just explains
what you're entitled to.

101
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,057
That's kind but, let's face it,
I'm not a widow, am I? Not really.

102
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,935
Of course you are. No I'm not.

103
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,522
How long was I married?
Six hours? Seven?

104
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,901
I shouldn't have taken his name,
except it were what he wanted.

105
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,695
Well, I'll leave it wi' you.

106
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,530
Daisy?

107
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,909
It wouldn't please William
if you don't take what's owing.

108
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,785
He wanted you to be looked after.

109
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,496
No. You made me a liar
while he was alive.

110
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,791
You'll not make me be false to
his memory.

111
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,300
You can leave me, Brooks.
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,385
Mr Bates said you wanted to see me,
sir.

113
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,057
Ah, yes.

114
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,185
I asked you up here,
because I want to offer you a job.

115
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,229
I have a job, sir.

116
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,148
Yes, of course you do,
I'm sure you enjoy it.

117
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,901
I don't mean to suggest
I'm offering a better one.

118
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,154
Thank you.

119
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,407
Although it would mean
a considerable increase in salary.

120
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,162
Lady Mary and I intend
to buy a home near Downton.

121
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,915
It's a long way from London,

122
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,835
but I've made enough money
to please myself, these days.

123
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,088
I know she holds you in high regard.

124
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,175
I believe she would very much
appreciate your help

125
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,636
when she first sets up house
as a bride.

126
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,765
You mean you wish me to leave
Downton Abbey and transfer -

127
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,017
Tomorrow, we go to see Haxby Park.

128
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,312
If we buy it, we'll take on
the whole 12,000 acres.

129
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,732
No doubt you will discover
many interesting walks to enjoy.

130
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,442
Of course it's run down,

131
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,237
but there's nothing wrong with it
that money can't fix.

132
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,073
So... what do you think?

133
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,535
One thing I must ask.

134
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,621
Is Lady Mary aware
that you have approached me?

135
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,582
Not yet.

136
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,834
I wanted to surprise her.

137
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,796
She thinks highly of you, Carson.

138
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,175
I hope I won't be taking on a rival.

139
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,428
I await Lady Mary's instruction.

140
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,478
I don't dislike him, I just don't
like him, which is quite different.

141
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,564
Did he talk about Haxby?

142
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:04,109
He's got ghastly plans for the place.
Of course, Cora doesn't agree.

143
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,654
I'm an American. I don't share
your English hatred of comfort.

144
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,158
Downton's comfortable enough for me.
I can't wait to have it back.

145
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,619
That's if Cousin Isabelle allows it.

146
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,496
She turned up today with
a hideous list of projects

147
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,582
that stretched to 1920 and beyond.

148
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,834
Surely you can put her off.

149
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,462
I don't know how,
once the bit's between her teeth.

150
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,047
Well, change the bridle.

151
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,341
Find a cause that needs her
more than Downton.

152
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,967
She's such a martyr.

153
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,720
Then we must tempt her
with a more enticing scaffold.

154
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,684
We're safe.
We've got the Decree Nisi.

155
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,603
I'm sure it's all right.

156
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,522
Except you're not sure.

157
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,398
Not sure about what?

158
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,860
What about you, Sergeant? Have you
started planning for after the war?

159
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,820
Not really, not yet.

160
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,073
I know what you should be doing.

161
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,242
I know what we should all be doing.

162
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,619
Oh, yeah? What's that?

163
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,287
Hoarding.

164
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,417
It may be wrong, but
this rationing is starting to bite.

165
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,253
Even with everyone's books,

166
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,630
I had a battle to get enough sugar
for this week.

167
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,926
Are you suggesting the black market,
Mrs Patmore?

168
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,636
I'm shocked.

169
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,890
Oh, I doubt that very much.

170
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,981
I'm sorry I couldn't get down this
week, but we've had a house full.

171
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,066
Who's looking after the baby?
My neighbour.

172
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,068
She's lent me her bike,
so I can get back.

173
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,070
Oh, well, you'd best be off.

174
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:51,723
I can't, darling,
I've got too much work.

175
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:54,976
We're losing two of the nurses
and they must rearrange the roster.

176
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:56,644
If Mary's out with Carlisle

177
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:58,897
and Edith's going to Mama's,
I'll be on my own.

178
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:01,316
What about Sybil?
Sybil's on duty.

179
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:04,360
I wish you'd told me. I could've
fixed something up for myself.

180
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,696
You could always
ask Major Clarkson to join you,

181
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:10,241
if you really can't be on your own
for one luncheon. I'll manage.

182
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,494
It's so empty.

183
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,416
I didn't know they'd gone.

184
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,376
They've given up.

185
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,253
You can't blame them.

186
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:25,882
When Billy was killed, it knocked
the stuffing out of them completely.

187
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,929
What'll we do about furniture
and pictures and everything?

188
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,847
What does anyone do?

189
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,724
Buy it, I presume.

190
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:38,853
Your lot buys it,
my lot inherits it.

191
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,151
We ought to be getting back.

192
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:47,237
Why?

193
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,406
What's at Downton that needs
your attention so urgently?

194
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,911
So...

195
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,955
Shall we rescue it?

196
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:00,708
Shall we give the house
another chapter?

197
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:06,965
Well, I suppose
one has to live somewhere.

198
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,719
You're telling me we've
been feeding Ethel for some time?

199
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,346
We have, m'lady.

200
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:15,598
Well, supplementing her food.

201
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,893
I didn't think you'd mind,
what with the baby and all,

202
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:22,897
but Mr Carson suggested you'd like
to be informed, all the same.

203
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:24,941
Carson is right, Mrs Hughes.

204
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:29,320
But the girl was our employee
and, while she was in the wrong -

205
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,073
Indeed she was.
Men will always be men

206
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:35,285
but for any young woman to let her
judgement so desert her -

207
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,163
She's not the first girl
to be taken in by a uniform.

208
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:42,375
And, don't worry, Carson, the baby
will make sure she pays the price.

209
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,920
Has she tried to get the father
to assume some responsibility?

210
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,715
She's tried and failed, I'm afraid.

211
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,010
I wonder.

212
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,305
If I were to write to Major Bryant,
inviting him to visit us again,

213
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,974
maybe Lord Grantham
can prevail on his good nature.

214
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:01,436
I'm not sure
he's got one to prevail on.

215
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:05,148
Satisfied? I feel sorry for Ethel,

216
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,734
but I cannot condone
her inability

217
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:11,029
to pronounce a simple
two-letter word: 'No'.

218
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,698
The wine delivery
should've been here by 12.

219
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,284
Get me out of the dining room
when they come.

220
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:19,287
Serve the main course
and let Jane finish. He won't mind.

221
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:30,632
Has Carson abandoned me?

222
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:33,468
He's dealing with a wine delivery,
m'lord.

223
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,763
Shall I fetch him?
No, no. I daresay we'll manage.

224
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:39,182
I hope you're happy here

225
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:43,728
and that your family arrangements
are not proving too complicated.

226
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:50,151
Your Lordship has a good memory.

227
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,737
All our lives
are lived around our children.

228
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,656
How old is your son?

229
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:59,244
12, m'lord.

230
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,912
Is he at the local school?

231
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:04,749
He is, but he's trying for
a scholarship to Ripon Grammar.

232
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,836
Ah. Is that a realistic prospect?

233
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:09,921
I think so.

234
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:13,132
He has a real talent
for mathematics and...

235
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:15,176
his teachers believe
it's worth a try.

236
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:17,262
Well done him. I'm impressed.

237
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:19,264
Perhaps I can put in a word.

238
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,684
I'm sure I should say
'He wants to do it all by himself',

239
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:26,020
but I'm not proud,
so if you can say anything, m'lord,

240
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:28,022
then, for heavens' sake do.

241
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:30,608
Jane, have you finished in here?

242
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,074
I hope she wasn't talking
out of turn, m'lord.

243
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:41,035
Not at all, it was my fault,
I asked the questions.

244
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,003
But surely, if His Lordship
asks him, he must do something.

245
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,463
Why? What difference will it make?

246
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:54,883
We're not in the 14th century.

247
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:58,178
But when he hears that Lord
Grantham knows what he's done -

248
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:01,181
What's he done that all young men
aren't anxious to do

249
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:03,349
behind the bicycle sheds
every night?

250
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:06,978
What am I going to do,
if Major Bryant doesn't come round?

251
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,022
Who knows?

252
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:10,899
Go to a big city.

253
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,692
Invent a past.

254
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:14,777
You've broken the rules, my girl,

255
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:17,655
and it's no good pretending
they're easily mended.

256
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,538
Mr Bates, there's a telephone call
for you. It's your lawyer.

257
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,876
Shall I come with you?

258
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:33,421
Lady Mary was looking for you.

259
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:36,174
When was this?

260
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,969
When she got back from her outing.

261
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:42,222
Were you going to keep it a secret
all day?

262
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:46,518
I'm going to fetch my button box.

263
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,107
Thank you.

264
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:54,901
Any letters to post?

265
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,737
Look...

266
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,366
I know I've changed, and not
for the better, but even so,

267
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,327
do you really still
not recognise me?

268
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,247
I know. Why am I feeling so silly?

269
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,332
It's funny, isn't it?

270
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:11,876
I came here all the time
when I was growing up.

271
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,920
You were here?

272
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,922
At Downton?

273
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,512
You're not saying that you're...

274
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,556
Patrick.

275
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,558
Yes I am.

276
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,977
That's exactly what I'm saying.

277
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,190
I've just been hoping you'd realise
without my having to spell it out.

278
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:35,775
But Patrick's...

279
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,152
Dead? Drowned on the Titanic?

280
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:42,740
Of course, this must be
very hard for you.

281
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:48,746
That's ridiculous.

282
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,085
No, I'm sorry, of course,
I'm not saying it's your fault.

283
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:55,837
It's mine. It's all mine.

284
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,630
Yes.

285
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:59,549
Thank you.

286
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,426
Goodbye.

287
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:09,350
She's gone and told the judge that
I paid her to agree to a divorce.

288
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:13,646
I suppose you did, didn't you?
Yes, I bloody well did.

289
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,650
So what does it mean?

290
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,527
Because we withheld it
from the court,

291
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:21,905
it means the judge can withdraw
the Decree Nisi.

292
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:25,158
It means I'm not divorced,
after all.

293
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,914
Above all it means that
I am a stupid, stupid, stupid man.

294
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,792
This won't change a thing.

295
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:38,296
We are going to be together,
whether she wants it or not.

296
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:40,131
If we have to leave here,

297
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:42,091
if we have to leave the country,

298
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,968
we are going to be together.

299
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,058
I was on the Titanic,
that much is true,

300
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:53,811
but I was pulled out of the water
by Fifth Officer Lowe,

301
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:55,480
the only one of them to come back.

302
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:57,690
At least,
that's what they said later.

303
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:01,069
When I properly came round,
they'd misidentified me as Canadian

304
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,988
and shipped me up to Montreal.
I don't understand.

305
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,366
Why didn't you just tell them
who you were?

306
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:08,034
Because I couldn't remember.

307
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:10,829
I don't know
if it was the blow to the head,

308
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,581
or the shock, or the cold,
but I had no memory.

309
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:16,000
As far as I knew, I was Canadian.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,086
So... So what happened?

311
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:21,047
Well, I had no reason
to go back to England

312
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:24,843
so, in the end,
I took my name from a gin bottle.

313
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,596
Then, in 1914,
I joined Princess Pat's Infantry.

314
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:30,890
And what changed?

315
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,435
I was caught in
a big explosion at Passchendaele.

316
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,437
When I woke up,

317
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:38,356
it all came back.

318
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,733
Suddenly, I knew who I was.

319
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:43,695
I began to call myself
Patrick again.

320
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,906
Why not your whole name?

321
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,908
Why didn't you send a message
at once?

322
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,994
I nearly did

323
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:54,455
and then I heard that Downton was
an officers' convalescent home.

324
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:56,958
I thought that
if I came here and you knew me,

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,668
the hard part would be over.

326
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,670
But we didn't know you.

327
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,630
Precisely.

328
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,388
I must... talk to Papa.

329
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:14,058
We've Matthew the new heir
to think about.

330
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,519
Ah. The new heir, yes.

331
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:20,273
This will be very difficult
for him, of course.

332
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:24,861
It must be so hard for you,
what with Mary getting married...

333
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,238
Did I love her very much?

334
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:30,617
Well, I'm the wrong person to ask.

335
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:34,704
Because you were the one
who really loved me, you mean?

336
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,626
I... never thought Patrick knew.

337
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:44,005
Well, he did.

338
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,884
I- I do.

339
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:54,855
It's big.

340
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:57,525
The staircase is prettier
than the one here,

341
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:00,152
but mainly, it's just big.
Can we stop?

342
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,696
I'd much rather see your face
when we talk.

343
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:11,038
So will you buy it?

344
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,706
Probably.

345
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:15,835
He says he wants to steal Carson
to come and run it for us.

346
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,920
I don't envy you, telling your Papa.

347
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,547
Mm.

348
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,590
Suppose Carson won't do it?

349
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,093
Since he would open his veins
for you,

350
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:26,095
I don't think there's much doubt.

351
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:30,307
I don't have to marry him, you know.

352
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,934
Yes you do.

353
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,522
If I thought for a moment that I was
an argument against your marriage,

354
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,899
I should jump into the nearest river.

355
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:41,610
And how would you manage that,
without my help?

356
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:44,238
I'd get you to push me.

357
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,782
Seriously, I can only relax

358
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:50,161
because I know that you have
a real life coming.

359
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,790
If I ever thought
I was putting that in jeopardy,

360
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,834
I'd go away and never see you again.

361
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,836
You don't mean that. But I do.

362
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,506
I am the cat that walks by himself

363
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:04,884
and all places are alike to me.

364
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:09,305
I have nothing to give
and nothing to share.

365
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:13,309
If you were not engaged
to be married...

366
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:17,730
.. I wouldn't let you
anywhere near me.

367
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,155
You'd think he was
in Mary's sole charge.

368
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:30,826
I worry it'll mean a big adjustment
for him, when we marry.

369
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:35,998
I don't believe Matthew
has any desire

370
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,083
to stop her marrying, Richard.

371
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,085
Quite the contrary.

372
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:45,508
Maybe, but is she as convinced
as he is that they have no future?

373
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:50,095
What are you saying?

374
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,309
I suppose I'm asking whether
you want Mary to have children.

375
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:57,436
Because, if you do,

376
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:00,606
isn't it time for Lavinia Swire
to come back into his life?

377
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:12,076
I wish I knew how an engine worked.

378
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,119
I can teach you, if you'd like.

379
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:17,915
That's Edith's territory.

380
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,043
I thought you were avoiding me.

381
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:23,921
Of course not.

382
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:27,883
But you haven't come up with
an answer yet, have you?

383
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,970
Not yet, I'm afraid.

384
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:35,099
I know you want to play your part
in Ireland's troubles

385
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,851
and I respect that,

386
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:39,770
but I just can't think about it all
until the war is over.

387
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,856
It won't be long now.

388
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:43,816
So will you wait?

389
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:45,734
I'd wait forever.

390
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:48,404
I'm not asking for forever.

391
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:51,532
Just a few more weeks.

392
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:57,913
You know, Old Ma Patmore's
not as mad as I thought.

393
00:21:57,955 --> 00:21:59,582
Why do you say that?

394
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:02,042
I've made some enquiries
and she's right.

395
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:05,421
There's a big demand for
rationed food if I can find it.

396
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,298
And can you?

397
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,800
Maybe. I've been given a name.

398
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:12,178
I'll have to come up with
the money though.

399
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:14,180
And can you find the money?

400
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:15,890
I think so.

401
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,059
I've a bit put by,
and I could borrow some.

402
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:21,103
It's a risk though, isn't it?

403
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:23,480
You've gotta speculate to accumulate.

404
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,566
Hadn't you heard?

405
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:29,195
No, but I know the one about
neither a borrower or a lender be.

406
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,449
What do you think?

407
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,784
All the chaps are wearing them
in London.

408
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:38,120
Only for informal evenings,
of course.

409
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:41,999
I'm not sure you'll get much use
out of it, when the war is over.

410
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:45,836
Maybe not, but I can wear it when
Her Ladyship and I are on our own.

411
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:51,759
You're very preoccupied, tonight.

412
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:57,181
Papa, can I have a word? Now?

413
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:01,769
What is it?

414
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,729
I think you'd better sit down.

415
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:14,365
Mm.

416
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,408
I knew you'd be in here,

417
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,786
making last-minute adjustments.

418
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:22,122
'Never leave anything to chance,'
m'lady, that's my motto.

419
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:24,166
Mine too, really.

420
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,502
Sometimes, I wish it wasn't.

421
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:32,925
I gather Sir Richard's asked you
about coming with us,

422
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,969
when we're married.

423
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:37,596
I need to hear what you think.

424
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:40,891
It's a terrific idea.

425
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,561
If anyone can keep me
out of trouble, it's you.

426
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,898
What about His Lordship?

427
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:51,235
Of course, he'll kill me,

428
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:53,362
but I'm sure he'll understand.

429
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,364
Well...

430
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:58,868
I'll give you my answer
when you've spoken to His Lordship.

431
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:03,455
It'd be a huge wrench for me
to leave Downton.

432
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,435
Major Gordon...

433
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:28,564
.. Edith has given me
an account of your conversation.

434
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:32,610
She said she would.

435
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,612
I wish you'd spoken to me first.

436
00:24:36,363 --> 00:24:39,325
Obviously, I need time
to consider what you've said.

437
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:41,619
Well, I can offer little proof,

438
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,455
except that I know things
only the real Patrick would know.

439
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:47,875
I was never fingerprinted,
or anything.

440
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:52,630
Presumably you understand that
people would be seriously affected,

441
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:54,256
should your story be true.

442
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:57,468
You mean Cousin Matthew?
It would be very hard on Matthew.

443
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,470
Of course it would but, Robert...

444
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:04,308
.. I-I mean, Lord Grantham,
if you'd prefer it.

445
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,268
I would, until we know more.

446
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:10,564
When I was in hospital,
I had my story written down.

447
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:20,616
So you can have it checked,
as far as that's possible.

448
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:24,578
Thank you.

449
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,330
I'll send it to my lawyers in London

450
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:28,999
and I'll break the news
to the family tomorrow.

451
00:25:31,836 --> 00:25:33,838
Where did you learn to do that?

452
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:37,550
Do what?

453
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,514
Never mind.

454
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:45,516
Am I really a stranger?

455
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,561
Do you not recognise me at all?

456
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:52,940
It feels very odd
to be talking so formally.

457
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,405
The whole situation is
certainly odd, that I freely admit.

458
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,381
The war may be at an end,
but the upheaval is only beginning.

459
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:19,008
Oh, how right you are.

460
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,303
That is why Downton Abbey still has
such an important role to play.

461
00:26:22,344 --> 00:26:23,888
Oh, dear me.

462
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:25,890
There's so much to be done.

463
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:29,101
When you think of all
the children laid up with disease -

464
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:32,062
But they're making
such advances now, aren't they?

465
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:35,608
Could we talk about the lecture
programme? If we must, we must,

466
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,902
if only I wasn't haunted
by those women

467
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:41,780
whose jobs will be snatched
from them when the boys come home.

468
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:44,658
We have to find work
for our heroes, don't we?

469
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,995
That must be our priority,
however hard that might sound.

470
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:50,080
As you say.

471
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,917
And what about
those wretched refugees?

472
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,710
What will become of them?

473
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:57,254
Ah, now you've struck a chord.

474
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,590
Have I really? Oh, thank heaven.

475
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,842
What do you mean? Oh, nothing.

476
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:04,678
Only the thought of
those poor men and women,

477
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,515
flung across Europe,
far from their homelands

478
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:09,850
and so much in need of your help.

479
00:27:09,892 --> 00:27:12,102
My help? Why do you say that?

480
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:14,396
When it comes to helping refugees,

481
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:18,776
your experience renders your value
'beyond price'.

482
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:21,779
One of the organisers said
those words.

483
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,697
Which organiser?

484
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:25,616
I forget.

485
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:28,786
But what about running Downton?
I mean, I can't do both.

486
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:31,956
Well, I suppose you must decide
what it more important.

487
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:35,084
Exercise classes
and lectures on pottery,

488
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:38,212
or... helping men and women
build a new life.

489
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:42,258
I must go,
but I will think about it.

490
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:46,554
Are you coming to
Cousin Robert's dinner tonight?

491
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,848
Are you?
Well, I didn't feel I could say no.

492
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:52,309
He sent a note this morning and was
most insistent. What's it about?

493
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:56,188
I have no idea,
but we'll talk there.

494
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,732
We're onto something for you.

495
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:01,360
We mustn't let the iron grew cold.

496
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,780
Thank you.

497
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,534
You know there is
nothing more ill-bred

498
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,536
than to steal
other people's servants.

499
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:13,289
But you're not 'other people'
and Carson brought me up.

500
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,500
What does he say? That he won't do
anything without your permission.

501
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,169
Which, of course, is so cunning.

502
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:20,171
How can I refuse a man
who says that?

503
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:22,214
What do you say, Bates?

504
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:26,093
I say Mr Carson must have the last
word on where he lives and works.

505
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,346
You're ganging up on me.

506
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,601
You're a darling and I love you.

507
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:35,644
Now, what's this dinner all about?

508
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:41,358
Won't you tell me? You'll find out.

509
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:45,738
I'm sorry if it's a bit of a crush.

510
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,448
I didn't want to be overheard.

511
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,200
Are we talking financial ruin?

512
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,910
Or criminal investigation?

513
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:53,537
Neither.
I'll get straight to the point.

514
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:55,956
We have a patient
who has been badly burned

515
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:58,334
who goes by the name of
Patrick Gordon...

516
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,879
.. but he claims to be
Patrick Crawley.

517
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:06,675
But I thought he was dead.

518
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:08,469
Didn't he drown on the Titanic?

519
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:11,597
Well, of course, it is
what we all thought, until now.

520
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:13,599
They never found a body.

521
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:15,267
They never found lots of bodies.

522
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:17,645
I'm so sorry,
but I'm not quite on top of this.

523
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:19,271
Who's Patrick Crawley?

524
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:22,024
The man who would displace me
as heir.

525
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:26,570
If he's alive, then I am no longer
the future Earl of Grantham.

526
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:28,239
It's ridiculous.

527
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,826
How can it be true? Where's he been
hiding for the last six years?

528
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:34,286
In Canada, suffering from amnesia.

529
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:36,747
He does have a story
that would explain it,

530
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:40,084
but I'm not quite sure about
how to test the facts.

531
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:43,379
He knows all sorts of things
that only Patrick,

532
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,714
or someone very close to him
would know.

533
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:47,341
What a stupid thing to say.

534
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:48,968
Any fortune teller at a fair

535
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:51,720
comes up with a dozen details
he couldn't possibly know.

536
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,347
There's no need to be angry.

537
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:55,683
This young man
is either Patrick of he's not.

538
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:57,643
There must be a way to find out.

539
00:29:57,685 --> 00:29:59,645
Is he like Patrick to look at?

540
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,564
He isn't like anything to look at.

541
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:05,985
I've sent his account off to George
Murray in London, to ask his advice.

542
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:08,028
What a waste of time and money.

543
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,073
What's the matter?
We were all so fond of Patrick.

544
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:14,076
You were going to marry him,
for heaven's sake.

545
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:16,829
Aren't you glad, if he survived?
Dear me.

546
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:19,039
Should I be worried? Certainly not.

547
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:21,208
This man is a fake and an imposter.

548
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:25,045
I think it's a cruel trick to play,
when Matthew's been through so much.

549
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:29,216
Oh, my dear,
don't be too quick to decide.

550
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:32,970
You never know, this might be
a blessing in disguise.

551
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:35,598
What do you mean?
Well, he seems a nice enough chap.

552
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:37,266
He's not very pretty, of course,

553
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:39,685
but he can walk round the estate
on his own two legs

554
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:41,854
and sire a string of sons
to continue the line.

555
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:44,732
I'd say that's a great improvement
on the current situation.

556
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:47,568
Sybil, could I prevail on you
to take me back to my room?

557
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,528
Of course.

558
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:05,117
Mrs Hughes, we've had a letter
in the evening post

559
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,744
from Major Bryant's father.

560
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:09,038
He must have found it
hard to write, for it seems

561
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,625
the Major has been killed
in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.

562
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:16,712
How sad. I'm sorry to hear it.

563
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:19,548
I know and right at the end,
but there we are.

564
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,218
I'm afraid
it's the end of our story too.

565
00:31:23,302 --> 00:31:25,221
What story is that, m'lady?

566
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:30,184
A friend of Mrs Hughes
knew the Major.

567
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,895
Can you relay the news? Of course.

568
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:35,606
Will that be all? Yes, thank you.

569
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:45,658
Is that the Major Bryant that Ethel
always thought so handsome, m'lady?

570
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,618
Too handsome for anyone's good.

571
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:59,588
I beg your pardon, Your Lordship,
I thought everyone had gone up.

572
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,173
Not yet.

573
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:03,175
Is there anything I can fetch you?

574
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,886
Nothing that would help.

575
00:32:13,227 --> 00:32:15,479
Never mind me. Good night.

576
00:32:24,196 --> 00:32:27,908
Not a shock, exactly, but obviously
it was a tremendous surprise.

577
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,910
So what happens next?

578
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,288
Papa sent your statement
up to his solicitor.

579
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:36,334
What is it?
Do you remember this place?

580
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,294
Of course I do.

581
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,296
How we used to hide over there?

582
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:43,924
Wasn't there a governess
none of you liked?

583
00:32:43,924 --> 00:32:45,634
Fraulein Kelder.

584
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:48,346
That's it. Fraulein Kelder!

585
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:50,806
What fun we used to make of her.

586
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,686
Do you know,
I do recognise you now.

587
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:57,355
Do you?

588
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:01,609
You haven't changed at all.

589
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:03,653
Not a jot.

590
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,321
God knows I have.

591
00:33:06,447 --> 00:33:08,532
It's not important.

592
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:11,035
Edith, if you really mean it,

593
00:33:11,077 --> 00:33:13,996
do you think once it's all settled,
we might talk again?

594
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,807
But, if they've read Her Ladyship's
letter, won't his parents know?

595
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:35,768
I don't think so. She only
invited him to pay a visit.

596
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:39,438
She thought the subject of the baby
would come better face to face.

597
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,025
Could I write to them?

598
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:45,319
You could try,
but where's your proof?

599
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:47,530
With him dead,
you've no evidence at all.

600
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,407
Then I'm ruined.

601
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:53,035
You were ruined already, my girl,
so don't let's us go overboard.

602
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,500
How's that new maid getting on?
The lady with the little boy.

603
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,460
Very well, thank you. Why?

604
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:04,630
Just thinking.

605
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,384
Everyone wants to help her,
to feed her, to find her work,

606
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:12,096
because her son's father is dead.
So is the father of my son.

607
00:34:12,138 --> 00:34:14,056
Where's the difference?

608
00:34:15,224 --> 00:34:18,436
The difference is Jane is
a respectable, married woman

609
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:20,396
that some man chose to be his wife.

610
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:21,981
Is that enough?

611
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:24,108
It is in the real world.

612
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:31,824
Carson, now, I wonder if I could be
put on the London train

613
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:33,576
at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning?

614
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:36,078
His Lordship's valet
is catching that one.

615
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,665
Would you object to his riding
in the front with the chauffeur?

616
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:43,169
Not at all. Meanwhile, have you
given my proposition any thought?

617
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,171
A great deal, Sir Richard.

618
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:47,465
I'll be back on the night of 10th.

619
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:49,967
Perhaps you could
let me have your answer, then.

620
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:53,804
Answer to what? As to whether
Carson will be captain of our ship.

621
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:57,600
With you at the helm, there's much
more chance of a smooth crossing.

622
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:03,939
Your Lordship,
I need to go to London tomorrow.

623
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,735
I've spoken to Mr Carson.
He has no objection.

624
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:12,657
Please say this concerns property
and not the former Mrs Bates.

625
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:16,035
I only wish she was 'the former',
m'lord,

626
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:18,329
or better still, 'the late'.

627
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,373
Indeed?

628
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:23,751
I have to reason with her.
I've found no other choice.

629
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:26,629
She's found a reason
to delay things again.

630
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:28,673
No, not delay.

631
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:30,716
She's found a way to ruin things.

632
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:32,802
Be sensible, Bates.

633
00:35:32,843 --> 00:35:35,012
Above all, do not lose your temper.

634
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,539
A German Republic?

635
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,666
No, I don't think so, Mr Branson.

636
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,585
The Kaiser will go, I'll grant
you...

637
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:09,630
.. and maybe the Crown Prince too,
but there'll be a Regency.

638
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:11,340
Mark my words.

639
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:15,261
Monarchy is the lifeblood
of Europe. Sorry, Mr Carson,

640
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:18,472
but I think you'll find the kings
and emperors have had their day,

641
00:36:18,514 --> 00:36:20,891
if President Wilson
has anything to say about it.

642
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:22,643
I'll have to go up to London.

643
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:25,187
What will you say to her
that you haven't said already?

644
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:28,316
I don't know, but I know staying
here won't make any difference.

645
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:31,402
You're always going to London,
Mr Bates. I have business in London.

646
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:33,738
Oh, yes?
Well, judging by your expression,

647
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:35,906
your business
doesn't seem to be prospering.

648
00:36:35,948 --> 00:36:38,075
The trick of business is
to mind your own.

649
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:40,036
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I...

650
00:36:41,162 --> 00:36:43,247
.. I've just heard news
from the War Office

651
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,374
and I thought you'd all like
to know...

652
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,419
.. that the war is over.

653
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:56,052
The ceasefire will begin

654
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:58,804
at 11 o'clock on the morning
of the 11th of November.

655
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:00,431
Why can't it begin now?

656
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:02,933
The 11th of the 11th,
seems pretty tidy to me.

657
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:04,852
We will mark the moment
in the Great Hall

658
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:07,980
and I expect all of you - including
the kitchen staff and hall boys -

659
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:11,067
everyone to be there - and Carson.

660
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:13,444
Oh, it's such wonderful news.

661
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:15,613
Is there any more glasses up there?

662
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:17,782
We should make a toast together.

663
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,492
To peace.

664
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:21,577
To peace.

665
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:25,247
The truth is, Cora, there is a
reason for inviting you here today

666
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,876
and I fear I'm going to be
a great disappointment to you. Oh?

667
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:32,713
Cousin Violet is, in part, to blame.
Yes, I usually am.

668
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:36,342
It was she who drew my attention
to the plight of the war refugees.

669
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,470
I feel very guilty,
since I chivvied you,

670
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:43,808
and now I'm jumping ship,
but I can't run Downton as well.

671
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,185
You must go where
you can make a difference.

672
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:47,812
This is what I think,

673
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:51,315
but I hope you will consider
keeping the house open without me.

674
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:54,819
I must be honest with you,
it was your idea, not ours,

675
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,905
so I doubt very much
we'll go on with it, now.

676
00:37:57,947 --> 00:38:00,074
But what does that matter

677
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:02,827
when one thinks of
the work you'll be doing?

678
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:05,037
Don't you agree, Mama?

679
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:11,585
I- I... cannot find the words
to say how I feel.

680
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:14,422
What - what do you think, Molesley?

681
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:16,841
Sometimes fate knows best, m'lady.

682
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:19,218
I couldn't put it better myself.

683
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,179
Well...

684
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:28,936
There really is
something for her to do?

685
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:33,024
Absolutely. It's all set up.

686
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:37,445
I had to promise to be a patron,
but it seemed a small price to pay.

687
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:39,572
I know it was
for Robert and the girls,

688
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:42,450
but I thank you, without irony,

689
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:45,286
from the bottom of my heart.

690
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,955
And I accept your thanks, my dear,

691
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:50,624
with no trace of irony either.

692
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,296
Lawyers take forever
to answer anything,

693
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:57,340
so they can charge more.

694
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:59,759
But the others don't believe me,
do they?

695
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,719
Not like you.

696
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:03,846
I think they want to be certain.

697
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,848
But how can they ever be?

698
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:08,517
If the lawyer casts
even the slightest doubt,

699
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,937
won't that give them the excuse to
cut me out and stay with Matthew?

700
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:13,981
If only one of them recognised me.

701
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:15,608
They will do, soon.

702
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:18,569
No they won't. They've forgotten me.

703
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,698
I'm a stranger to them now!

704
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,580
Well, you're not a stranger to me.

705
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,713
I wouldn't be Vera Bates.

706
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,924
He left here at dawn,
with a face like thunder.

707
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:41,801
I wonder if she knows
what she's started.

708
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:43,719
If I were you, I'd keep out of it.

709
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:45,346
Wise words.

710
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:48,265
How did you get on?
Yeah, it was interesting.

711
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:51,143
Daisy, I wish you'd let me
tell you about it.

712
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:53,312
There's no point. No point in what?

713
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:57,149
Jane keeps making out
I'm a war widow, but I'm not, am I?

714
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:58,859
You all know that.

715
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:01,904
I married William on his deathbed,
that don't count.

716
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,323
Course it counts. I don't think so.

717
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:06,033
And I wasn't good to him.

718
00:40:07,284 --> 00:40:11,205
He thought I loved him,
but I didn't, not like he loved me.

719
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:16,419
I should never have married him
in the first place, only -

720
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,005
Marrying him was a great kindness.

721
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:21,590
No, it wasn't kind.

722
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:23,301
It was wrong.

723
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,472
Mr Bates, how did you get here?

724
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:30,308
I walked from the station.

725
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:32,977
You should've said.
We'd have sent someone to meet you.

726
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:35,313
I was glad of the walk.
I was glad of the air.

727
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:41,193
I never thought
you'd be back tonight.

728
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:42,778
How was it?

729
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,156
Worse than you can possibly imagine.

730
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,868
What's...?

731
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,800
I assume that whatever Mr Murray has
told you means the man is a fake.

732
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:07,720
You can't have asked Matthew to be
here, unless you know that.

733
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:09,680
It's very complicated.

734
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:12,642
Lowe was the only officer to go back
to the site of the wreck.

735
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:14,769
He did pull
some people out of the sea

736
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:17,855
and it seems one of the men
was unidentified. There.

737
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:21,567
One of the reports has him dying
before they reached the Carpathia.

738
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:23,194
Precisely.

739
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:26,030
Another witness says
the man did get to New York alive,

740
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:27,990
but there's no clear record
of his name.

741
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:30,534
Which could be Patrick Crawley.
There's more.

742
00:41:30,576 --> 00:41:34,413
There was a Peter Gordon who worked
with Patrick at the Foreign Office.

743
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:37,041
Now, he emigrated to Montreal
in 1913.

744
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,543
Yes and when
his face was blown away,

745
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:42,421
he decided
every cloud has a silver lining.

746
00:41:42,463 --> 00:41:45,925
He was perfectly placed
to impersonate his dead friend.

747
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:49,512
No doubt they shared confidences,
so he just brushed them up

748
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:51,889
and put himself forward for
a major inheritance.

749
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:53,599
Granny's right.

750
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,643
All he needed was a survivor
from the Titanic

751
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:57,645
who was unaccounted for
and he found one.

752
00:41:57,687 --> 00:42:01,148
But the Titanic story bears out
Patrick's version in every way.

753
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,526
What do you think?

754
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:05,403
I don't know what to think.

755
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:07,238
How can you even hesitate?

756
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:10,032
But, Mary, you haven't heard
the things he remembers.

757
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,701
I don't need to.

758
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:14,578
I remember how we played,
and your pony, and your birthday,

759
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,331
and how we hid in the garden
from the nasty governess.

760
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:20,793
What other memories would you have
of a childhood spent here?

761
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:25,131
Murray will continue to investigate
so, Edith,

762
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:28,050
can we be polite to the man,
but nothing more?

763
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,429
The end of the war should make it
easier to unearth the evidence.

764
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,431
That is all for the time being.

765
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:37,560
I thought Carlisle was going to come
back for our ceremony tomorrow.

766
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:40,563
He's driving up. He'll be here
in time for dinner, tonight.

767
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:45,651
I'm sorry I can't be more decisive.

768
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:48,487
Don't be.
I meant what I said, the other day.

769
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:52,658
It'll take a man who is
more than I am now to follow you,

770
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,285
so don't think about me.

771
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:56,329
My dear chap, how can you say that?

772
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,331
I never think about anything else.

773
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:07,089
What do they make of this Peter
Gordon character they've uncovered?

774
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,050
Do they think that's who I am?

775
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:12,595
Do you remember him?

776
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:14,180
Very well.

777
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:16,223
Peter and I were good friends.

778
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:17,808
Very good friends.

779
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:21,145
Did you know he'd moved to Canada?

780
00:43:21,187 --> 00:43:24,982
How could I, when I'd forgotten
who I was, until two months ago?

781
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:26,984
Of course.

782
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:29,070
So what will they do now?

783
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:31,155
Track him down, I imagine.

784
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:34,408
Find out what happened to him.

785
00:43:34,408 --> 00:43:37,244
Suppose he joined
the Princess Pat Light Infantry?

786
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:41,832
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

787
00:43:41,874 --> 00:43:43,918
Why would he?

788
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:46,420
You're very sweet, you know.

789
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:50,925
So sweet, you made me think
that all things were possible.

790
00:43:52,218 --> 00:43:55,346
But perhaps the lesson is
you can't go back.

791
00:43:57,556 --> 00:44:01,143
You're tired and I don't blame you,
but you're not to give up.

792
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:03,771
I won't let you.

793
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:08,150
We'll find this Peter Gordon,
I know we will.

794
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,111
Yes.

795
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:12,154
I expect you will.

796
00:44:20,496 --> 00:44:22,957
They'll be going in to dinner
in a minute.

797
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:25,376
We've built a good cellar here,
you know.

798
00:44:25,418 --> 00:44:29,839
I'm not saying it's legendary,
but it's nothing to be ashamed of.

799
00:44:33,092 --> 00:44:35,052
You've made your mind up, then?

800
00:44:36,262 --> 00:44:39,307
I think so, yes.

801
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:43,060
I think I have...

802
00:44:44,478 --> 00:44:46,772
.. but, with a heavy heart,
Mrs Hughes.

803
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:51,152
And just when we thought
we were getting back to normal.

804
00:44:51,193 --> 00:44:53,154
Don't tell me you'll miss me.

805
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:57,491
I will, Mr Carson.

806
00:44:57,533 --> 00:44:59,160
Very much.

807
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,203
And it costs me nothing to say it.

808
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:03,164
Thank you.

809
00:45:03,205 --> 00:45:05,416
That means a lot to me.

810
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:14,842
Shall we go through with the ladies
and let them get in here? Of course.

811
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:16,719
I wonder what happened to Richard.

812
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:18,679
He'll have started late and...

813
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:20,556
Oh, I do apologise, Lady Grantham.

814
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:23,893
We got stuck in Royston and
a cart had overturned in Baldock.

815
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:29,732
Hello, my dear.
How lovely to see you.

816
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,400
Are you sure?

817
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:34,987
Sir Richard said
you were expecting me, but are you?

818
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:37,114
Of course we are.

819
00:45:37,156 --> 00:45:40,159
Can you take Matthew into
the small library? Are you hungry?

820
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:43,454
We've finished, but Mrs Hughes can
easily put something on a tray.

821
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:45,414
Carson?

822
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:56,717
Nothing's changed.

823
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:59,595
But, you see, it has,
because I've changed.

824
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:02,390
When I was last here,

825
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:04,976
I was so bowled over
that I let you send me away,

826
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:06,644
but not this time.

827
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:08,729
I love you.

828
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:11,607
I'm going to look after you.
That's all there is to it.

829
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,112
And if I refuse?

830
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,490
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

831
00:46:20,616 --> 00:46:23,202
You won't frighten me away,
whatever you do.

832
00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:25,788
It seems such a waste of time
to drive from London

833
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,999
and get stuck in every town
on the way.

834
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,793
I don't agree. I'd love to drive

835
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:34,630
and you'd better agree if Anthony
Strallen comes back into your life.

836
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:36,716
Before you scold me,
it's no good pretending

837
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:38,551
Mary is not too attached to Matthew.

838
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:40,177
So you summon Lavinia,

839
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:42,513
to be sacrificed
like some latter-day Iphigenia

840
00:46:42,555 --> 00:46:44,807
doomed to push his chair
through all eternity?

841
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:47,143
Robert, it's quite simple.

842
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:49,770
Do you want Mary's marriage
to be a success?

843
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:52,356
Do you want grandchildren?

844
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:55,651
Sometimes, Cora,
you can be curiously unfeeling.

845
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:08,622
Suppose he doesn't want
her back? Have you thought of that?

846
00:47:08,664 --> 00:47:10,708
He needs someone to look after him.
Yes, but -

847
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,460
You'll be too busy
with our new life.

848
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:15,087
I know you're used to having
your own way. Yes, I am.

849
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:17,632
I'll say something now
I hope I won't have to repeat.

850
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:20,468
If you think you can jilt me,
or in some way set me aside,

851
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:23,262
I tell you now, you have given me
the power to destroy you.

852
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:25,222
Don't think I won't use it.

853
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,561
I want to be a good husband
and for you to be happy,

854
00:47:30,603 --> 00:47:33,022
but don't ever cross me,
do you understand?

855
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:34,982
Never.

856
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,781
Absolutely never.

857
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:49,086
What's happened to Major Gordon?

858
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,962
He's gone.

859
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:53,340
But he can't have.

860
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:57,135
When?

861
00:47:57,177 --> 00:47:59,262
After breakfast.

862
00:47:59,304 --> 00:48:01,765
I couldn't very well stop him.
The war's over.

863
00:48:03,684 --> 00:48:05,644
He left this for you.

864
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:18,281
What does it say?

865
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:22,202
'It was too difficult.

866
00:48:22,244 --> 00:48:24,204
I'm sorry.

867
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,206
P Gordon. '

868
00:48:31,003 --> 00:48:33,505
P for Patrick or P for Peter?

869
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:37,759
I know what you think,
but I don't accept it.

870
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:41,054
We drove him away.

871
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:45,809
His own family
drove our cousin away.

872
00:48:49,354 --> 00:48:52,441
But you believed in him,
whoever he was,

873
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:55,027
and that's worth something.

874
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:08,332
I think, while the clock strikes,
we should all make a silent prayer

875
00:49:08,373 --> 00:49:10,917
to mark the finish of
this terrible war...

876
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,339
.. and what that means
for each and every one of us.

877
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,425
Let us remember the sacrifices
that have been made

878
00:49:18,467 --> 00:49:21,303
and the men who will never come back

879
00:49:21,303 --> 00:49:23,805
and give them our thanks.

880
00:50:05,514 --> 00:50:07,516
Thank you, everyone.

881
00:50:07,557 --> 00:50:11,687
Remember, this is not just
the end of a long war,

882
00:50:11,728 --> 00:50:14,064
but it is the dawn of a new age.

883
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:17,067
God bless you all.

884
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,079
Let me help you with that.

885
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:31,206
Can you get him back to his room?

886
00:50:31,248 --> 00:50:33,125
I'll open the door.

887
00:50:38,547 --> 00:50:40,590
My God.

888
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,676
Is something wrong, sir?

889
00:50:42,718 --> 00:50:44,636
No, nothing.

890
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:46,638
Bates, if I felt...

891
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,557
If you felt what, sir?

892
00:50:48,598 --> 00:50:50,809
It doesn't matter. Not yet.

893
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:54,688
Not until I feel it again.

894
00:50:57,357 --> 00:50:59,401
I thought that was very dignified.

895
00:50:59,443 --> 00:51:01,445
Very calming.

896
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:03,196
Thank you, m'lord.

897
00:51:03,238 --> 00:51:06,408
I don't suppose you're having
any doubts about leaving?

898
00:51:07,576 --> 00:51:09,619
I'm afraid not, m'lord.

899
00:51:09,661 --> 00:51:12,497
Well, I can't say I'm not sorry.

900
00:51:13,832 --> 00:51:16,668
I won't go until
we've found a proper replacement.

901
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,714
Whoever we find won't replace you.

902
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,240
.. yes, of course. Mr Bates.

903
00:51:47,282 --> 00:51:49,201
Telegram for you.

904
00:52:09,638 --> 00:52:11,556
What was that about?

905
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,102
His wife's dead.

906
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:18,605
Someone found her,
earlier this morning.

907
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:34,579
I've found a dealer.
You mean black market business?

908
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:36,623
I'm anxious to make Lady Mary happy.

909
00:52:36,665 --> 00:52:39,584
I've had a request from Sir Richard
that you ought to know about.

910
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:42,921
I think I've found a way to escape.
Nothing too drastic, I hope.

911
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:46,216
I want to tell you all something.
Girls! Cora! Come at once!

912
00:52:46,258 --> 00:52:48,510
Does this mean
that you've made up your mind?

913
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,180
I'm a foolish man who's lost his way
and don't know how to find it again.

914
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,891
You said yourself,
there wouldn't be another chance.

915
00:52:54,933 --> 00:52:56,727
I bought it. It was arsenic.

916
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:59,146
I've been thinking
that's what she must have taken.

917
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:02,065
Mary is still in love with you.
