1
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,320
That's the last of the equipment
gone.

2
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,160
The maids have put the drawing room
back to normal.

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm walking down to the village.
I want to have a word with Travis.

4
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
Richard will be here any moment.

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,520
That's why I'm telling you. Give him
my excuses. I'll see him at dinner.

6
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,840
Is there any news on
the Bates situation?

7
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,840
Not that I'm aware of.

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,760
So you still want to keep him on?

9
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,200
Cora, Bates's wife has committed
suicide. It's very sad, of course,

10
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,960
but not, when I last looked,
a reason to sack him.

11
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
They've taken the rest of the beds.

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,200
So that's the finish of it.
Not quite. We still have Matthew.

13
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,520
And I wanted to ask you,
isn't it time he went home?

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
I see. You want to throw him out.

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,000
Robert. I want him to learn to be
as independent as he can.

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,080
And I want Mary to get on with her
life. What's wrong with that?

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Is there something you're not
telling me? What do you mean?

18
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,120
About Mary. And Matthew.
Some element you haven't told me?

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,600
Of course not. You're being silly.

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,880
If thinking that trying
to protect Mary with a

21
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,480
ring of steel is silly,
then yes, I am very silly.

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,680
You shouldn't be doing that.

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,640
Let us hope the end of the war brings
the return of the footman, Mr Crawley.

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,280
Do you think they will return?
I certainly hope so.

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm sure Sir Richard can buy you
a dozen when you get to Haxby.

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,760
Let me.
No, m'lord. I can manage.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
The handle broke.

28
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,760
Aren't we feeding you? They're from
my mother's apple store.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,720
She always loads me up.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,240
How's your boy doing? Freddie?

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,400
Yes, Freddie. He's doing very well.

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
I wrote to the headmaster of Ripon
Grammar. I said to look out for him.

33
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,120
That, that's so kind, m'lord.

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,200
I hope it works. I don't see why it
should, but you never know.

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,440
I suppose you miss your husband very
much?

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Of course.

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,840
But I have Freddie...

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,440
and when you think of what some
families have gone through. I know.

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,520
Almost 30 dead on this estate alone.

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,640
And the Elcots down at Longway
lost three out of four sons.

41
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,960
Mrs Carter's only boy was killed
a month before the end of the war.

42
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,600
Poor William.

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,760
And then there's Matthew.

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you ever wonder
what it was all for?

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I'd better go in, m'lord.

46
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,280
The train was late.

47
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,280
Welcome to the new world.

48
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,840
When a war is over,
the first emotion is relief.

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,200
The second, disappointment.

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
How sad.

51
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,480
But how true.

52
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Come in and have some tea.

53
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,000
Will you miss the extra staff,
Mrs Patmore?

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Not really. When push comes to shove,
I'd rather do it myself.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
Though God knows what I'm to feed
them on.

56
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,760
There's nothing out there to be had.
Well.

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,840
The Lord tempers the wind
to the shorn lamb.

58
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,200
What about you, Thomas?
How much longer will you stay?

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,760
Well, now the last of the invalids
have gone, I suppose I'm finished.

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,600
I'll report to Major Clarkson,
but he won't be taking anyone on.

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,760
I suppose the hospital will revert
to the way it was before the war.

62
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,080
Where will you go?
What's it to you?

63
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,160
Where will you go?
I'll tell you where I'm going.

64
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,160
Into business. It's all set up.

65
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Do you mean black market business?

66
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Don't look so surprised.

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,020
I've found a dealer
and as soon as I make

68
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:44,160
the payment, I'll
have the supplies.

69
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,360
Where will you keep them?
I've got a shed in the village

70
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
and I'll get a banger
to deliver the stuff.

71
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,960
I'll be well fixed as soon as word
gets out. You heard her.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There are shortages all around.

73
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,880
Isn't it dangerous?
I don't think so.

74
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,840
I don't think the police are bothered
about rationing, now the war's over.

75
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,000
It won't last forever
but by the time it's done,

76
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,000
I should have enough
to go into business, properly.

77
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,440
So that's your future settled
as a plutocrat.

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,040
In the meantime, have you found
somewhere to live?

79
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Not yet, but there's no hurry.

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm sure they won't object
if I stop here for a week or two.

81
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
I shouldn't bet on it.

82
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,000
I nearly put out
the new dinner jacket, m'lord,

83
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,520
but then Mr Carson said the Dowager
was dining here. Quite right.

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Mustn't frighten the horses.

85
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,280
By the way, her ladyship was asking if
there was any more news about Mrs Bates.

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I don't think so, m'lord.

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,400
They'd like to know why she did it,
but I don't suppose we ever shall.

88
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,320
You'd think she'd leave a note.

89
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
Perhaps it was a spur of the moment
decision. It can't have been.

90
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,160
Wouldn't she have to get hold
of the stuff?

91
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,680
Please forgive me. I was thinking
aloud. We'll drop the subject.

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Anna.

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,120
It is Anna, isn't it?
Yes sir.

94
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I want to ask a favour of you.
Of me, Sir Richard.

95
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
You. I've been waiting for you.

96
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,120
I wonder if you could step into
my room for a moment.

97
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,560
You attend Lady Mary
and her sisters... don't you?

98
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,920
In addition to your other duties.

99
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
I do, sir, yes.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,360
You must be kept very busy.
I hope it's worth your while.

101
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,520
Because I would be very willing
to increase your stipend.

102
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,640
If this is about coming with
Lady Mary when you marry,

103
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
it's very good of you, sir,
but you see,

104
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
my fiance, Mr Bates, works here
and I don't think I...

105
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,760
No, it's not that.
Although it's a pity.

106
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Lady Mary's very fond of you.

107
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
That's kind.

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,480
You see...
I'm anxious to make Lady Mary happy.

109
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,640
Of course you are, sir. And to that
end, I feel I need to know

110
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,000
a great deal more about her
than I do.

111
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,400
Our customs are so strange
in this country.

112
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,740
A couple is hardly
allowed a moment alone

113
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:25,040
together before they
walk down the aisle.

114
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

115
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,360
I'd like to know more
about her interests.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,400
Where she goes, whom she sees.
What she says to them.

117
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,720
Excuse me, sir. Do you mean
you want me to give you

118
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,840
a report of Lady Mary's actions?

119
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,600
It will be extra work,
but I'm happy to pay.

120
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm sure.

121
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,640
But I'm afraid I wouldn't have
the time. Thank you, sir.

122
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
It's your choice, of course.

123
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
I'd be grateful if you didn't
mention this to Lady Mary.

124
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,240
I wouldn't want her to think I was
checking up on her.

125
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,440
I nearly came down in a dinner jacket
tonight.

126
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,720
Really? Well, why not a dressing
gown?

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Or better still, pyjamas?

128
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,720
That's why I didn't.

129
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,080
I like the new fashions.
Shorter skirts, looser cuts.

130
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,920
The old clothes were all very well
if one spent the day

131
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,840
on a chaise longue, but if one
wants to get anything done,

132
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,720
the new clothes are much better.

133
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I'll stick to the chaise longue.

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,120
Granny, you don't want things to go
back to the way they were, surely?

135
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,920
Of course I do,
and as quickly as possible.

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,240
What about you, Papa?

137
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,640
Before the war,
I believed my life had value.

138
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,720
I suppose I should like
to feel that again.

139
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,040
Have you seen the boys' haircuts
the women are wearing in Paris?

140
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
I hope you won't try that.

141
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
I might.

142
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,360
I'm not sure how feminine it is.

143
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm not sure how feminine I am.
Very, I'm glad to say.

144
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
Carson, I keep forgetting
to tell Mrs Hughes

145
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,560
we've had a letter from
Major Bryant's mother.

146
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,000
She and her husband are in Yorkshire
on Friday

147
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
and she wants to pay us a visit.
Why?

148
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,520
The last time they saw him alive,
it was here. I can understand.

149
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
Will they be staying, my lady?
No, but we'll give them luncheon.

150
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,040
That way they can talk about the
Major with all of us who knew him.

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That lets me out, thank heaven.

152
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
You look very fine.

153
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,600
Everything I own is from my season
before the war.

154
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
I'm trying to wear them out.

155
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,120
Where have you been all day?
Nowhere. I've just been busy.

156
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,240
I envy you.

157
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,720
I feel so flat after the rush and
bustle of the last two years.

158
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,040
They were sighing for the old days
at dinner,

159
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,140
but all I could think
about was how much

160
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:20,200
more I want from life
now than I did then.

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,840
Does this mean that you've made up
your mind, at last?

162
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
No, not quite, but almost.

163
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
What do you mean,
'how did she say it?'

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,640
Mr and Mrs Bryant are coming
for luncheon on Friday.

165
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,240
How are things over at Haxby?
Pretty good.

166
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,160
Building materials
are in short supply,

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,720
but Sir Richard knows
how to get around that.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I bet he does.

169
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,720
Well, you should see some of the
gadgets in the kitchens.

170
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,200
And the bathrooms - oh, goodness me!

171
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,080
They're like something out of a film
with Theda Bara.

172
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm surprised you know
who Theda Bara is.

173
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,120
I get about, Mrs Hughes,
I get about.

174
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,600
But will you be happy there?
That's what I want to be sure of.

175
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,400
If you're asking whether
I'll regret leaving Downton...

176
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,120
I will regret it
every minute of every day.

177
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I thought I would die here...

178
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,320
and haunt it ever after.

179
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Well, then!

180
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,080
You see, I think I can help her.

181
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
In those early years when it's
important to get it right.

182
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,280
And if I can help her... then I must.

183
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
I wish I could understand.

184
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
To me, Lady Mary is an uppity minx

185
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,080
who's the author of her own
misfortunes.

186
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,840
You didn't know her
when she was a child, Mrs Hughes.

187
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
She was a guinea a minute then.

188
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,560
I remember once she came in here,

189
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
she can't have been more than
four or five years old.

190
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,480
She said, 'Mr Carson,
I've decided to run away

191
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,680
and I wonder if I might take
some of the silver to sell.'

192
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,360
'Well, ' I said, 'that could be
awkward for his Lordship.

193
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,080
Suppose I give you sixpence to spend
in the village instead?'

194
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,400
'Very well, ' says she. 'But you must
be sure to charge me interest.'

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,880
And did you?

196
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,920
She gave me a kiss in full payment.

197
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,480
Then she had the better bargain.

198
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
I wouldn't say that.

199
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,040
There you are, Mrs Hughes.
They said you were in here.

200
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,440
Might I have a word?
Of course. Shall we go to my room?

201
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,080
There's no reason Mr Carson
shouldn't hear it.

202
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
In fact, I think he probably should.

203
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,440
You see, I've had a request from Sir
Richard that you ought to know about.

204
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
You've done this before.

205
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Bates, can I ask you something?

206
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,080
If I started to feel a tingling
in my legs,

207
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,680
what do you think that might mean?

208
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,680
Have you told Dr Clarkson?

209
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Yes, he says it's an illusion.

210
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,560
Memory of a tingling or something.

211
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,080
But, I mean,
I do know my back is broken.

212
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,520
I understand that I won't recover,
but...

213
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,640
I do keep feeling it.
Or I think I do.

214
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,360
I should wait and see.

215
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,160
If something is changing,
it will make itself known.

216
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Now will that be all?
Yes, thank you.

217
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Bates...

218
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Please don't tell anyone.

219
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,560
I couldn't bear it if Miss Swire
or mother or...

220
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,760
or anyone started to hope.

221
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,840
I won't say a thing.

222
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Good night, sir.

223
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Morning.

224
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,840
Morning.

225
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,200
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I must be out of my mind.

226
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,680
Because you know it's my last chance.
That's true. They won't be back.

227
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,000
Not after this trip.
So what should I do?

228
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,320
Come to the house. But stay outside
in the game larder.

229
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,200
I'll leave some food there
and a blanket,

230
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,200
and then I'll try and find a moment
alone with Mrs Bryant

231
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,600
and tell her about little Charlie.

232
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,240
And then, if she asks -
only if she asks, mind you...

233
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,520
I'll bring her out to see the child.
What about him?

234
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,360
If either of them are in the least
interested, it'll be the mother.

235
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,240
And do you think she'll help me?
She might.

236
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,600
Suppose she won't see him.

237
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,000
Then you're no worse off than you
are already.

238
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,720
Look, I shouldn't be doing it.
So if you're not keen,

239
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,880
then for heaven's sake
let's forget all about it. No...

240
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I'll be there. I promise.

241
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,200
Doesn't it feel odd
to have the rooms back?

242
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
And only us to sit in them.

243
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,200
I suppose we'll get used to it.
I don't want to get used to it.

244
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
What do you mean?

245
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,680
I know what it is to work now.

246
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,520
To have a full day.
To be tired in a good way.

247
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,760
I don't want to start dress fittings
or paying calls,

248
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,600
or standing behind the guns.
But how does one escape all that?

249
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,640
I think I've found a way to escape.
Nothing too drastic, I hope.

250
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,000
It is drastic. There's no going back
once I've done it.

251
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,600
But that's what I want.
No going back.

252
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
I don't want to go back, either.

253
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Then don't.

254
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,200
You're far nicer than you were before
the war, you know.

255
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,080
Where did you get it all?
I told you. This bloke from Leeds.

256
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,440
Where did he get it?

257
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,040
Some's army surplus,
some's from America.

258
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,000
And Ireland. Everywhere.

259
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,960
He's got contacts all over.
That's what I'm paying him for.

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
How much have you paid him?
A lot.

261
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,720
But I'm not worried.
I've taken nothing perishable.

262
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,720
This lot will last for months.

263
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,480
I'll be sold out
long before any of it's gone off.

264
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Starting with Mrs Patmore.

265
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,440
But Carson if you're abandoning me,

266
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,520
I think I deserve to know
the reason why.

267
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,120
I do not believe that Sir Richard
and I would work well together.

268
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,240
But there must be more to it
than that.

269
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,040
You knew what Sir Richard was like.

270
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,880
We were to educate him, together,
you and I. Wasn't that the plan?

271
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,000
Sir Richard offered Anna
a sum of money

272
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,320
to report your activities to him.

273
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,880
Whom you saw, what you said.

274
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
He wanted her to spy on me?
Naturally he used a different word.

275
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Naturally.

276
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,240
And she refused?

277
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,560
She refused and she reported the
offer to Mrs Hughes and me.

278
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,640
Well, I wish she'd come to me first.

279
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,080
So you mean you'd be uncomfortable?

280
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,800
Working for a spymaster?

281
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
How disappointing of you.

282
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,160
And I always thought
you were fond of me.

283
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,720
There you are.

284
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,240
What about a quick walk before
dinner? We ought to change first.

285
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Will that be all, my lady?
Yes, Carson. Thank you.

286
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I think that WILL be all.

287
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,400
Carson has decided not to come with
us to Haxby.

288
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,520
I'm sorry. Is there anything I
can say to change your mind?

289
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I'm afraid not, sir.

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
What a shame.

291
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,520
Not really.
Butlers will be two a penny

292
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
now they're all back from the war.

293
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,440
I gather Carson was looking for me.

294
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,160
Shall I go and find him, m'lord?

295
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,200
It's all right. Tell him I'll be
in the dressing room.

296
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,200
Has he done the red wine, yet?
It's over here, m'lord.

297
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,320
I'm pleased. It's a new one on me.

298
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,800
I had some at a dinner in London
and ordered it.

299
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,480
Carson thought we might try it
tonight.

300
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Well, I'd better go up.

301
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,640
You made me sad yesterday.
Wondering what the war was for.

302
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Don't listen to me.

303
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm a foolish man who's lost his way

304
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,760
and don't quite know
how to find it again.

305
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I'm terribly sorry.

306
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,320
Please try to forgive me.

307
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
I do forgive you.

308
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,080
Mr Carson.

309
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,920
His lordship said you were looking
for him.

310
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,000
And?

311
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,520
And well, I was to say that you'd
find him in the dressing room.

312
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,280
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

313
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,100
I wrestled with it, m'lord,
I don't mind admitting.

314
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,660
And I wanted to be there
to help Lady Mary, and...

315
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,980
And protect her from Sir Richard.

316
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:05,380
Well, I wouldn't quite have put it
like that, but yes, I suppose.

317
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,700
Only... Only you felt
you couldn't work for a man

318
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,780
who would offer a bribe?
That is correct, m'lord.

319
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,980
Are you quite sure you
won't regret it?

320
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,940
I know how fond you are of
Lady Mary.

321
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,940
But I couldn't work for a man
that I don't respect.

322
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,340
And I certainly couldn't have left
Downton for him.

323
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,620
I shall take that as a compliment.
For myself and for my house.

324
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,220
I still don't see
why you didn't tell me first.

325
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,620
I'm sorry, m'lady, but I didn't want
to add to your troubles.

326
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,460
Well, you have done,
whether you wanted to or not.

327
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,900
Nobody's down yet.
They won't be long.

328
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,620
Look. They've cleared the tea
but forgotten to take that tray.

329
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,100
Ring the bell. I'll do it. They'll be
busy getting dinner ready.

330
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,740
It's too heavy for you.
No, it's not. Look out!

331
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,780
Heavens, that was a near thing.

332
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
My God...

333
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,060
Mary! Girls!

334
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,700
Cora! Come at once!
Robert wait.

335
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,980
Everyone come at once.
What is it? What's happened?

336
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Come and see this.

337
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,940
Is it true?
Is it true what Lavinia says?

338
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,980
I don't believe it!
It's so wonderful.

339
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,900
It is, but don't tire yourself out.

340
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,540
Sit down now and we'll send for
Dr Clarkson.

341
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,660
She's right. Edith, go with Branson.

342
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,220
Get Clarkson, but fetch Mama
and Cousin Isobel as well.

343
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,180
I don't care what they're doing.
Tell them to come now!

344
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,140
My dear chap.

345
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,540
I cannot begin to tell you what this
means to me.

346
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,060
It's pretty good news for me, too.

347
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,820
There is only one possible
explanation.

348
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
It starts with my own mistake.

349
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,100
Every indication told me
that the spine was transected,

350
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,060
which would have been incurable.

351
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,540
But when Sir John Coates came to see
Matthew, he agreed with you.

352
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,100
Well, he didn't. Not entirely.

353
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,180
He thought that it could conceivably
be a case of spinal shock.

354
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,980
That is, um, intense bruising.

355
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,100
Which was sufficiently severe
to impede the leg mechanism.

356
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,140
But which would heal?

357
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,140
Why didn't you tell us?

358
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Because I didn't agree with him...

359
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,180
and I didn't want to raise Captain
Crawley's hopes to no purpose.

360
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,020
I understand and I don't blame you.

361
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,060
You must take it slowly.
Rome wasn't built in a day. I know.

362
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,300
And I'm afraid you will carry a bruise
on your spine for the rest of your life.

363
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,100
But I will have a life?
Yes.

364
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,560
I think we can say that.
You will have a

365
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,820
normal life and it won't
be long in coming.

366
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,220
My darling boy.

367
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
My darling boy.

368
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,420
Excuse me, m'lord,
but Mrs Hughes is

369
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:08,540
wondering what she
should do about dinner.

370
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,780
You'll all stay for dinner,
won't you?

371
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,980
I'm afraid I'm not dressed. Never
mind that. Who cares about that?

372
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,220
What about you, Mama?
Certainly.

373
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,820
All this unbridled joy has given me
quite an appetite.

374
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,860
There you are. I wondered what had
happened to you.

375
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,980
It's wonderful news, isn't it?
Wonderful. Are you busy?

376
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm just going up to help in the
dining room. Why? It'll keep.

377
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,460
No. Tell me. I've got time.

378
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,620
It's just something his lordship said
recently, I can't get out of my mind.

379
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,620
How Vera must have bought the poison
and taken it home with her.

380
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,580
Yes. I suppose she must.

381
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,580
And it's... a terrible thing
to think of.

382
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
But she didn't. I did.

383
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,660
What?
Months ago, before I left.

384
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,380
Vera said we needed rat poison
and I bought it.

385
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,740
It was Arsenic. I've been thinking
that's what she must have taken.

386
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,060
Have you told the police?
No. Tell them.

387
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,660
If you don't and they find out,
it'll look bad.

388
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,220
But wouldn't I be asking for
trouble? You are if you stay silent.

389
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,940
Anna, we're starting.
Sorry, Mr Carson.

390
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,580
Tell me, how are things progressing
at Haxby?

391
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,380
Quite well. I've put in a condition

392
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,220
so the builders are fined for every
day they go over.

393
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,420
Does that make for a happy
atmosphere? I want it done.

394
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
They can be happy in their own time.

395
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,340
Why the rush?

396
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,220
I like everything I own to be
finished and ready to sell.

397
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,460
You're not thinking of selling
Haxby, surely?

398
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,700
Depends. We'll have to see if it
suits us, to be so close to Downton.

399
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,260
I... I want to tell you all
something.

400
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,980
As you know, during this... well,
I think I can say horrible time...

401
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,860
Lavinia has proved to be
the most marvellous person.

402
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
Hear, hear.
Indeed.

403
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,700
I never thought we would marry,
for all sorts of reasons,

404
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,860
but she wouldn't accept that
and so now I am very pleased to say

405
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
that she's been proved right.

406
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Lavinia and I will get married.
My dear fellow.

407
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,540
Isn't it wonderful? As soon as I'm
well enough to walk down the aisle.

408
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,300
Dr Clarkson can help us with when.
Not long now.

409
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,580
And she feels we ought to marry here,
at Downton.

410
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,340
To bury forever the memories of what
I hope has been

411
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
the darkest period of my life.

412
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,180
- Of course!
- Are you sure?

413
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,380
I know it should be at my home
in London,

414
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,300
but we've been through so much here.

415
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,940
We'd be delighted.
Bravo! Excellent news.

416
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,420
Mary, isn't that excellent news?

417
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,860
Just excellent.

418
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,340
You're very late. Won't they worry?

419
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,300
They're all so excited,
they won't care where I am.

420
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,300
I'm pleased. I like Mr Matthew.

421
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,820
He announced at dinner that
he wants to get married at Downton.

422
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,980
Somehow, it made me feel
more than ever

423
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,260
that the war is really over...
and it's time to move forward.

424
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,620
Do you mean you've made your
decision?

425
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,020
Yes.

426
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,460
My answer is...
that I'm ready to travel...

427
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,140
and you're my ticket.

428
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,780
To get away from this house,
away from this life.

429
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,380
Me?

430
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,380
No. Uncle Tom Cobley.

431
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,020
I'm sorry.

432
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,260
But I've waited so long
for those words,

433
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,620
I can't believe I'm hearing them.

434
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,460
You won't mind burning your bridges?
Mind?

435
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,620
Fetch me the matches!

436
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,980
Yes, you can kiss me, but that is
all until everything is settled.

437
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,980
For now, God knows it's enough
that I can kiss you.

438
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,980
What a day. I can't stop smiling.

439
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,020
No. But another time, please ask me
before you agree to host a wedding.

440
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,620
What?
I'm fond of Matthew, of course,

441
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,940
but you do realise this means
Mary's marriage will be delayed?

442
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,220
I can't help that.
Mary is our first priority, Robert.

443
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,340
And just because Matthew's been lame.

444
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,420
Matthew's been lame?!

445
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,500
Can you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

446
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,940
Can you hear how stupid
and selfish they are?

447
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Because I can.

448
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,800
Don't bother me with it now.

449
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,080
I've enough on, trying to make a
luncheon that looks worth eating.

450
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,240
But that's what I'm saying.
Everything's in short supply now.

451
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,040
Short supply? No supply, more like!

452
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,160
Talk about making a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

453
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,880
I wish we had a sow's ear!
It'd be better than this brisket.

454
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,440
That's just it. Thomas has come by
some groceries and such

455
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,360
and he's prepared to let them go
for the right price.

456
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
He's prepared to let them go,
is he?

457
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,520
And how did he come by them?
That's what I'd like to know.

458
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,120
Well, they're not stolen,
in case you're worried.

459
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm not worried.
You're the one who should be worried.

460
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,040
Tell you what. I'm making
a wedding cake now, for Mr Crawley.

461
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,600
I'll finish it early
and feed it with brandy.

462
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,440
So if I give you a list of
ingredients, can you get them?

463
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
I can.
And then we'll see.

464
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,920
Now will you leave me and let me
get on with this travesty?

465
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Why are you here?

466
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,600
Mr Bryant, Mrs Bryant, welcome.

467
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,560
We're so pleased to be here.

468
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,040
This is so kind of you,
Lady Grantham.

469
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,760
It is, but we ought to make it clear
we can't stay long.

470
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,040
I wasn't sure we had time to come
at all.

471
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,920
Luncheon is quite ready.

472
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,880
We must eat and run, I'm afraid.
We have to be at Maryport by six.

473
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,960
We're all so terribly sorry about
the reason you're here.

474
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,320
If we could see Charles's room.
Shall I take Mrs Bryant up?

475
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,760
No, I'll do it.
We'll all do it.

476
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
My cousin, Mrs Crawley,
who looked after Major Bryant,

477
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,920
and my daughters who nursed him,
will join us. How thoughtful.

478
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,320
But we can't be long. I've told our
chauffeur to stay in the car.

479
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,880
Will I take him something to eat?
Leave him be. He's quite happy.

480
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,600
Please, come and see where Major
Bryant lived while he was with us.

481
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,960
I'm afraid it's not going to work.
Why?

482
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,020
They're in the dining
room and getting

483
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:10,040
straight into the car
when they've finished.

484
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,680
I tried to speak to her on my own but
there was never the right moment.

485
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,160
Your grandaddy is a bit of a bully.

486
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,520
But I must see them.
I've come all this way.

487
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Of course it's a disappointment.

488
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,440
You said yourself there wouldn't be
another chance. We can't know that.

489
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
Maybe you should write to them
after all.

490
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,080
You've nothing to lose. No. They have
to see him. They must see Charlie.

491
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,960
Well, maybe they will...
sometime in the future.

492
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
I hope so.

493
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You'd better go now.

494
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,320
This wedding cake... Can I make it?

495
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,600
You wouldn't know how to start.

496
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,520
But you can tell me.

497
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,720
And if I make it early, then you can
make another if it's no good.

498
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,600
If I say yes,
will you do as you're told?

499
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,240
Daisy, there's a wretched chauffeur
at the front

500
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
who's not allowed
to get out of the car,

501
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,160
so can you make him a sandwich and
take him up a bottle of pop?

502
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
We've some ham and...
My God.

503
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,760
Who was that?
Wasn't that Ethel?

504
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,040
Did you see what she was carrying?
No.

505
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,680
Then just... let's leave it at that.

506
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm afraid Downton will be
a place of pilgrimage for a while.

507
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,080
We're glad to be. If we can help
to bring some peace of mind.

508
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,080
There's no point in wallowing in it.
What good does it do?

509
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Leave me alone.
Ethel!

510
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,320
I tried to stop her.
What on earth?

511
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,000
Ethel... I know what this is.

512
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,200
Mrs Hughes, I don't think
it's quite the right - I'm stopping.

513
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Until I've had my say.

514
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,640
This is Charlie. Your grandson.

515
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,560
He's almost a year old.

516
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
What proof have you?

517
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,720
What?
I say, what proof have you?

518
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,480
If my son was the father of this boy,
where is your proof?

519
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
Have you any letters?
Any signed statement?

520
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,040
Why would there be letters?
We were in the same house.

521
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,480
I think she's telling the truth.
I'm not interested in 'think'.

522
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,320
I want proof that my son
acknowledged paternity of this boy.

523
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,960
If what you say is true,
then he would have known

524
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,560
of the boy's existence
for months before he...

525
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
before he was killed.

526
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,560
Yes. He knew.

527
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,040
So... What did he do about it?

528
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Nothing.

529
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,040
He did nothing.
Thank you.

530
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,320
That's the proof I was looking for.

531
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,400
If Charles was the
father, he would never

532
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:43,440
have shirked his responsibilities.
Never.

533
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,720
Well, he did.
I won't listen to any more slander!

534
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Now will you please go, and take
that boy with you, whoever he is.

535
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,040
You are upsetting Mrs Bryant.
I would like...

536
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,800
I say you are upsetting Mrs Bryant.

537
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,680
Lord Grantham, are you going to stand
by while this woman holds us to ransom?

538
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,960
This isn't doing much good.
Ethel, you'd better come with me.

539
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Come on.

540
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
She thinks we're a soft touch.

541
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,720
They hear of a dead officer with
money behind them

542
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,920
and suddenly there's a baby
on every corner.

543
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
But if she's telling the truth...

544
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,560
If Charles had fathered that boy,
he would have told us.

545
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,320
Now, I'd say she's done her homework
and discovered he was an only child.

546
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,440
She thinks we'd be ripe
for the plucking.

547
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,680
You knew her. Was she one of the
nurses when he was here?

548
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
She was a housemaid.

549
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,320
Were you aware?
No.

550
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,000
No-one told me Major Bryant
was your only son.

551
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,680
That's right. Just Charles.

552
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,880
Matthew is my only son,
and he nearly died.

553
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,200
I think I know what you're going
through. He seems such a nice...

554
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,980
I think that's cast rather a
shadow over the proceedings,

555
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:02,720
so I don't see any point
in prolonging it.

556
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Daphne, come on, we're leaving.

557
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,680
He's afraid of his own grief.
That's why he behaves as he does.

558
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,000
He's terrified of his own grief.

559
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,960
If that's what he's like, I don't
want his help. I don't want it.

560
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,720
I doubt you'll have the option.
You're a dark horse.

561
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,600
How did you keep it a secret
all this time?

562
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,840
Maybe when he's thought about it he'll
feel differently, you never know.

563
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,800
Anna... will you kindly go upstairs
and help in the dining room?

564
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,600
Ethel, please take the child
and leave.

565
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,040
How did you get here? I caught the
bus and walked up from the village.

566
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,720
Then can you reverse the process
as quickly as possible?

567
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,080
She's very badly shaken, Mr Carson.
She's lost everything.

568
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,720
Are you all right for the fare?
Yes, thank you.

569
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,400
He's their only grandchild.
There can never be another.

570
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,960
Even if Ethel is telling the truth.
I believe she is.

571
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,200
Even so, there's no legal reality
to it.

572
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,040
The child is her bastard
and has no claim on them.

573
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,360
Steady on, sir. The ladies have had
enough shocks for one day.

574
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,120
I just don't see the point in pretending
something can be done when it can't.

575
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,800
What about you, Mother? Can't one of
your refugee charities help?

576
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,560
She's not a refugee and we have more
claims on our funding than we can meet.

577
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,040
The truth is, Ethel's made her choice
and now she's stuck with it.

578
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,520
That seems a little hard.
Does it?

579
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,120
Aren't all of us stuck with
the choices we make?

580
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,320
Candied peel? Well, well. I never
thought you'd find that.

581
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,640
I hope you're pleased, Mrs Patmore.

582
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,720
Course she is. Aren't you?
There's stuff

583
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,760
here we haven't seen
since before the war.

584
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
I can't wait to get started.

585
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,600
I won't ask where you got it from,
because I don't want to know.

586
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,000
I keep saying. There's nothing
wrong. So what I'd like to know is...

587
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,880
When will he get paid?
When I'm satisfied.

588
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,800
And when will that be, oh mighty one?

589
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,960
When Daisy's baked the cake
and I'm pleased with it.

590
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,360
He understands.

591
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
He knows this is just the sprat
to catch the mackerel.

592
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,200
I really ought to walk
to the library.

593
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,440
No need to rush it, sir.
You're getting better every day.

594
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,080
Cousin, Matthew? May I come in?
Please.

595
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,080
No, no, no. No stay where you are.
Thank you.

596
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,280
No doubt you will regard this as
rather unorthodox,

597
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,080
my pushing into a man's bedroom,
uninvited.

598
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,680
Well, erm... It's just I don't
want us to be disturbed.

599
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,960
I'm sure you know how pleased I am
that you will recover, after all.

600
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,040
Thank you.

601
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,960
Just as I am delighted that you can
once more look forward to a...

602
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
to a happy married life.

603
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm very lucky.

604
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,880
Now this may come as a surprise...

605
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,760
but I feel I must say it
all the same. Please do.

606
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,200
Mary is still in love with you.
What?

607
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,280
I was watching her the other night
when you spoke of your wedding.

608
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,960
She looked like...
Juliet, on awakening in the tomb.

609
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,280
Mary and I have always had -
Of course, I suspected long ago

610
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,920
that the flame hadn't quite gone out,

611
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,880
but then there was no chance
of your recovery.

612
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,120
And it seemed best to let her try
for happiness where she could.

613
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,440
I quite agree, and Sir Richard is...

614
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,680
No, now, let's not muddy the pool
by discussing Sir Richard.

615
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,280
The point is, you loved her once.

616
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,760
Are you sure you can't love her
again?

617
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Cousin Violet...

618
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,960
Please don't think I mind your...
speaking to me in this way.

619
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,280
I quite admire it but...
consider this.

620
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Lavinia came back against
my orders, determined

621
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:17,200
to look after me for
the rest of my life,

622
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,040
which meant that she would wash me
and feed me and...

623
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,040
do things that only the most
dedicated nurse would undertake.

624
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,000
And all with no hope of children
or any improvement.

625
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,720
Yes, it's all very admirable...
and I give her full credit.

626
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,080
And giving her that credit, do you
think it would be right for me

627
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,640
to throw her over
because I can walk?

628
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,760
To dismiss her, because I no longer
have need of her services?

629
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,120
Spoken like a man of honour.

630
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,920
And we will not fall out over this.

631
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
But you don't agree.

632
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
I would just say one thing:

633
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,280
Marriage is a long business.

634
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,800
There's no getting out of it
for our kind of people.

635
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,440
Now you may live 40... 50 years
with one of these two women.

636
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,040
Just make sure you have selected
the right one.

637
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,120
Will it be April or May?

638
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,800
I should steer clear of May.
Marry in May, rue the day.

639
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,880
I think it's April. Matthew should
be walking normally by them.

640
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,320
Spring weddings are the prettiest
of all.

641
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,800
All this talk of weddings
is making me impatient.

642
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,920
I don't think we can go into competition
with Matthew and Lavinia, do you?

643
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,440
After then. In the summer. Let's
settle it before I return to London.

644
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,400
You must be looking forward to
travelling again.

645
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
I know I am.

646
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
Very well. The end of July.

647
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,480
Then we can be out of England
for August.

648
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,560
You don't sound very excited.

649
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,040
To quote you 'that's not who we are.'

650
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,240
There's something I've been meaning
to ask you. Here's the hero.

651
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,720
Here we are.

652
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Why did you try to bribe Anna?

653
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,240
She told you, did she?
She didn't. Not me.

654
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
But why did you do it?

655
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,120
Next time, if you want to know
anything, just ask me.

656
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Well done.
Very well done.

657
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,020
All right then I will.
Once and for all, are

658
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:35,360
you still in love
with Matthew Crawley?

659
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
Of course not!

660
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,240
Would I ever admit to loving a man
who preferred someone else over me?

661
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,560
Where's Sybil?
She's not feeling well.

662
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,400
She told Anna she wouldn't be down
for dinner.

663
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,160
What is it?
I heard from my lawyer today.

664
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,160
Apparently, Vera wrote to a friend
just before my last visit.

665
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,520
Why are they telling you now? It was
only delivered a few days ago.

666
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,200
And do you know what the letter
says? They sent me a copy.

667
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,720
'John has written and he's coming
here tonight.

668
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,320
His words sound as angry as
I've ever heard him,

669
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
and you know how angry that is.

670
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,600
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm afraid for my life.'

671
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
What did you write to her?

672
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,480
I said I was coming that evening and
I meant to have it out with her.

673
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,720
I may have said she was being
unreasonable, but so she was.

674
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,720
Will it change anything?
Think about it.

675
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,320
Before Vera's death,
she had taken all my money

676
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,240
and she had wrecked the divorce.
Now, as her widower,

677
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,360
I inherit everything and we can marry
whenever we like.

678
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Anna, they're going in.

679
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,240
You look as if you've got the cares
of the world on your shoulders.

680
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,280
Not the whole world, Mrs Hughes,
but quite enough of it.

681
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Sybil?

682
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Sybil I just want to say goodnight.

683
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,840
Mrs Hughes, can I borrow the
duplicate keys for upstairs?

684
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,280
Why? Lady Mary says one of the
bathroom keys isn't working.

685
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,280
She thinks it must have got swapped.

686
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,720
I'll come.

687
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,160
No, no there's no need.
I'll bring them back in a jiffy.

688
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
You've done enough for one day.

689
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,720
My God. She's eloped.

690
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,120
She's on her way to Gretna Green.

691
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,960
They must stop at some point.
It won't be open before morning.

692
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,320
They won't expect us to
follow until tomorrow.

693
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,640
They'll stay somewhere on the road.
We hope.

694
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,880
Everyone keep an eye out
for the motor.

695
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,080
Daisy? What in God's name are you
doing down here at this hour?

696
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,280
I just wanted to check
it were all right.

697
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,320
That it hadn't, you know,
caved in or anything. Caved in?

698
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,880
It's a cake, not a souffle.

699
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,520
I know. But I've never made
a wedding cake before.

700
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,680
Is that the one for tasting?
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

701
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,920
Well, bring it out.
We'll give it a try.

702
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,920
What in God's name
do you call this?

703
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,800
I don't know. I did everything
that you said. I promise.

704
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,840
But didn't you taste the mixture?

705
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,520
Well, then I'm afraid it's time
to look at Thomas's ingredients.

706
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,400
Well, it's two thirds plaster dust.
Where's the peel?

707
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,840
Yuk! This were old
when Adam were a boy.

708
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,840
So, Thomas was happy to 'let it go',
was he?

709
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,680
Well, it won't go anywhere near me
in future!

710
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,040
Chuck the whole bally lot out
and we'll have to think again.

711
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Isn't that the car?

712
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,840
How did you find us?
How did you know?

713
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,560
Never mind that. At least nothing's
happened, thank God.

714
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,560
What do you mean nothing's happened?

715
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,840
I've decided to marry Tom and your
coming after me won't change that.

716
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,840
This isn't the way.
She's right.

717
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,400
Of course Mama and Papa will hate it.
Why should they?

718
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,320
Pipe down.

719
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,920
Sybil, can't you let them
get used to the idea?

720
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,960
Take your stand and refuse to budge,
but allow them time.

721
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,280
That way, you won't have to break up
the family.

722
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,200
They would never give permission.
You don't need permission. You're 21.

723
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,520
But you do need their
forgiveness if you're not

724
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:00,800
to start your new life
under a black shadow.

725
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,920
Don't listen. She's pretending
to be reasonable to get you home.

726
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,040
Even if I am,
even if I think this is mad,

727
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,680
I know it will be better to do it
in broad daylight

728
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,280
than to sneak off
like a thief in the night.

729
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,640
Go back with them, then.

730
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,400
If you think they can make you
happier than I will.

731
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,380
Am I so weak you believe
I can be talked out

732
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,680
of giving my heart in
five minutes flat?

733
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,240
But Mary's right. I don't like deceit
and our parents don't deserve it.

734
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,760
So I'll go back with them.

735
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,320
Believe it or not,
I will stay true to you.

736
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
I'll return the car in the morning.

737
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,320
You're confident you can bring her
round, aren't you? Fairly.

738
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,360
I'll certainly try.

739
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Do you want some money? For the room?

740
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,080
No thank you, m'lady.
I can pay my own way.

741
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Where are the girls?

742
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,440
I suppose Sybil's still ill and
the others just haven't appeared.

743
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,800
I hope they're not coming down
with anything.

744
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,400
The stories of this Spanish 'flu
are too awful.

745
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,360
No, it's nothing of the sort.
Why are you up so early?

746
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,320
I'm meeting Isobel. She wants me to
help with her refugees.

747
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,600
I thought the whole
point of Mama arranging

748
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,840
that was to keep her out of your hair.
I know.

749
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,240
But now the soldiers have
gone, I do have a lot

750
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,600
of time on my hands and
maybe I can be useful.

751
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,480
Why is it different from before the
war?

752
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,880
I don't know exactly. It just is.

753
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Maybe the war's changed me.

754
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,320
I guess it's changed everybody.

755
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,280
Not me.
Don't be too sure.

756
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,000
If I'm not back before luncheon,
don't wait.

757
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,240
I'll take this down to keep it hot,
m'lord.

758
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
I wanted to catch you alone.

759
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,440
Yes... You see, I think you might be
happier if I tended my resignation.

760
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,920
What? I'd hate you to be
uncomfortable in your own house...

761
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,360
I won't hear of it.
But I know...

762
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,460
You will not be deprived
of your livelihood

763
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:03,520
because I behaved in an
ungentlemanly manner.

764
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,680
The fault was entirely mine.
You will not pay the price.

765
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,160
Is this yours? Moseley found it
in your dressing room.

766
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,440
It's not one of your old toys, is it?
Because I don't recognise it.

767
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,800
No. It was given to me. As a charm,
I think. To take to the front.

768
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,960
Well, you're home and safe now.

769
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Shall I put it in the barrel
for the village children? No.

770
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,800
You never know.
It might be bad luck not to keep it.

771
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Luncheon will be ready soon.

772
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,840
It's all rubbish.
It's all bloody rubbish!

773
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,760
Can't you ask for your money back?

774
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,920
Yes. Of course I can ask.
And a fat lot of good that'll do!

775
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,840
You must challenge him.
How?

776
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,200
I only ever met him in a pub.
I wouldn't know where to find him.

777
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,560
But surely -
Don't you understand, woman?!

778
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,120
I've been tricked!

779
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,920
I've been had!

780
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,200
I've been taken for the fool
that I am!

781
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
How much did he get from you?

782
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,120
Every penny I had.

783
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,840
And then some.

784
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,880
What are you going to do now?

785
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,600
I don't know.

786
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,880
I don't bloody know.

787
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,880
And all the time you've been driving
me about,

788
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,800
bowing and scraping and seducing
my daughter behind my back.

789
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,200
You know Cousin Violet came to me...
and told me to marry you?

790
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,120
Mr Carson, whatever's the matter?

791
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,640
I wish you knew much I want to help.
Do you?

792
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,280
Let's get down to business.

793
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,920
Find out what we mean to do for
Charlie in the future.

794
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,560
I did something once which
I bitterly regret. Bitterly.

795
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Everything's going to be all right.

796
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Everything is clearly not all right.

797
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
