1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,540
You mustn't make him wait forever.

2
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,680
I love him.

3
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,800
I'd accept him in a trice if it
weren't for Marigold.

4
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,970
You say he'll let you keep her.

5
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,160
- That's not the problem. - What is?

6
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,330
If I stay silent,

7
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,680
there's a lie at the heart of my marriage.

8
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,960
But if I tell him the truth, will I ruin it?

9
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,240
Edith,

10
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,680
you're a grown woman and I can't force you.

11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,705
But you cannot be married to a man

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,565
and leave him out of a secret like this.

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,390
It's not possible and you won't be happy.

14
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,040
How happy am I now?

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,260
Mrs Patmore, you are the owner of
No. 3, Orchard Lane,

16
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:37,410
Haughton-le-Skerne.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,935
I am. I'm running it as a
bed-and-breakfast place.

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,200
Among your guests, was a certain
Doctor Fletcher and his wife?

19
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:45,120
Yes, they were my first.

20
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,090
Very courteous and respectable, I must say.

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,555
Not as respectable as you think.

22
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,975
Dr Fletcher was a Mr Ian McKidd

23
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,925
- and his 'wife' a Mrs Dorrit.
- What?

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,140
Mr Dorrit is now suing Mr McKidd for damages

25
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,695
related to adultery.

26
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,900
You may be called upon to testify.

27
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,210
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,790
There is some concern Haughton-le-Skerne
will be in the news,

29
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,490
as a site of a house of ill repute.

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,505
A house of ill repute?

31
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,150
I'm afraid the rumour mill
has already begun...

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,760
but there's a chance that Dorrit
may settle out of court.

33
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,670
- I'll keep you informed.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,925
Hello. What brings you here?

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,670
Oh, Mrs Patmore's the one to ask.

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,520
A house of ill repute?

37
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,070
Mama is swanning around the South of France

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,635
without a word to any of us.

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,530
- I wish Cora -
- I won't hear a word against Cora.

40
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:54,390
- Mama is being impossible.
- I was going to say,

41
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,082
"I wish Cora wouldn't take it to heart. "

42
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:59,740
Mama has exhausted my patience this time.

43
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,610
But she did give you Teo.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,700
True. I forgive her everything.

45
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,790
Do you think he will marry Edith?

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,220
If he learns about Marigold?

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,460
I just don't want her to be hurt.

48
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,220
- Is that it, then?
- Yes, let's go.

49
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,210
Isn't Bertie's employer always in Tangiers?

50
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,850
Can you buy one?

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,950
Thank you.

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,890
The 6th Marquess of Hexham, 39, has died

53
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,355
on holiday in Tangiers

54
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,985
where he was a frequent visitor.

55
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,870
The cause is given as Malaria.
Lord Hexham was unmarried.

56
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,010
Does this mean Bertie's out of a job?

57
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,500
That depends on the heir.

58
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,160
Poor Edith. It was bad enough
he was an agent.

59
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,090
Now he may not be that.

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,190
Don't sound so gleeful about it.

61
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,840
You should have seen her face.

62
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,630
It wasn't very funny for Mrs Patmore.

63
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:18,100
No. And I'm not laughing, but -

64
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:20,140
But, you're laughing.

65
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,750
How many classes will you be
taking every week?

66
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,365
Five to start with.

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,140
Only afternoons between half-two
and half-four.

68
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,100
What does Mr Carson say?

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,300
I haven't asked him yet.

70
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,950
Don't ask him, tell him.

71
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,810
But suppose it doesn't work out?
Suppose I'm no good?

72
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,510
Of course I didn't know they'd invited you.

73
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:46,355
I would have mentioned it.

74
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,515
Nobody has been as rude to me as your son.

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,645
Why in God's name would he
want me at his wedding?

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,700
- Well, isn't it a good sign?
- I'm not sure what it's a sign of.

77
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:55,110
Amelia's influence.

78
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,140
Yes. I think I agree.

79
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,320
She is a very kind and gentle soul.

80
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,440
Is she? Is she, indeed?

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,685
Don't you think so?

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
To be honest, I don't know her.

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,380
It was all I could do not to
burst out laughing. Poor thing.

84
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,857
Is it funny? Suppose someone
makes a connection

85
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:20,300
between Mrs Patmore and her place
at Downton Abbey?

86
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:21,745
I'm sure they won't.

87
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,805
We should PRAY they don't.

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,800
I don't want this story repeated upstairs.

89
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:29,310
I'm not going to tell them.

90
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,220
Oh, that's the first proper laugh
I've had for ages.

91
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,910
- I couldn't resist telling you.
- Poor Mrs Patmore.

92
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:42,380
Oh, I know. It's awful for her.

93
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,980
I'm going to have to think of something
serious when I go down.

94
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,420
I had some rather sad news
when we were in Thirsk.

95
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,230
Lord Hexham's died.

96
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,070
- Who's that, M'Lady?
- The owner of Brancaster Castle,

97
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,547
where we all stayed last year.
For the grouse.

98
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:00,990
Not me, M'Lady. I was... otherwise detained.

99
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,300
Oh, of course you were. I am sorry.

100
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,500
Only it might affect Lady Edith's friend,

101
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:07,585
Mr Pelham.

102
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,715
He's the agent there. Or was.

103
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,630
He might be out of a job.

104
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:13,510
How worrying for them.

105
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,910
So my romance might not be the only one
to come to an untimely end.

106
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,580
Have you heard from Mr Talbot?

107
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,905
No. But that's a good thing.

108
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,540
- It means he's accepted my decision.
- Which is what you want?

109
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,750
Which is exactly what I want.

110
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,350
Oh, I just can't get the phrase
out of my head.

111
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:34,300
It just goes round and round.

112
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,115
A house of ill repute.

113
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,660
Yes, I know what it is, thank you!

114
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:40,355
Yes, I see.

115
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,510
Ah, Mr Dawes has got some news for you.

116
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,850
Do I want to know?

117
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,900
Read it for yourself.

118
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,300
You passed every paper with high marks.

119
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,440
Oh, Daisy. That's wonderful news.

120
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,895
Poor Mr Pelham.

121
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,995
First that terrible day at the racetrack,

122
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,000
- and then to hear his cousin's died.
- It does seem very hard.

123
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,050
- Did you get hold of him?
- Yes.

124
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,540
He's coming tomorrow, on the first leg
of his trip to Tangiers.

125
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:13,290
- I've asked him here.
- Good.

126
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,530
- How is he?
- Sad.

127
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,440
He loved his cousin,
and it was all so quick.

128
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:21,140
The trouble is they've already buried him

129
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,925
and Bertie's not sure what to do.

130
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,120
It's ordinary in hot countries.
It won't mean any disrespect.

131
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:29,405
No, but, should they leave him there?

132
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Surely the decision is down to the
new Marquess not to Bertie.

133
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,380
Well, that's the thing.

134
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,220
He is the new Marquess... Bertie.

135
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,460
Bertie Pelham is now the Marquess of Hexham?

136
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,780
Yes.

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,010
Nonsense. He's having you on.

138
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,445
He'd have told you if he was the heir.

139
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,330
He did tell me. But his cousin
was in his 30s

140
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:57,180
and they all knew the girl
he was going to marry.

141
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:58,610
But that's absurd!

142
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,185
If Bertie's a marquess, then Edith -

143
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,520
Edith would outrank us all.
Yes. That's right.

144
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,250
Was he a close relation?

145
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,875
Second cousin, once removed.

146
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,460
Nobody thought it was possible
he would inherit.

147
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,285
Least of all Bertie.

148
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,310
He seemed like a nice young man to me.

149
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:14,887
And getting nicer by the minute.

150
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:16,841
With a real love of Brancaster.

151
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,760
Golly gum drops! What a turn-up.

152
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,450
That's dinner.

153
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,270
If we're not too distracted to eat.

154
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,860
So we'll all bow and curtsy to Edith.

155
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,865
- You'll enjoy that, Mary?
- Hardly.

156
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,760
And if Bertie is Lord Hexham
which I still don't believe,

157
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,115
- he won't want to marry her now.
- Careful.

158
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,630
Or people will think you're jealous, dear.
We don't want that.

159
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,540
It's only a try-out, Mr Carson.

160
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:44,205
Every day you'd leave at two?

161
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,380
And I'd be back by five. So I could
serve dinner and luncheon.

162
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:50,427
- No lingering over the pudding.
- Mr Barrow is still here -

163
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,706
- Oh, don't we know it.
- But if lunch does go on a bit,

164
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,950
there's still Andrew and Mr Barrow
and you to see to it.

165
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,240
And what makes you think you'll be any good?

166
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,155
I don't know exactly. Perhaps because
I want it so much.

167
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,700
There are plenty of little boys who
want to be famous cricketers.

168
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:08,210
It's not enough to make them champions.

169
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:10,590
I just want to try, Mr Carson.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,610
And so you shall.

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,535
How terrible. Poor Mrs Patmore.

172
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,590
What an unlikely bawdy house madam.

173
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,010
Mrs Patmore's secret career.

174
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,020
We mustn't joke when Bertie's here.

175
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:32,050
We'll have long faces, don't worry.

176
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,150
- I had a call from Henry earlier.
- Henry?

177
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,670
Why didn't you say?

178
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,030
- I'm saying now.
- How is he?

179
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,040
Mourning Charlie Rogers.

180
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,650
Missing you.

181
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,190
You're not to ask him to come here.

182
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,375
Suppose he just turns up?

183
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,420
Don't encourage him, Tom. I mean it.

184
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:54,120
We'd be wretched long term.

185
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,510
And you're not wretched now?

186
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,350
- Mary thinks he'll throw me over.
- I don't see why.

187
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,835
It's surely very encouraging

188
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,795
he's coming here on his way to London.

189
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,600
Unless it's to break with me
so he can start afresh.

190
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,975
He's not bound.

191
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,640
I haven't accepted him.

192
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,120
Have you told him about Marigold?

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,835
Not yet.

194
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,935
Make a clean breast of it. Please.

195
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,000
You'll regret it if you don't.

196
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,960
With my luck, I'll regret it either way.

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,690
What are you doing?

198
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,670
Making time charts and setting some
tests for comprehension.

199
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,770
Tests? For the village children?

200
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,415
You're not expecting too much?

201
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,340
- Who wants cocoa?
- I think if you expect a lot, you get a lot.

202
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,440
No, thank you, Mrs Patmore.

203
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

204
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,920
How are you feeling?

205
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,070
I'm still shaken. I can't deny it.

206
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:04,685
Is your poor niece managing?

207
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,550
I'm going over to see her tomorrow.

208
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:07,970
I'll come with you.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,720
A genuine, copper-bottomed
marquess for Edith.

210
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:14,490
Who'd have thought it?

211
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,705
She hasn't accepted him so
he's not obligated.

212
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,400
He wouldn't be coming here
if he'd changed his mind.

213
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,150
If anyone had told me Mary would
hitch up with a mechanic

214
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:24,790
and Edith would marry one of the
grandest men in England,

215
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:25,955
I'd have knocked them down.

216
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,050
Mary has got rid of her mechanic

217
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,370
- and Edith is not married yet.
- I know.

218
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:33,020
But for poor old Edith

219
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,955
who couldn't make her dolls do
what she wanted,

220
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,880
- it is rather wonderful.
- There's still Marigold.

221
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:40,715
She hasn't told him yet and she must

222
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,610
if they're to have any chance of happiness.

223
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,405
I beg you, my darling,

224
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,540
please don't let things be spoiled
for her this time.

225
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,740
- That's all I ask.
- All.

226
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,840
I think the wood is right the way it is.

227
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,910
We don't need it any larger.

228
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,070
Mary, let me get him up here.

229
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,900
- There's no point. Nothing's changed.
- You've changed.

230
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,740
It's not as easy as that.

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,600
I find him very attractive.
I like him a lot.

232
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,080
'I find him very attractive. '
'I like him a lot. '

233
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:34,580
What a load of baloney!

234
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,340
If I'm in love with him,
then what's that?

235
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,115
A powerful urge that fades.

236
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,070
Did it fade for you and Matthew?

237
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,555
We weren't married long enough

238
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,870
- but I'm sure it would have done.
- I'm not.

239
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,860
Tom, look I don't mean to pull rank

240
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,357
but with people like us,

241
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,820
we need to marry sensibly.

242
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,110
Especially if we're going to inherit
the family show.

243
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,580
It's a way of life that isn't for everyone

244
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,325
and a bad marriage can poison it.

245
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,770
He's not an orangutan.
He knows how it works.

246
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,195
He wants different things.

247
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,150
What about you and Matthew?
You came from different poles.

248
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:11,670
Yes, but we were young and free.

249
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,270
- It's difficult the second time.
- Why?

250
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,255
Because you know what's at stake.
It's easier to get it wrong.

251
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,120
- I only see a real opportunity for you
to get it right. - Honestly?

252
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:24,590
- I'm always honest.
- Are you?

253
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,870
Why would you say that
for heaven's sake?

254
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,030
One word, Marigold.

255
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,880
It wasn't my secret to tell.

256
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,390
So, it is true. Well, I knew it was.

257
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,810
Never mind Marigold.
She won't make you happy.

258
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:41,825
Henry Talbot will.

259
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,070
Oh, Henry Talbot, Henry Talbot.

260
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,890
You're far more on his side
than you were on mine.

261
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,610
He's the one for you. Trust me
and give him a chance.

262
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,300
No. And if you want to redeem yourself
in my good graces,

263
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,440
you won't give him a chance either.

264
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,235
Where is everybody?

265
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,045
Mary and Tom are agenting

266
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,910
and Edith's gone to meet Bertie's train.

267
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,960
Are we going to talk about it?

268
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,955
Are we going to sit by

269
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,270
and let this young man's family and future

270
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,780
be put at risk from a scandal
we are hiding from him?

271
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,270
I don't think she has to tell everybody

272
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,105
but I agree.

273
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,450
She must tell him. Then it's his choice.

274
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:25,415
Isn't it up to Edith?

275
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,240
You say that because
after Tony Gillingham had gone,

276
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,685
you thought none of your daughters

277
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,740
would make a marriage worthy of the name.

278
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,210
And now there's a chance and you can't
bring yourself to give it up.

279
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:37,662
You haven't got children.
You don't understand these things.

280
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:41,080
No. I haven't had children, Robert,
as you so kindly remind me,

281
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,970
but I hope I do have a sense of decency.

282
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:44,697
How long are you planning to stay?

283
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:46,390
Your cold must have cleared up by now.

284
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:47,990
Don't fight.

285
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,030
Nothing's going to get better
by you two falling out.

286
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,805
Hello, Mr Pelham. I mean...

287
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,330
I'm going to stay Mr Pelham
until the service.

288
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,815
But I wish you'd call me Bertie anyway.

289
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,470
- What sort of service will it be?
- Not a funeral.

290
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:04,550
I've decided not to disturb him.

291
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,590
I'll fetch his things and
settle his debts and

292
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,110
have a service at home to say goodbye.

293
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,135
That sounds like a very good plan.

294
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,400
- I hope you'll allow me to come.
- I want you to come.

295
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:16,960
You remember my sister?

296
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,015
Of course. Lady Rosamund.

297
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,300
This must be a strange and
unsettling time for you.

298
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,540
I'll say.

299
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,895
My mother's cock-a-hoop,

300
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,230
but she doesn't appreciate that
I was devoted to Cousin Peter.

301
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:30,850
I'm sure she does.

302
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,710
Not really. Most people didn't get
the point of him.

303
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:38,630
He was... so delicate.

304
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,910
But he was as kind to me as
any man has ever been.

305
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,650
Then how pleased he'd be to know
that you're his heir.

306
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,260
That's so nice of you.

307
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,020
Goodness.

308
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,700
I'm afraid you've made me blub.

309
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,010
Let me take you upstairs to unpack.

310
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,050
Luncheon's not for half an hour.

311
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,070
And that's the man you want to
trick into marriage?

312
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,070
I'm going for a walk.

313
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,930
I agree.

314
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,220
But Robert thinks Edith's had
so little luck in her life.

315
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,210
Oh, I sympathise, of course,

316
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,500
but we both know she's making a mistake.

317
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,425
One thing. Don't forget that Mr Pelham

318
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,620
is now the Marquess of Hexham,
when you address him.

319
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:41,127
I helped him unpack this morning

320
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,565
and he wishes to remain Mr Pelham

321
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,235
until his cousin's funeral, Mr Carson.

322
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,380
He can call himself Mr Pelham
to his heart's content

323
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:50,497
but he is Lord Hexham nevertheless,
Mr Bates,

324
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:53,580
and we will refer to him as His Lordship.

325
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,280
Good. Time to get started.

326
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,800
Good news?

327
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,050
Not exactly.

328
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,500
Thank you for your enquiry but
we wish to combine

329
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,780
the roles of butler, chauffeur and valet,

330
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,040
and you seem overqualified.

331
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,280
But please accept our best wishes
for the future.

332
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,250
- What future?
- Don't be silly.

333
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,130
Of course. That's right.

334
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,380
I'm silly, aren't I? Silly old me.

335
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,560
- No wait.
- Let him go.

336
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,340
What was it about Tangiers that your cousin
enjoyed so much?

337
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,102
Who knows? He used to talk of
going down to the beach

338
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:42,203
and watching the young fishermen
bring in the nets.

339
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:45,244
How the setting sun would make
the scene magical

340
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,250
until everything was suddenly
plunged into darkness.

341
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:50,345
Goodness. How lyrical.

342
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,780
He was lyrical. He was an artist.

343
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,045
In his heart, anyway.

344
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,900
I don't think this family can boast
much in the way of artists.

345
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,020
Although we did have an aunt who was
quite good at macrame.

346
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,180
So, are you here to settle things
with Edith before you leave?

347
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,860
Mary, please.

348
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,300
I hope so. I hope we can get
things settled

349
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:16,120
but I mustn't jump the gun.

350
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,370
You've talked of your mother but
what other family do you have?

351
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,610
That's it. My father's dead,
obviously,

352
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,517
there are no siblings.

353
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:29,390
It's just me and Mother.

354
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,480
You were joking when you said
she was cock-a-hoop

355
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,680
but she must feel a certain pride.

356
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,280
I wasn't joking but

357
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,990
you can judge for yourselves
when you meet her.

358
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,000
You talk as if we should be scared.

359
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,750
She makes Mr Squeers look like
Florence Nightingale.

360
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,400
Ladies? Can I have a picture?

361
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,550
No, you may not.

362
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,140
He's been there all day.

363
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,800
Well, why didn't you telephone and
warn us? You daft ha'porth!

364
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,230
I'm sorry, Auntie Beryl, I thought
you might not come

365
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,050
and I'm going nearly mad here.

366
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,030
What about the bookings?

367
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,950
Cancelled.

368
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,605
What?! All of them?

369
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,280
One man wanted compensation.
For the ridicule.

370
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:23,920
I hope you told him what he could
do with it!

371
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,520
I'll give him RIDICULE!

372
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,200
Now, calm down.

373
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,700
There's no harm done so let's go
and have some tea.

374
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,760
This is Mr Molesley.

375
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,900
He will be teaching you history
and English literature.

376
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,280
- Make him welcome, please.
- Good afternoon.

377
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,780
Well, I'll leave you to it.

378
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,025
This term we will explore

379
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,610
the years between the Civil War
of 1642 and...

380
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,750
1642 and the Glorious Revolution...

381
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
of 1688.

382
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,920
Almost half a century of change
and social progress.

383
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,670
I hope you will find it as exciting as I do.

384
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,930
Things have changed for you now.

385
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,040
You must know that you're quite free
if you want to be.

386
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,130
I don't.

387
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,950
Look, of course things have changed.

388
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,130
I was in line for a quiet life,

389
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,630
farming, sport, bringing up a
family with my wife.

390
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,320
But now I'm to be one of the
kings of the county -

391
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,160
always on parade, representing the people
who look up to me,

392
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,410
fighting for causes, trying oh so hard
not to be disappointing.

393
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,770
Oh, I think you'll make a
very good job of it.

394
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,390
You couldn't ask for a man with a
sounder moral conscience.

395
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,585
The conscience maybe,

396
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,500
but what about the courage?

397
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,210
Help me. Please.

398
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,010
But can I help? Am I worthy?

399
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,815
The 7th Marquess of Hexham

400
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,940
weds the daughter of the
5th Earl of Grantham?

401
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,360
What could be more suitable?
Mother will be thrilled.

402
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,730
You talk of her a lot.

403
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,350
She has been an important figure
in my life. I admit it.

404
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,730
But I don't agree with her about everything.

405
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,560
Is she very stern?

406
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,540
She certainly believes rank
carries responsibilities.

407
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,170
But so do I.

408
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,290
That's why I need you.

409
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,480
To help me live up to my own expectations.

410
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,520
We ought to go in.

411
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,260
Tea will have started and the children
will be down in a minute.

412
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,300
The husband has been bought off?

413
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,135
Well, he's settled out of court.

414
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,950
And you won't have to be a witness?

415
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:13,540
So Mr Willis said.

416
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,840
But I've still lost every one
of my bookings.

417
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,265
I'm still a laughing stock.

418
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,300
I did wonder about the whole idea
from the beginning.

419
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,580
You did not!

420
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,745
It's exactly what we're planning to do.

421
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,040
Then clearly we're going to have to be
a lot more careful

422
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,850
than Mrs Patmore, aren't we?

423
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,750
That's the front door, Mr Carson.

424
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,320
I'll go.

425
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,990
Punch is terribly fierce.

426
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,960
I don't think he's a good model
for marriage in later life.

427
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,520
Or relations with the law.

428
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,690
- Take that! And that! And that!
- Ouch, you rascal!

429
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,490
And that's the way to do it!

430
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:51,160
Very good!

431
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,510
Mr Talbot.

432
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,060
Hello, Mr Talbot. Mary never told me
you were coming.

433
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,955
I didn't know he was.

434
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,175
Well, the thing is, I was driving down
from Durham

435
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,200
and I suddenly realised I'd almost be
passing the gates.

436
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,335
What were you doing in Durham?

437
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,160
Oh, I was doing various car things.

438
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,790
We haven't seen you since that
awful day at Brooklands.

439
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:12,467
I hope you're coping with it all.

440
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:14,110
Well, one doesn't have much choice.

441
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,650
Did you know about this?

442
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,360
I might have said if he was
coming from Durham,

443
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,915
then he'd be driving quite close.

444
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,390
Don't think I'm amused.
I dislike my hand being forced.

445
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,870
No-one's forcing anything.

446
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,010
Now you're here, I hope you'll stay
the night at least.

447
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,470
Mary?

448
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,230
Perhaps Mr Talbot is in a hurry to get home.

449
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,890
No, no I'm not.

450
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,560
It's settled then. Carson, will you
please tell Mrs Hughes?

451
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,920
And ask someone to unpack for Mr Talbot.

452
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,490
I'm afraid you've missed tea.

453
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,750
- Oh, don't worry about that.
- I won't.

454
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,010
Hello, Bertie, I heard about your cousin.
I'm so terribly sorry.

455
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:00,375
Thank you. I'm on my way out there now,

456
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,700
but I wanted to get things settled
before I go.

457
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,550
And are they... settled?

458
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,240
I think so. They will be.

459
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,925
Then I envy you.

460
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,870
I would say Mr Talbot has just
miscalculated rather badly.

461
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,360
.. The struggle between the Monarchy
and Parliament.

462
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,980
Oh, right. That's it for today.

463
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,940
Oh yes, er some of you

464
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,150
may like to examine these time charts
that I've drawn up,

465
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:34,000
and tomorrow we'll really begin
to make a start.

466
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,880
Would you...?

467
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,540
This is so precisely not the way
to win me over!

468
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,500
Mary, will you just get off your high horse?

469
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:43,805
Why are you interfering anyway?

470
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,670
Because I love you and want you to be happy.

471
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,500
Well, you've got a bloody odd way
of showing it!

472
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,060
Well, I take it this is me
you're fighting about?

473
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,350
Yes, it is. And you can dig yourself out.

474
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:55,570
Because I've had enough.

475
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,330
Have you brought a dinner jacket?

476
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,750
Yes.

477
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,460
Well, you were very well equipped
to do your 'car things' in Durham.

478
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,770
How many years do you think
it's taken to find someone

479
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,675
I want to spend the rest of my life with?

480
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,030
Living in my family house?
Working to preserve my estate

481
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:15,260
and being outranked by your own stepson?

482
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:16,875
Oh, I'm tougher than I look.

483
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,850
Oh, Henry, please don't make this
harder than it has to be.

484
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,220
Are you mad?

485
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,370
If you're trying to get rid of me,

486
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,350
I'm going to make this as hard
and as horrible as I can!

487
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,360
Well you're being extremely unfair!

488
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,900
I wish I knew what we should do.

489
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,935
I'm attempted to tell him myself.

490
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,620
You think he's strong enough to stand out
against his mother?

491
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,500
Can't we just leave Edith to tell him
or not, as she sees fit?

492
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,910
Tell him what?

493
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,660
That Mr Gregson made Edith his heir.

494
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,500
Some men might not feel
comfortable with that.

495
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,080
Why did you invite Henry to stay,
without asking me first?

496
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,850
Darling, it was half-past five

497
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,550
and the man was in North Yorkshire.

498
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,245
What did you want him to do?
Pitch a tent under a tree?

499
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,830
He must have made a plan for his
journey back from Durham.

500
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,250
I doubt he ever went to Durham.

501
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,530
He came up here to see you.

502
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,810
- Who says so?
- The look in his eyes.

503
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,350
Not one of you thinks it's a good idea!
A professional driver?

504
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,675
With nothing to his name?

505
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,155
- Then give him up.
- I had. I did.

506
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,860
Until Mama invited him
to make himself at home!

507
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,070
You can't expect us to be rude.

508
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,375
The man's only crime is to love you.

509
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:43,390
Just send him away! As quick as
you can. For all our sakes.

510
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,160
She's right about one thing.
None of us thinks it's a good idea.

511
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,910
No, maybe not. But she's clearly
quite mad about him,

512
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,160
whatever she says.

513
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,460
How was it, Mr Molesley? Teaching?

514
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,920
It was a, quite a challenge.

515
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,190
There's always another day.

516
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,800
I know.

517
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,400
They've got their coffee upstairs so

518
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,840
I'll make a last check.

519
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,000
How are you getting to Tangiers?

520
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,835
Is there a boat that sails direct?

521
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,280
- Actually I'm flying. For the first bit,
anyway. - What?

522
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,370
I know. It does seem rather daring.

523
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,525
I do not envy you.

524
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,970
I don't know. Now the commercial airlines
are starting to operate,

525
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:36,515
I dare say we'll all be flying

526
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,490
hither and thither before too long.

527
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,860
I rather doubt that.

528
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,760
I must say I do like the way

529
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:43,130
Bertie makes no bones about it.

530
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,700
He's here to see you.

531
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,910
I know.

532
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,640
The same could be said of me
but I'm not doing as well as he is.

533
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,090
I hope you know what you are doing.

534
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,745
She's quite a handful you know.

535
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,820
- Who's a handful?
- My beloved sister.

536
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,030
Well, she is beloved by me, anyway.

537
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,470
I like Bertie. I do. But when you
see them together...

538
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,580
Meaning?

539
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,985
If Henry were the new Marquess of Hexham,

540
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,560
there wouldn't be a woman in England
who wasn't setting her cap at him.

541
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:10,420
What about you? Would you
set your cap at him?

542
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,510
Because if that's why you're not,
shame on you.

543
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,360
Oh, stop lecturing me!

544
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,840
Excuse me.

545
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,290
Mary, wait.

546
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,820
Wait!

547
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,690
Look, I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

548
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,710
I thought I could present my arguments
effectively in person,

549
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:36,490
- clearly I was wrong.
- I can't bear to be manoeuvred.

550
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,790
But you see, I think we love
each other very much.

551
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:41,670
For some reason,

552
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,160
you're fighting it. I'm not.

553
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,530
My birth is respectable,
so it can't be that,

554
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,875
which forces me to believe that it is

555
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,160
my lack of money and position
that present the problem.

556
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,500
- Aren't you better than that?
- What?

557
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Well, it just seems rather small to me.

558
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,965
Not to marry a man for lack of money

559
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,380
is the same as marrying him because of it.

560
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:07,445
- Out of my way!
- Am I not right?

561
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,135
No. You push in here, into
my home, uninvited,

562
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,790
in order to call me a grubby,
little gold digger?

563
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,600
You've got a nerve!

564
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,570
Mary!

565
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,430
Mary!

566
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,890
She loves him but she can't control him.

567
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,560
That's what frightens her.
He's stronger than she is, really.

568
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:40,190
Or as strong. And she's not used to it.

569
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,060
She's a bit of a bully, your Lady Mary.

570
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:44,510
She likes her own way.

571
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,405
She is and she does but

572
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,220
there's another side to her. He sees that.

573
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,200
- So you were wrong about him?
- I think I was.

574
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,985
- Why are you smiling?
- Show me a man

575
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,320
that doesn't smile when his wife
admits she's wrong.

576
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,170
Won't you send me to bed happy?

577
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,290
Sounds like an indecent proposal.

578
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,110
I meant, give me your answer.

579
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,710
Let me go to Tangiers with a sense
my tomorrows are beginning.

580
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,260
Please.

581
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,240
I love you, Bertie.

582
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,205
I've been in love before.

583
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,170
I won't pretend that I haven't.

584
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,820
But I really do love you.

585
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,640
Then I'll take that as a yes.

586
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,610
The trouble is, I'm not as simple
as I used to be.

587
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,760
My life is not as simple.

588
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,280
I... just need to be sure
I'm being realistic,

589
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,250
not living in a fool's paradise and
dragging you into it with me.

590
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:07,870
I'll still take it as a yes.

591
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,540
You're down early.

592
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,920
No, I'm not. Where's Henry?

593
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,815
- He's gone. - What?

594
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,670
He had something in London this evening

595
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:33,150
and wanted to get back.

596
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,610
I have a mass of letters to write.

597
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,590
- I'm sorry Lord Grantham's left.
- Why particularly?

598
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,450
Because we've got some news

599
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,850
and I was waiting for Mary to join us.

600
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,700
It's not the right moment.

601
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,550
Carson, could we have some more
coffee, please?

602
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,740
Why isn't it the right moment?

603
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,965
Well, Henry's abandoned you.

604
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,130
No, he hasn't. I wanted him to go.

605
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,430
- That's not what it looked like.
- Well, that's how it is.

606
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,770
There's no need for this.

607
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,570
Edith, if your news is good, then we are
very happy for you both.

608
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,080
Aren't we, Mary?

609
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,410
See? I told you.

610
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,445
The one thing Mary can't bear

611
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,800
is when things are going better
for me than for her.

612
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,660
I'm sure that's not true.

613
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,100
You don't know her.

614
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,100
I'm getting married and
you've lost your man.

615
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,555
And you just can't stand it.

616
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,590
- Edith, there is no need for...
- You're wrong.

617
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,410
I'm very happy for you.

618
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,250
And I admire you, Bertie.

619
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,040
Not everyone would accept Edith's past.

620
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,870
- Mary, don't.
- What do you mean?

621
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:05,420
Well, you must've told him?

622
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,840
You couldn't accept him without telling him?

623
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,735
Tell me what?

624
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,760
About Marigold. Who she really is.

625
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,360
Marigold is my daughter.

626
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,510
Will you excuse me?

627
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,910
I beg your pardon, Your Ladyship,
but Mr Pelham, that is,

628
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:59,590
Lord Hexham, has asked for a taxi
and Mr Carson has gone out,

629
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,902
so I'm not quite sure...

630
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:02,658
What? Lord Hexham's leaving?

631
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,345
Obviously, if he wants a taxi.

632
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,055
What's happened? Where's Lady Edith?

633
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,985
Can't she drive him to the station?

634
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,880
Don't bother about it, Mrs Hughes.

635
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,620
- I'll sort it out.
- Very good, M'Lord.

636
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:15,330
Mrs Hughes, how is Mrs Patmore?

637
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,570
She's still very upset, M'Lady.

638
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,285
But there's nothing to be done.

639
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,680
Is this about her B & B
going down the drain?

640
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:23,115
Don't be flippant.

641
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,810
Why don't we pay her a visit?

642
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,805
Have tea there and let people see us.

643
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,160
What a good idea!
Why didn't I think of that?

644
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,830
But if it's to be effective, won't we
have to be in the papers?

645
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:36,110
Well, the local papers. And it wouldn't
be a news story any more

646
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:38,210
than being photographed at a flower show.

647
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,700
Would Mrs Patmore agree?

648
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,590
I think she'd be bowled over, Your Ladyship.

649
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,290
Then it's settled.

650
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:50,260
I hope you don't mind my saying
that you seem very suspicious.

651
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:54,610
Do I? But you must admit, your attitude
is quite a volte-face.

652
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,980
I want Larry's father to be content.

653
00:34:57,015 --> 00:34:58,632
Is that a volte-face?

654
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,250
Yes, but does your fiance

655
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,290
want his Papa to be content
in this way? With me?

656
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:06,690
Well, you know men.

657
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm not sure I do, as it happens.
Tell me about them.

658
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,700
I only meant they dig themselves
into a position,

659
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,540
often before considering all the options.

660
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,640
- And you've considered 'the options'?
- I believe so.

661
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,780
Well, here's another option for you.

662
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,230
I won't rekindle Lord Merton's dreams

663
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,100
unless I'm invited to do so
by Larry Grey, himself.

664
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,910
Is that clear?

665
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,405
I speak for him.

666
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,710
Yes, but you see, I don't want you
to speak for him.

667
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,650
I want to hear him speak for himself.

668
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,940
Oh, I see. The plan is to mix up
His Lordship

669
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:50,335
or, worse, Her Ladyship,

670
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,600
with a divorce petition and the scene
of an adultery?

671
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:55,625
But I want to bury that story

672
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,215
and I need a big event to bury it under.

673
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,560
And you have no qualms about dragging
the family we serve

674
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:02,585
into the mud?

675
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,880
It's their choice, Mr Carson.

676
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,140
They're all grown people, surely?

677
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,825
Well, I've always known that
women were ruthless,

678
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,250
but I didn't think I'd find the proof
in my own wife!

679
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,120
And there's me thinking how kind they were
to come to the rescue.

680
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:25,280
And so they are. Just tell them yes
and arrange the day.

681
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,520
- He'll miss his train.
- Let him miss it.

682
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,850
He can catch the next one. What happened?

683
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,690
Mary thought Edith had told him
about Marigold.

684
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,850
- How did Mary find out?
- Mary is not stupid.

685
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:42,860
No. And she's not always kind, either.

686
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:44,505
Was it really a mistake?

687
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,060
What difference does it make?

688
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,840
I'm not shocked exactly. It isn't that.
I promise you.

689
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,380
You have to protect the honour of your family.
Of course you do.

690
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:55,600
It isn't even that.

691
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,860
You should have told me the whole story
from the beginning.

692
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,700
You haven't been fair to me.

693
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,310
No. I don't believe I have.

694
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,150
Then why didn't you?

695
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,980
I suppose I thought it might
ruin everything.

696
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,110
You mean you didn't trust me?

697
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,090
I can't have, can I?

698
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,140
Would you have married me in a lie?

699
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,610
I don't think so, but we'll never know now.

700
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,830
No.

701
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,070
You see,

702
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,420
I don't feel I could spend my life
with someone I don't trust.

703
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,930
Who didn't trust me.

704
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,030
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

705
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm terribly sorry, of course,

706
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,090
but that doesn't mean much, does it?

707
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,950
The truth is, my life was about to be
perfectly wonderful and

708
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,910
now I've thrown it all away.

709
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,060
I'd better go if I'm to catch my train.

710
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,480
Yes, hurry.

711
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,995
I doubt we'll meet again

712
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,090
so I want to say good luck,

713
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,450
and everything else that goes with it.

714
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,540
Good luck to you, too.

715
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,750
I mean that.

716
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,260
Well, you got what you wanted!

717
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,405
Bertie has left for the train

718
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,380
and Edith won't be the next
Marchioness of Hexham!

719
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,550
- Well, that's not what I wanted.
- Isn't it?

720
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,200
I still can't believe she'd never told him.

721
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:12,315
How was I to know that?

722
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,010
Don't play the innocent with me.

723
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:17,870
- I didn't mean it.
- Don't lie! Not to me!

724
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,610
You can't stop ruining things!

725
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,460
For Edith, for yourself!

726
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,395
You'd pull in the sky if you could!

727
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,040
Anything to make you feel less
frightened and alone!

728
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,915
You saw Henry when he was here

729
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,685
high-handed, bullying, unapologetic.

730
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,180
Am I expected to lower myself to his level

731
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:36,890
and be grateful I'm allowed to do so?

732
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,640
Listen to yourself.
'Lower yourself to his level'.

733
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:42,300
You're not a princess in
The Prisoner of Zenda!

734
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,900
- You don't want to understand me.
- You ruined Edith's life today!

735
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:49,490
How many lives are you going to wreck
just to smother your misery?

736
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:52,930
- I refuse to listen!
- You're a coward, Mary.

737
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,010
Like all bullies, you're a coward.

738
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,535
What are you doing up here?

739
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,785
Looking for you to borrow some scissors
but you're going out.

740
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,000
I've left my workbox downstairs
but you're welcome to take them.

741
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,450
Where are you off to?

742
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,270
I said I'd walk with Mr Molesley
to the schoolhouse.

743
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:20,530
For moral support.

744
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,820
Are you all right, Mr Barrow?

745
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,160
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

746
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,900
- Going away?
- Do you care?

747
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,510
Look, I wasn't to know you hadn't told him.

748
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,835
It never occurred to me -

749
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,650
Just shut up! I don't know what's happened.

750
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,510
Tom has made you feel bad, or Papa,

751
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,940
or maybe it's just the same old Mary

752
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,030
who wants her cake and hate me to...

753
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:27,950
- I never meant to.
- Yes, you did!

754
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,610
Who do you think you're talking to?

755
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,150
Mama? Your maid?

756
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,130
I know you!

757
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,750
I know you to be a nasty, jealous,
scheming bitch!

758
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:40,020
Now listen, you pathetic

759
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:41,580
You're a bitch!

760
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,190
Not content with ruining your own life,

761
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,080
you're determined to ruin mine!

762
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,490
I have not ruined my life

763
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,875
and if Bertie's put off by that, then -

764
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,980
Don't demean yourself by trying to
justify your venom.

765
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,610
Just go.

766
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,500
And you're wrong, you know.
As you so often are.

767
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,715
Henry's perfect for you.

768
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,630
You're just too stupid and
stuck up to see it!

769
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,905
Still at least he's got away from you.

770
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,470
Which is something to give thanks for,
I suppose!

771
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,770
I beg your pardon, M'Lord but Mrs Patmore
has something to say.

772
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:33,510
- I wonder if now would be convenient.
- Of course. Bring her in.

773
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,040
How can we help, Mrs Patmore?

774
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,820
Well, that's just it, M'Lord.

775
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,305
I know you're planning to help

776
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,160
by coming over to the cottage for some tea

777
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,115
but should you be mixed up in it?

778
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,770
It's my mess, why should you pay for it?

779
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,055
Indeed.

780
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,270
Carson? Is this what you believe?

781
00:42:56,305 --> 00:42:58,002
It is, Your Ladyship.

782
00:42:58,037 --> 00:42:59,665
I wouldn't like to see

783
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,800
this family dragged into a tawdry,
local brouhaha.

784
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,710
He means me.

785
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,810
Oh, I think we have to show a little more
backbone than that.

786
00:43:09,845 --> 00:43:12,520
- My Lord? - Mrs Patmore has been
loyal to this house

787
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:15,080
and this house must be loyal to her.

788
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,510
She had made a large investment
in her future.

789
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:20,420
We can't let it fall away to nothing.

790
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,700
I'll go now, if I may.

791
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,530
We'll see you on Friday.

792
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,805
Are you sure, My Lord?

793
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,340
QUITE sure, thank you, Carson.

794
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,545
You mustn't be nervous.

795
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,060
You don't know what they're like.

796
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,635
I felt like a fraud yesterday.

797
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,650
And all the time I kept wondering,
"What would they say

798
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:52,630
if they found out that I was a servant
at the big house?"

799
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,580
What would their parents say?

800
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,890
Why not tell them? Then they won't have to
find out, will they?

801
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,110
- Mr Barrow's in a funny mood.
- Why?

802
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,835
He suddenly told me out of the blue
how he hoped

803
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,070
I'd make more of my life than he'd
ever make of his.

804
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,290
I should go back.

805
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,830
- Is something wrong?
- I hope not.

806
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,800
Does Mrs Hughes know you're
on the men's side!

807
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:46,100
Never mind that. Have you seen Mr Barrow?

808
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:48,020
Er, he was going in for a bath.

809
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:50,570
Oh, my God! Come with me!

810
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,820
Hello! Mr Barrow! Are you in there?

811
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,790
Will you open this door?

812
00:44:58,825 --> 00:44:59,740
Get back!

813
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,135
- Oh, my God!
- Fetch Mrs Hughes.

814
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,480
Send Anna for the doctor but tell
no-one else what you've seen.

815
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:14,950
- I wish I'd gone with them now.
- With who?

816
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:19,345
- Mr Molesley and Miss Baxter.
- Well, go then.

817
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,155
- I can manage. - I'll be too late, though,
won't I?

818
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,930
Well, you should still go if you want to.
For a walk.

819
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:27,030
They might have a break when you get there.

820
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,400
Where's Mrs Hughes and Anna?

821
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,650
Mrs Hughes is in her sitting room.

822
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,170
- Are you in a rush?
- Not particularly. Why?

823
00:45:57,205 --> 00:45:59,520
I need you to come with me to the station.

824
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:01,280
Then you can drive the car home.

825
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,610
- Where are you going?
- Up to London.

826
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,560
I haven't said goodbye to anyone

827
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,840
and I can't bear to look at Mary.

828
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,270
She's unhappy.

829
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:13,350
- I think she regrets what she did.
- Not as much as I do.

830
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,075
And, for your information,

831
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,330
before I left we had the row
we all knew was coming.

832
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,535
I'm not sorry.

833
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,950
At least I'm just sorry we didn't
have it years ago.

834
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,710
Bertie may come round.

835
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,960
I don't think so. He might have
come round about Marigold.

836
00:46:30,995 --> 00:46:33,040
In fact, I'm sure he would've done.

837
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,970
But I tried to trick him

838
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,630
and he won't come round about that.

839
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,010
Would you like me to talk to him?

840
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,900
No, but I love you for asking.

841
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,180
We should get going.

842
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,485
Anna's gone for Doctor Clarkson.

843
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,340
Now, we should get him into bed
and out of his wet things.

844
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,385
I hope he won't mind if we undress him.

845
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,990
He's past minding if we put him
in a shy and threw coconuts.

846
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,390
Now you take his feet and
we'll take an arm each.

847
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,000
- Should we tell His Lordship?
- Mr Carson's seeing to that.

848
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:29,310
Right. Here goes.

849
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,345
I hate to think he was so unhappy.

850
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,500
At least it's not gone too far.

851
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,350
Why should you?

852
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,275
.. And maybe one of you

853
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,815
will run the country one day.
How about that?

854
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,320
That's daft, sir.
Only toffs run the country.

855
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:02,175
No.

856
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,540
No, you see, you must never think that

857
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,615
education is only for special people,

858
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,445
you know, for clever people, for toffs.

859
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,280
- Education is for everyone.
- You would say that, sir.

860
00:48:13,315 --> 00:48:15,870
Yes, I would. But I'm not anyone special.

861
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,325
You're a teacher.

862
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,145
I'm a teacher now. But I'm an
ordinary bloke.

863
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,770
I've spent my life in service,
fetching and carrying.

864
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:28,530
- You were a servant?
- I was. I am.

865
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,640
And I was glad to get the work.

866
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:35,230
My mum's in service. She works for
Mr Travis at the vicarage.

867
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,445
Dad's a gardener at Skelton Park.

868
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,980
But I never gave up on learning, do you see?

869
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,290
I read as much as I could
and I taught myself,

870
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:48,280
and I hope to be able to teach you.

871
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,100
Maybe give you the shortcut
that I never had...

872
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,900
Right.

873
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,110
The Civil War.

874
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,200
Let's start with the Divine Right of Kings.

875
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,905
Did King Charles

876
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,795
really believe that he had a
Divine Right to rule?

877
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,030
Or did he just choose to believe it
because it suited him?

878
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,320
You mean the King was a liar?

879
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,150
Not quite.

880
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,810
Kings are like anyone else.

881
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,630
Anna says Edith's gone to London
and I suppose we all know why.

882
00:49:26,665 --> 00:49:29,480
- Do we have to do this now?
- Yes, I really think -

883
00:49:29,515 --> 00:49:32,970
Carson, what's happened?
Where are the footmen?

884
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,770
That is something I need to
discuss with you, My Lord.

885
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,995
Thomas has cut his wrists?

886
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:46,480
- Yes, I'm afraid so, My Lord.
- God in Heaven.

887
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,765
Who knows?

888
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,290
Not many and I should like to
keep it that way.

889
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,165
I shall say that he is ill with influenza.

890
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,160
Carson... please don't bother with
serving our tea.

891
00:49:56,195 --> 00:49:58,050
With your permission, My Lady.

892
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,170
How sad. How very sad.

893
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,410
Do you still think dismissing Barrow
was a useful saving, Papa?

894
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,050
That's rather below the belt, even for you.

895
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,140
Look, we've kept him out of the hospital.

896
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,385
Dr Clarkson stitched him up here.

897
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,760
He says Miss Baxter found him in time.

898
00:50:35,795 --> 00:50:37,440
I'll go up in a minute.

899
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,600
I saw Doctor Clarkson leaving when I got back.
What was he doing here?

900
00:50:46,635 --> 00:50:49,087
Mr Barrow has been taken poorly.

901
00:50:49,122 --> 00:50:51,540
He will spend a day or two in bed.

902
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,650
Anna and Miss Baxter will look after him.

903
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,890
How was it, Mr Molesley?

904
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,345
I enjoyed myself today.

905
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,910
The children were generous to me.

906
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:03,440
The children were spellbound.

907
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,330
- How do you know?
- Because I crept in and listened.

908
00:51:06,365 --> 00:51:08,910
- You never.
- I did. And you're a natural.

909
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,415
So,

910
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,640
are we to lose you to the groves of
academe, Mr Molesley?

911
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,825
Can I teach a little while longer

912
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,335
before I re-order my world, Mr Carson?

913
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,840
I'm glad, though. You're a kind man,
Mr Molesley.

914
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,680
It's about time you were rewarded
for your kindness.

915
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,885
He'll recover, M'Lady. And he hasn't
had to go to hospital.

916
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,580
- Can we keep it quiet? For his sake.
- That's what Mr Carson wants.

917
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,170
What a day.

918
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,700
I ruin Lady Edith's life

919
00:51:43,735 --> 00:51:45,740
and Barrow tries to end his.

920
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,850
- How is Lady Edith?
- She's gone to London.

921
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,660
Which is hardly to be wondered at,

922
00:51:50,695 --> 00:51:52,972
when her only sister has wrecked her

923
00:51:53,007 --> 00:51:55,250
chances of a happy, fulfilling life.

924
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,530
Lord Hexham won't come round?

925
00:51:57,565 --> 00:51:59,300
Lady Edith thinks not.

926
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,990
And I'm sorry.

927
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,390
What about you?

928
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,995
Have you thought any more about Mr Talbot?

929
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,500
Don't you start. You're as bad
as Mr Branson.

930
00:52:13,535 --> 00:52:15,100
Why? What's he done?

931
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,935
He asked Mr Talbot to come here

932
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,700
and he keeps going on and on and on.

933
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,280
But Mr Talbot's not right for me.

934
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,805
He's not. We'd be miserable.

935
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,600
- As long as you're sure that you...
- I am sure!

936
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:34,230
I apologise.

937
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,070
It's just

938
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,420
nobody can believe that I know my own mind.

939
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,200
Of course, M'Lady.

940
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,710
Right. Can I do anything more for you?

941
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:48,980
No, thank you.

942
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,650
Good night.

943
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,120
And Anna...

944
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,060
.. I'm sorry.

945
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,470
- You don't know that's the end.
- Yes, I do.

946
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,300
And please don't think badly of him.

947
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,050
It was my own fault.

948
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,840
Well, I liked him.

949
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,040
Me, too.

950
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:34,090
Your sister hasn't been helpful.

951
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,820
Mary and I are locked into a kind of

952
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:40,535
lifelong struggle and I don't know,

953
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:44,280
it's hard for an outsider to understand.
It's hard for me.

954
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:47,330
Who invented families?
That's what I'd like to know.

955
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,550
What time is Miss Jones coming today?

956
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:51,430
Five. For tea.

957
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,085
Do we know her real name yet?

958
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,570
She only writes as Cassandra Jones
which is the name on her account.

959
00:53:56,605 --> 00:53:58,980
Perhaps it is her real name, after all.

960
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:00,775
Well, real or not,

961
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,200
she has quite a following.
So we'd better be pals.

962
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:05,520
How did you get her to come here?

963
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,845
I'm afraid I forced her.

964
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,325
Look, she wants more money

965
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,770
which is fair enough given
the success of the column,

966
00:54:11,805 --> 00:54:14,982
but I insisted we negotiate in person.

967
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:18,160
- Why? - I was curious.
Aren't you?

968
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,960
Suppose she sends someone
to impersonate her,

969
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:22,965
if she's as secretive as all that?

970
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,830
Let's have a sign if we think
it's the real Cassandra.

971
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,790
Say, "Bananas" if you think
she's telling the truth.

972
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,300
All right. Bananas it is.

973
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,420
May we come in?

974
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,595
Hello, Mr Barrow.

975
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:47,830
Here you are. To make you feel better.

976
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,610
Thank you very much, Master George.

977
00:54:52,645 --> 00:54:54,745
We want you to get better, Barrow.

978
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,470
Truly. And no-one more than Master George.

979
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,400
At least I've got one friend, eh?

980
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,960
Have you been lonely?

981
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,710
If I have, I've only myself to blame.

982
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,170
I've done and said things.

983
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,680
I don't know why, I can't stop myself.

984
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,010
Now I'm paying the price.

985
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,900
Strange. I could say the same.

986
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,740
Mr Carson's told them that you've got...

987
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,310
'Flu. I know.

988
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,680
I beg your pardon, M'Lady.

989
00:55:25,715 --> 00:55:27,380
We're going Barrow

990
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,590
and I hope things improve for you.
I really do.

991
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:35,292
I'd say the same if it weren't
impertinent, M'Lady.

992
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:38,960
- Goodbye, Mr Barrow.
- Goodbye, Master George.

993
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:47,245
- So. Today's the big day.
- Oh, spare me.

994
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,570
- Do you want to take Daisy with you?
- Oh, if I'm allowed.

995
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:52,375
I mean my niece is good

996
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,600
but she might be dumbstruck with those Lords

997
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:56,645
and Ladies sitting in my front room.

998
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,380
Come to think of it, how will the village
know that they've been?

999
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,065
Lucy's seen to that.

1000
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,820
We've got the man from The Echo
coming at five.

1001
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,105
Put up a poster, why don't you?

1002
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,240
They're doing something nice, Mr Carson.
Don't spoil it.

1003
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:10,725
Yes. Very nice.

1004
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,455
For the public to read about
the cakes and dainties

1005
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:17,340
His Lordship is guzzling as he sits
at the adulterers' table!

1006
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:21,140
I'm sure there've been a few adulterers
sat at the table upstairs.

1007
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:22,990
- That is different.
- Why?

1008
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,820
To say nothing of suicidal footman
in the attic!

1009
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,600
What are we coming to?

1010
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,510
I only thank God that the Dowager
isn't here to witness it.

1011
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,720
- I can't believe you came.
- You made it sound so urgent.

1012
00:56:59,755 --> 00:57:02,100
Even so, I really appreciate it. Thank you.

1013
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,430
- Was everything all right when you
got home? - Well no, not really.

1014
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,670
- Spratt has gone away.
- Did you tell him you were coming back?

1015
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:12,060
A good butler should not need to be told.

1016
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,530
Now, where are they?
My broken-hearted granddaughters?

1017
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:18,900
It's just Mary. Edith's gone up to London.

1018
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,410
I didn't know when I wrote.

1019
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,660
All the better.

1020
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:26,250
But how will we get it all there?

1021
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,405
They're letting me have a car.

1022
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,750
Seeing as I'm giving tea to His Lordship.

1023
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,350
You're ready, then?
They've brought the car round.

1024
00:57:34,385 --> 00:57:35,960
Andrew, carry that out.

1025
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,410
And very, very good luck.

1026
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,650
And good luck to us all

1027
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,225
in the vain hope that we'll
avoid scandalous gossip.

1028
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,920
- You're such an old curmudgeon.
- Don't say you're going off me.

1029
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,720
No, because you're my curmudgeon

1030
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,980
and that makes all the difference.

1031
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:09,470
Granny. When did you arrive?

1032
00:58:09,505 --> 00:58:11,230
Yesterday evening.

1033
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,930
I spent the night before in Southampton

1034
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,840
and an entire day on trains.

1035
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,515
So I've come hot foot.

1036
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,820
If you're here to reprimand me
about Edith, please don't.

1037
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,075
Tom's already torn me into strips.

1038
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,470
- Why did you do it?
- I don't know. She was so...

1039
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,005
- Anyway, I'm sorry now.
- You should be.

1040
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,710
With Edith, I just say things and
then they can't be unsaid.

1041
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:37,495
Tom believes you're unhappy.

1042
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,990
That's why you lash out as you do.

1043
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,590
Look, if this is about Henry Talbot,
you should be clear

1044
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:45,080
he hasn't much to offer.

1045
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,350
Bertie Hexham is a loss but not Henry.

1046
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,960
He's well born, but there's no
money or position.

1047
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,900
He's not even a countryman.
Not really. He grew up in London.

1048
00:58:55,935 --> 00:58:58,270
- He shoots.
- Yes, he shoots.

1049
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,425
Like every social-climbing banker shoots.

1050
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,980
Well, let's leave his credentials
to one side for a moment

1051
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:08,740
- and concentrate on what is important.
- Which is?

1052
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:11,430
Tom says that he is in love with you

1053
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,860
and that you are in love with him.

1054
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,210
- Do you believe him?
- Do you deny it?

1055
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,650
For you of all people to talk as if
his qualifications don't matter!

1056
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:26,920
Tony Gillingham had all that I could wish -

1057
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,580
birth, money, looks...

1058
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,370
.. But he didn't suit you.

1059
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,960
- No.
- He wasn't clever enough.

1060
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:36,960
He wasn't strong enough.

1061
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,315
Henry Talbot is both.

1062
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,910
All right, Granny, it's not his poverty.

1063
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,155
But did Tom tell you,

1064
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:47,710
I stood there staring at a car in flames,

1065
00:59:47,745 --> 00:59:49,205
wondering if it were him?

1066
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,945
I think he's told me everything.

1067
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,760
Then you'll know I can't be a
crash widow again. I can't!

1068
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,610
I'd live in terror, dreading every race,

1069
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,265
every practice, every trial.

1070
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,815
- I cannot do it!
- Does he know this?

1071
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,760
He'd feel he should give it up
but I don't want that.

1072
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,500
He'd resent me.

1073
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:11,600
Oh, can't you find me some Duke?
There must be one spare.

1074
01:00:11,635 --> 01:00:13,762
So I can put Edith in her place.

1075
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:15,890
You are the only woman I know

1076
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:22,720
who likes to think herself cold
and selfish and grand.

1077
01:00:22,755 --> 01:00:25,550
Most of us spend our lives
trying to hide it.

1078
01:00:25,585 --> 01:00:27,520
Oh, Granny please don't

1079
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,090
lecture me on sentimental virtues.

1080
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:31,385
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1081
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:37,110
I believe in rules and traditions
and playing our part.

1082
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,140
But there is something else.

1083
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,730
And what is that, pray?

1084
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,150
I believe in love.

1085
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,065
I mean, brilliant careers,

1086
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:53,330
rich lives, are seldom led without...

1087
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,690
.. Just an element of love.

1088
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,130
Oh, Granny. You do surprise me.

1089
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,165
Oh, I am glad.

1090
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,260
So climbing all those stairs wasn't wasted.

1091
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:09,930
No.

1092
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,870
No, I would only say this.

1093
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,470
First,

1094
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:19,330
make peace with your sister.

1095
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:27,210
And then make peace with yourself.

1096
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,490
Oh, Mary.

1097
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,400
- Is Granny coming back for dinner?
- She didn't say so.

1098
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,890
She goes without telling us.
And returns without seeing us.

1099
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:45,185
We're in the dog house.

1100
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,290
How hard is that to understand?
Now, let's go.

1101
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:50,520
- Sure you don't want to come with us?
- Quite sure.

1102
01:01:50,555 --> 01:01:52,820
You don't need me.
You're enough of a headline.

1103
01:01:52,855 --> 01:01:54,440
And you certainly don't need me.

1104
01:01:56,550 --> 01:02:00,410
- My Lord, I wonder if I might have a word?
- What is it?

1105
01:02:00,445 --> 01:02:03,347
With your permission, I'd like to
tell Mr Barrow

1106
01:02:03,382 --> 01:02:06,250
that he can stay for the time being
at any rate.

1107
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:08,065
It would take a weight off his mind.

1108
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,030
That's a relief. I was going to
suggest the same thing.

1109
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,340
Were you, My Lord?

1110
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:16,560
Yes. I feel quite as guilty
as you do, Carson.

1111
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,950
I tell you what I blame myself for.

1112
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,505
I didn't credit him with feelings.

1113
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,735
I thought he was a man without a heart.
And I was wrong.

1114
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:27,930
No man is an island, Carson.
Not even Thomas Barrow.

1115
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:33,420
I ought to be very angry with you.

1116
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:36,710
Summoning Granny to tick me off.

1117
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,230
I was amazed she came at my call.

1118
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:43,650
She said your letter was very eloquent.
She was quite persuaded.

1119
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,970
So what are you going to do?

1120
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,235
As soon as Granny left

1121
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:50,310
I sent Henry a telegram
to get the next train.

1122
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,660
- Hopefully he'll be here by tea time.
- What about Edith?

1123
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,230
That's a harder task.
I'm ready to say I'm sorry.

1124
01:02:59,265 --> 01:03:01,340
But why should she want to forgive me?

1125
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,725
I got held up. Is she here yet?

1126
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,995
Miss Jones has arrived, yes, Lady Edith.

1127
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,730
- Why the mysterious face?
- You better go in.

1128
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,000
Edith.

1129
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,430
So this, it turns out,
is Miss Cassandra Jones.

1130
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,850
- Spratt?
- Good afternoon, Lady Edith.

1131
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,680
Bananas!

1132
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,650
I don't have to tell you why I'm here.

1133
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,580
Either you know everything or

1134
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,980
you're not hearing me now.

1135
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,270
The truth is...

1136
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,210
I love him.

1137
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,410
I believe we are right together

1138
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,550
but I so very much want to feel

1139
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,490
that you're happy for me,

1140
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,220
as I'd be happy for you, my darling.

1141
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,740
Remember, however much I love him...

1142
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,200
I will always love you.

1143
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,730
- I often come at this time.
- I don't come often enough.

1144
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,800
No, no. It's only a habit.

1145
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,150
Actually, I came to ask for his forgiveness,

1146
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,530
if that doesn't sound too silly.

1147
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,200
I see.

1148
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,770
I think that means you want to marry again.

1149
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,870
Well, I don't know if you have
his forgiveness...

1150
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,040
.. But you don't need to ask for mine.

1151
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,540
I'm delighted.

1152
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:44,890
- Anything else I can get you?
- One more mouthful and we'd explode.

1153
01:05:44,925 --> 01:05:47,490
Unless there's another of those
delicious scones.

1154
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:50,455
Of course. Lucy, fetch the scones.

1155
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:54,200
- When does the photographer arrive?
- Five o'clock, M'Lady.

1156
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,730
I'm afraid some of the village
have caught on

1157
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:58,400
and they're waiting too.

1158
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,690
Are you sure you want to do it?

1159
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,270
Oh, ye of little faith.

1160
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,770
That's it. I'll leave you to it.

1161
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:18,430
You don't have to go, Tom.

1162
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:23,720
Believe me, I've been part of this courtship
for quite long enough.

1163
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,170
It's for you to manage from here.

1164
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,885
- Well? - Well what?

1165
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,505
Mary, the last time I saw you,

1166
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,405
you threw me out for saying I loved you.

1167
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,365
Now you've whistled and I'm here,
but I don't know why.

1168
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,500
Because you were right. Because we are
in love with each other.

1169
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:56,140
I'm not sure why I fought it
but I've stopped fighting it now.

1170
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,220
I know I'm not what you were looking for.

1171
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,610
Tom and I once talked about
how marriage should be equal.

1172
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:06,150
It has nothing to do with position or money,

1173
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:11,530
simply that a couple should be equal
in both strength and passion.

1174
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,410
Should I ring for more tea?

1175
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:20,020
Are you always so cool and collected?
I do hope so.

1176
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,605
I'm not sure what you mean.

1177
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,950
Only that, your words have made my
heart pound at such a rate

1178
01:07:23,985 --> 01:07:25,412
I'm surprised you can't hear it.

1179
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:26,840
I'm hot, I'm cold and can't breathe.

1180
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:27,815
All because of you.

1181
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,630
- I must say, you carry it off well.
- Thanks.

1182
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:35,500
I need to know that you're certain.

1183
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:36,770
I am.

1184
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:40,205
I believe I've met my match. I have.

1185
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,560
I'm not 20, trembling at the touch
of your hand,

1186
01:07:43,595 --> 01:07:45,480
but I know that if I leave you now

1187
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:49,060
I'll never be as happy as we
could've been together.

1188
01:07:49,095 --> 01:07:50,750
I'm not 20 either

1189
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,580
but I still tremble at the touch
of your hands.

1190
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:55,770
Me, too. I don't know why
I said that, really.

1191
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,590
Oh, darling. Thank God for you.

1192
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,230
So what do we do now?

1193
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:06,710
Elope to Gretna Green?

1194
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:07,930
Well, I have a confession.

1195
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:08,775
When I came here last

1196
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,710
I brought a licence so we could
marry at once.

1197
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,300
Doesn't the Archbishop of Canterbury
need to agree?

1198
01:08:14,335 --> 01:08:15,707
Not if you can specify the Church.

1199
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:17,045
Well, you still need a bishop.

1200
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,320
- My uncle's a bishop.
- Good old England.

1201
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,940
Some things never change.

1202
01:08:21,975 --> 01:08:23,480
Quite. But the point is,

1203
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:27,310
it's still valid so shall we
get married now?

1204
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:29,860
- Now?
- Well, on Saturday.

1205
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:33,220
You don't want to have a huge society affair
again, do you?

1206
01:08:33,255 --> 01:08:37,140
- God, no. I've done that.
- Then will you?

1207
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,860
Well, I suppose I've come this far.

1208
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,000
Give it a moment, Mr Molesley.
Better give it a moment.

1209
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:07,175
If you're ready, My Lord. My Lady?

1210
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,585
- We must have Mrs Patmore.
- Of course.

1211
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,195
- Oh, no, no, no. You don't want me.
- I insist.

1212
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:16,060
A picture to mark our gratitude
for a marvellous tea.

1213
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,440
Are we ready?

1214
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,890
Three, two, one.

1215
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,940
And you promise you haven't cheated?

1216
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:28,905
As God is my witness,

1217
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,150
I haven't set eyes on her
since yesterday lunch.

1218
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:34,780
- I even had breakfast in my room.
- That was Carson.

1219
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,950
He wouldn't take any chances
with Mary's happiness.

1220
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:44,300
Strange. I'll be best man at both
of her weddings.

1221
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:45,550
I hadn't thought of it.

1222
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,930
You've been a good friend in this, Tom.
Thank you.

1223
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,580
Pay me back by looking after her.

1224
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,530
Who's that?

1225
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,600
What? I don't believe it!

1226
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,625
Why didn't you say to expect you?

1227
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,220
Because I wasn't sure until I
got on the train.

1228
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,845
How are you feeling?

1229
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,430
Fine. Can you not ask me that
for the rest of the day?

1230
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,790
- Could you leave us for a moment?
- Of course.

1231
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,660
We'll wait for you downstairs.

1232
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,390
You know I'm sorry.

1233
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,180
I assumed you would be fairly sorry
unless you're actually insane.

1234
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,320
Well, I'm not insane but I am sorry,

1235
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,250
I don't know why I did it. Not really.

1236
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,100
I've told you.

1237
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,520
Because you were unhappy so you wanted
me to be unhappy, too.

1238
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,370
Now you're happy again, you'll be nicer...
for a while.

1239
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,970
If that's what you feel, then why
are you here?

1240
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,710
Because, in the end, you're my sister

1241
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,100
and one day, only we will remember Sybil...

1242
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:15,595
.. Or Mama or Papa or Matthew

1243
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:19,145
or Michael or Granny or Carson

1244
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:23,060
or any of the others who have
peopled our youth...

1245
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,380
.. Until, at last,

1246
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,440
our shared memories will mean more

1247
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:32,130
than our mutual dislike.

1248
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,900
What do you think he'd have made of it?

1249
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:46,950
I went to his grave to tell him,

1250
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,690
which isn't like me.

1251
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:54,210
Matthew loved you and
wanted you to be happy.

1252
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:58,670
I'm sure he'd be very, very pleased.

1253
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,630
In fact, I know he would.

1254
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,420
You look nice, by the way.

1255
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,120
Thank you.

1256
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,600
You'd better go in and find a seat.
I'll wait for her here.

1257
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,530
Amelia said you called on her.

1258
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:31,110
Yes. I did. We were talking about Larry.

1259
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:33,060
Really? Was it productive?

1260
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,480
That rather depends on him.

1261
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,215
But surely she was -

1262
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:39,450
The ball is in Larry's court, Lord Merton,

1263
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,820
only he can play it.

1264
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:58,580
Those whom God hath joined together

1265
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,010
let no man put asunder.

1266
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,325
For as much as Henry and Mary

1267
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,810
have consented together in Holy Wedlock

1268
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,510
and have witnessed the same before
God and this company...

1269
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,930
.. And thereto have given and pledged

1270
01:13:18,965 --> 01:13:21,850
their troth either to other,

1271
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:23,900
and have declared the same

1272
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:27,860
by giving and receiving of a ring,

1273
01:13:27,895 --> 01:13:30,160
and by joining of hands...

1274
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:35,030
.. I pronounce that they be man
and wife together.

1275
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:38,500
In the Name of the Father,

1276
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:43,080
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

1277
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:45,430
- Amen. - Amen.

1278
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,680
Amen.

1279
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,760
Congratulations, Henry!

1280
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,070
Thank you.

1281
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,770
That was a treat, but we'll pay for it now

1282
01:14:00,805 --> 01:14:03,240
if we don't get home to serve the breakfast.

1283
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,170
Well, Mr Talbot. You have swept me
off my feet.

1284
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,670
- I promise you won't be sorry.
- I'd better not be.

1285
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:21,280
There they go, a new couple in a new world.

1286
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,040
It seems all our ships are coming into port.

1287
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,710
- And Edith?
- Of all my children,

1288
01:14:32,745 --> 01:14:35,892
Edith has given me the most surprises.

1289
01:14:35,927 --> 01:14:39,040
Yes, surprises of the most mixed variety.

1290
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:41,270
A surprise is a surprise, Mama,

1291
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,620
and I'm sure we haven't seen
the last one yet.
