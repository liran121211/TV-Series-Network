1
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,919
But what are they paying to
see? We have nothing to show 'em.

2
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:05,296
A decent Reynolds, a couple
of Romneys and a Winterhalter.

3
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,322
That's your lot. They'd do better

4
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:10,533
- visiting the Tate.
- That's not the point.

5
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:13,723
People want to see a different sort
of home. It's not the things in it.

6
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:17,754
- How the other half lives?
- If you like. There's curiosity.

7
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:21,370
- Dr Clarkson, what do you feel?
- Keeping people healthy takes a lot

8
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:24,872
of money in this day and age. We
could raise more than you think.

9
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:27,522
Robert, we are opening
for one day for charity,

10
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:30,930
and there's an end to it. Mary
and Tom have made the decision.

11
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:33,798
Ah. I know well enough
that when Mary has spoken,

12
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,000
my opinion has little
bearing on the matter.

13
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,120
You don't really mind, do you?

14
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:40,624
No, but I think it's crackers.

15
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,978
I don't like it. Poking and
prying around the house.

16
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,552
What's to stop them slipping the odd
first edition into their back pockets?

17
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:51,005
You've a very poor opinion
of your fellow man.

18
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,374
I have the opinion that
life has taught me.

19
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:56,709
But I don't see why anyone would
pay good money to come and look.

20
00:01:56,792 --> 00:02:00,190
- You're not curious about how other people live.
- No. I'm not.

21
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:04,232
And if you'd the chance to see the private
rooms of the King and Queen, would you pay?

22
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:08,222
But what would it tell me? They sleep
in a bed, they eat at a table. So do I.

23
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:12,046
I always wonder whether someone else
is having a better time than I am.

24
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:15,994
But that's what's so dangerous. You
think they must be having a better time.

25
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,228
Then you want them not
to have a better time.

26
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,675
The next thing you know, there's a
guillotine in Trafalgar Square.

27
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,292
Ever the optimist

28
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,502
I think all these houses
should be open to the public.

29
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:27,164
What gives them the
right to keep people out?

30
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,492
The law of property,
which is the cornerstone

31
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,985
of any civilisation worthy of the name.

32
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:34,230
Well, to me, it could be a good thing.

33
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:38,438
To let them enjoy fine craftsmanship
and beautiful paintings.

34
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,088
But then, of course, they're
bound to start asking,

35
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,415
"Why have the Crawleys got
all of this and I haven't?"

36
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,792
Thank you, Mr Molesley. I
couldn't have put it better myself.

37
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,120
But why have they, Mr Carson?

38
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,112
How is your job search going, Mr Barrow?

39
00:02:56,565 --> 00:03:01,220
But why should anyone pay to
see a perfectly ordinary house?

40
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:03,786
Not everyone lives in a
house like Downton Abbey.

41
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:08,743
Oh, roll up, roll up, visit
an actual dining room!

42
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:12,317
Complete with a real
life table and chairs!

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,517
People have always tipped the
butler to look 'round a house.

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,718
Even Elizabeth Bennett wanted to
see what Pemberly was like inside.

45
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:21,700
A decision which caused her a
great deal of embarrassment,

46
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,653
if I remember the novel correctly.

47
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,479
And what about Robert?
He's still very ill.

48
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,599
He's on the mend. It's
been a few weeks now.

49
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:33,171
- And Cora's very competent.
- Mmm, yes, she's competent.

50
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:36,257
Leading a revolution
without turning a hair.

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,154
Anyway, it's agreed. Downton Abbey
will open to the public for one day.

52
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,232
Dr Clarkson is very grateful.

53
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:46,398
Clarkson was there? Oh,
so he really has weakened.

54
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:49,391
I prefer to think he
has begun to see sense.

55
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:52,633
You believe that? Even after Robert's life

56
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:56,664
was saved by a hospital being nearby?

57
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:59,813
You think that changes things,
but as Lord Merton pointed out,

58
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,055
Robert would have been treated
there even after the hand-over.

59
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:05,393
Oh? How is Lord Merton?

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,663
As he always is.

61
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:13,373
And you? You weakening?

62
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,555
No.

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,922
Who was it?

64
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:26,423
Bertie Pelham. He's going to be in London
on the 11th, and he wanted to meet up.

65
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:29,572
Why don't you ask him to stop in here
on his way back to Northumberland?

66
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:32,149
- If you'd like to.
- I would rather.

67
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,518
- Is he worth it?
- As opposed to your car mechanic?

68
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,928
I'm a car mechanic, thank you.

69
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,139
We're opening the house that
weekend. He may have some ideas.

70
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,446
Well, I'll ask him.

71
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:58,499
I should go.

72
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,284
I'm late as it is. I'll be back tomorrow.

73
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:05,118
Don't feel you must look in every day.
You should be working for your exams.

74
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,560
- It can't be long now.
- Not too long, no.

75
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:10,023
Are you nervous? I should be.

76
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:14,304
I do know it. The question is, can
I summon it up when the time comes?

77
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,205
- Where are you taking them?
- The school.

78
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:19,790
The headmaster will oversee it. Mr
Molesley's settling the details.

79
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:24,071
- You owe him a great deal.
- I know. But he's enjoyed it, too.

80
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:29,173
- This is for Mrs Patmore.
- What is it?

81
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:31,656
A note to thank her. I'm grateful.

82
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:35,251
- She already knows that.
- It never hurts to say it.

83
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,743
You don't want to encourage her.
She's too curious for her own good.

84
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:41,340
Just give her the note.

85
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:45,683
Oh. This is good of you.

86
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:48,624
You should've let one of
the footmen bring it up.

87
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,294
I wanted to see how you are, My Lord,

88
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,196
and... I thought you
might fancy some of this.

89
00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:00,012
Crumbs. That looks frightening.

90
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:04,595
It's, uh, a little Chateau
Chasse-Spleen, My Lord.

91
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,704
I put it in this for ease of carriage.

92
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,187
Chasse Spleen? Now you're talking.

93
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,775
I believe it was a
favourite of Lord Byron's.

94
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:15,027
He knew a thing or two
about wine. And women.

95
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:22,965
But do you know, Carson, I think
I'm going to have to say no.

96
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,698
- Really, my Lord?
- I'm afraid so.

97
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,033
Sometimes in life
sacrifices have to be made,

98
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,681
and I think the time has
come for me to accept

99
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,842
that I cannot go on as I used to.

100
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,336
I am very sorry to hear
you say so, My Lord.

101
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:39,840
Not as sorry as I am.

102
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:44,619
And speaking of necessary sacrifices, I've
been thinking about things, lying here.

103
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,851
We must get on with
simplifying the household.

104
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:51,311
I know we've talked about it,
but we haven't really done much.

105
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:54,636
Oh, the new maids live in the
village, and so cost a lot less.

106
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,618
And we only have one
groom and a stable boy.

107
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,702
But we still have an under butler and
two footmen. In this day and age.

108
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:05,983
I do believe that Mr Barrow has genuinely
been looking for other employment.

109
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:09,225
But not finding it. Is there
anything we can do to help?

110
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:11,459
I'll speak to him, My Lord.

111
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:16,446
What do you think of the plan
to open the house for a day?

112
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:19,480
I think it's a dangerous
precedent, since you ask,

113
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:22,265
but I'm not sure how useful
it is of me to say so.

114
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,927
Dangerous? I think it's idiotic.

115
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,922
It adds up to the same thing, My Lord.

116
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:31,575
- It's a mistake. I suppose it's too late to stop it now.
- Far too late.

117
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:35,991
But what on earth can we show them to give them
their money's worth? Lady Grantham knitting?

118
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:40,355
Lady Mary in the bath?

119
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,839
What's this?

120
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,073
Oh, it's addressed to me.

121
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,328
Oh, it's from Mr Mason.

122
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,936
- How did it get there?
- I wondered where I'd put it.

123
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:56,430
- He asked me to give you it.
- Well, why didn't you, then?

124
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:00,097
I couldn't find it. It must have
fallen in the rubbish by mistake.

125
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,789
- Why had it been opened?
- Had it?

126
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:10,363
Whatever happened to that man?
Do you know what his sentence was?

127
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,203
- Ten years, m'lady.
- Ten years? My goodness.

128
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,736
I know. I'm glad in a way I didn't
have to testify against him now.

129
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:21,334
Good night, Baxter.

130
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:32,618
Are you here? What time is it?

131
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,987
It's late. Go back to sleep.

132
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:39,091
I think we ought to ask
Mama to come and see me.

133
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:43,840
- She must be feeling rather left out.
- Her mind is on other things.

134
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:48,121
She's hoping your operation will
persuade people over to her side.

135
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:52,111
I would have died if I'd
had to be taken to York.

136
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:56,475
But they'd still operate here in
an emergency, so nothing's changed.

137
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:59,042
Well, let's not make it worse.

138
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:02,315
I'm afraid it must get worse
before it gets better.

139
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,471
What about a fire?

140
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,633
It's a bit indulgent, but we've earned it.

141
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,301
- Not for me. I'm going to bed.
- You're not feeling ill, are you?

142
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:18,867
Anna, if you're not
well, you must tell me.

143
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,943
We've finished with this business
of your keeping me in the dark.

144
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,727
- I'm not ill exactly.
- Have you told Lady Mary?

145
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,832
- I didn't like to bother her.
- Bother her first thing.

146
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:29,649
I could tell Dr Clarkson.

147
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:32,500
No. You're seeing Dr Ryder
if you're seeing anybody.

148
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:34,328
Don't be silly. We can't afford that.

149
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,869
- I can't expect Lady Mary to keep shelling out.
- I'll pay. I have savings.

150
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:42,017
- We're selling a house, aren't we?
- Yes. To buy another house.

151
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:45,259
Now you're the one being
silly. Talk to her tomorrow.

152
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,878
She'll agree with me. And I'm paying.

153
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,406
I wouldn't mind having
breakfast here sometimes.

154
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,240
- Not every day, but sometimes.
- I don't think anyone would object.

155
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,141
How are you at making coffee?

156
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:01,635
I can make coffee. It's not very hard.

157
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:05,012
That's where you're wrong.
There's quite an art to it.

158
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:08,316
Uh, you might like to have
a word with Mrs Patmore.

159
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,737
Of course. If you'd like me to.

160
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:14,530
And I want to start bringing
things a little more up to standard.

161
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,886
I wonder if we could have the
hall boy to do some polishing.

162
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:19,798
I don't see why not.

163
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,591
And you might ask one of the
maids about making the bed.

164
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:29,243
- Isn't that good enough, either?
- It's not bad. I didn't mean that.

165
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,069
But I do like those sharp corners.

166
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,103
Well. I'm glad it's not bad.

167
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,335
I wish you'd told me before.

168
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,211
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- What does Bates say?

169
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:44,725
He wants me to see Dr Ryder again.

170
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:48,237
He wants to pay, but it
seems an extravagance to me.

171
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm happy to talk to Dr Clarkson.

172
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:54,129
No, let's go to London. I'm
sure Dr Clarkson could manage it,

173
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:56,914
- but I feel like a jaunt.
- And stay the night?

174
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:59,865
With Lady Rosamund. Pack
something for the evening.

175
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,899
Medium smart. I'll make
some telephone calls.

176
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,227
- I got your message. What's happened?
- I'll ring for some coffee.

177
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,126
You sound as if you should
ring for some smelling salts.

178
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,328
If you mean is it serious, it is.

179
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,573
I received a letter this morning
from the Board of Governors.

180
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:18,390
Go on

181
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,059
They are going to combine us with York.

182
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:25,226
- As we knew they must.
- Indeed. I am to remain in my post here.

183
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,125
- Good.
- Mrs Crawley is to stay on as our almoner.

184
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:30,618
- Very sensible.
- But they want to offer

185
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,736
- the role of president to you.
- Me? Why?

186
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,354
You made a good impression
when you went into York.

187
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,973
I don't understand. What about Mama?

188
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,851
Lady Grantham is to be, and I quote,

189
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:46,381
"Allowed to step down after so
many years of noble service. "

190
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,485
Golly. They've sacked the Captain.

191
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:54,808
You can see their point. How could they have
someone in the management of the new system

192
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,510
who thinks the whole idea
is a horrible mistake?

193
00:11:57,562 --> 00:12:00,170
- And you support this notion?
- Of course he does.

194
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:02,331
He put your name forward as replacement.

195
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:04,617
Lady Grantham is not as young as she was,

196
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:09,041
and, as Mrs Crawley says, I'm afraid she'd be
almost willing the new regime to fail.

197
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:09,389
Probably.

198
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:13,439
Besides, I want to involve the new president
in the logistics of running things.

199
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:15,880
And she would never have
agreed to take that on.

200
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,416
So, I'm to step into her
shoes and then be given

201
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,286
more responsibility than she had?

202
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,769
We both think you'd be marvellous.

203
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:25,523
And who's going to tell her?

204
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:28,692
They'll write, as soon
as they hear back from me.

205
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:31,882
I need to talk to Lord Grantham.

206
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,791
The thing is, we don't want someone
to come up with another name.

207
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:39,058
Don't we? It might be easier
all round if they did.

208
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,128
Good. I'll see you at 8:00.

209
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,915
Don't tell him it's me.

210
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,994
I want to be the surprise guest.

211
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:51,331
Oh, you'll think of something.

212
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:53,202
All right, bye.

213
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,265
So this is the urgent business
that takes m'lady to London town?

214
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,841
- It's not the only thing.
- But it is getting serious.

215
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:02,211
Dinner with Evelyn
Napier at the Criterion?

216
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:03,873
Doesn't sound very serious to me.

217
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,910
I used to go to the
Criterion with Michael.

218
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:08,528
Do you have to put a damper on
every restaurant in the capital?

219
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,978
As a matter of fact, I have
very happy memories of it.

220
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,430
Send him my best wishes. I
hope to see him again soon.

221
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:16,799
Oh, Evelyn? Yes, send him my love, too.

222
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:19,490
Evelyn or whoever else might be there.

223
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:23,117
Why don't you come with me?
It'll be fun. I dare you.

224
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,649
- You haven't been anywhere in ages.
- All right. I'll go and pack.

225
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,725
We can't be too long. I want to be
sure we're ready for the opening.

226
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:32,510
Oh, we've masses of time for
that. We'll be home tomorrow.

227
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,837
Edith, you can manage for a
day without us, can't you?

228
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,006
I can manage without you
for as long as you want.

229
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:40,938
Why don't you come with us?

230
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:44,339
And watch Mary flirt with her oily driver? No, thank you.

231
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,506
- Can't you be pleased for her?
- I'm as pleased for her as she would be for me.

232
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,247
Barrow, you mustn't let him wear you out.

233
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,281
Oh, he's all right, m'lady. Aren't you?

234
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,814
- I was cheering him up.
- That's not what it looked like.

235
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,975
Do you need cheering up, Barrow?

236
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:05,459
We all need it sometimes, m'lady.

237
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:10,218
I mean it, George. You must let
Mr Barrow get on with his work.

238
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:12,950
Again, again...

239
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,912
All right. And off we go!

240
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:32,287
We're off. I'm taking Tom.
It's time he had a break.

241
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,194
Oh, I envy you. I'm so sick
of this room, I could scream.

242
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:41,473
Barrow was in the gallery, looking
rather glum. Do we know why?

243
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:44,798
We've talked about making
changes in the household.

244
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,988
Carson and I both feel
he's the obvious candidate.

245
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,609
You're not going to sack him?

246
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:51,853
I hope not. I hope he's
going to find another job.

247
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:55,563
Oh. I see. Well, that explains it.

248
00:14:56,643 --> 00:14:58,669
He's awfully sweet with
George and the girls.

249
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:02,628
- You do know that?
- And when George is older, he can ask him back.

250
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,444
Goodbye, darling.

251
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:09,278
- Get some rest.
- Rest.

252
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:13,840
Don't worry, Bates.
We'll have her home soon.

253
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:16,874
I don't think there'll be anything
to concern ourselves about.

254
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,578
Anna has an appointment this evening.

255
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,612
I'll telephone you
after. Mr Mead won't mind.

256
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,675
I'm very grateful to you,
m'lady, for arranging it,

257
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:28,013
but Anna will ask him to send me the bill.

258
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,475
Dr Ryder was my idea, not yours.

259
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:33,759
And it was a good idea, m'lady.
An idea that has brought us

260
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,824
to within shouting distance
of our greatest happiness.

261
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:39,650
But I can pay my way, and I'd
be more comfortable to do so.

262
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:42,362
Very well. We won't fight about it.

263
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,342
- Will you miss me?
- I miss you when you're out of sight, never mind London.

264
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,168
I'm glad to hear it, Mr Bates.

265
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:59,444
I won't let them send him the bill.

266
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:03,476
That's not kind. His pride is more
important to him than the money.

267
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,502
Thank you, Mr Branson.

268
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:14,656
Mr Barrow, in 20 years' time,

269
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,597
I doubt there's one footman
working at Downton.

270
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,888
Lady Edith already manages without her
own maid, and if Anna were to leave,

271
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:25,006
I doubt that Lady Mary would replace her.

272
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:28,289
- It's not just you.
- But I am the first.

273
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,358
But you are the under butler,

274
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:35,472
a post that is fragrant with
memories of a lost world.

275
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:38,631
No-one is sorrier to say it than I am,

276
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:42,372
- but you are not a creature of today.
- And you are?

277
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:46,861
I don't believe that a house like
Downton could be run without a butler.

278
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,978
In that sense, yes, I am.

279
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:54,882
- Oh, you're busy.
- No, no. We're finished, Mrs Hughes.

280
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,210
Or at least one of us is.

281
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,620
Good day, Mr Carson.

282
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,933
I thought we might have our
dinner at the cottage tonight.

283
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:11,632
- If you like.
- Perhaps you could get some guidance from Mrs Patmore?

284
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:14,157
It doesn't have to be
anything very complicated.

285
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,952
Doesn't it? That's a relief.

286
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,966
I'll give you the date
as soon as I have it.

287
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:26,792
Right. I'm quite excited. How mad is that?

288
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:29,535
Can Mrs Patmore spare Daisy for the day?

289
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:32,070
For it will be the whole
day. There are six papers.

290
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:36,528
Oh, they'll spare her. Everyone there thinks she's
taking the right step. Especially Her Ladyship.

291
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:40,144
I hope they appreciate your role
in all this. You've been very kind.

292
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,134
Well, I think it's because I
missed the boat that I feel

293
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:46,991
it's so important for others to catch it.

294
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,449
Mr Molesley, I've had an idea.

295
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:55,013
- What would you say to helping me out?
- What?

296
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,465
I'm not necessarily
suggesting you might teach.

297
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,419
I need a clearer idea of what you know.

298
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:01,788
But I like your respect for education.

299
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,040
I like your enthusiasm, and I
want to harness it if I can.

300
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:08,563
Oh, I don't know what to say.

301
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:11,773
First you can decide if you'd
sit a test of my own devising,

302
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:15,129
of general knowledge as much as anything.

303
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,333
This is kind of you, Mama, but
as you can see, I'm miles better.

304
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:26,570
I assumed it was a good sign that
I hadn't been summoned in haste.

305
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,516
Anyway, I'm here and I'm glad
of the chance to talk about

306
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,591
this mad scheme of opening the house.

307
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:36,867
It's all fixed, Mama. By Mary.

308
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:42,031
Well, why anyone would come
beats me, but, since it is,

309
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:46,728
should I cut a ribbon when
the doors are flung open?

310
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:48,322
Uh, well...

311
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:51,632
As president of the hospital,
I ought to have a formal role.

312
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,617
That is why we are raising funds.

313
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:59,695
I don't believe we need a ceremony. The doors will
be open from 9:00. Who'd want to get here for then?

314
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:03,311
- Well, it wouldn't kill me.
- No, but it might kill us.

315
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:06,927
Oh, well, let me know what you decide.

316
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,086
The patients are my priority.

317
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:14,699
As president, I am their
representative on earth.

318
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:17,848
I have a feeling your
collapse will have changed

319
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,222
a lot of people's minds
about the so-called reforms.

320
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:25,963
Don't worry. I shall be
magnanimous in victory.

321
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:32,456
Is everything ready for tonight?

322
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:36,248
I think so. You're not
expecting a banquet, are you?

323
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:39,532
I'm expecting a delicious dinner
prepared by the fair hands

324
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,693
of my beautiful wife.

325
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:43,844
There's a threat in there somewhere.

326
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:48,010
I don't understand. He wants you
to sit the exam as well as Daisy?

327
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:51,668
Oh, no. Not matric. He wants
to assess my general knowledge.

328
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:55,076
- With a view to...
- He wasn't very specific.

329
00:19:56,448 --> 00:20:00,230
I'd guess he didn't want to make
a promise he might have to break.

330
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:02,090
Are you going to take the test?

331
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:06,173
If Mr Carson gives me the time
off. What have I got to lose?

332
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,434
We'll meet upstairs after our
dinner. My room or yours?

333
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:17,645
- I don't mind.
- Mine, then. The lighting's better.

334
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,308
You're back. I thought I was
going to have to dress myself.

335
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,135
I am so sorry, m'lady. Only,
I could not get a bus.

336
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:36,088
Never mind. What did he say?

337
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,964
It's fine. Standard pregnancy pain.
Something to do with the ligament,

338
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:42,323
- but don't ask me what.
- I won't.

339
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:46,032
He gave me exercises and suggested
a warm towel if it lingers,

340
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:48,141
but it's just the body adjusting.

341
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:51,685
I don't think ligaments were invented
when I was having Master George.

342
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,586
Master George does make me laugh.

343
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:55,539
He rules Mr Barrow with a rod of iron.

344
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:58,033
Yes, Barrow's rather
sweet with the children.

345
00:20:58,085 --> 00:21:00,236
Do you think he's trying
to get in with us?

346
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:06,647
I'd say he's genuine, m'lady. I doubt he'll have
any children of his own, and he enjoys their company.

347
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:10,014
Miss Marigold's fitted
in surprisingly well.

348
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:13,796
- Yes, but then they're all...
- They're all what?

349
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:17,277
They're all clever and pleasant.

350
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:20,020
What were you going to say?

351
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,264
Just what I did say, m'lady.

352
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:25,340
Now, has Mr Talbot found
out you're coming tonight?

353
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:29,288
No. I suppose I should
have jumped out of a cake.

354
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,458
But then you'd have to wait for
the pudding before you saw him.

355
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:36,780
I must give Clarkson an answer, or
Mama will find out some other way,

356
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:39,014
before the letter arrives.

357
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,347
This is a secret, Baxter.

358
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,880
- Of course. Will that be all?
- Yes, thank you.

359
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:53,592
That was high risk.

360
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,346
Not really. She won't talk.

361
00:21:56,897 --> 00:22:00,429
- Anyway, it'll be public soon.
- I suppose you want to accept?

362
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:04,502
I do. But not if it will upset you.

363
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:07,807
Mama's the one who'll be
upset when she's deposed.

364
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,527
Although the fact you're the
usurper who's stolen her throne

365
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,382
- will clearly make it worse.
- But if that wasn't an element?

366
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,000
I only worry if it's too much for you.

367
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:20,868
It sounds as if Clarkson
almost wants you to work there.

368
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,624
So?

369
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:26,676
I've had one career already,
bringing up my daughters.

370
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,638
They don't need me now,
so I'm ready for the next.

371
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,264
The girls still need you. But
anyway, isn't it time for a rest?

372
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:35,290
- You're not like Isobel.
- In what way?

373
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:37,773
I only mean you don't need a job.

374
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,735
I don't think she needs a
job. I think she wants a job.

375
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:42,938
She enjoys it, so would I.

376
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,011
- I'm not old, Robert.
- I didn't say you were.

377
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:48,601
Didn't you?

378
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,565
If Anna says she doesn't know
anything, I'm sure she doesn't.

379
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,394
Why must there be something to know?

380
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:09,854
If I find out you knew and didn't
tell me, I'd be terribly upset.

381
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:12,462
- I'd see it as a real betrayal.
- Don't say that.

382
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:13,557
So you are in on it.

383
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,326
Welcome.

384
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,261
- Evelyn!
- My hand is complete.

385
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:17,399
Darling.

386
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:20,059
Heavens. We are quite a party.

387
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:24,318
You know Lady Anne Acland,
Mrs Dupper and Mrs McVeigh?

388
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:28,713
Anne and I shared a governess,
and Jill and I came out together.

389
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:33,077
Small world. You know Henry Talbot, and I
think you met Charlie Rogers up at Brancaster.

390
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:37,119
- We've met again since then.
- This is Mary's brother-in-law, Tom Branson.

391
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:39,426
- Hello.
- You're over here.

392
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:44,185
I shall read lots into your wanting
to be a surprise. Am I right?

393
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:49,702
A table of singletons
at our age, well done.

394
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:52,185
Single now, we're all war widows.

395
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:55,614
I am not a war widow. Good
to see you again, Mr Rogers.

396
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,555
You, too. Although I haven't
been allowed to forget you.

397
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:00,758
Henry talks of nothing and nobody else.

398
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,168
Oh, I didn't think he knew
enough about me for that.

399
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,961
- Tell me, are you pleased with your progress this season?
- I certainly am.

400
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:10,909
- We're both driving at Brooklands next month.
- In the car you tested in Yorkshire?

401
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,684
Exactly. See? We'll get
you interested yet.

402
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:16,053
- No, you won't.
- Well, you've got me interested.

403
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,547
- Would you want to come?
- I don't get down to London much.

404
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:22,079
Well, you're here tonight. Why not come
specially? Watch from the pits with the team.

405
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:25,747
- Yes, I think you'd enjoy it.
- I know I'd enjoy it. Mary?

406
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,438
- Tom, you should go if you like.
- And what about you?

407
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,649
Well, I don't keep my diary in
my head. Ask me nearer the time.

408
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:38,247
How are we doing?

409
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,147
Ah, what is it?

410
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:49,563
Um, Glenvere smoked salmon, from
last night's upstairs dinner.

411
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,542
- Lemon?
- Oh.

412
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:55,246
- I don't believe it.
- What?

413
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:59,372
Mrs Patmore gave me two lemons, and
I left them on the kitchen table.

414
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:03,694
I'll tell you what would be
nice with this. Some horseradish,

415
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:06,271
thinned with a little soured cream.

416
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:10,968
I agree. That would be heavenly.
Except that we don't have any.

417
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,700
- Ah.
- What are we drinking with it?

418
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:16,319
The thing is, I don't
think we should drink.

419
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,937
Not if His Lordship feels
obliged to give it up.

420
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:22,273
But His Lordship is suffering
from a burst ulcer. We're not.

421
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,005
I know, I know. But
somehow it feels disloyal.

422
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,039
He is my officer, and I
should follow his lead.

423
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:31,313
- And it won't make you grumpy?
- I don't think so.

424
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:34,326
What's next?

425
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:38,524
- Duck.
- Oh.

426
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:42,877
Is the skin crispy like Mrs Patmore
does it? Did you ask her advice?

427
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:45,953
We certainly talked about what
it's like to cook dinner for you.

428
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:49,060
- Ah, I bet she had a lot to say.
- We both did.

429
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:56,137
- Good night. Shall I get us a taxi?
- Well, it's such a lovely night.

430
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:58,257
Why don't I walk you back?
Where are you based?

431
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,584
We're staying with my
aunt in Belgrave Square.

432
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,857
- Perfect. What do you say?
- I think it'd be nice.

433
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:08,242
Except I have a lot of reading to do,
so I might just go straight back.

434
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:10,809
- Only if you're sure, Tom.
- I'm sure.

435
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,261
- He'd better be sure.
- Well, I hope we meet again.

436
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:17,428
Perhaps at Brooklands. You'd have a good
time. It's really quite swanky these days.

437
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,911
How enchanting you make it sound.

438
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:21,948
Goodbye, Evelyn.

439
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,369
- You're a darling.
- Shall we?

440
00:26:29,315 --> 00:26:31,091
I hope you will come south next month.

441
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:35,632
Partly to watch me driving of course,
but mainly so that I can see you.

442
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:40,942
- And I know you're not interested in racing.
- It's not only that.

443
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,002
I don't know why I haven't
told you before now,

444
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:46,246
but...

445
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:48,573
Matthew died in a car crash.

446
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,275
Yes, I know. Evelyn told me.

447
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:55,016
- So you understand.
- Of course I understand.

448
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:59,265
The car is your enemy. But it's my friend,

449
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:02,840
and all I ask is that you
give it a second chance.

450
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:07,287
After all, it's not as if you're
driving around in a Hansom cab.

451
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:11,485
Excellent. Um, in here.

452
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:36,464
Heavens, Mr Talbot. Is this
part of your plan to convince me?

453
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:40,319
Look. You don't have
to if you don't want to.

454
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:44,527
- Plenty of drivers' wives never go near the race track.
- Wives?

455
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:47,218
I only meant that if we do get involved,

456
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,463
it doesn't have to be part of the plan.

457
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,375
It's not compulsory.

458
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:53,661
But you'd like me there to watch?

459
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,747
Yes, but only so I can be near you.

460
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,103
Henry, to be honest,

461
00:28:00,155 --> 00:28:02,971
this is moving much
faster than I'd imagined.

462
00:28:03,023 --> 00:28:06,389
Look, I know I'm not what you're after.

463
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:10,462
My prospects are modest
at best, and you...

464
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:14,286
Well, you're a great catch.

465
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:20,438
But you're also a woman that I
happen to be falling in love with.

466
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,708
Gosh, that sounds rather
feeble, doesn't it?

467
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,667
No, not at all. As an argument,
I think it's rather compelling.

468
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:32,283
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

469
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,888
It doesn't show any signs of stopping.

470
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,226
- No.
- Should we run for it?

471
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:40,803
Well, you're the boss.

472
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:45,625
Come on. Careful.

473
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,932
- Were you caught in the rain?
- Not too badly.

474
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:55,038
We dashed for cover till
it slackened off a bit.

475
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:59,205
- How romantic.
- Why are you playing Cupid?

476
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:03,902
He's nice, he's mad about you and
he loves cars. I rest my case.

477
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:05,772
I don't see how it would work.

478
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:10,469
Why? He'll have to settle down eventually, go
into business. Why couldn't he do it from Downton?

479
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:12,630
- I know...
- He won't be as rich as you.

480
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:14,417
He won't be as rich as your child.

481
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:18,106
But he's a gentleman. And if
I say that, it must be true.

482
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:21,784
- Would you like a drink?
- Just a tiny glass of whisky and water.

483
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:26,678
- When does Edith's beau arrive?
- Friday.

484
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,003
- Just in time to interfere with the opening.
- I liked him when we met.

485
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:33,630
- He seemed a decent sort.
- But boring to an Olympic degree.

486
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,931
If Edith's happy, it
improves things for everyone.

487
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:41,682
She's so stupid to have
saddled herself with a child.

488
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:45,309
I mean, Marigold's sweet, but why
would any man want to take her on?

489
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,955
I thought you'd forgotten me.

490
00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:04,417
Thank God I've found you.

491
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,285
The car wouldn't start, so I
had to get Stark to do it.

492
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:10,402
I'm glad I don't have to walk
the whole length of the drive.

493
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,886
- Hop in.
- I will. But first...

494
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:21,094
That feels so nice and automatic.

495
00:30:21,718 --> 00:30:24,502
- Which is good?
- It is for me.

496
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,264
I hope you don't mind my taking a chance,

497
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:35,433
but I got your letter and
I wanted to discuss it.

498
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:38,665
This is Miss Cruikshank.
She's engaged to Larry.

499
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:42,541
- Yes. I saw it in the papers.
- I know I've rather pushed in,

500
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,271
- but I did so want to meet you.
- Does your fiance know you're here?

501
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,346
I gather you and he haven't exactly
seen eye to eye in the past.

502
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:50,926
Not exactly, no.

503
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:55,924
As you can imagine, I was amazed and very pleased
when she asked if she could join me to pay a call.

504
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:58,947
You mustn't blame him.
It was completely my idea.

505
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:01,576
Mmm. Well, life is full of surprises.

506
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:04,557
I know you and Larry rather got off on the wrong foot.

507
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,558
That's one way of describing it.

508
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,388
Well, please know not all of Lord
Merton's family feel the same way.

509
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,475
Goodness.

510
00:31:13,953 --> 00:31:17,590
After that, I don't know if I
can concentrate on business.

511
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,551
I wondered if old Lady Grantham
had received the letter.

512
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:25,424
Not that I've heard of. Although Dr Clarkson
has told them that Cora is happy to serve.

513
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:28,947
Uh, only we're coming to the house
opening on Saturday to support it.

514
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:31,150
Well, don't say anything if you see her.

515
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:35,192
I hate things like this. We'll all come
off very badly when she does find out.

516
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:38,049
I'm afraid that's probably true.

517
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:43,203
It's odd to think you'll be sitting
side by side, writing exams.

518
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:45,406
Well, my paper won't be
anything like as long as Daisy's.

519
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,484
- She's got six to do.
- Thanks.

520
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:50,476
I admire you, Daisy. To give
yourself a second chance.

521
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,804
When the time comes,
Daisy'll need some lunch.

522
00:31:52,856 --> 00:31:54,799
- Maybe I will, as well.
- Well, I've thought of that.

523
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:56,918
I'll do lunch for Mr Dawes, too.

524
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,960
You could ask Mr Mason to join
you on the day. He'd enjoy that.

525
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,402
Don't bother him, not when
he's got so much work to do.

526
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,821
I'll tell him as soon as we have a
date. See if he'd like to look in.

527
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:09,138
I don't understand why you
can't just leave him alone.

528
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,055
- Daisy, that's not very gracious.
- Well, I don't!

529
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:17,658
It's nerves. She's worked
long enough for this moment.

530
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,653
It's partially nerves, yes.

531
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:24,485
But I don't think it's all nerves.
And I will write a note to Mr Mason.

532
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:34,076
This is nice. Now we can go down together.

533
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:36,736
- Less nervous making.
- Absolutely.

534
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,437
But I was going to look
into the night nursery first.

535
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:41,858
- Can I come?
- Of course.

536
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,139
Good evening, Nanny.

537
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,290
- This is Mr Pelham.
- Good evening, sir.

538
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,534
- Good evening.
- M'lady, could you be here

539
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:53,870
- while I just run down to the sewing room?
- Of course.

540
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,057
This is Mary's son, George,

541
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,975
and my late sister
Sybil's daughter, Sybbie.

542
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,495
And this is Marigold.

543
00:33:09,497 --> 00:33:11,742
God bless you, Marigold.

544
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:15,420
What a lovely place this is to grow up.

545
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:17,020
I hope so.

546
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:23,660
I'm an experienced housemaid and a housekeeper for
how many years? And he doesn't think I can make a bed.

547
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,611
Well, you always knew he was
old to be trained as a husband.

548
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:28,897
- Good evening.
- What are you doing here?

549
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:30,435
I thought I'd look in.

550
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,812
- What's that for?
- I brought these to say thank you to Mrs Patmore.

551
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:37,344
- You've already said thank you.
- That's very nice of you, Mr Mason.

552
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:40,327
Why bother? Have you seen
the kitchen gardens here?

553
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:44,036
There's enough vegetables to feed an
army. You need 'em more than we do.

554
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,359
Oh, never mind her, Mr Mason.
I think it's a lovely thing,

555
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:51,258
to have fresh farm vegetables just for me.

556
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,970
I'll make soup and stock and all sorts.

557
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:56,283
Well...

558
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,278
I'll leave you to it.

559
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:04,138
You've probably thought of
this, but I'd place someone,

560
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,466
maybe a servant, in each
room the public will enter.

561
00:34:06,518 --> 00:34:08,378
- Just to keep an eye on things.
- Literally.

562
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,370
- I think that's a good idea.
- Carson, can you sort it out?

563
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:14,706
Of course, m'lady. I understand
it's only the ground floor.

564
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:17,812
And not too much of that. They'll
start in the small library,

565
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:20,348
then through the big library,
into the painted room,

566
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,758
the drawing room, the smoking
room, the great hall,

567
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,670
in and out of the dining
room and back outside.

568
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:27,372
Rope off across the
staircases and the back wing.

569
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:29,367
Who are the guides?

570
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:32,619
Do we need guides? Can't they just
have a look and leave it at that?

571
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:35,861
I don't think so. Not if you
want them to go away happy,

572
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:38,137
and leave behind what's not theirs.

573
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:40,464
Who knows about the history of the house?

574
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:43,841
Only our librarian, Mr
Pattinson, but he's away.

575
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:48,039
You'll have to fake it. Lady
Mary, Edith, Mr Branson...

576
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:51,405
Not me. I don't know a thing.
I'll sell tickets, but that's it.

577
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:55,977
Well, then, Lady Grantham, you and your
daughters can take parties of 10 each,

578
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,378
with no more than 30 in
the house at any one time.

579
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,999
- Crikey.
- Heavens.

580
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,201
I feel like the Belgians
waiting for the invasion.

581
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:04,373
Or the monkeys in a zoo.

582
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:10,846
- Do you all know your positions?
- Are we allowed to sit, Mr Carson?

583
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:13,808
Well, the place will
be open for nine hours.

584
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,707
Find an inconspicuous chair in the corner,

585
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:20,582
but keep a sharp eye out and stand
if any member of the family comes in.

586
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,110
What about the upstairs luncheon?

587
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:25,861
- Sandwiches in Her Ladyship's room.
- We'll set up two of the tea tables.

588
00:35:25,944 --> 00:35:31,264
Mr Molesley can serve, and his place
in the hall will be taken by Daisy.

589
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,706
And look respectable.

590
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:35,213
Right.

591
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,358
Do you know where my walking stick is?

592
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,226
I thought I might equip
myself with it for tomorrow.

593
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:44,512
In case you catch a thief red-handed?

594
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:47,972
You never know. But
it's not at the cottage.

595
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:51,703
And I wonder if it might have
got left behind in my wardrobe.

596
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:55,246
- He knows a lot about everything.
- The trouble is, I think he does.

597
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:58,768
- Did you enjoy our London spree?
- I did.

598
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,636
Have you decided if you're coming
to Brooklands? I will if you will.

599
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:04,255
I know I won't enjoy it one
bit, but at the same time...

600
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:07,122
- You'd like to see him again.
- It's not that.

601
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:09,699
I could see him for a walk in the park.

602
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:13,284
No, I suppose I want to get
over it. To get over myself.

603
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:16,568
He asked me if I'd give cars
another chance. Perhaps I should.

604
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,760
Who is this flexible
and reasonable person?

605
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:21,659
I don't recognise my
own dear sister, Mary.

606
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:24,828
- Could this be love?
- Oh, shut up.

607
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:29,784
He seems nice, and he's certainly
organised. Tom was quite jealous.

608
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:33,400
But what are his prospects? An
agent stuck up in Northumberland

609
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,177
managing someone else's estate?

610
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:37,131
What are Edith's prospects?

611
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:40,508
Oh, I don't know. With her magazine,
I think she could develop into

612
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,783
one of the interesting women of the day.

613
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:46,493
Ten years ago, that very idea
would have filled you with horror.

614
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:49,600
I've changed, you've
changed, the world's changed.

615
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,769
He is a gentleman. You can't
object to him on that score.

616
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:55,959
If she loves him, I don't
object to him on any score.

617
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:57,580
But I don't think we should encourage it.

618
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,364
She took him to meet Marigold,
but she didn't tell him why.

619
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,107
- Nor should she.
- She must eventually.

620
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,799
Let her make that decision for herself.

621
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:10,474
Now, you need some sleep before
your hideous day tomorrow.

622
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,315
Andrew? What were you
doing in Mr Barrow's room?

623
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,892
We were... I was borrowing a book.

624
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:29,832
What book? Where is it?

625
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:34,165
I left it there. I'll get it in the
morning. Good night, Mr Carson.

626
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:50,558
Oh, Andrew, Andrew, place
the table here, please.

627
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,688
Yes, Mr Carson.

628
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:58,070
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

629
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,244
I'm sorry for the wait, can
you form parties of 10?

630
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:23,070
We've been here since 9:00.

631
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:25,762
You are in the next group.

632
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,464
No, the third Earl built it.

633
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:35,872
Well, he didn't really build
it so much as envelope it,

634
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:39,696
because this room is originally medieval.

635
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:42,179
It was the monks' refectory of an abbey

636
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:45,390
that King Henry sold after the
Dissolution of the Monasteries.

637
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:49,276
Is that why it's called Downton Abbey?

638
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,289
I guess so.

639
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,107
Who painted that?

640
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,318
I'm not sure, but this...

641
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,259
This is a Reynolds, so
that is worth looking at.

642
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:07,740
And that's quite good, too.

643
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,943
Tell us about these people.

644
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:14,224
Oh, well, they were all rather marvellous

645
00:39:14,276 --> 00:39:17,518
and sort of living that life.

646
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:20,375
- It's not very cosy, is it?
- Isn't it?

647
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:24,209
It is cosy at night, with
the lamps and the fire.

648
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,820
What about the architect?

649
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:29,529
Sir Charles Barry? Yes, he
built the Houses of Parliament,

650
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:32,501
or at least he finished them.

651
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:37,800
And, you know, he built
lots of lovely big buildings.

652
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:42,164
No, that's him, I think. Or his son.

653
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:44,980
Or it might be his father.

654
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:47,017
Who's the little girl?

655
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:49,729
Ah, the little girl is a little boy,

656
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:53,719
but who I could not say. Ah,
Granny, thank God you're here.

657
00:39:53,802 --> 00:39:56,701
What else could I tell
them about the library?

658
00:39:56,753 --> 00:40:00,618
The library was assembled by
the fourth Earl. He loved books.

659
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:04,858
- What else did he collect?
- Horses and women. Where's your mother?

660
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:07,892
- She's in the great hall.
- Thank you.

661
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:11,289
Excuse me please. Thank you.

662
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:14,396
Why are those shields on
the chimneypiece blank?

663
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,604
Do you know, I've never
really noticed that before.

664
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:21,597
Isn't that strange? I haven't
a clue is the answer.

665
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:23,096
Cora!

666
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:25,587
Excuse me.

667
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:28,257
Did you know when I was last here?

668
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,616
Mama, I think maybe we should...

669
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:33,287
Did you know when I was last here?

670
00:40:36,154 --> 00:40:40,518
And you let me babble on about
my victory? Have you told Robert?

671
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:44,675
- Mama, you of all people don't want to bore our vis...
- Just be quiet.

672
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:47,750
Excuse me.

673
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:53,099
Are you all right?

674
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,547
I was going to see if Her Ladyship
needs anything.

675
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:58,224
She needs a glass of water and a
fan, if you'd heard what I heard.

676
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:03,960
- What is it?
- I've had a letter. From Coyle.

677
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:07,399
- What?
- He wants me to visit him in prison.

678
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:11,067
Well, don't even answer it. Ignore
it completely. Throw it on the fire.

679
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,132
Mr Molesley, there's no-one
on duty in the library!

680
00:41:14,184 --> 00:41:16,127
Right away, Mr Carson.

681
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:27,141
Daisy, can you relieve me? I
ought to get the tables upstairs.

682
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:28,424
What about the sandwiches?

683
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:31,425
- I'll take them up when I've got the tables organised.
- Oh, tablecloths!

684
00:41:34,508 --> 00:41:37,615
You wouldn't believe what happened
up there. In front of everyone.

685
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,610
Oh? Try me.

686
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:44,442
My son's wife, whom I have
treated like a daughter.

687
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:48,671
- Too like.
- That she should connive at my humiliation,

688
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:51,414
should revel as I am cast into the dust.

689
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:55,415
Steady the buffs. Cora doesn't
control this any more than you.

690
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:59,197
You've had different opinions,
but neither of you made it happen.

691
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:02,262
If only Mr Chamberlain had spoken...

692
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:06,335
He was never going to say
a word. The truth is, Mama,

693
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:09,120
officialdom doesn't care
what we think any more.

694
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,240
Our influence is finished.

695
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:15,198
You can say that! You, whose
very life has been saved.

696
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,056
You know dealing with
emergencies won't be affected.

697
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:21,880
- Do be logical.
- I am sick and tired of logic!

698
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:25,246
If I could choose between
principle and logic,

699
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:27,875
I'd take principle every time!

700
00:42:29,374 --> 00:42:31,730
Just tell Cora I do not
wish to see her face

701
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:35,399
until I'm used to having
a traitor in the family!

702
00:42:41,596 --> 00:42:44,048
Why is she in such a tizzy?

703
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:49,368
Well, you know mothers. They get
terribly wrought up about things.

704
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,893
- My mum does.
- There you are.

705
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,857
Mine does too.

706
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,250
May I ask what you're doing here?

707
00:42:59,302 --> 00:43:02,502
I come to see your house.
With my mum and dad.

708
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,359
Do they know where you are?

709
00:43:05,411 --> 00:43:09,775
- No. Why is it so big, your house?
- I'm not sure, really.

710
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:12,924
It's the way they used to manage things.

711
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:15,085
Well, why not buy somewhere comfy?

712
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:17,839
- You must have enough money.
- Maybe.

713
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:22,701
But you know how it is. You
like what you're used to.

714
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:30,131
Why are you in here?

715
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:33,383
- Wouldn't you like to know!
- Cheeky rascal!

716
00:43:33,757 --> 00:43:36,043
Let him go. No harm done.

717
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:39,399
Are you sure, My Lord? Shouldn't
we shake out his pockets?

718
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,187
I don't think so.

719
00:43:41,446 --> 00:43:44,813
He was more of a philosopher than a thief.

720
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,874
- So your house is finished?
- Finished and ready to receive my guests.

721
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:57,604
- And who'll run it day-to-day?
- My niece. My sister's girl.

722
00:43:57,656 --> 00:43:59,848
She's agreed, so I'm all set.

723
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,926
Oh, and how will you attract the visitors?

724
00:44:01,978 --> 00:44:04,004
Put an advertisement in the papers.

725
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:05,999
But how will they get in touch?

726
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:07,662
How do you think?

727
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:12,494
- I've installed a telephone in the house.
- Your own telephone?

728
00:44:12,577 --> 00:44:15,528
My, my. You're blazing a trail now.

729
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:18,926
Have you found anyone
to hit with that yet?

730
00:44:18,977 --> 00:44:21,378
If I had my way, I'd hit the lot of them.

731
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,921
- But it's going all right?
- Well, it seems so.

732
00:44:25,046 --> 00:44:27,002
Mr Carson, can I have a word?

733
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:29,503
- Certainly.
- I'll leave you to it.

734
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:32,517
It's something or nothing.

735
00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:35,270
Only, I'm a bit worried about Andy.

736
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,844
Now, it may be innocent. I'm
not saying I'm infallible.

737
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:42,544
But he's young, and you ought to know.

738
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:47,645
Lady Grantham, how nice.

739
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:50,513
Uh, this is my soon-to-be
daughter in law, Miss Cruikshank.

740
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:54,545
She was curious to see the Abbey, so I
bought her here to support the opening.

741
00:44:54,597 --> 00:44:56,706
I've already taken her
to meet Mrs Crawley.

742
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:58,743
What did your fiance say to that?

743
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:01,912
Forgive me, but I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

744
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:05,143
- Larry isn't Mrs Crawley's enemy.
- No?

745
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:07,388
He gives a marvellous impression of it.

746
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,598
Please tell Mrs Crawley when you
see her that I am her friend.

747
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:14,162
I would never want to stand in
her way. And nor will Larry.

748
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:16,365
I promise. Not while I'm around.

749
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:20,657
- Oh, yes, very interesting.
- Oh, interesting and encouraging.

750
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,514
Yes, I'll leave it at interesting for now.

751
00:45:23,691 --> 00:45:25,634
Good day to you both.

752
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,800
Mama, can I speak to you?

753
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,920
No, you may not.

754
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,220
- Is dinner finished?
- It is.

755
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:44,503
They've had coffee taken up
to Her Ladyship's bedroom,

756
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:46,779
so they don't want us there.

757
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,458
What a day.

758
00:45:53,038 --> 00:45:56,363
- I hope you've thrown away that letter.
- No, not yet.

759
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:59,563
I think you should.

760
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:03,335
- I don't know. I have to think.
- Think about what?

761
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:05,912
Nothing that would interest you.

762
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:08,115
You don't know what might interest me.

763
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:11,783
Well, that's rather what I
want to talk about, Mr Barrow.

764
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,840
Do you want us to leave
you to it, Mr Carson?

765
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:19,835
If you wouldn't mind.

766
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:26,319
I hope you're not planning
to hit me with that.

767
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:30,569
No. But I will not beat about
the bush either, Mr Barrow.

768
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,052
Someone has reported that you seem

769
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:36,014
to have a private
understanding with Andrew.

770
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,874
Not this again.

771
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:40,741
I might not have given it
much mind, but I was upstairs

772
00:46:40,793 --> 00:46:43,609
last night quite late, and
I saw him leave your room.

773
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:46,394
Mr Carson, how long do I have
to work in this house before

774
00:46:46,446 --> 00:46:48,846
- I am given any credit?
- That is all very well,

775
00:46:48,898 --> 00:46:50,966
but we are talking about
a vulnerable young man,

776
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:54,000
- and I must look to his welfare.
- Yes. And if I were to give you

777
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:57,418
my word of honour that nothing took
place of which you would disapprove?

778
00:46:57,502 --> 00:46:59,517
If I could just be sure.

779
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:05,315
So my word is still not good enough,
Mr Carson, after so many years?

780
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:08,266
I only wish it were.

781
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:23,654
Golly, Moses. You astound me.

782
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:27,218
- And all from the sale of tickets?
- It's a great deal of money.

783
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:30,002
I don't suppose we could open
the house on a regular basis?

784
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:32,039
- For charity, you mean?
- No, for us.

785
00:47:32,091 --> 00:47:36,580
The house costs money to run, and at the moment,
it doesn't raise a penny for washing its own face.

786
00:47:36,663 --> 00:47:38,938
Tell me you're not being serious, Tom.

787
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:43,926
To charge money so people can come and snoop
around our home? What a revolting suggestion.

788
00:47:43,978 --> 00:47:46,794
- It is rather a frightful idea.
- All right.

789
00:47:46,846 --> 00:47:51,532
There may come a day when we simply can't ignore
such a large source of income at our fingertips.

790
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:55,563
- Hopefully when I am dust.
- Still, Tom and Isobel were right.

791
00:47:55,615 --> 00:47:58,265
People are curious about
what it's like to live here.

792
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:00,177
Which is sad in a way.

793
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:04,208
- Why?
- Because it means our way of life is something strange,

794
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,993
something to queue up
and buy a ticket to see,

795
00:48:07,045 --> 00:48:10,443
a museum exhibit, a fat
lady in the circus.

796
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,768
Trust you to cast a pall of
doom over our successful day.

797
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,469
I had a visitor, a child
who'd escaped his mother.

798
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:18,340
He thought we were mad to live here

799
00:48:18,392 --> 00:48:22,465
- when we could be so comfy in a normal house.
- Oh, I refuse to listen.

800
00:48:22,548 --> 00:48:24,449
Downton Abbey is where
the Crawleys belong.

801
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,652
I hope we'll stay as long as we can.

802
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:31,141
- But I suppose we all realise it may not last forever.
- Oh, this is weakling talk.
