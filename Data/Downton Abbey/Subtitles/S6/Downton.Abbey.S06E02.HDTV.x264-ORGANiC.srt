1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,710
Tom writes that they've
opened the new sale room.

2
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,270
What about Rose? What does
she have to say for herself?

3
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,630
Oh, everything's good. New York is heaven.

4
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,310
They're taking a house in
the Hamptons for the summer.

5
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,640
- Ah! I think she could be pregnant.
- Golly! Why do you say that?

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,510
She says, 'I might be back in August,

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,190
but it's a bit early to say.'

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,800
As usual, you add two and
two and make 53. Busy day?

9
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,750
Granny's asked me to look in later.

10
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,670
It'll be about the hospital
business. Have you told Mama?

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,800
- To be honest, Granny said not to.
- You're mad if you don't.

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,950
She's a trustee, she belongs there.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,230
Not all the trustees
can be at every meeting

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,670
and I want to see if there
is some way to sort it out

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,390
before there's blood on the carpet.

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,150
- What is it?
- There's a man downstairs, My Lady.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,950
- Mr Finch is here to see the agent.
- I'll see him.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,630
I suggested that but he said

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,960
he doesn't want to bother you,
or His Lordship, 'just the agent'.

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,350
Wait ten minutes and show
him into the library.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,750
- Very good, My Lady.
- You'll have to manage him.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,600
I've got some errands to run and
I promised I'd meet Granny at 11.

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,550
I want to be left to
manage him. It's my job.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,230
How are preparations for
the wedding coming along?

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,950
Slowly but surely, My Lord.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,990
We've settled a date with Mr Travis

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,750
and now we have to decide
where to hold the reception,

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,160
- what there is of one. - Well,
here of course. - Absolutely.

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,400
We can decorate the servants' hall
and make it look really special.

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
That's kind, My Lord. As I say,
we haven't yet made the decision.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,190
Don't forget poor Mr Finch.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,150
Honestly, Papa, 'We'll
decorate the servants' hall'!

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,710
- Surely we can do better than that.
- What do you mean?

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,830
I don't want to discuss
it now. I'm in a rush.

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,420
We'll have a proper conversation later.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
I know it's cheating, but I think
I might get a jar of horseradish.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,150
It really isn't bad now.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,190
- That's not like you.
- True.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,720
We could use it in sandwiches without
having to go through the palaver.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,070
- Can I borrow some soda,
Mrs Patmore? - Borrow?

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,790
So you'll give it back (?)

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,120
Any more news on Mr Mason?

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,560
Only that he's losing home and
livelihood and it's all my fault.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,910
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes, it is, I caused it.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,710
If it weren't for my big mouth,
he might've had a reprieve.

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,110
- That's not what Miss Baxter says.
- She wasn't there.

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,360
Have you finished your order list?
I'll send them out this afternoon.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,680
I'll take them up to Mr Bakewell.
I'm going into the village later.

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,560
That's kind. I think I'll walk
down to the Home Farm myself.

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,240
I'll join you.

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,030
We'll be back by 12.

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,760
Right you are.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,470
I'm sorry I'm a letdown, Mr Finch.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,790
Not a letdown, milady,
I wouldn't say that,

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,230
only I need to discuss the
estate's entries this year

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,270
in the fat stock show at Malton.

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,190
You won't want to be bothered with it.

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,670
I thought all the shows
took place before Christmas?

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,230
They do, usually. This is an experiment.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,430
And you've come to discuss
it with Mr Branson.

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,190
I know that's not possible, milady,

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,310
but if you could tell
me who's replaced him...

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,150
Hold onto your hat, Mr
Finch, but I'm afraid I have.

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,280
Mm-hm... Hm.

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
I see.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,230
I've been working with
Mr Branson for some years

67
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,870
and now I intend to manage
myself, with His Lordship.

68
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,400
- Well... it's a changing world.
- It certainly is.

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,070
We're anxious the show
shouldn't be a letdown, milady,

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,710
so we're really hoping for a
decent entry from the Abbey.

71
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,190
We did well with the pigs in
the other fat stock shows,

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,990
so let me discuss it with our pig man.

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,910
You see, these shows don't
have the buzz of a county show,

74
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,160
but a decent turnout from the surviving
estates means they're taken seriously.

75
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,150
The key word being surviving.

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,800
Hm.

77
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120
'Decorate the servants' hall'?

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm not sure how enticing that sounds.

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
- It was meant kindly.
- I daresay.

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,590
What would you like us to do?

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,580
If I'm honest, I'd like
to get away for the day.

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,560
Find somewhere local, where
we can throw our own party,

83
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,590
instead of a gathering by
courtesy of the Crawley family.

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,230
You do mean to invite them?

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,080
Of course I do.

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,390
Why, did you think you
would have to get married

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,150
without Lady Mary to witness it?

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,150
She's an important figure
in my life, Mrs Hughes.

89
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,590
- I won't apologise.
- Nor do you have to.

90
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,960
I just don't want to be a
servant on my wedding day.

91
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that so wrong?

92
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,910
What should I tell His Lordship?

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,950
Tell him thank you, but no.

94

(GROANS SOFTLY)

95
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,600
This seems very formal.

96
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,080
The Royal Yorkshire has written to
all our financial donors to canvas
their support for the takeover.

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
- Which you'll agree is very sneaky.
- I think it's sensible.

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,790
The principle benefit
of the new arrangement

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,880
will be to make our money raising
activities more coherent and logical.

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,080
There's no government funding
available, either to them or to us.

101
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Which means we'll become a ward
of the larger establishment,

102
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,390
while the local community
forfeit any claims

103
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,590
to being treated in their own village.

104
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,230
Well, that depends how we
divide the new departments.

105
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,360
In the end, surely, it comes down
to how many lives will be saved.

106
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,480
- Precisely. - Lord Grantham, are
you saying we don't save lives?

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,200
- No, of course not. - If you can't say
anything helpful, Robert, please be silent.

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,480
- Helpful to whom? And why isn't Cora here?
- It doesn't concern her.

109
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,870
I am the president, you are the almoner,

110
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,000
Dr Clarkson runs the hospital
and Robert is the patron

111
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,200
and his father gave the land
on which the hospital is built.

112
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,760
- The four of us constitute a quorum.
- I disagree.

113
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,150
Tell her about this
meeting and, when you do,

114
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,040
say that Cousin Violet would have
kept the rest of us away if she could.

115
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,080
Don't give me ideas.

116
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,870
I suppose you've settled into
the routine by this time.

117
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,510
I think so. I like it here.

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,510
- It's quite a change from Bayswater.
- It's a change that suits me.

119
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,350
I've been getting to know the
estate when I've got time off.

120
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
- I thought I'd look at the woods.
- I'll come with you, if you like.

121
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,830
No, you're all right. I like to
walk on my own, if I'm honest.

122
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,990
I agree with you, Andy,
it's very liberating.

123
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
If you say so.

124
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,680
Mr Carson, I don't suppose there's any
more news on when you'll be serving notice?

125
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,840
Nobody's going to be flung into
the road, I can assure you.

126
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,000
No, but I mean... should I
start looking for another job?

127
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,820
How could it hurt?

128
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,040
At least you know you won't be asked to
leave until you've got somewhere to go.

129
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,990
- I don't know anything of the
sort. - But you heard him. - No.

130
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,910
What I heard is that I'm for the chop

131
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,310

to make it come true.

- Mr Molesley.

.. might I have a word?

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,310
There's no point in
shouting at me, Mr Skinner.

136
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
I want what you want: a
magazine people like to read.

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,750
I don't understand why you're so angry.

138
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm simply making suggestions.

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,390
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

140
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,110
I will be up tomorrow, so
we can talk about it then

141
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,440

calm until I get there.

will be here in a minute.

- Who was it?
- Mr Skinner in his usual form.

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,550
He hates my ideas for the editorial,

147
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,790
he hates my suggestions for interviews

148
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,430
and he hates the new
photographs we've commissioned.

149
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,470
Sounds as if he hates running a magazine.

150
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,950
He hates me. Let's leave it at that.

is a nuisance, but there you are.

Dr Clarkson wants to win your
mother over to Granny's team.

154
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,910
- And will he?
- I don't believe so.

155
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,790
I suppose he likes being his
own boss and who can blame him?

156
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,080
Is that fair? It's always been a huge
plus that we have our own hospital

157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,990
- and he wants to retain it.
- So whose side are you on?

- I wish I didn't have to decide.

I never asked what that man
was here for this morning.

162
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,150
Malton is holding a late
fat stock show this year.

163
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,760
- That sounds rather small beer. Is
it worth the bother? - I think so.

164
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,270
Two of the pigs are
proven winners after all.

165
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
- I'm going to look at them tomorrow.
- Can we come? - I don't see why not.

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,360
I'll tell Nanny.

167
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,830
You want to take them to the Drewes' farm?

168
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,870
You can come with us if you like.

169
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,280
But is it a good idea? Is it safe?

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,990
Don't be such a ninny. I've
said you can come if you want.

171
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,990
It'll be nice for them to see Marigold.

172
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,030
But I have to be in London now.

173
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,640
I'll go.

174
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,550
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- How exciting!

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
We'll all look at the
pigs, then we'll come home.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,910
- Are you on your own?
- Looks like it.

177
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,750
Cos I've got something for you.

178
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,790
Oh, yes? What's that, then?

179
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,910
You know I went into the village earlier?

180
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,630
- I looked in at the school,
while I was there. - Go on...

181
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,070
I spoke to the headmaster
about your examination.

182
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,430
Well, about examinations
in general, really.

183
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,440
Anyway...

184
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,280
He suggested, before we fix a date,

185
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,800
you might like a go at some old
papers from the last few years.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,470
You mean real exams that people sat?

187
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,110
- That was kind of you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

188
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,280
He took me through them. In fact,
it was really rather interesting.

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,310
I just wish Mr Mason was settled.

190
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,350
If you passed your exams, you'd
be in a better place to help him.

191
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,190
Maybe, but first, I've
got to make them listen.

192
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,160
Her Ladyship was there and she
tried to calm the new owner down,

193
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,280
- so she must be sympathetic.
- Daisy, we're servants.

194
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
I have to do something.

195
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,480
Is anything the matter?

196
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
No.

197
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,670
I mean, you're free.

198
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,480
Bates is free, the threat's gone away.

199
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,520
I'd expect you to be wreathed in smiles

200
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,200
but, instead, you seem rather cast down.

201
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,110
Life's never simple is it, milady?

202
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,100
You don't have to tell
me, if you don't want to.

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,800
It's almost funny really, given the
service I once performed for you.

204
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
You know Mr Bates and I have
always wanted children...?

205
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,080
And you'll have some now, I'm sure.

206
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
No, I won't.

207
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,480
It seems I can't.

208
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,200
Anna, no woman living

209
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,720
has been put through more of
an emotional wringer than you.

210
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,920
It doesn't surprise me in the least
that you haven't got pregnant.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,800
That's the point, I can get
pregnant, I just can't keep it.

212
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,150
And how many times has this happened?

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,280
Two, maybe three.

214
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,800
Well, I still say your life has been
so filled with stress and worry...

215
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,840
It's all right, milady.

216
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,880
I'm used to the idea.

217
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,060
Some women can't have
children and I'm one of them.

218
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,150
Now, if that will be all...

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes, thank you.

220
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
(DOOR CLOSES)

221
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,060
Hello.

222
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,130
- Do you post your own letters?
- Ha!

223
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,140
It was vital it went off today and
I'm never very good at delegating.

224
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,770
As a matter of fact, I'm glad to see you.

225
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,780
I'd value your advice.

226
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,850
I've had a letter from the
Royal Yorkshire Hospital,

227
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,850
asking if I'd head the new
Board of Charitable Donors.

228
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,890
We'd be working alongside.

229
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,380
Well, that's if I stay the
almoner, once we've amalgamated.

230
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,500
Well, of course you would. When we combine,
we'll avoid duplicating our efforts.

231
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,700
The whole thing would work a lot
more efficiently than it does now.

232
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,850
So you don't disagree with the plan?

233
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,930
Well, don't you see what it could mean?

234
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,090
How old is our X-ray machine?

235
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,490
Does Clarkson really know how to use it?

236
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,580
What advanced surgery do we offer? None.

237
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,370
If a family at the Abbey has a
cut finger, they go to London,

238
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,660
- but what about everyone else? - I bet
you'd go to London too. - (CHUCKLES)

239
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,410
I probably would, but I shouldn't have to.

240
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,210
And what about people who
don't have that option?

241
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,660
So the battle lines are drawn
and now we must fight it out.

242
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,080
Well, I'm glad we're to be allies.

243
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,370
I must be going.

244
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,660
I assume old Lady Grantham
is still bitterly opposed?

245
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,020
Of course, so there'll be wigs
on the green before we're done.

246
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,440
So be it. Wigs on the green it is.

247
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,060
Poor Daisy's in a terrible state
about Mr Mason losing his farm.

248
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,380
I don't blame her, it's a beautiful
place and he's a lovely man.

249
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,540
She seems to think that Her
Ladyship might want to help.

250
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,980
I don't see how. I mean, they like
Mr Mason, but what can they do?

251
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,660
The way she talks, they didn't
much take to the new owners.

252
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,490
But do you think you could ask?

253
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,660
I can tell her Daisy's worried,
but I can't do more than that.

254
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,220
Very well. I'd better get on.

255
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,130
- I shouldn't get involved.
- No.

256
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,340
And you don't like to get
involved in helping others, do you?

257
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm trying to help you.

258
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,250
- Anything interesting?
- Is this interesting?

259
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,580
'Assistant butler, varied
duties, start at once.'

260
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,450
- Then there's a Ripon number.
- Oh.

261
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,020
- It would be nice if you didn't have
to move far away. - Nice for whom?

262
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,860
You won't let me be fond of you,
will you? No matter what I do.

263
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,820
- Did I leave a tin of oil in here?
- I put it on the mantelpiece. - Oh.

264
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,660
Mr Carson wants me to wind the clocks.

265
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,980
I've an idea the one in the tapestry
room needs extra loving care.

266
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,290
I used to wind the clocks.
Do you want some help?

267
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,020
Don't worry, Mr Barrow, I looked
after the clocks in my last place.

268
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,050
What's an assistant butler
when it's at home, anyway?

269
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,090
That's what I'd like to know.

270
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,140
(CLEARS THROAT)

271
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,420
- Well, they're big enough.
- They're good animals, milady.

272
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,770
They've done well and
they will again at Malton.

273
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,530
Hey, Miss Marigold!

274
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,340
Does Lady Edith know you're here?

275
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,890
She would've come herself,
but she's in London.

276
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,540
- So you're happy to enter them
for the show? - Very happy.

277
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,220
- Where's Mrs Drewe? - She's gone
into town, but she'll be back soon.

278
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,130
- We should probably get home.
- Well, there's no great rush.

279
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,050
- Won't Mrs Drewe want to see
Marigold? - Well -- - Yes, I would.

280
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,140
It's kind of you, milady.

281
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,740
I'd love to look at her.

282
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,420
Hello.

283
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,740
- Do you remember me? - Of course she
remembers you, don't you, darling?

284
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,420
It's been so nice, but I think we ought
to get them back for their luncheon.

285
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,900
Back to the big house for luncheon.

286
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,340
Let her go, Margie.

287
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,420
We mustn't hold them up.

288
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,060
(BOTH LAUGH)

289
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,540
That's it, my love, you come
with me, back to your auntie.

290
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,820
Good, well, I'll send a note
to Mr Finch in the afternoon.

291
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Thank you, Mr Drewe.

292
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
(I hope that's the last
time anyone calls me Auntie.)

293
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,060
Right, back to work.

294
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,020
Mr Carson?

295
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,860
I wonder if I could have some time
off, this afternoon, for an interview?

296
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,930
Interview? What, for a job?

297
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,260
Yes, it's quite local --
Rothley Manor near Ripon.

298
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,420
I telephoned and they
said to look in today.

299
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,010
You don't let the grass grow, I must say.

300
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,980
- So I can go?
- Be my guest.

301
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
Thank you, Mr Carson.

302
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,300
Good luck.

303
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,920
If I was lucky, I wouldn't be leaving.

304
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,530
- Did the children like the pigs?
- They loved them.

305
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,730
Drewe was as proud as
punch showing them off.

306
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,860
- Was Mrs Drewe there?
- She came just before we left

307
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,570
and she enjoyed seeing
Marigold, didn't she, Mama?

308
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,180
- She was quite overcome.
- Yes, I think she was very pleased.

309
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,980
Is that luncheon?

310
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,100
Carson, when Papa offered to
decorate the servants' hall,

311
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,170
he wasn't really thinking.

312
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,660
If you'd like your reception to be
here, we can hold it in the hall,

313
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,370
or whichever room you choose.

314
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,210
That's very kind of you, My Lady.

315
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,010
Not a bit, we'd be
delighted, wouldn't we, Papa?

316
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,170
But you must feel free to refuse.

317
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,210
Oh, there's not much chance of that.

318
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,210
- Speak to Mrs Hughes, she may
feel differently. - Why should she?

319
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,860
She just may, that's all, it's
her wedding. Shall we go in?

320
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,540
Of course, I'd have been very happy
in the servants' hall, My Lord...

321
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,370
Don't worry, Carson, there's
no point even pretending

322
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,700
that we can argue with
Lady Mary, either of us.

323
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
(WEEPS)

324
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,410
- (SNIFFS)
- This isn't right.

325
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,690
- Give me a moment, I'll be fine. - No.

326
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,130
I mean, it's not right
for you to cry alone.

327
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,100
You're married and that means you
never have to cry alone again.

(SNIFFS)

329
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,240
I told Lady Mary last night.

330
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,380
She was kind, of course, but
it just brought it all back.

331
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Have you ever thought about adoption?

332
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,620
Yes, but... I don't believe
it would work for you.

333
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,490
You're tribal, Mr Bates,

334
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,340
and the tribe doesn't
have a lot of members.

335
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,900
You want your own child.
No substitute will do.

336
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
But what do YOU want?

337
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,740
See. You gave yourself
away by not denying it.

338
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,620
We must learn to be content as we are...

339
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,210
.. which is easy for me.

340
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,820
But it's my fault, not yours, that
I can't give you what you need.

341
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,780
To me, we are one person and
that person can't have children.

342
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,700
(SNIFFS)

343
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,780
I love you.

344
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,140
Of course I understand you
may have read many magazines

345
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,130
whilst having your hair done
or waiting for the dentist,

346
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,460
but that does not mean you're an
expert in how to produce them!

347
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,930
You know, there is no need
to shout, I am not deaf.

348
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,770
Oh, really? Are you sure?

349
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,140
Because you seem to have such
difficulty in hearing what I am saying.

350
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,050
- It's drier than they said it
would be in the newspapers. - Yes.

351
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,300
It's brightening up, isn't it?

352
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,570
- Let's go. - We'll have lunch
and then you can come back.

353
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,620
There's no point.

354
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,220
- What a terrible man.
- He didn't sound very conciliatory.

355
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,340
The truth is, I've come up to
London to have my nose bitten off

356
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,180
and that's not all.

357
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,780
Mama telephoned. Mary took
Marigold to the Drewes' farm today.

358
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,530
- I knew she was planning it.
- Well, why didn't you stop her?

359
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,460
Well, how? George was
aching to see the pigs

360
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,410
and what possible reason could
I give for stopping Marigold?

361
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,850
Well, you could've said
it would upset Mrs Drewe.

362
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,810
Wouldn't Mary have wondered why
I was making such a thing of it?

363
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,660
- You're going to have to tell her one day.
- I don't see why.

364
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,260
- How's Granny?
- Embarking on a civil war.

365
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,250
They want to change the way
they run the local hospital.

366
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,290
Change? Mama won't like that.

367
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,460
She's in one camp with Dr
Clarkson, who isn't a fan either,

368
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,730
- and Isobel's in the other.
- And your parents?

369
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,260
Mama agrees with Isobel. Papa
doesn't want to take sides.

370
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,880
Well, if I know Granny, he'll have to.

371
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,090
So you're under butler at Downton Abbey.

372
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,850
Yes, I've been there for a long time.

373
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,020
I first arrived as a junior
footman about 15 years ago.

374
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,090
- Another world.
- So it seems.

375
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,180
Of course, I was away at the
war in the middle of that.

376
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,700
- Why are you leaving now?
- It seems like the right time for a move.

377
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,940
Does it? Does it, indeed?

378
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,980
Tell me, Mr Moore, what exactly
is an assistant butler?

379
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,850
I'm not familiar with the term.

380
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,570
No, well, we made it up.

381
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,340
Ah, so the duties of an assistant butler
are not the same as an under butler.

382
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,580
I think you have to climb down
from that high horse, Mr Barrow.

383
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,340
This is 1925.

384
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,660
We'd need you to combine the duties of a
footman -- when needed -- and a chauffeur.

385
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,940
- There's no chauffeur?
- Well, they drive themselves most of the time

386
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,500
but, should they need a chauffeur for
evening parties and the like, that'd be you.

387
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,100
I see. Well, I can drive, just about.

388
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,330
- Is that all?
- Do you know how to valet?

389
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,890
Goodness, this is a job
for a one-man band.

390
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,780
You're a delicate-looking
fella, aren't you?

391
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,700
I wouldn't say that.

392
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,410
- Are you married?
- No.

393
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,860
Why would that be? Did the
right girl never come along?

394
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,460
I think you know that not many
footmen or butlers are married.

395
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,020
Well, they didn't used to be. But I am.

396
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,020
All right, Mr Barrow, I've got
enough. We'll let you know.

397
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,180
- How did the visit go? - Well, George
wants to be a pig farmer when he grows up.

398
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,140
- And Mr Drewe's well?
- He's so proud of his animals.

399
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,300
Was Mrs Drewe there?

400
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,380
You're full of questions.

401
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,900
To be honest, she was quite
upset at seeing Marigold again.

402
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,130
I thought it would be a nice gesture

403
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,210
but, perhaps, I was being insensitive.

404
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,420
When a woman loves a child,
it must stay with her.

405
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I suppose so.

406
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,300
That reminds me...

407
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,100
You know what you told me, last night?

408
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,780
Yes.

409
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,130
I want you to let me help.

410
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,260
That's so nice, milady, thank you,
but there's nothing to be done --

411
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,420
That's not true. Well,
that's not necessarily true.

412
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,900
I think you've forgotten that,
when I was first married,

413
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,530
- I couldn't get pregnant, either --
- Yes, but you see, I --

414
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,490
Listen. So I went to a
Dr Ryder in Harley Street.

415
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,980
He found I needed a tiny operation,
I had it and George is the result.

416
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,340
- I don't think there's any point --
- There's no point in thinking, you don't know.

417
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,580
I'm going to take you up to London, we'll
meet Dr Ryder and listen to what he has to say.

418
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,170
- Then we'll see.
- But what would that cost?

419
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,210
I couldn't accept it from you.

420
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,530
Don't be silly, you've
earned it fair and square,

421
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,340
keeping my secrets, hiding
that fearful Dutch thingamajig,

422
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,410

gallery in the dead of night.

424
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,050
We have had our moments
haven't we, milady?

425
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,780
We certainly have. And
this is our next moment.

426
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,420
I'll telephone and make an appointment.

427
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,540
I do appreciate it.

428
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,180
It won't work, but that's not the point.

429
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,210
Nobody in my whole life has
been kinder to me than you have.

430
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,460
- Except for Mr Bates.
- Except for Mr Bates.

431
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,580
I'm glad that's settled.

432
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,260
- Will you tell him?
- Not yet.

433
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,820
He'd hope too much. But later,
if anything comes of it.

434
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,500
But how? I'd be surprised if Mr Henderson was
particularly anxious to renew our acquaintance.

435
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,850
Couldn't Sir John Darnley
put in a good word?

436
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,340
I'm sure, but the new owners
won't take orders from him.

437
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,410
Now that it is theirs,
they'll do as they think fit.

438
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,570
So I'll tell Daisy not
to speak to you about it.

439
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,980
I don't like anyone to feel they
can't approach me if they want to,

440
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,330
- (DOOR OPENS)
- but I'm not convinced I can help.

441
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,100
- Whom can't you help?
- Mr Mason.

442
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,580
- I don't think I can.
- No.

(DOOR CLOSES)

444
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,220
What were you not saying about
your visit to the Drewes'?

445
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,500
Only that Mrs Drewe has
definitely not got over Marigold.

446
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,180
- No? - No. She looked as if
she wanted to swallow her whole.

447
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,170
Well, how clever was it to take the
child there in the first place?

448
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,820
Mary made the plan. There
was no way to cancel it.

449
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,890
I wish Edith would just tell her.

450
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,180
Oh, she thinks Mary would use it
as a weapon and she may be right.

451
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,020
If only the Drewes would move
away and find a tenancy elsewhere.

452
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,010
Why would they? They've been at
Yew Tree for more than a century.

453
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,580
That woman will not forget Marigold
while the girl is under her nose.

454
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,980
I don't mind talking to Drewe,
but I doubt it will do much good.

455
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,910
- Did the interview go well?
- Not very.

456
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,110
Never mind. Something will turn up.

457
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,790
But not this one.

458
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,760
They wanted me to be a chauffeur,
a footman and a valet combined.

459
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,240
For all I know, I'd have to cook and
do the garden into the bargain (!)

460
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,910
I suppose none of that was
reflected in the money.

461
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,640
Was it heck as like? They pay for
one servant and they want a whole
bleeding household thrown in.

- I don't understand why you bother with him.
- I know you don't.

464
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,070
- So I can't speak to Her Ladyship?
- She didn't say that,

465
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,270
she just said she didn't
think she could help.

466
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,480
I'd like to hear it from her lips, or I'll feel
I've done nothing, except make things worse.

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,230
- Well, then, ask her.
- But don't be angry with her.

It's not Her Ladyship's fault.

Maybe not, but it's the system's fault.

That's what makes me angry -- the
system -- and she's part of it.

form of compromise is beyond him.

in a bull ring with Attila the Hun.

- With Mary? Not likely.

- Why aren't you there now?
- I should be.

485
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,600
I suppose the truth is
I've never lived alone

486
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,990
and I'm not convinced
I'll be much good at it.

487
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,030
Beware of being too good at it.

488
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,680
That's the danger of living alone
-- it can be very hard to give up.

489
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,600
It's not that I'm ungrateful, I am
grateful, I think it's very kind.

490
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,710
But you don't want to accept?

491
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,040
This is a beautiful house

492
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,440
and whether we're in the great hall
or the drawing room, or wherever,

493
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,510
it would all be very splendid.

494
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,520
- So what's the problem?
- It's not us.

495
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,880
It's not who we are.

496
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,910
It may be where we work,
but it is not who we are.

497
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,680
While being in the school house would be?

498
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,670
It doesn't have to be the school
house, if you don't like it.

499
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,600
But, yes, if we take a neutral place
and decorate it the way we want

500
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,760
and put in the flowers we
like, it would be about us

501
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
in a way the great hall of
Downton Abbey never can be.

502
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,520
(SIGHS)

503
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,080
And I have to tell His Lordship.

504
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,360
I will, if you don't want to.

505
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,560
No, no, I'll do it. It should be me.

506
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,630
Do you know when you'll be back?

507
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,670
Tomorrow, or the next day, I expect.

508
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,310
What does she have planned?

509
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Oh, you know, some shopping,
one or two appointments.

510
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,230
Well, try and put your feet up.

511
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,910
Yes, I'll be putting my feet up.

512
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,430
I think a bit of a break will do you good

513
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,960
and give my regards to Mr Mead.

514
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,920
You're right, it may do me good.

515
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,140
It won't do any harm, anyway.

516
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,830
To what do we owe this honour?

517
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,870
I must look in at the church

518
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,560
and I'm seeing Dr Clarkson and
Mama at the hospital later on.

519
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,630
I've mentioned it to Isobel,
so I hope she's there too.

520
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,080
- Is that wise?
- I think so.

521
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,560
At least she's an ally I can rely
on, even if I can't rely on you.

522
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,960
- I didn't tell you about the m - What
time's your train? - Half-past nine.

523
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,920
- Bags of time. - Carson, have
you broken the news to Mrs Hughes?

524
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,160
- What news is this?
- Where they're having the wedding reception.

525
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,240
- I hope she's pleased. - To be honest,
My Lady, she's a little hesitant.

526
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,150
She's not quite convinced
that it would be appropriate.

527
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,840
- Why not? - She feels we would be
making a claim to which we have no right.

528
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Carson, you've worked in this house
man and boy for half a century.

529
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,950
If you've no right to be married
from here, then who does?

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,870
- Mrs Hughes sees it differently.
- You leave Mrs Hughes to me.

531
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,960
Don't worry, Carson, your reception will be
in the great hall if it's the last thing I do.

532
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,200
How reassuring, My Lady.

533
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
How very reassuring.

534
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,200
We wanted you to see the
ward now it's been repainted.

535
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,200
- It's much brighter, isn't it?
- Very nice.

536
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,960
Doctor?

537
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,030
He's done this with me, my dear.

538
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,070
Now you'll be paraded past
every element of treatment:

539
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,350
surgical, palliative, you name it.

540
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,390
Oh? And what are you trying to add?

541
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,670
I don't want Cousin
Cora to feel outnumbered.

542
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,670
It isn't friendly, you know,
to stir her up into opposition.

543
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,630
It's not very friendly to squash
her into submission either.

544
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,350
Excuse me, but I don't need
to be stirred or squashed.

545
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,990
- The facts speak for themselves.
- Your facts or mine?

546
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,040
- What's the difference?
- Mine are the true facts.

547
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,590
Shall we continue this in my office?

548
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,360
I wish we could persuade you to
help us stem the tide of change.

549
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,880
I'm just not convinced it's the
right way forward, to go backward.

550
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,950
I do not understand you, my dear.

551
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,520
- Are you saying Dr Clarkson is
a bad doctor? - Certainly not.

552
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,040
And the other doctors that use our
hospital -- are they no good either?

553
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,150
I'm sure everyone does their very best,

554
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,190
but there are new methods now,
new treatments, new machines.

555
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,430
Great advances have
been made since the war.

556
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,390
- Can't we share in them?
- Hear, hear.

557
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,630
Of course. I intend that we should.

558
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,000
- We haven't got the money.
- I see I'm not needed to lend you strength.

559
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,990
You're fully in command of the argument.

560
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,240
Have you no pride in what we
have achieved with our hospital?

561
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,310
I don't think pride comes into it.

562
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,680
Well, I warn you, Dr Clarkson and
I will fight to the last ditch.

563
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,030
I just want what's best for the village.

564
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,070
Well, at least we have that in common.

565
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,760
I must go. Mama, Isobel...

566
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,800
I'll come with you.

567
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,980
We must give them time to
gnash their teeth alone.

568
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,000
I can't deny it, Lady Grantham
would've made a powerful ally.

569
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,360
I hope you're not implying that
she would be more powerful than I.

570
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
- Oh, no, indeed.
- Mm.

571
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,950
- Are you ordering me to leave?
- Of course not,

572
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,590
but the fact remains, this
is a difficult situation.

573
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,800
Why did they bring her here?
Why didn't Lady Edith stop it?

574
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,950
She couldn't, she was away.

575
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,630
Where's Mrs Drewe now?

576
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,870
She's collecting the children from school.

577
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
We're all right.

578
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,070
I wish we were all right.

579
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,110
Nobody wishes it more than I do,

580
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:07,280
but Her Ladyship worries that Mrs Drewe
simply cannot stand being so near the child.

581
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,110
Don't push us out, milord.

582
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,070
We've been here since before Waterloo.

583
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,390
I'm not pushing anyone anywhere.

584
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,960
I want Lady Edith to be happy and
I want Miss Marigold to be happy

585
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,030
and as a matter of fact, I would
like your wife to be happy too.

586
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,160
I can manage her, I promise.

587
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,720
- Very well, if you're sure you can.
- I am sure.

588
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,940
Then we'll leave it at that.

His Lordship brought it up.

592
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,270
How did he take it when you refused?

593
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,550
Oh. You didn't refuse, did you?

594
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,560
It was difficult.

595
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Lady Mary feels... that it's only right

596
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,190
that my marriage is
celebrated in the house.

597
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,320
And heaven forfend we lowly folk should do
anything to contradict the blessed Lady Mary!

598
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,440
- That's not like you.
- It is very like me.

599
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,560
I want my own wedding to
be done in my own way.

600
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,550
- Is that so outlandish?
- It's my wedding too.

601
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,320
But I am the bride, we'll be doing
it your way for the next 30 years,

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,400
- Now?
- She's just outside.

606
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,280
Very well.

Thank you for seeing me, milady.

608
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,430
I'm happy to, Daisy, but I
must tell you right off,

609
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,880
- there's nothing more I can do.
- I just can't bear it

610
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,440
for our William's dad to be thrown out
of his farm when it's all my fault.

611
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,750
To start with, I don't
think it is your fault.

612
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,240
Mr Henderson was angry, but he
wouldn't change his plans for that

613
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,240
and the truth is, they are taking
a lot of the estate in hand.

614
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,960
But Mr Mason's not young and
it needs someone that knows him.

615
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,400
I'm sure he has a fine reputation
and Sir John Darnley will help.

616
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,190
He's got all the dead stock,
with everything in top shape.

617
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,310
Any estate would be lucky to have him.

618
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,840
And he'd be happy to start
anew? It's a big undertaking.

619
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,560
Why?

620
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,430
Have you thought of something?

621
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,430
- You've had an idea, haven't you?
- Probably not.

622
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,160
Well, maybe.

623
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,270
I'll let you know if anything comes of it.

624
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

625
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,000
It's no mystery, Mrs Bates, you
suffer from cervical incompetence.

626
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,190
To put it plainly, the
neck of the womb is weak

627
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,430
and as the foetus reaches
three or four months,

628
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,350
it becomes too heavy to be supported.

629
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,270
- So it's not unusual?
- It's bad luck, but not unusual.

630
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,470
- And you can treat it?
- Certainly.

631
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,670
The procedure is called cervical cerclage.

632
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,190
- It's been in use for more
than 20 years. - Go on.

633
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,800
I would insert a stitch, quite a
large one, in the neck of the womb.

634
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,870
- Is it painful?
- It's quite quick.

635
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,080
- But it works? - I'm afraid I
can't make a blanket promise.

636
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,120
It works in many cases.

637
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,070
- And when would you do it?
- At about 12 weeks.

638
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,710
I'd normally come to your
house and perform it there,

639
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,710
then you can rest afterwards
without the nuisance of travel.

640
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,260
- I wouldn't go to hospital?
- Oh, no, it's not worth it.

641
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,920
Well, you've given me a lot
to think about, Doctor.

642
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,840
Thank you.

643
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,350
- When do you return north?
- In the morning.

00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,480
Then I leave it to you to get in touch if and
when you next become pregnant, Mrs Bates.

I'm afraid Drewe won't leave.

646
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,470
I can't pretend I really blame him.

647
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,470
But I don't believe the
problem will go away either.

648
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,510
Edith telephoned before I came up.

649
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,720
It seems her editor continues
to be a nightmare too.

650
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,390
Did she say when she's coming back?

651
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,520
She and Mary are catching the
same train tomorrow, 11 o'clock.

652
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,640
Travelling together? Heavens to Betsy!

653
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,990
But I'm glad Mary's coming straight back.

654
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,120
As it is, she'll only have two days
to get the pigs ready for the show.

655
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Don't worry, it's only a fat stock
show and they're pretty low-key.

656
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,510
Two days is more than enough.

657
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,550
Still, I'm glad she's doing it.

658
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,440
These things remind the farming community
that we're all on the same side.

659
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,880
I wish we could remind your mother
that we're on the same side.

660
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,070
I don't think the rule applies to Mama.

661
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,220
- She's a law unto herself.
- And don't we know it?

662
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,950
Is there more sugar?

663
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,990
Here, pop one in there for us.

664
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,880
Right, as you're all aware, this
is the day of the Malton show.

665
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,950
There'll be no upstairs luncheon

666
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,550
and you're all free to
visit the show if you wish.

667
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,150
The wagonette will leave
from the stable yard at ten.

668
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,640
- Is there a lunch we're serving at?
- No, they're guests of Lord Mexborough.

669
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,510
I don't think I'll bother. It's
only a muddy, little affair.

670
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,360
- Oh, no, you should come. I think
it'll be fun. - (BELL RINGS)

00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,790
You're full of the joys of spring.

673
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,910
- Am I?
- I was right about London.

674
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,400
- You've been very bouncy since you
got back. It did you good. - It did.

675
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,230
Now let me get on. I'll see you
down here, just before ten.

676
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,590
- How long can we stay there?
- Good question.

677
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,070
I must have a staff to serve
tea in case they want it.

678
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,030
- I could do that.
- I don't think so.

679
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,240
Andrew, Mr Molesley, make sure
you're here by a quarter-past four.

680
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,990
Then when do you need me, Mr Carson?

681
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
When indeed?

- You made it, then? - Did you
think I wouldn't? - (CHUCKLES)

687

Oh, they're all here, then.

688
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,350
You knew they would be. Come on.

689
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,320
Never mind. Do you want to see
Lady Mary showing off her pigs?

690
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
In a minute.

- Here, let me show you.

692
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,590
Don't worry, Mr Barrow. It's not my game.

693
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,580
I'd better go. I don't
want to miss those pigs.

694
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,750
(SIGHS) You're not a
quick learner, are you?

695
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,830
I don't know what you mean, Mrs Patmore.

696
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm only thinking of you. Just
be sensible, for heaven's sake.

697
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,040
Does it ever occur to you that,
just this once, you might be wrong?

(CHEERING)

699
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,270
Well done, milady. You look
as if you're born to it.

700
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,760
Not a compliment to everyone's
taste, Mr Finch, but it is to mine.

701
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,630
It's funny to see Lady Mary
in there with the pigs.

702
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,270
I think it does her proud.

703
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,960
I agree. People might think she's
a pretend farmer, but she's not.

704
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,560
- I hope things are beginning to settle
down for you, Mr Mason. - Settle down?

705
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,550
- They're beginning to break
apart, more like. - Don't say it.

Only poor Daisy can hardly work,
she's been so worried about you.

Nae, Daisy, you can't let
worry put you off your work.

Brava. You look very convincing.

- My god-daughter, the pig breeder.
- So good of you to come.

711
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,510
One of my tenants has an
entry, I came to support him,

712
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,550
so you're a bonus, my dear.

713
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,240
Mama says you're on her side
for the battle of the hospitals.

714
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,310
Well, I believe in the changes, yes.

715
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,080
Naturally, Granny blames Isobel for
drawing you over to the dark side.

716
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,910
Oh, no, no, no. I was
on the dark side anyway.

717
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,400
Oh! I was rather hoping it might
be the first signs of a thaw.

718
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,360
How I wish that were true but, I'm
afraid, her mind remains made up.

719
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,280
A woman can always change her mind,
it's what we're known for. Ah...

- Hello, Mrs Drewe. Everyone well?
- Very well, thank you, milord,

721
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,710
but I've left the
children with my neighbour.

722
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,560
- Tim thought I should have a day off
to enjoy myself. - Quite right too.

723
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,280
Nice to see you.

724
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,950
What else would you like to do?

725
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,080
If you're asking, could we get this
business sorted for good and all?

726
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,880
I don't mean to sound stubborn,
but surely it is sorted.

727
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,760
It means a lot to Lady Mary and the
family that we're married in the house

728
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,230
- and I can't see why we shouldn't be.
- You can't?

729
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,840
No, I can't.

730
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,800
If we had family nearby, or a
place that meant something special,
it'd be different, but we don't

731
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,640
and Downton Abbey means much
more to me than the school.

- First prize goes to Golden
Empress of Downton Abbey. - Oh!

Earned by the Earl of
Grantham and Lady Mary Crawley.

- Pig man -- Mr Timothy Drewe.

Yes, well done, us.

741
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,800
She was... Who's got Marigold?

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,230
- She was here just...
- No, she's gone.

- I gather we've won.
- Yes, but Miss Marigold's missing.

- What? - Oh, my god. - Don't worry,
she's just wandered off. She's fine.

She'll be perfectly fine, you'll see.

- What is it?
- Marigold's gone.

747
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,760
I was talking to your wife and
Marigold was just in front of us.

have lost sight of her?

- Don't say that word.
- Don't be silly.

soon she'll be found.

- Have you got a car here, milady?
- What? No, I came with my parents.

759
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,510
- Why?
- I know where we'll find her.

760
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,760
- Where? - I've just realised Margie's
gone too and she's taken the truck.

761
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,750
- You mean she... - I'm afraid so,
milady, but she won't hurt her.

762
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,000
Whatever she does, she won't hurt
her. Calm them down and let's go.

It's all right, we had a message.

764

Mrs Drewe found her and has taken
her home to be out of harm's way.

- Could you take me there now
to collect her? - Of course.

00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
I'll get the car.

- What's going on?
- Panic over, milady.

- They've just gone to fetch her now.
- At the farm with Mrs Drewe? Why?

- I know how much Lady Edith...
- There you are.

- .. know how much all of us owe to
you and your wife. - Don't feel badly.

We made a plan, Lady Edith and
I, but we forgot about emotion...

.. and emotion's what can
trip you up every time.

00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,280
The same to you, milord.

806
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
The very same to you.

807
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,040
He's agreed.

808
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,830
It seems very unfair, but I've
thought and thought about it

809
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,470
and I don't see what else we can do.

810
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,510
I think it's for the best.

811
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
I know it's for the best.

812
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,790
- Did you drink at luncheon?
- No, I did not.

813
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,840
One wrong move and snap,
you're out on your ear.

814
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,230
You think I'm a bully.
I think you're a snob.

815
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,070
- I don't suppose you'd like a drink with me?
- All right. Why not?

816
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes. This is
not the behaviour I would look for from you.

817
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,750
Mr Spratt seems very
preoccupied at the moment.

818
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,750
- This is the tonic Mr Mason needs.
- But it's not definite yet.

819
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,560
- We've come to dress the bride.
- There's a sentence I never thought I'd hear.
