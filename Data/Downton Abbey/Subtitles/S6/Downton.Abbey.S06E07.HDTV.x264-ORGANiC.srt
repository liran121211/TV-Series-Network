1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,150
Tell me the worst, Billy.

2
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,070
I'm afraid Mr Rogers beat you
by three-and-a-half seconds.

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,830
Take it like a man, Henry. Can I
help it if I am your superior?

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,150
(CHUCKLES) You want a drink?

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,960
- Why not?
- See you there. Thanks, Billy.

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,710
- Well, this is very nice.
- What is?

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,670
Mary's beau, Henry
Talbot, has invited us all

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,750
to watch him drive at
Brooklands next week.

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,910
- He's just sucking up.
- Mama won't ever let you go.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,510
- I don't see why not.
- Because you're still convalescing.

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,030
I only want to watch the
race, not drive in it.

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,950
It's a long way, and it won't
last much more than ten minutes.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,470
He told me he's inviting Bertie Pelham.

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,310
- Oh.
- What about you, Mary?

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
I think I've talked myself into it,
although I'm sure I'll be sorry.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,830
Just think! It's finished
and open for business.

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,110
You are the owner of a
bed-and-breakfast hotel.

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,870
- What have you had done?
- I turned a bedroom into a bathroom

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,350
- and I've installed an inside privy.
- Think of that.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,310
It leaves me two bedrooms to let,
and one for my niece to run it.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,310
- Which is yours when the time comes.
- Mmm, when the time comes.

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,350
All you need now are some clients
and that will happen soon enough.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,470
- How's life for the newly-weds?
- Fine.

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,950
Only, Mr Carson wants to
dine at the cottage again.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,750
No need to sound so gloomy.
I can rustle up something.

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,350
Whatever you do rustle up,

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,030
I won't cook it right, or
the plates will be cold,

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,110
- or the dressing will be wrong.
- Does he appreciate all you do?

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,430
- Does any man?
- Ooh, Daisy.

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,670
Mr Dawes has been given a
date by the examining board.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,470
- Blimey, when is it?
- The 20th.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,950
Oh, my God!

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,630
I will thank you not to take
the name of the Lord in vain.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,080
I hope it's not in vain! I
need all the help I can get!

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,670
- Do you enjoy weddings?
- Yes. But I'm not going to that one.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,030
I'd feel like the wicked fairy at
the christening of Sleeping Beauty.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,990
Why would Larry Grey want you to
be there? I mean, you of all people.

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,030
I'm sure he doesn't. Dickie
must've persuaded them to ask me.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,630
I doubt that. He wouldn't want
to subject you to more insults.

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,150
Well, who then?

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,350
I'd say this is the
work of Miss Cruikshank.

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,720
She's the one always
making a show of friendship.

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,390
Why don't I pay a call on her?
See if I can winkle out the truth.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,870
- I'm sorry I showed it to you now.
- Oh, don't be, don't be.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,790
Are things going well
in my former kingdom?

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,710
Cora is settling in. I
know it must feel awkward.

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,310
Oh, no. I'm yesterday, she's
tomorrow. That's the way it is.

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,350
- You must be feeling very hurt.
- Well,

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,790
the fact is, I might as well be honest.

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,190
I am angry at the way I have been treated.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,470
I don't blame you.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,270
While angry, I say things some
people find hard to forgive.

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,950
So, I have decided to go away.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,440
I'd rather vent my rage
on the desert air...

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,870
.. and return when I've
regained control of my tongue.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,310
Your self-knowledge is
an example to us all.

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,110
You don't think I'm wrong?

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,590
The last thing you need
at this stage in your life

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,870
is to quarrel with your
son and daughter-in-law.

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,470
Precisely. But don't fear. I'll call
on Miss Cruikshank before I leave.

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,470
I suspect she's quite a tough nut.

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,560
And I'm quite a tough nutcracker.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,390
How's Mr Mason getting on? I'm
always ready if he needs any help.

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,350
I'm going down there this afternoon,
I'll tell him you said so.

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,870
I am trying to find a
position, Mr Carson, honestly.

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,350
I don't say you're not, but it doesn't seem
quite fair on His Lordship to string it out.

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,950
Does that mean I'm sacked?

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,110
It means I shall be pleased
when we learn the identity

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,560
of your next employer, Mr Barrow.

70
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,950
We'd stay with Rosamund, drive
to the track, have lunch,

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,270
see some racing and come
home the following day.

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,830
It's so unnecessary in your state.

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,750
But I'm not in a state. Unless
it's a state of boredom.

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,390
- (CHUCKLES)
- Please let me.

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,030
- It's not my decision.
- If you mean that, then we're going.

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,190
- Edith?
- Oh, I'm in if Bertie's coming.

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,350
It's a long way for him.

78
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,870
Maybe there's something
else for him to do in London.

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,270
Isn't it enough that
it's a chance to see you?

80
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,590
Would it annoy you if it were?

81
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,750
I'm sorry if Mr Carson
spoke harshly just now.

82
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,230
He doesn't mean to be unkind.

83
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,390
But it worries him when a plan is delayed.

84
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,640
The plan being my departure.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,040
You just haven't found the
right person yet, Mr Barrow.

86
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,350
But I'm sure there are friends
out there waiting for you,

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,870
and a new job in a new house
may help you to find them.

88
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,120
Well, you see, Mrs Hughes,...

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,000
.. this is the first place I've found
where I've laid down some roots.

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,710
I'm terribly sorry, Lady Grantham.
No-one told me you were coming

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,390
- and I'm afraid Lord Merton's out.
- It's you I've come to see.

93
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,040
How flattering.

94
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,960
- May I offer you anything?
- Only your attention.

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,940
Shall I sit here?

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,310
Now, Mrs Crawley tells me
that you paid her a visit

97
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,910
when you first came, that
you were amazingly friendly.

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,590
- Well, I hope I'm always friendly.
- Nobody's always friendly.

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,830
And now you have invited
her to your wedding,

100
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,950
which has taken her by surprise.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,990
You mean Larry and Mrs Crawley have
not seen eye to eye in the past.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,670
Larry Grey has spoken to
Mrs Crawley in a manner

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,070
that in any other century would
have resulted in him being

104
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,590
called out and shot.

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,550
(CHUCKLES) I can't believe
it was as bad as that.

106
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,630
Then you are misinformed.
But I want to know this.

107
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,150
Why encourage Mrs Crawley when your
fiance detests the mere idea of her?

108
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,710
I still dispute that, but I would say

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,710
that Larry had perhaps not
quite thought matters through.

110
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,390
- Meaning?
- Only that his father is old,

111
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,350
and alone, and in need of...

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,070
In need of care?

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,350
Which you are not prepared to give.

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,350
I would've said a companion.

115
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,800
Which you are not prepared to be.

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,230
And what of this house? Will you
surrender it to be free of him?

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,750
She won't want to live at
Cavenham after Lord Merton's death.

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,430
It would be lonely for a woman like her.

119
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,550
But, by heaven, I bet it won't be
too lonely for a woman like you.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,390
I expect they'll have to drag you
out as you break your fingernails

121
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,510
catching at the door case.

122
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,630
So, there we have it.

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,560
You want a free nurse to take her
tiresome old man off your hands.

124
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,310
You're a cruel, little Miss, aren't you?

125
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,710
I'd feel sorry for Larry, if
I didn't dislike him so much.

126
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,270
I shall forget you said
that, but you should go now.

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,870
Much more, and we may
feel awkward when we meet.

128
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,620
- Which we are bound to do.
- I think not, Miss Cruikshank.

129
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,280
Not if I see you first.

130
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,030
Er, as you may have gathered,

131
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,470
the family will be away
for three days next week,

132
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,270
so if any of you feel
you're owed some time off,

133
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,670
perhaps you could take it then.
Er, but clear it with me first.

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,670
I've put in the advertisement.
It'll be out in the morning.

135
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,150
- So, now you just have to be patient.
- What's this?

136
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,910
Mrs Patmore is ready for her first
visitors to the guest house.

137
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,350
- That was quick.
- Yeah, just what I said.

138
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,950
- I've got butterflies.
- Oh, don't be silly.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,550
I'll go over to check it
all when they're in London.

140
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,630
Oh, I'll come with you if you like.

141
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,230
Everyone has something to do
on their free days, except me.

142
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,830
We know what you've got to do, Mr Barrow.

143
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,840
Yes, Mr Carson.

144
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,840
Well! If that doesn't
just take the biscuit.

145
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,630
Are you going to tell me or not?

146
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,390
She's only decided to up sticks and
set sail for the South of France.

147
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,030
- When? - The family
are in London next week

148
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,470
for the racing, so she wants
to leave while they're away.

149
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,070
- She can't do that!
- No?

150
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,190
Well, perhaps you'll pop up and tell her.

151
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,670
- Save me packing.
- What happens to you?

152
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,040
What do you think? I
go with her. (GIGGLES)

153
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,470
I don't know -- strolling
along the Croisette,

154
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,510
dining in Juan-les-Pins. (CHUCKLES)

155
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,270
- It's a burden I can bear.
- And what about me?

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,110
You stay here, sticking in stamps.

157
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,670
And so, she's going to sneak off
while they're away from home?

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,190
My Lady doesn't sneak,
thank you very much.

159
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,910
If there's any sneaking to
be done, I'll leave it to you.

160
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,150
(BELL JANGLES)

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,800
Must go. So much to do.

162
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,350
It's a nuisance, but I can't help it.

163
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,120
Two dinners, neither very grand,...

164
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,160
- .. and clothes for Brooklands.
- Very good, My Lady.

165
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,350
I'm sorry if you're not keen. I am.

166
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,750
I just worry about getting
Mr Talbot's hopes up.

167
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,470
Well, I'm curious about the fellow.

168
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,630
Listen, I like him a lot, but I
don't believe a professional driver

169
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,350
with very little to look
forward to will make her happy.

170
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,790
Sybil, maybe. But not Mary.

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,630
Well, that's the whole point.
What's he got that fascinates Mary

172
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,030
when poor old Tony's rolling acres
and glistening coronet didn't.

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,270
You'll say sex-appeal, but
isn't Mary too sensible?

174
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
We have a very contrary daughter.

175
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,340
Anyway, I've never been motor racing.

176
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,950
Mr Talbot will fix it. You
can help with the picnic,

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,190
but you'll have to take the train.
There won't be any room in the cars.

178
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,870
Mr Bates is looking forward to it.

179
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,470
- I wish I was.
- You don't have to go, you know.

180
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,190
I think I do. It's part of
him, and I must get used to it.

181
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,630
That sounds serious.

182
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,390
I suppose you don't approve.

183
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
- It's not for me to say, m'lady.
- But do you approve?

184
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,800
Mr Talbot seems a nice gentleman.

185
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm just not sure his life
and your life fit together.

186
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,310
- I don't mean to offend you, m'lady.
- I'm not offended.

187
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm troubled because I
understand what you mean.

188
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,190
- They do say that opposites attract.
- Yes, they attract.

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,780
But do they live happily ever after?

190
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,870
(EXHALES) I think I'll go up in a minute.

191
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,830
How do you revise if he's
testing your general knowledge?

192
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,110
Surely, you'll either
know it or you won't.

193
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,310
- I just feel I have to do something.
- Is it so important to you?

194
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,190
It's important I don't feel a fool.

195
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,110
- You're not a fool. I'm the fool.
- (CHUCKLES) Why do you say that?

196
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,030
Because I still can't decide
what to do about Coyle.

197
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,040
I don't know why not.

198
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,150
Maybe if I'd given evidence in
court, but that never happened

199
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,670
and as Her Ladyship said,
"The story feels unfinished."

200
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,270
You sound as if you're going.

201
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,510
I need to be sure he has
no power over me any more.

202
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,960
Will you tell me when you decide?

203
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,110
When Daisy said you'd like to help,

204
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
I wondered if you could bring
the books up to date a bit.

205
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,950
Or tackle some of the heavy stuff?

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,190
Oh, there's nothing I can't do
until we separate the piglets.

207
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,990
But I've got to get on top of
the figures. When can you come?

208
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm busy just now, as it happens.

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh, well. Let me know
when you can get away.

210
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,750
You're leaving now? Today?

211
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,790
I'll spend tonight in London,

212
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,870
then I'll sail on the SS Paris
from Southampton tomorrow.

213
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,350
We'll cruise around the Mediterranean,

214
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,150
then I'm staying with
the Broughams in Cannes.

215
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,550
- They keep asking me.
- Surrounded by foreigners.

216
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,350
My reason for travelling is to
make myself eager to come home.

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,030
A month among the French should manage it.

218
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,470
- Won't Robert be hurt?
- Oh.

219
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,150
Not as hurt as he would be
if he knew why I was going.

220
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,670
Now, can you give this
to him when they get home?

221
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,350
What if they want to contact
you while you're away?

222
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,880
Well, I've... I've written to Tom.

223
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,920
Told him how to reach me.
He's the most sensible.

224
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,190
Oh, by the way,

225
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,440
I called on Miss Cruikshank.

226
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,910
And was she behind that odd invitation?

227
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,190
The fact is, she wants you
to take Dickie off her hands

228
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,070
and out of her hair.

229
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,990
I'd say your choice is
harder now than before.

230
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,990
You know, when we talked, you
didn't want to come between

231
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,590
- a father and his sons.
- Well, what's changed?

232
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,950
Well, now you must decide

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,550
whether to abandon him to his
selfish and greedy children.

234
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,670
I mean, is that kind or right?

235
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,470
It's still a tug-of-war I
have no wish to be part of.

236
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,590
Well, my guess is, when you
take delivery from Miss Amelia

237
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,800
you'll be lucky if you
see a Christmas card.

238
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,880
- Can you be ready by tomorrow night?
- Oh, it's just one couple.

239
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,910
Well, the house has been
beautifully finished.

240
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,990
(CHUCKLES) No doubt about that.

241
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,670
But there is a lot to think about.
You don't offer dinner, do you?

242
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,710
No, if they need dinner,
they can go to the pub.

243
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,910
But I would like to make
a thing of my breakfasts.

244
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,990
- I want a reputation for them.
- You'll manage that easily enough.

245
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,390
I'm here again tomorrow,

246
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,910
but should I come back
on Thursday morning?

247
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,550
The family will still be in London,

248
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,190
and Daisy could easily do the
servants' hall breakfast.

249
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,070
I have no objection.

250
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,950
Now, dinner with Mr Carson. Why not
tomorrow night when they're away?

251
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,710
I suppose we could eat at
a normal time, for once.

252
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,240
Ah, well, you could and you couldn't,...

253
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,560
.. because I've had an idea.

254
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,670
- Oh, hello, stranger.
- I'm not really here.

255
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,390
I'm racing at Brooklands tomorrow,
and I thought I'd pop in

256
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,630
- and see what's new.
- Not much.

257
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,510
Oh, although, we have had an offer today.

258
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,750
I was going to ask you what you thought.

259
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,030
Er, her name is Miss Cassandra Jones.

260
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,510
She thinks we ought to
have an advice column.

261
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,030
- With her dispensing it?
- Yes, but I must say

262
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,150
her samples are quite funny.

263
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,030
"Your husband is losing interest?

264
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,550
Well, here's step one.
Take a look in the mirror."

265
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,430
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- What are you proposing?

266
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,150
We'll invent some problems,
she can write the answers,

267
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,910
then see how the public likes it.

268
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,870
There's nothing new in an
agony column, of course,

269
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,910
but they're very popular in America,

270
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,070
which means they're due a revival here.

271
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,430
Should we interview her?

272
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,910
No, let's leave it until
we decide to go forward.

273
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,030
I think it's worth a try.

274
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,710
I've never seen motor racing close up.

275
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,190
My sister's new boyfriend
drives. Why not come?

276
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,350
- I'm not sure I should.
- Well, I'm your employer,

277
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,750
so if I think it's all
right then it must be.

278
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,830
You can meet my family,
if you're strong enough.

279
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,350
- (LAUGHTER)
- Looking round the table,

280
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,710
I wonder if we ought to have opened
Grantham House. I feel rather guilty.

281
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,870
Oh, don't. I know what a palaver it is.

282
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,030
More so, now there's no real staff.

283
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,670
Almost everyone we know is
selling their London house.

284
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,790
But I suppose that's not for me to say.

285
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,790
I went past the site of
Devonshire House on my way home.

286
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,070
There's something vast
going up in its place.

287
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,510
- (DOORBELL)
- Flats and offices and salerooms.

288
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,710
People don't want vast palaces any
more, even if they can afford them.

289
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,550
They were fun, though.

290
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,590
In my youth, all the great hostesses

291
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,110
used to have luncheon
laid for 20 every day.

292
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,350
And if you turned up in time, you
just sat down to a lovely feed.

293
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,600
- (LAUGHTER)
- (DOOR OPENS)

294
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,510
I'm so sorry, Lady Rosamund, I
thought dinner would be finished.

295
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,160
And so it should be. We'll go through.

296
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,030
Unless the boys prefer to
stay and talk racing cars.

297
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,480
- I think I'd rather join the
ladies. - Like Lord Byron? - Hmm.

298
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,270
Well done for rounding them
all up. I'm very grateful.

299
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,720
Don't be. I'm as keen as you are.

300
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,750
It's a bit obvious. Dropping
in uninvited after dinner.

301
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,270
I hope it is obvious. Obvious that
I want to be a part of this family.

302
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,550
Don't I have a say in the matter?

303
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,110
I want to surround you with people
murmuring, "Isn't he divine?"

304
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,950
Or "You'd be mad to let him go."

305
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,750
Suppose they say, "I shouldn't
have thought a racing driver

306
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,390
was your sort of thing at all"?

307
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,670
They don't have to,
you've already said it.

308
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,870
(CHUCKLES)

309
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,070
I'm afraid there's a list as
long as your arm of people

310
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,910
- who are coming tomorrow.
- Hmm.

311
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,390
Just give me the list
and I'll sort it out.

312
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,310
Did you mind my inviting your
family without telling you?

313
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,160
I'm here, aren't I?

314
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,700
Let's get some coffee.

315
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,510
Are you prepared for your exams?

316
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,750
- I've done as much as I'm able.
- No-one can say more.

317
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,430
I confess, I wasn't always sure about it,

318
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,430
but now you've got there, well done.
I wish you every good fortune.

319
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,270
I wonder where she'll go from here.

320
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,190
Doesn't Gwen's visit show us that

321
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,150
in the new century anything is possible?

322
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,550
And what about you, Mr
Molesley, are you ready?

323
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,790
I think so, hmm. Ready as I'll ever be.

324
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,950
I'll walk down with some lunch
for you and Daisy and Mr Dawes.

325
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,990
- Oh, you don't have to.
- No, I'd like to.

326
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,190
I'll give you a hand.

327
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,110
Mr Barrow, what are you doing
with your free time tomorrow?

328
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,840
Scanning the jobs column,
Mrs Hughes, what else?

329
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,350
There, that's got it.

330
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,070
I think you're all set.

331
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,510
- It's a good car.
- Clearly, we need you on the team.

332
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,230
- Don't tempt me, Henry.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

333
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,470
- Who's this?
- Laura Edmunds, my editor.

334
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,910
Laura, this is Tom
Branson, my brother-in-law,

335
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,470
and the man of the hour, Mr Henry Talbot.

336
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,270
- HENRY: Hello.
- My sister, Mary.

337
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,350
These are my parents. You can
sort them out in your own time.

338
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,990
- Nice to meet you at last.
- Lord Grantham, Lady Grantham.

339
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,630
This is Charlie Rogers.
He drives on Henry's team.

340
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,110
Henry's team, is it? When I beat
him into a cocked hat every time.

341
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,270
Oh, he's just showing off. I'm
faster, I'm younger and better.

342
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,790
- But not at driving.
- (LAUGHS)

343
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,510
I wish there was something
more I could do to be useful.

344
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,660
- Oh, just cheer, Tom.
- I don't have to be asked.

345
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,430
I don't know why I'm doing
this. I can't even swallow.

346
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,110
It's all terribly swank, not
a bit what we're used to.

347
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,230
- No? - Normally, it's an oil-stained
sandwich and a bottle of pop.

348
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,990
Well, I'm glad to think
we've brought an improvement.

349
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,430
Thank you.

350
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,790
My train sat in a tunnel for an hour.

351
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,710
Anyway, I'm here now.

352
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,190
Come and meet Miss Edmunds.

353
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,470
Is it hard to be a woman editor?
Fleet Street sounds so very tough.

354
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,390
It's hard to be a woman
anything if it isn't domestic.

355
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,670
- But I do my best.
- I think it's courageous and good.

356
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,390
Heavens! Papa's conversion to the
modern world is almost complete.

357
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,550
Don't be deceived. He'd still like
to see us happy wives and mothers.

358
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,470
That's not fair. Even leopards
can change some of their spots.

359
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,060
Quite. Now, there's still some food.

360
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,390
I'm glad no-one seems unhappy
that Lady Edith hired a woman.

361
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,270
You're a big improvement on the
last editor, that's for sure.

362
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,830
And you're not the only one around
here who's broken a few barriers.

363
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,180
I started my life at Downton
Abbey as the chauffeur.

364
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,790
I think we're being summoned.

365
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,390
- The cars are in place. We should go.
- Right behind you.

366
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,440
- You'll stay there if I
have my way. - (LAUGHS)

367
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,190
I can't begin to tell you what it
means to me that you came today.

368
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,550
I hope so, because my digestive
system has packed up completely.

369
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,910
I'm going to be fine. Mary, you
must credit me with SOME skill.

370
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,550
Now, when I pass you, I expect
to see you cheer and wave.

371
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,070
Does praying count?

372
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
- Henry!
- Coming.

373
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,540
Well, that should keep my spirits up.

374
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,910
I'll see you in a minute.

375
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,280
MALE ANNOUNCER: 'We're just
waiting for the last chap...'

376

Talbot, driving car No.14.'

377
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,280
Good luck, Charlie.

378
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,670
Good luck, old boy.

379
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,630

'Just listen to the roar of those
engines, ladies and gentlemen.'

383
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,270
And they're off. There they
go, tearing down the street

384
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,920
and jostling for first position.

385
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,960
Come on, Charlie!

386
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,040
Here they come!

387
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,430
Come on, Talbot!

388
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,550
I don't think you can shout that.
Isn't Talbot the name of a car?

389
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,470
I can't shout "Come on, Henry."
They might all be called Henry.

390
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,150
- Oh, my God, here they are.
- Come on!

391
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,910
(ALL CHEERING)

392
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,360
- When will it be over?
- Not soon, they go round and round.

393
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,190
Yes! Come on!

394
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,580
Come on! God bless you! Come on!

395
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,070
What's the point? What
do they get out of it?

396
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,440
What do you think? Speed.

397
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,310
This is kind of you, Mrs Patmore.

398
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,350
I meant to bring some lemonade, but
I left it on the kitchen table.

399
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,790
I could kick meself.

400
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,510
THOMAS: Is this what you mean?

401
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Oh, that was kind of you,
Mr Barrow. Thank you.

402
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,270
How were the exams? Did you do well?

403
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,630
We can't know the answer
to that, can we, Mr Dawes?

404
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,430
You'll find out soon enough.

405
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,110
But Daisy will have to wait a while.

406
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,150
I've not finished yet. I've got
three more papers after lunch.

407
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,390
- Was it harder than you thought?
- See for yourself.

408
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,310
What about number two? It knocked
me for a loop, I can tell you.

409
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,560
- (ALL LAUGH)
- What does it say? Read it out, Andy.

410
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,820
- I'll read it.
- Why, what's the matter?

What were the causes of Turkey's illness

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,880
and what measure was the Russian
Tsar prescribing for its recovery?"

417
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,670
I can't read, Mr Molesley.

418
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,310
At least Mr Barrow's been
trying to teach me to read,

419
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,350
- but I'm too stupid to learn.
- Don't say that.

420
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,600
So, there we have it. I'm
a fool who knows nothing.

421
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,740

428
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,990
- My God, but don't you envy them?
- No, I don't.

429
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,140
Nor me. We're going to
have to keep an eye on Tom.

430
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,600
There is something gallant and
daring in it, even I can see that.

431
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,110
Andy, maybe I can help,
if you'd like me to.

432
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,950
Oh, that's very kind.
What do you say, Andy?

433
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,350
Well, I've tried and tried with Mr
Barrow, and I can't break through.

434
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,470
- I'm too stupid.
- Will you stop saying that?

435
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,830
You're not stupid, and I promise you I
can soon have you reading for pleasure.

436
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,190
If you'll just come two or three
times a week after school closes.

437
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,630
- Could you manage that?
- That's the best time for me.

438
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,230
It won't take long, you'll see.

439
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,110
- We can go on with...
- Mr Barrow,

440
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,070
it might be better if you step back now.

441
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,790
You've been very generous, but we wouldn't
want to confuse Andy with different methods.

442
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,150
No, of course not.

443
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,310
I hate to cut this short, but Daisy's
still got a lot of work to do

444
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,710
- and she better get started.
- Need any help?

445
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,910
- I can manage.
- Well, good luck, Daisy.

446
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,830
ANDY: Yes, good luck.

447
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,030
Funny when the house is
empty above decks and below.

448
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,510
All the more reason for us to be vigilant.

449
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,710
- Let's sit down.
- Erm, I don't know.

450
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, just for a moment.

451
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,430
- Hmm.
- There.

That's nice, isn't it?

They don't live badly,
you have to concede.

454

They live as they're supposed
to live. It has its burdens

455
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,630
and its benefits.

456
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,990
Better than a life of just burden.

457
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,950
I hope you're ready for tonight.

458
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,110
For once, we can eat when civilised
people eat, so don't be late back.

Are you sure you know how to cook it?

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,080
Don't you worry. I've been through
every detail with Mrs Patmore.

Looks like steering trouble.

and challenging for the lead.

the power to fight him off!

Oh, dear, look! Rogers
is coming back at him!

Would you believe it? He's
going to take back the lead!

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,990
No, it's no good. I can't stay.

486
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,110
You're not going anywhere.

487
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,150
- I must go to her!
- No, no, Anna. Not in your condition.

488
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,630
- Never mind, I have to go.
- Can you follow her, please?

489
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,080
Of course.

490
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,670
Get him out of there!

491
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
HENRY: Charlie!

492
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,990
- MAN: Turn around!
- HENRY: Charlie!

493
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,550
TOM: It's too late.
Henry, Henry, get back!

494
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,470
Henry, Henry, get back!

495
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,950
- HENRY: Charlie!
- He's gone, Henry.

496
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
No! Charlie!

497
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,760
Charlie!

498
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,990
We have to help him. Charlie!

499
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,670
- Charlie!
- ANNA: Let me pass.

500
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,390
I know him. Let me pass!

501
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,310
You can't say that. We
don't know it's him.

502
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,240
- Oh, my God.
- TOM: I need help here!

503
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,080
Who is it? Can we find out who
it is? Tom, Bertie, who is it?

504
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,910
I'm afraid it's Charlie Rogers.

505
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,440
He was my friend.

506
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,590
My best friend, really.

507
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,340
If that phrase didn't sound
like it was something from a...

508
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
.. Rider Haggard novel.

509
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,430
I keep asking myself
if I... encouraged him.

510
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,310
Of course you encouraged him,

511
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,670
- and he encouraged you.
- Yes, but I'm so stupid, I...

512
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,230
I...

513
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,310
I needled him and I
teased him, I pushed him.

514
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,230
And he did the same.

515
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,710
And if you'd have died instead of him,

516
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,270
he'd be here asking exactly
the same questions.

517
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,720
Yes, but I didn't die and he did!

518
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

519
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,470
We're going now.

520
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,550
Aunt Rosamund doesn't want
to cancel dinner tonight.

521
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,310
She thinks we should all be
together on a day like today.

522
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
(SCOFFS)

523
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,680
I can't. I have to deal
with Charlie's family.

524
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,920
Of course. I wasn't thinking.

525
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,720
Tell her thank you.

526
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,110
- And, Mary...
- No.

527
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,640
Let's not do any of that stuff now.

528
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Go on, then. Put us out of our
misery. Did he pass or not?

529
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,230
Mr Molesley, I'd be very glad

530
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,030
if you would join the teaching
staff at the village school.

531
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,750
Well, I'll be...

532
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,550
Very good of you to come
up tonight to tell me.

533
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,070
Does that mean you'll be a
teacher and not a servant?

534
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,230
- When will you be leaving?
- Give him a moment.

535
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,710
There's a lot to be settled.

536
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,070
- Course there is.
- I'm impressed, Mr Molesley.

537
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,400
There are Oxford and Cambridge
graduates who know far less than you.

538
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,550
You should be proud.

539
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,200
Good night.

540
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,160
Mr Dawes.

541
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,870
Thank you very much.

542
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,620
Well done, Mr Molesley.

543
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,830
- It'll be you next.
- I doubt it, but thanks.

544
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,190
We should celebrate. Come into the
kitchen while I get the dinner going.

545
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,940
There's a bottle of wine there,
if Mr Carson wouldn't mind.

546
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,190
Is that the end of service for you?

547
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,390
Hmm, service is ending
for most of us, Daisy.

548
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,510
I've just got a head start.

549
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,590
Will you miss it?

550
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,190
Oh, let's face it. I were
never going to make butler.

551
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,310
Well, not in a proper house like this one.

552
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,630
And from now on, there's going
to be more and more people

553
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,110
chasing fewer and fewer
jobs, so it's probably time.

554
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,270
And this seemed like a good way to go.

555
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,870
Well, I'm glad. You deserve it.

556
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,790
(LAUGHS) I never think I deserve anything.

557
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,240
Perhaps I've been wrong all along.

558
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,590
Are you coming, Mr Barrow?

559
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,960
In a minute. You go ahead.

560
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,710
MRS PATMORE: Here you
are, Daisy, you have one.

561
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,520
- Andy, come on. Have a glass of wine.
- DAISY: Congratulations.

562
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,070
But how did you do it?

563
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,750
Er, I must have stumbled and
fallen over in the wrong way.

564
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,430
Mrs Patmore put on a bandage, but I'll go to
the doctor in the morning if it's no better.

565
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,560
- But how are you going to cook?
- I can't cook!

566
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,350
I can't lift.

567
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,430
But it's not difficult. I'll
talk you through it, don't worry.

568
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,350
You mean... I'm going to cook?!

569
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,070
It's very straightforward.

570
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,390
Now, get the chicken
in the oven right away,

571
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,910
then peel the potatoes and
prepare the cauliflower.

572
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,030
Oh, and put a kettle on to boil.

573
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,950
You should find bread and an
onion for the bread sauce.

574
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,940
Butter and milk are in
the meat safe outside.

575
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,920
I assume that none of us are
going to eat anything else.

576
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,950
One talks of risk and danger,
and it sounds like fun.

577
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,760
But of course, the reality
behind it is sudden death.

578
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,030
Sudden, stupid, wasteful death.

579
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,320
It was a bloody awful business.
A bloody, bloody awful business.

580
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,000
- The English language never
lets you down. - Oh, shut up!

581
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,070
Shall we go through?

582
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,600
- You're going to bed.
- Me, too.

583
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,830
The rest of you can talk
into the small hours.

584
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,390
- (TELEPHONE RINGING)
- Should I say goodbye?

585
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Not yet. Come into the
drawing room for a drink.

586
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,630
Henry's on the telephone.

587
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,150
Tell him to ring tomorrow.

588
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,540
I think you should speak to him.

589
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,550
MARY: 'You should try to sleep.'

590
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,440
I found that I had to
hear your voice first.

591
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,560
The truth is...

592
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,950
.. I won't sleep until I
know where we're headed.

593
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,070
Henry, please let's not do this now.

594
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,080
- Think of Charlie, not us.
- Hear me out. Charlie would have.

595
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,230
Because his death has made me realise

596
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,550
we don't have a minute
to waste, you and I.

597
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,670
This is my carpe diem moment. I...

598
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,200
- I must seize the day.
- No.

599
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,070
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry, I wouldn't have said this now,

600
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,400
but today has made me
realise something, too.

601
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,720
We're not meant to be together, Henry.

602
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,710
- We're not right.
- I can...

603
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,910
Don't start saying you'll give up racing.

604
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,350
I don't want you to give up anything

605
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,630
- except me.
- I can't give you up.

606
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,870
Please. I wish you nothing but good.

607
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,660
I want you to have a long and happy life.

608
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,030
- Just not with me.
- Mary, please don't do this.

609
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,360
I must.

610
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,640
Good night, Henry.

611
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,150
I wish you wouldn't.

612
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,790
Do you know the worst thing?
When they said it was Charlie

613
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,070
and not Henry who was dead, I was glad!

614
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,590
Think of that. I was glad!

615
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,150
You're not seeing straight.

616
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,030
Today brought up Matthew's
death and all the rest of it.

617
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,950
- You're in a black mist.
- It's not what I want!

618
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
You're frightened of being hurt again.

619
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,110
But let me tell you this.

620
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,830
You will be hurt again, and so will I,

621
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,620
because being hurt is part of being alive.

622
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,140
But that is no reason to give up
on the man who is right for you.

623
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,510
I'm sorry I'm a bit behind. (PANTING)

624
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,710
The potatoes may have caught.

625
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,390
Never mind. Er, how's the cauliflower?

626
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,780
Oh, God.

627
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,550
- (EXCLAIMS)
- Oh, while you're there,

628
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,070
put in the apple crumble. Bottom oven.

629
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,200
Mmm. (EXCLAIMS)

630
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,350
I think it's been a good day.

631
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,590
The funny thing is, I quite
enjoyed it in the end.

632
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,990
I'm glad it's turned out
well for Mr Molesley.

633
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,430
And Andy. I think that'll
turn out well an' all.

634
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,630
I suppose so. Even if he only wants to read
to learn more about farming from Mr Mason.

635
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,830
And if he does? You must share, Daisy.

636
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,830
Love isn't finite. If Mr
Mason makes new friends,

637
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,150
it doesn't mean he has
any less love for you.

638
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,670
Doesn't it?

639
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,630
I never had much that
was my own, you know.

640
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,880
Well, you found the love of a father
there and you can count on him.

641
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,030
Just as you can count on me.

642
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,620
Now, run along and I'll finish this.

643
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,030
Mmm. This crumble's good.

644
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,160
My mother's was always a bit soggy.

645
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,510
- (SCRAPES SPOON NOISILY)
- Hmm, crumble. Oh!

646
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,000
Is that it now? Are we done?

647
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,670
Oh, just put the things in to soak.

648
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,750
Make sure you cover the pots with water.

649
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,110
You don't have to do the washing up
till tomorrow if you don't want to.

650
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,190
- You won't be better by the morning?
- Oh, not for that.

651
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,110
We could ask Billy to come over,
but he's got his own work to do.

652
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,470
You don't mind, do you?

653
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,240
(PANTING) No, I don't mind.

654
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,400
I expect you're glad to
get to bed. I know I am.

655
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,470
- What is it?
- I just wondered if I was right.

656
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,590
That you're to be congratulated.

657
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,110
It's a bit early to
shout about it, but yes.

658
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,310
I'm happy for you. It's good
to think of a new life coming,

659
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,630
especially on a day like this.

660
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,700
Well, good night.

661
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,510
Look at you, stretched out like a pasha.

662
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,590
A creature of leisure.

663
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,310
Early night for me. He went to
bed when he left the dining room.

664
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,510
(SIGHS) Not for me. She's very shaken.

665
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,270
- By the crash?
- Because of the crash,

666
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,790
and she's broken up with Mr Talbot.

667
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,790
I wouldn't have thought it was the right
night to make that sort of decision.

668
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,790
She says she's sure.

669
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,510
- Do you think she's right?
- I don't know.

670
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,110
Probably.

671
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,720
Then there's no more to be said.

672
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,030
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

673
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
(CLOCK CHIMES)

674
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,710
I'm afraid I've got to go.

675
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,830
You've been such a help.

676
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,870
It's odd, isn't it? We
witnessed a tragedy today

677
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,550
but, sitting here with your arm around me,

678
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,430
I can't remember feeling so comfortable.

679
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,870
(CHUCKLES) When you say things
like that, you make me so happy.

680
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,710
If it isn't wrong to feel
happy on a day like this.

681
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,910
I don't believe it's ever wrong
to feel happy and confident

682
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,230
in someone else's company.

683
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,430
Do I really make you feel those things?

684
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,750
- It's not a trap.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

685
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,150
Today has been sad and wretched,

686
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,990
and having you here has
helped me face it, that's all.

687
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,840
The thing is, I'd like
to be trapped, and...

688
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,990
Well, I better just say it.

689
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,870
I want to marry you.

690
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,430
- Oh!
- You're not offended?

691
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,110
Offended? Why would I be offended?

692
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,590
I'm thrilled, I'm delighted.

693
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,150
- I'm just rather surprised.
- Why? You know I'm mad about you.

694
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,510
I don't ever think I'm the
sort of girl men are mad about.

695
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,190
Then you're wrong, because I am.

696
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,110
I... I know I've not got much to offer

697
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,030
and your father's probably hoping for

698
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,750
more than a penniless land agent,

699
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,550
but if love is allowed
to weigh in the balance,

700
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I've got plenty of that.

701
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,680
I must ask you something.

702
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,630
Would you let me bring Marigold with me?

703
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,110
Marigold?

704
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,550
Your family's ward?

705
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,910
You see, I'm much fonder
of her than anyone else,

706
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,360
and I'd hate to leave her behind.

707
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,030
If she means that much to you.

708
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,270
Of course, I hope we'll
have children of our own

709
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,270
- before close of play.
- Oh, absolutely. I'd like that, too.

710
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,060
- Does that mean you accept?
- Not quite.

711
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,350
I'll have to think about it. I'm
sorry to be a killjoy, but I must.

712
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,590
Be my guest. I'm not going
to marry anyone else.

713
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Not until after you've
broken my heart, anyway.

714
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,220
I'll go.

715
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,070
Kiss me first.

716
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,520
And I promise I won't
keep you waiting too long.

717
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,560
(SIZZLING)

718
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,880
All right, let's see what
you make of that. (CHUCKLES)

719
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,710
Now, I must be off, but my
niece, Lucy, is in the kitchen.

720
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,060
- She'll see to everything.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

721
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,750
Hello, Carson.

722
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,910
Mrs Crawley is in the library, My Lord.

723
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,510
She's been here for some time.

724
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,390
- Why?
- She didn't say, My Lady,

725
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,270
but she seems eager to see you all.

726
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,790
Also, er, Mr Spratt rang to ask
when you'd be arriving from London.

727
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,390
- Mr Spratt?
- The Dowager Countess' butler.

728
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,470
Oh, that Mr Spratt. What did he want?

729
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,120
- Again, no explanation was proffered.
- Curiouser and curiouser.

730
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,070
Isobel, I hope we haven't
kept you waiting for hours.

731
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,750
Not at all, it's entirely my
fault. I got here far too early.

732
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,310
- How was it?
- Perfectly terrible, as it happens,

733
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,030
but let's not go into that now.

734
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,350
Oh, I am sorry. And, to be quite honest,

735
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,270
- I feel rather awkward.
- Why, what is it?

736
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,870
I have a letter from Cousin Violet.

737
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,110
Why didn't she bring it herself?

738
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,510
- Because she's gone away.
- Gone away? Where?

739
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,150
She's on board the Paris,
headed for the Mediterranean.

740
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,230
This is me, isn't it? I've
done it. She's furious with me.

741
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,670
I don't see the point of
bringing any of that up now.

742
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,990
- What does it say in the letter?
- (SIGHS) Nothing much.

743
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,150
She needs a change of air,

744
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,430
and Spratt is bringing a
present by way of goodbye.

745
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,110
That's why he rang.

746
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,070
Mr Spratt has arrived, My Lord.

747
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,350
- Oh, show him in.
- Well, that is,

748
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,990
he's in the servants' hall

749
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,270
with a present for Your Lordship and
he doesn't want to bring it up here.

750
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,230
- What is going on?
- He may be right, My Lord.

751
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,230
- Let's go and see what it is.
- If you wish,

752
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,620
but it all seems very rum to me.

753
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,030
What is it? What's the surprise?

754
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,110
You'll soon see, m'lord,
but I think it's a good one.

755
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,750
- Good day, m'lord.
- Spratt, what is

756
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,790
this great secret you're about to reveal?

757
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,080
Her Ladyship chose her herself,
m'lord. Er, she was most particular.

758
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,310
Oh! Hello, little one!

759
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,840
Oh!

760
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,390
Now, what are we going to call you, eh?

761
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,710
(CHUCKLING) Oh, I know, Tiaa.

762
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,390
I thought we always had
names from ancient Egypt.

763
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,750
Tiaa was a wife of Amenhotep II
and the mother of Thutmose IV.

764
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,030
Don't you know anything?

765
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,950
She's not exactly trained yet, m'lord.

766
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,550
so we decided against
bringing her up to the library.

767
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,630
Oh, I don't care about that.
You're coming upstairs with me.

768
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,910
(LAUGHTER)

769
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,630
Tom, what about this, eh?

770
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,790
He does love his dogs.

771
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,750
How were your guests this morning?
Was everything satisfactory?

772
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,390
Oh, very. He was a doctor,
Mrs Hughes. Imagine that!

773
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,270
So, I don't think I could
have started better.

774
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,670
Even if I did work harder
over their breakfast

775
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,230
than anything I've done
since Lady Rose got married.

776
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,030
- (CHUCKLES)
- Oh, talking of which,

777
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,670
has Mr Carson survived his
ordeal from last night?

778
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,150
Put it this way --

779
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,750
he has discovered a new respect for
the role of cook and bottle washer.

780
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,710
So I think he'll be giving
less trouble in the future.

781
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- What's so funny?

782
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,960
Just life, Mr Carson.

783
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,440
Just life.

784
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,710
You push in here, into my home,

785
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,870
to call me a grubby little gold-digger?

786
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,270
You've got a nerve.

787
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,750
I wouldn't like to see this family
dragged into a local brouhaha.

788
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,070
He means me.

789
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,830
I'm not as simple as I used to
be. My life is not as simple.

790
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,590
What would they say if they found out

791
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,750
that I was a servant at the big
house? What would their parents say?

792
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,240
I know you. I know you to be a
nasty, jealous, scheming bitch.
