1
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,320
Daisy, put that into the oven.

2
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,130
Ohh!

3
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,650
Have you chosen what you want yet?

4
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,370
Whatever you think best.

5
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,130
That doesn't sound like a bride
on the brink of wedded bliss!

6
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,370
It's a long time since I've
been on the brink of anything.

7
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,410
Except possibly the grave.

8
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,450
I wanted a big wedding breakfast.

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,370
All of us sat at groaning
tables having a jolly time.

10
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,490
- Why can't you have that?
- It's not how posh people do it.

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,130
They stand about with nibbly bits stuck in
their teeth and that's what we've to do.

12
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,450
I don't see why. We could put
trestle tables up in the hall.

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,290
No, Mr Carson wants it like
the family would do it.

14
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,610
(SIGHS) I don't mind.

15
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,650
Not really.

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,410
- So what are you going to wear?
- My brown day dress.

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,450
Anna is going to tidy it up a bit.

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,810
It's simple, but I'm sure it will be fine.

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,610
Because I've got a new
catalogue. It's so easy.

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,060
You send a postal order and
they send you the dress!

21
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,730
I know what a catalogue is, thank you.

22
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,900
I'm too old to think a new
dress will solve anything much.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,700
Well, you're not wasting
money, that's for sure.

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,770
Mama! What are you doing here?

25
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,810
I wasn't expecting you.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,170
I want to be quite certain you're thinking sensibly
about the possible changes at the hospital.

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,530
By thinking sensibly, you
mean thinking like you.

28
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,570
Of course.

29
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,610
Cora believes you're wrong.

30
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,650
Cora is confused.

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,370
And when she sees sense,
she'll agree with you?

32
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,410
You have been talking to Isobel.

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,730
Since they made her the almoner,
she's never been the same.

34
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,970
- I have been talking to Cora.
- That is a mistake.

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,810
You can't expect me to avoid
talking to my own wife!

36
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,540
Why not? I know several couples who are
perfectly happy, haven't spoken in years.

37
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,890
Hello, Granny! They
didn't say you were here.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,060
I'm here to make sure of your
father in the coming fight.

39
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,180
I'm off to London to calm my editor.

40
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,730
Say goodbye to Mama.

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,570
Will you stay with Rosamund?

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,690
I don't know how long I'll be
there. So I'll stay at the flat.

43
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,530
Is it proper for a young
woman to be alone in a flat?

44
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,970
Granny, Adrienne Bolland flew alone
over the Andes mountains four years ago.

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,010
Anyway, I'm not a young woman.

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,050
I'm staring middle age in the face.

47
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,090
- Granny!
- Have you seen your mama?

48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,050
She's just finishing off
the menus with Mrs Patmore.

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,090
Then I will be off.

50
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,130
Why not stay and say hello?

51
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,130
Oh... I have a feeling Cora and I will be
saying hello rather less than... en garde!

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,250
.. in the next few weeks.

53
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,010
Right.

54
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,050
What if we keep the Dover sole

55
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,090
and change the cod to a crown roast?

56
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,050
- I'll do peaches in brandy.
- That sounds more like it.

57
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,090
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

58
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,010
- Is everything else all right?
- Yes, Your Ladyship.

59
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,730
That is... I'm a bit
concerned about the wedding.

60
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,370
Why is that? Don't hesitate to
charge it all to the house account.

61
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,810
Oh, very kind, I'm sure.
But it's not that.

62
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,370
- Mrs Hughes isn't happy.
- I'm sorry to hear it.

63
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,130
- Is she regretting her decision?
- It's not her decision she regrets

64
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,250
so much as his decision.

65
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,930
What is that?

66
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,650
A stamp to mark the
British Empire exhibition.

67
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,770
Just been released. First
commemorative stamp ever.

68
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,810
What's that great lion doing?

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,850
It's the lion of Britain
with the head of the king.

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,260
Hm! I think it's silly.

71
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,410
Because you understand nothing.

72
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,450
(BELL)

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
I'll go.

74
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,180
(VOICES)

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,570
- Ahem.
- Who was that?

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,500
- Who was... what?
- Whoever was outside.

77
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,130
- Was nobody.
- Very talkative for a nobody.

78
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,420
I meant... He'd come to the wrong house.

79
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
Haven't we all?

80
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,490
- Did Lady Edith get off OK?
- As far as I know.

81
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,650
I can't think why she doesn't sack the
wretched man and find someone else.

82
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,090
Unless she enjoys racing up to London
in a swirling cloud of crisis and drama.

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,250
I've had rather a sad
letter from Mr Branson.

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,290
Listen.

85
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,330
I dreamt last night I was
in the park at Downton,

86
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,690
walking with Sybbie under the great trees,

87
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,650
listening to the pigeons
cooing in their branches.

88
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,130
And when I woke, my eyes
were filled with tears.

89
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,650
- That's very moving.
- I agree.

90
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,690
I owe him a letter.

91
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,210
I'll write after Carson's wedding.

92
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,220
Talking of which, I feel
sorry for Mrs Hughes.

93
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,530
I said I'd brighten up her frock for her.

94
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,290
When she gave it me, it was an old day
dress. There wasn't much I could do.

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,330
Can't I lend her a brooch or something?

96
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,650
I told Mrs Patmore and she said not
to worry. Maybe she's got a plan.

97
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,690
Let's hope so.

98
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Have you given any more
thought to Mr Ryder's advice?

99
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
I have.

100
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,250
You're not...

101
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,380
- Too early to tell.
- Lord knows the problem isn't Bates!

102
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,570
Honestly, My Lady! If I repeated some
of the things you say downstairs...

103
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,130
Should you be working? I can
manage. And there's always Baxter.

104
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,170
No, Mr Bates would smell a rat.

105
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,810
I don't want him to know anything until
it's worked and I'm almost showing.

106
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,650
He'd put so much on to it.

107
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,170
At the end of the third month, I'll invent
an appointment and we'll whizz up to London!

108
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,530
- How exciting!
- I don't want to be excited.

109
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,250
Not until I know it's going to happen.

110
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,730
Looking for a place, Mr Barrow?

111
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,770
I might be. Would you be sorry?

112
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,810
They've not said anything though.

113
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,850
Mr Carson is hoping I'll resign.

114
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,770
To avoid any possible
unpleasantness, that's all.

115
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,810
What do you think of this?

116
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,570
Experienced manservant required

117
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,930
for a position of trust
in a prominent household.

118
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,770
Sounds interesting. Where is it?

119
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,730
I'm only looking in the Yorkshire
papers. I want to stay up here.

120
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,850
Careful, Mr Barrow. Someone might accuse
you of having feelings for the area.

121
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,890
Would that be so hard to believe?

122
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,810
Harder for you to accept
than for us to believe.

123
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,690
Am I here tonight without cousin Violet

124
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,730
to cement my alliance with Cora?

125
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,770
No, not at all!

126
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,330
Carson, could you ask Mrs Hughes
to join us in the drawing room?

127
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,370
Mrs Hughes, My Lady?

128
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,810
I want to ask her something and
I'd like Lady Mary to be there.

129
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,460
- What are you getting at?
- Carson?

130
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,730
Of course, Your Ladyship.

131
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,650
Shall we go through? Are
you staying tonight, Robert?

132
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,690
No, I don't want to miss anything.

133
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,410
Does cousin Violet know
I'm here this evening?

134
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,250
Not unless you've told her.

135
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,970
I don't want her to think
I'm plotting against her.

136
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,020
- Aren't you?
- Yes.

137
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,170
But I don't want her to know.

138
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,810
Her Ladyship is going to help Mr Mason.

139
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,130
When I was in the drawing room,
she almost said it out loud!

140
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,770
Let's hope so.

141
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,530
Now, will you let me take
you through the exam papers?

142
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,450
- Are you losing confidence in me?
- No, it's not that.

143
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,490
I'm sure you know the answers.

144
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,530
But sometimes it can be hard
to make out the question.

145
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,770
Mr Molesley, shall we ask them
to come down and help themselves?

146
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,090
- Sorry, Mr Carson.
- Is Mrs Hughes in her room?

147
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,140
As far as I know.

148
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,930
- How may I help, My Lady?
- I'm sorry to put you on the spot.

149
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,650
But I believe you've been rather
railroaded over your reception.

150
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,570
I understand you don't want
to be married from this house.

151
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,610
- What?
- Why ever not?

152
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,930
My Lady, we're both honoured
to be allowed the privilege --

153
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,330
No. I want to hear from Mrs Hughes.

154
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,250
Your Ladyship, I have no
wish to sound ungrateful.

155
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,290
This is a fine house.

156
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,330
And Mr Carson's right.

157
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,850
It would be an honour
to hold our party here.

158
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,890
But it's not what you want.

159
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,250
Well, to start with, I'd like a kind of reception
that's different from the ones you're used to.

160
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,690
With a solid meal served at proper tables.

161
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,930
Does anyone have a sit-down
wedding breakfast any more?

162
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,970
A great many people, My Lady.

163
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,850
And then I'd like to feel
we could ask all sorts.

164
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,730
Everyone who's been
part of our lives here.

165
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,010
And I'd planned for music later on.

166
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,050
And maybe a bit of a hoolie.

167
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,890
None of which would be
suitable in the Great Hall.

168
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,450
- It would not.
- There you are, we're agreeing.

169
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,010
Mrs Hughes, doesn't Carson
deserve a wedding in this house?

170
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,410
Where he has served this family
for so long and with such loyalty.

171
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,770
And will continue to do so while
there is breath in his body.

172
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,410
Well, then.

173
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,450
But this is our day, My Lady.

174
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,440
It's about Charles
Carson and Elsie Hughes.

175
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,970
And not about this glorious house or the
glorious people who have lived in it.

176
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,930
Just us, and that's the way
I'd like to celebrate it.

177
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,290
I couldn't understand more, Mrs Hughes.

178
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,330
I hope we'll be invited.

179
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,370
Of course you will all be invited.

180
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,410
We'd be honoured if you come.

181
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,730
But it would be our day,
celebrated in our way.

182
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,450
Do you know where you
will stage this festivity?

183
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,010
I had thought about the
schoolhouse, My Lord.

184
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,050
But Mr Carson doesn't care for it.

185
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,090
I don't mind the schoolhouse.

186
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,610
Right, then it would seem to be settled.

187
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,650
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

188
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Thank you, My Lady.

189
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,170
- Why did we have to listen to that?!
- I want you to stop bullying them.

190
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,610
- And let them do it their way.
- You think I'm a bully?

191
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,250
- I think you're a snob.
- How do you make that out?

192
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,370
She didn't want the bother of a
servants' wedding in the hall.

193
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,410
That's not fair. We...

194
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Ahem.

195
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Going out, Mr Spratt?

196
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,170
Do I have your permission?

197
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,010
You can go round the world
as far as I'm concerned.

198
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,660
That's very considerate of you.
But a breath of air is all I need.

199
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
(KNOCKING)

200
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,570
Denker, I wonder if I might have
something warm to drink before I go up.

201
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,610
Yes, certainly, My Lady.

202
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,770
How about a nice cup of hot chocolate?

203
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,160
Oh, just the thing. Thank you.

204
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,170
- Um...
- Yes?

205
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,050
My Lady, Mr Spratt seems very
preoccupied at the moment.

206
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,370
I wondered if you knew what it was about.

207
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,530
Does this spring from a
concern for his welfare?

208
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,970
We all have to rub along
together, don't we?

209
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,250
Well, it would be nice if we could.

210
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,930
I worry. Perhaps one of
his friends is in trouble.

211
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,010
I know nothing of Spratt's friends.

212
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,050
I know he has a great many relations

213
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,290
who seem to get married and
buried with numbing regularity.

214
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,330
Usually on very inconvenient days.

215
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,370
Perhaps it's one of them?

216
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,420
Why don't you ask him?

217
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,450
While you're making my chocolate.

218
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,140
Yes, My Lady. Of course.

219
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,930
Oh, My Lord. A quick word.

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,170
It may be that we have a painless
solution to the problem of Barrow.

221
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,610
Oh, yes?

222
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,930
He's applying for a job in the vicinity.

223
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,130
Do you know of a house
called Dryden Park, near York?

224
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,970
The name rings a bell. I think
my parents used to go there.

225
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,490
But I haven't heard anything about it
for years. Is that where he's off to?

226
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,050
- Hopefully. We shall see.
- Ahem.

227
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,570
- Are you quite well?
- Oh, yes.

228
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,680
Just a bit of indigestion.

229
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,050
Carson.

230
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,770
I hope you weren't upset by that
business in the drawing room.

231
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:22,130
Not at all, My Lady. As a matter
of fact, I don't believe Her Ladyship
was acting for snobbish reasons.

232
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,530
Perhaps not. But it annoys me to see
you cheated of your just desserts.

233
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,850
- I wanted the best for you.
- And I shall have it, My Lady.

234
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,020
If you attend the wedding,
that's enough for me.

235
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Good night.

236
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,060
(BELL)

237
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,170
- Yes?
- Hello.

238
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,410
I telephoned earlier in
response to the advertisement.

239
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,450
- Name's Barrow.
- Come in.

240
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,570
- Come in.
- Thank you.

241
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,250
Lady Edith Crawley?

242
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,450
- It is you, isn't it?
- Hello...

243
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,890
Bertie Pelham. We met at Brancaster
when it was let to Lord Sinderby.

244
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,970
Of course! I'm sorry to be so
dense. I remember you very well.

245
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,010
You're the agent. Or you were then.

246
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,530
I am now. Business has brought
me to London for a few days.

247
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,170
Me too.

248
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,530
In fact, it's the longest time I've
spent in London since my cousin came out.

249
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,970
She was with us at
Brancaster. Rose Aldridge.

250
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,810
I remember. I thought you
were a very jolly party.

251
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,850
I told Lord Hexham he should try and
let to the Sinderbys again this year!

252
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,890
Are you having a good time in London?

253
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,250
Well, I've been working since I arrived.

254
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,770
- And missing Marigold, of course.
- Marigold?

255
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,490
My... That is, my ward.

256
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,530
- Our ward.
- Of course.

257
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,570
You told me about her.

258
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,890
- I'd better get on.
- I expect you're busy.

259
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,290
I'm not usually, but I've got rather
a drama on my hands with my magazine.

260
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,410
You've probably forgotten,
but I own a magazine.

261
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,530
Indeed I have not. I thought
it was incredibly modern.

262
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,090
It's incredibly complicated at the moment.

263
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,610
Which is why I have to
get back to the office.

264
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,450
I don't suppose you'd like
a drink with me later on.

265
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,690
- Well...
- Only I'm going home tomorrow.

266
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,730
And I'm not sure when I'll be back.

267
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,410
All right. Why not?

268
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,570
But it will have to be near the office.

269
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,610
We're in Covent Garden.

270
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,370
What about Rules? Will they
let us have a drink there?

271
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,530
I should think so. Shall we say seven?

272
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,980
I'm going to hurry away
before you change your mind!

273
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,610
Perhaps you could tell me a
little more about the job, Mr...

274
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,130
Reresby. Sir Michael Reresby.

275
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,170
Oh.

276
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,010
As you can see, we've
rather let things slide.

277
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,000
It's been very difficult
since my wife died.

278
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,620
I can imagine, Sir Michael.

279
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,880
She was a lady in waiting, do you know?

280
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,200
- To the old Duchess of Connaught. - Ah.

281
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,690
Do you have any other family?

282
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
Two sons.

283
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,900
But they... They never
came back from the war.

284
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,010
Very sorry to hear that.

285
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,290
- Did you serve?
- I was in Flanders, yes.

286
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,060
I served. I got this there.

287
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,180
That's what I need. Someone who knows about
fighting for his king and his country.

288
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,930
I expect this was a wonderful
house for entertaining.

289
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,970
Oh, you should have seen it!

290
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,010
We had such fun in those days.

291
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
(SIGHS)

292
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,100
Do you know what I shall always remember?

293
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,460
The women going up to bed
at the end of the evening.

294
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,140
Their faces lit by the
flame from the candle.

295
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,210
Yes, diamonds twinkling

296
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,900
as they climbed up into the darkness.

297
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,410
Shall we go through here?

298
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,890
As you can see, it's all rather silted up.

299
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,610
- Can you clear a space?
- Of course.

300
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,610
So can you let me know more about the job?

301
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,860
How many staff do you have?

302
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,330
Well, there's Mrs Tonkins. She
comes in three days a week.

303
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,090
And she has to manage everything?

304
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,080
We do have a man outside
every now and then.

305
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,410
But that's why we need you.

306
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,180
In your advertisement, you spoke of a position
of trust, Sir Michael, in a prominent household.

307
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,850
This is a very prominent household.

308
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,890
Can you doubt it?

309
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,930
We have entertained not
just the Connaughts,

310
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,570
but the Fife princesses!

311
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,490
Both of them. The Duke of
Argyll. The Queen of Spain.

312
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,530
Yes... But that was some time ago.

313
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,570
Are you a republican?

314
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,730
No. I don't believe so, but then I've
never really thought about it much.

315
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,770
Well, think about it now!

316
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,530
I can't risk a republican in this
household when anyone might call!

317
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,170
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I'm not quite up to it.

318
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,210
Philosophically.

319
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,890
Thank heavens we picked that
up before he caused any trouble!

320
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
I should be going.

321
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,610
I hope you find the man
you're looking for.

322
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,170
We can't let them down, do you see?

323
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,260
When the good times return,
they will all come back.

324
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,450
We must be ready.

325
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,850
Can't let our standards slip.

326
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,890
No.

327
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,480
And good luck with those standards.

328
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,410
This is what you had
in mind for the cover?

329
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,050
No, don't touch that!

330
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,890
It does seem similar to
last month's, Mr Skinner.

331
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,930
Don't be so absurd. Please!

332
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,970
Where is the copy for this?

333
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,330
Mr Skinner, this really isn't finished.

334
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,370
I have dealt with amateurism.

335
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,410
I've even dealt with incompetence.

336
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,730
But this ridiculous, muddle-headed
meddling just about --

337
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,770
Mr Skinner! That's quite enough.

338
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,500
If that's how you feel, I suggest
we part company once and for all.

339
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,730
I've done it. He's gone.

340
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,770
Good riddance.

341
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,810
And well done.

342
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,850
But what happens now?

343
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,890
We have to get it out by tomorrow.

344
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,610
We have to get the proofs
to the printers by 4am.

345
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,970
- You can't mean to do it yourself.
- Why not?

346
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,650
I refuse to be defeated by a
petulant and overweight tyrant.

347
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,690
I'll lay out the articles as usual.

348
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,730
It's seven o'clock.

349
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,770
Which means we have nine hours.

350
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,890
We'd better get some coffee on and...

351
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,930
Oh, crikey!

352
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,970
I won't be long.

353
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,360
Keep getting the copy together.

354
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,560
- May I help you, madam?
- I won't be long.

355
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,490
I'm so, so sorry. Believe me, if you knew
what I'm living through, you'd forgive me.

356
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,970
- I forgive you anyway.
- I can't have a drink.

357
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,010
I'd love to, but I can't.

358
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,050
My editor has walked out.

359
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,610
I have to get the magazine to the
printers by four in the morning.

360
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,530
So it's sandwiches and
coffee and work until dawn.

361
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,850
- All right.
- You're a darling. Thank you.

362
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,890
Do telephone me if and when
you're up in London again.

363
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,250
No, I meant all right, I'll come with you.

364
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,890
- Come with me where?
- Back to the office.

365
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,330
I can make coffee. I can fetch sandwiches.

366
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,420
I can... carry bits of paper around.

367
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,330
- Shouldn't we get going?
- Aren't you having dinner somewhere?

368
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,770
I thought that's why
you hadn't suggested it.

369
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,730
No, I didn't think you'd accept dinner. I
planned to ask you halfway through the drink.

370
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,180
Right, well, we should get back.

371
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,610
So it's just the causes of the war.

372
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,650
Both wars.

373
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,170
The Spanish succession and the Austrian
succession. You're comparing them.

374
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,610
Don't forget. Keep it
simple and straightforward.

375
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
What is it?

376
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,930
Oh...

377
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,970
I don't know if I should tell you.

378
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,530
Tell me if it's important.
Don't if it's not.

379
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
It might be.

380
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,330
When I was serving tea in the library,

381
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,130
I heard them say that the Drewes
are giving up Yew Tree Farm.

382
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,170
That's what she was thinking!

383
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,810
Her Ladyship knew they were
going to hand in the lease.

384
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,050
She couldn't decide
whether to say anything!

385
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,090
- Don't jump the gun.
- I knew she'd had an idea. I said it!

386
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,610
You've made me so happy! This is
just the tonic Mr Mason needs.

387
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,050
- But it's not definite yet.
- I'll say that. I'll tell him that.

388
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
But he'll be made up.

389
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,290
(BELL)

390
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,330
Who's that?

391
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,370
Somebody at the back door.

392
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,930
Never mind. Mrs Porter can answer
it. It's probably a delivery.

393
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,980
At this time?

394
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,050
Mr Willis, what brings you here?

395
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,090
I'm sorry to call so late.

396
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,080
But I've had an enquiry
which concerns you.

397
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,010
Mm, I'm all ears!

398
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,800
Mr Spratt, do you know a Mr Wally Stern?

399
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,810
Yes, he's my sister's son.

400
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,050
He's been serving time in York prison.

401
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,690
Oh.

402
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,010
Is it absolutely necessary
for Miss Denker to be present?

403
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,170
- Killjoy.
- She'll be questioned next.

404
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,410
So what's the point in
asking her to leave?

405
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,050
Thank you, Sergeant.

406
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,490
I'm aware of the present situation
of my unfortunate nephew.

407
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,810
Not the present situation, I'm afraid.

408
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,250
Mr Stern recently absconded from prison.

409
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,290
He's currently on the run.

410
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,010
Someone answering his description
has been seen in this neighbourhood.

411
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,730
Naturally, we wondered if
he'd tried to make contact.

412
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,770
Not with me, Sergeant, no.

413
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,290
Miss Denker, can you add anything?

414
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,650
No.

415
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,810
Nothing that leads you to suppose
a man was hanging around the house?

416
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,850
I'm afraid not, Sergeant.

417
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,370
Perhaps the identification was a mistake.

418
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,410
Is he very distinctive to look at?

419
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,820
Um... Not very. Quite ordinary, in fact.

420
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,050
All right.

421
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,090
Well, that would seem to be that.

422
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,130
I'll say goodbye.

423
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,450
Of course, if he tries to get in touch...

424
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,840
We'll be on to you in a moment.

425
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,290
I'm sorry. I don't know why
he wanted to drag you into it.

426
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,450
What an interesting family
you have, Mr Spratt.

427
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,810
Mine are quite dull by comparison.

428
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,130
I haven't seen him for years.

429
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,010
It's your sister I feel sorry for.

430
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,060
- She has done nothing to deserve it.
- Of course not.

431
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,370
I do have one question though.

432
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,410
What's that?

433
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,730
After you put him up in the potting shed,

434
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
did he get away safely?

435
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,750
- What's the idea?
- Lady Eltham's costume ball.

436
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,710
I can't decide which guests
are the most important.

437
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,670
Never mind that. Best
clothes and prettiest faces.

438
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,190
Nobody cares about anything else.

439
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,910
You have the address.
They're waiting for you.

440
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,950
He's got everything he needs.

441
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,310
- Put it into Mr Brent's hands.
- Yes, ma'am.

442
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,360
- I'll get you some more coffee.
- Would you?

443
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,830
- Well, you did it.
- We did it.

444
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,160
I really am so grateful.

445
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,110
Are you an editor now?

446
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,750
Does this count in your profession
as a sort of baptism of blood?

447
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,790
I don't know what will happen next.

448
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,390
But it's nice to know I
can do it if I have to.

449
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,430
You certainly can.

450
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,590
I won't though. Not yet.

451
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,350
I'll put someone in charge as a caretaker.

452
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Then I'll think.

453
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,310
In the end, the question must be
are you a country woman or a townie?

454
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,350
It's more than that.

455
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,710
I know now I need a purpose.

456
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,790
That's what I've learned.

457
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,670
I can't just lead one of
those purposeless lives.

458
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,710
You inspire me.

459
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,750
Not many people would say that.

460
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,000
They would if they knew you.

461
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Thank you, Audrey.

462
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,470
So you go home today.

463
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,110
Yes. I'll catch the twelve o'clock
and try and sleep on the train!

464
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,150
What about you?

465
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,700
I'll settle in the new
editor and go back after that.

466
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,550
Our butler is getting married on Saturday.

467
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,870
- Which is quite a big thing.
- Has he been with you a long time?

468
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,670
Forever. He joined us as a junior
footman in my grandfather's day.

469
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,710
I love those stories.

470
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,430
I wonder how much longer
people will tell them.

471
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,470
I know.

472
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,720
Let's not be sad, not today.

473
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,340
After all, we've just edited a magazine.

474
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,830
This just came for you.

475
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,070
- Oh, thank you very much.
- What is it?

476
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Never you mind.

477
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,310
Oh, what a relief! I thought
it wasn't going to get here.

478
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,870
May we know what it is?

479
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,590
It's a frock I ordered as
a surprise for Mrs Hughes.

480
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,430
But with the wedding tomorrow,
I thought we'd missed it.

481
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,550
- Can we have a look?
- Don't see why not.

482
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,710
- Just check Mr Carson's gone.
- It's a relief to me as well.

483
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,830
The one she wanted to wear was awful.

484
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,870
Oh.

485
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,910
Well, it's very...

486
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,550
It's an improvement, we can say that.

487
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,590
Is it? What was the last one like?!

488
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,430
I don't understand. It was
so nice in the picture.

489
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,790
It wasn't dear but... It
seemed like a bargain.

490
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,830
It's the thought that counts.

491
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,870
Not with a frock, it's not!

492
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,510
Lady Mary says she'll lend
her a brooch or something.

493
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,150
A brooch? She'll need a diamond
parure to make this look any good.

494
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
She's coming!

495
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,680
Daisy, I'm afraid Gertie's ill,
so can I ask you to do the fires?

496
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,030
I'm sorry to get you up so early.

497
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,070
That's all right, My Lady.

498
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,510
Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?

499
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,360
No. I've had a cup of tea. That's enough.

500
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,240
I'm having luncheon in York
after I see the hospital.

501
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,270
Daisy, you don't do the bedroom
fires these days, do you?

502
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,310
Not as a rule, My Lady, no.

503
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,270
But Gertie's unwell. And we don't
have a proper scullery maid any more.

504
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,390
I'm afraid I'm not usually
up early enough to know that.

505
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,630
I just wanted to say how
very grateful I am, My Lady.

506
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,190
- Grateful? For what?
- When you said you had a plan.

507
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,510
It was because the Drewes might be
leaving Yew Tree Farm, wasn't it?

508
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,750
- Well...
- I know you can't say anything.

509
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,910
But I'm so thankful to you for trying.

510
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,430
Is something the matter, My Lady?

511
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,870
- I hope she wasn't bothering you.
- No, but...

512
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,910
Never mind.

513
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
We'll see what happens.

514
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,070
Do you remember I thought Mrs Patmore might
have an idea about Mrs Hughes's dress?

515
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,350
She did, and it arrived this morning.

516
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,390
- No good?
- No good at all.

517
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,950
Horrible, in fact. And it's too
late now to order anything else.

518
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,990
Can't we lend her a dress?

519
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,230
She wouldn't fit into a dress of yours.

520
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,590
- And Her Ladyship is too tall.
- An embroidered evening coat?

521
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,630
The length wouldn't matter so much.

522
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,470
I'll ask Mama when I get up.

523
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,310
Miss Baxter said she was
leaving early to go into York.

524
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,350
That's right. She's out all day.

525
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,670
She goes straight from York
to a meeting with Dr Clarkson.

526
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,520
We'll have to manage without her.
She won't mind. She'll be pleased.

527
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,870
I um...

528
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,880
.. just want to make sure
everything is under control.

529
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,750
I think so. Mr Brock is bringing the
flowers and foliage in the morning.

530
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,400
And Mrs Patmore is on top of things.

531
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,990
Are you nervous?

532
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,470
A little. And I'm sad about my dress.

533
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,150
I wish I'd made more of an effort.

534
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,190
But it's too late now.

535
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,230
I'm sure you'll look wonderful.

536
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,670
- Well, I'll look tidy.
- What about tonight?

537
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,510
We mustn't see each other tonight.

538
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,550
I'm having dinner in here.

539
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,480
And they'll warn you when I'm going
up so we don't meet on the stairs!

540
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,070
Am I hearing right?

541
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,190
You went behind our backs and
betrayed us to the enemy?

542
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,350
Whose enemy? They're not my enemy.

543
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,950
I asked to see the Royal Yorkshire.

544
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,110
And to meet with the doctors in charge

545
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,470
so I could learn the benefits of a merger.

546
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,230
Today, they were good enough to
give me a tour and a luncheon.

547
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,230
- Am I to think ill of them for that?
- And you don't call that betrayal?

548
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,350
It's called being in
possession of the facts.

549
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,390
I wondered when we'd hear from you.

550
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,630
It's unfortunate if you've given them the
impression that we approve of the plan.

551
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,670
But I do approve of it.

552
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,230
And you're the fount
of wisdom on this topic!

553
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,390
I don't claim to know
more than any of you.

554
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,830
I'm glad you don't claim to know
more than I do, Lady Grantham.

555
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,070
- But I am disappointed.
- And we know why.

556
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,110
If we don't, I gather we will soon.

557
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,150
I'm afraid you see the new arrangement
as diminishing your own importance.

558
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,270
- What?
- You're the king of this place.

559
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,590
But once it's a wing of the Royal
Yorkshire, you'll be one more local doctor.

560
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
With some authority, yes.
But it will not be the same.

561
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,630
- Mrs Crawley doesn't mean that.
- I'd like to think that.

562
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,790
But it sounds very much as if she does.

563
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,830
Did you drink at luncheon?

564
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,350
No, I did not. Which you know
very well since we were together.

565
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,390
Not all the time.

566
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,510
Shall we call a halt to this
before we say things we will regret?

567
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,870
I rather hope Mrs Crawley
regrets what she's said already.

568
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,910
I'm going home.

569
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,550
In future, let's try to manage
things in a more civilised manner.

570
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,590
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

571
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
Goodbye, Lady Grantham.

572
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,870
Has tea gone up?

573
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,910
Not yet, oh great one.

574
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,030
How did you get on at Dryden Park?

575
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,470
It wasn't right for me, Mr Carson.

576
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,240
Pity. Mr Molesley, Andrew, tea.

577
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,870
- Won't be long now.
- Something will turn up.

578
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,430
I expect you will be glad
to see the back of me.

579
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
If it's what you want.

580
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,630
- He means it too.
- Don't fish.

581
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,150
Especially where they're
never going to bite.

582
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,310
- You've got me wrong.
You all have. - How?

583
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,070
I don't want anything
from Andy but friendship.

584
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,230
We were friends when he first came. I
helped to get him the job, for God's sake!

585
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,790
But now you've all poisoned
his mind against me.

586
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,830
- Then tell him.
- It's too late.

587
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,950
The damage has been done.

588
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,480
You don't believe me anyway.

589
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,310
Mrs Hughes.

590
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,150
Can you pop up to Her
Ladyship's room for a moment?

591
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,190
- Whatever for?
- Lady Mary has a surprise for you.

592
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,750
A surprise? For me?

593
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,790
Why?

594
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,950
You're getting married tomorrow. That
might have something to do with it.

595
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,140
Can we meet there at five?

596
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,590
Here she is, the famous editor!

597
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,980
Trailing streamers of success.

598
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,710
This is the mock-up.

599
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,270
It does seem weird that
we managed it in time.

600
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,310
We managed it?

601
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,350
The office. We all pulled together.

602
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,480
I think it's perfectly
brilliant, darling. Don't you?

603
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,190
I'm back, but I'm going
upstairs to get straight.

604
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,630
- And to calm down.
- Why? How was your day?

605
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,240
The morning was interesting.
The afternoon was ghastly.

606
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,870
Oh, Mama, you'll find...

607
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,070
See? That dress doesn't look bad now

608
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,270
as a foil to set off the
colours of the embroidery.

609
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,310
I agree. It's plainness is a virtue.

610
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,660
And I'm sure we can do
something about the length.

611
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,510
Excuse me? Will someone
explain to me what's going on?

612
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,230
- Didn't Lady Mary tell you, My Lady?
- Tell me what?

613
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,590
That Mrs Hughes is going to borrow
one of your coats to be married in.

614
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,510
Was I to have any say in this as
you rifle through my cupboards?

615
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,350
Your Ladyship, there's obviously
been a misunderstanding.

616
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,390
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes.

617
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,510
This is not the kind of behaviour
I would look for from you.

618
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,550
We'll hang them up at once
and leave you in peace.

619
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,590
Lady Mary said --

620
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,310
Lady Mary may dispose of her
own clothes as she sees fit.

621
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,270
But I do not know what gives her
the right to dispose of mine.

622
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,600
Now please leave me. I have a
headache and I need to lie down.

623
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,990
- You're very prompt.
- Oh, My Lady.

624
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,030
We've had an awful business.

625
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,190
Her Ladyship walked in when Mrs
Hughes was trying on the coats.

626
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,670
I don't know. She seemed to
think we were stealing them.

627
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,710
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not.

628
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,270
I've never seen her so angry.
Poor Mrs Hughes. She feels awful.

629
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,840
We can't have that on the day
before her wedding. Leave it to me.

630
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
- (KNOCKING)
- Yes?

631
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,670
I hope Anna's wrong, but she seems to
think you wouldn't lend Mrs Hughes a coat.

632
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,630
I just walked in and they
were putting on my clothes.

633
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,670
Please tell me you weren't rude.

634
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,750
Your mother has had a horrible afternoon with
Granny. They were at each other's throats.

635
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,390
Does that excuse insulting a woman who
has served us faithfully for many years,

636
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,750
who simply wanted something
nice to be married in?

637
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I tried to but you stormed off.

638
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,070
What was Mrs Hughes doing in there?

639
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,110
Typical though, isn't it?

640
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,550
30 years of service, one wrong move,
and... snap, you're out on your ear.

641
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,070
They're very appreciative of our service.

642
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,910
It was not a wrong move and
she is not out on her ear.

643
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,950
I won't speak ill of Her Ladyship.

644
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,310
Not when she's doing what
she's doing for Mr Mason.

645
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,350
- What's this?
- Daisy.

646
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,990
- You must talk when it isn't settled.
- I want to get things settled.

647
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,030
Don't we all?

648
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,790
You seem unusually disenchanted
with life these days, Mr Barrow.

649
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,310
I can't see the future, Mr Carson.

650
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,960
But then, I suppose, none of us can.

651
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,790
Don't let it upset you.

652
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
It does upset me.

653
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,680
I felt like a naughty
child in need of a smack.

654
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,830
Anyway, I'm going up now. It's past ten.

655
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,440
- (KNOCKING)
- Yes?

656
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,040
- May I come in?
- Please.

657
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,030
Mrs Hughes, I won't beat about the bush.

658
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,070
I behaved badly earlier.

659
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,520
I hope you'll accept my apology.

660
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,990
It must have been strange to
find us all there, My Lady.

661
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,830
Nevertheless, I have no
excuse to behave as I did.

662
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,670
Not to someone who deserves
our loyalty as you do.

663
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,430
- Please forgive me.
- Of course.

664
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,790
I can only say I was angry about
something quite different.

665
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,830
I allowed it to cloud my judgement.

666
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,870
We've all done that, My Lady.

667
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,470
Finally, I'd like you to have this coat.

668
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,270
I... I'm not sure it was a good idea.

669
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,990
Please. Or I'll feel I've spoiled the day,
which is the very last thing I'd want to do.

670
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,310
Furthermore, I want you to keep it.

671
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,950
Well, I...

672
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,680
I've asked Baxter to fit it for you
tonight. She's happy to do that.

673
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,310
Very well, My Lady. I'm very grateful.

674
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,960
I'm not sure when I'll wear it again.

675
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,310
- But you never know.
- You never do.

676
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,520
- I'll say good night.
- Good night, Your Ladyship.

677
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,080
- For Mr Carson.
- Thank you.

678
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,610
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in.

679
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,490
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

680
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540
That's lovely.

681
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,890
- What's happened? What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.

682
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,930
We've come to dress the bride.

683
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,920
There's a sentence I
never thought I'd hear.

684
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,930
Ring and...

685
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,970
Ring.

686
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,020
Ohh...

687
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,690
- Mr Brock brought these for you.
- What are they?

688
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,650
They're roses with
heather for buttonholes.

689
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,770
He's done that to one of Mrs Hughes'.

690
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,010
- Very nice, but whom are they for?
- For you and your ushers.

691
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,050
My ushers? I've not got any ushers.

692
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,410
- Perhaps you should
have, Mr Carson. - Oh...

693
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,850
Take one for yourself. Give one to Andrew.

694
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,170
- Remove the fern.
- What about me, Mr Carson?

695
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,340
Take one. I might as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb.

696
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,890
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

697
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,930
in sickness and in health,

698
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,450
to love, cherish, and to obey,

699
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,490
till death us do part.

700
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,140
According to God's holy ordinance...

701
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,930
With this ring, I thee wed.

702
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,730
With my body, I thee worship.

703
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,730
All my worldly goods, I thee endow.

704
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,740
In the name of the Father and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

705
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,260
In the name of the Father and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

706
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,290
Ohh...

707
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,140
I now pronounce you man and wife together.

708
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,780
♪ BAGPIPES

709
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,020
Oh, thank you.

710
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,820
(CHEERING)

711
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,690
- I'm so glad to see you here.
- Couldn't miss Carson's wedding.

712
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,250
I felt uncomfortable about the
way I spoke to you the other day.

713
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,490
- You said what you thought.
- I don't think I did. Not truly.

714
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,530
I was exasperated by Lady Grantham.

715
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,170
And you got in the way.

716
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,810
Don't be too quick to condemn
yourself. I'm not sure you were wrong.

717
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,570
Maybe I haven't focused on
what's best for the village.

718
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,210
What is this?

719
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,930
Dr Clarkson is reviewing his position.

720
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,970
I hope this is wishful
thinking on Mrs Crawley's part.

721
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,730
To be honest, I don't know.

722
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,290
But if something is that important,
it's worth considering more than once.

723
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:29,410
Really? In my experience, second
thoughts are vastly overrated.

724
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,850
But we mustn't be too blinkered, surely?

725
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,410
It's not just Mrs Crawley
and Lady Grantham.

726
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,330
Your old friend Lord Merton
is in favour of reform.

727
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,380
A peer in favour of reform. It's
like a turkey in favour of Christmas.

728
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
(CHEERING)

729
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,890
Nice to see you here.

730
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,450
- A wonderful service.
- Thank you, My Lord.

731
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,490
Please understand that
nothing is going to change.

732
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,130
I doubt you'd agree, Mrs... Carson.

733
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,620
We'll try to keep the
changes manageable, My Lady.

734
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,580
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

735
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,730
I'm so happy for you. I'm sorry if I
made things awkward about the reception.

736
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,770
Please forgive me.

737
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,620
My Lady, Mr Carson would forgive you
if you attacked him with a brick!

738
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,010
You don't have to worry,
you know, Mr Spratt.

739
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,650
No?

740
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,810
I can keep secrets when I want to.

741
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,580
Maybe. But the question
remains, will you want to?

742
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,810
Ah, mm.

743
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,850
You're very sunny again.

744
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,900
- I love weddings, don't you?
- I liked mine.

745
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,290
You would tell me if you'd
fallen in love with someone else?

746
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,080
I shouldn't think so. Not for a moment.

747
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,730
Because there's something
about you just now.

748
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,370
And there's something about you, Mr Bates.

749
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,850
There's definitely something about you.

750
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,900
There she is now.

751
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,890
You won't regret it. She's
more than equal to the task.

752
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,650
In fact, I think she'll do you credit.

753
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,170
I think she'll do you credit, Mr Molesley.

754
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,330
You seem to have been an
excellent influence in all this.

755
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,220
Well, I believe that education is the
gate that leads to any future worth having.

756
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,200
Have you missed your vocation?

757
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,210
I've missed everything, Mr Dawes.

758
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,400
But Daisy doesn't have to.

759
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,330
Mr Mason is so full of
gratitude, Your Ladyship.

760
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,170
It's like a dream after
a nightmare, My Lady.

761
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,210
But please, you mustn't think...

762
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,260
May I have silence?

763
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,170
Thank you.

764
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,210
Mr Barrow.

765
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,050
Before we take our seats,
I believe, as the groom,

766
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,090
that I have the right to a few words.

767
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,810
I will not be prolix,

768
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:08,330
but it must be right that I mark that
I am the happiest and luckiest of men.

769
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,650
That a woman of such grace and charm

770
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,340
should entrust her life's
happiness to my unworthy charge...

771
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,490
.. passeth all understanding.

772
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,890
To my wonderful bride.

773
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,930
The bride and groom!

774
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,970
ALL: The bride and groom!

775
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,010
To the bride and groom.

776
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,050
Ohh!

777
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,090
Tom!

778
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,730
And Sybbie, darling!
What are you doing here?

779
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,850
And how did you know where to find us?

780
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,290
The hall boy on duty
told me where you were.

781
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,010
It means that I can
congratulate you in person.

782
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,050
Mr and Mrs Carson.

783
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,090
- Oh, are you back for a holiday?
- Say you'll stay!

784
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,130
That's just the point.

785
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,650
I can stay as long as you want me.

786
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,450
I don't understand. What are you saying?

787
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,410
Just this. That I've come back
and I'd like to stay for good.

788
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,170
- If Lord Grantham will have me.
- Of course we'll have you!

789
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,220
- We'll be delighted!
- I echo every syllable.

790
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,450
Hello, darling Sybbie!

791
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Give old Donk a kiss!

792
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,330
Tom, this is such wonderful
news. Are you sure?

793
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,450
I'm really, really sure.

794
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,130
So what happened?

795
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,170
It's quite simple.

796
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,130
I had to go all the way to
Boston to figure something out.

797
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,170
- But that's what I did.
- What was it?

798
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,210
I learned that Downton is my home.

799
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,250
And that you are my family.

800
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,700
If I didn't quite know that
before I left, I know it now.

801
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,610
- Sybbie!
- Marigold!

802
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,660
Hello.

803
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,090
If I am to live out my life here, I need
something to do that isn't just the estate.

804
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,610
- How enterprising.
- We talk about making a difference.

805
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,650
But this could actually change lives.

806
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,810
Hasn't got time to greet her old friends.

807
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,650
When were you a friend of Gwen's?

808
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,690
No-one has sharper eyes than a loving son.

809
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,330
You read that somewhere.

810
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,370
You're not hiding anything?

811
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,450
- Don't give me not possible!
- All right, madam! Finish that mash!

812
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,210
Cousin Isobel is entitled
to put up an argument.

813
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,780
Of course. She's just
not entitled to win it!
