1
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,192
- Shall I help?
- Well, you can.

2
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:47,896
- You know what these
are, don't you? - No.

3
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,692
Pig boards. They control the pigs.

4
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,544
Are you annoyed we've given
Yew Tree Farm to Mr Mason?

5
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:58,454
I'm annoyed you fixed it
while I was in London,

6
00:00:58,506 --> 00:00:59,950
but no, he's a good man.

7
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:01,945
And I hear pigs are his speciality.

8
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:04,222
No wonder you were convinced.

9
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,482
So now that you've settled in, have you
decided what your next task will be?

10
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:12,140
You haven't done much about the repair shop
while I was away, so I'll start with that.

11
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:15,757
I had an idea to put it on the edge of
the estate with access to the village.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,409
For passing trade?

13
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,573
Why not?

14
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,641
Is Papa ready for that?

15
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,530
Hmm. You must be gentle with him.

16
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,474
When does Mr Mason move in?

17
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:26,845
His equipment's already there.

18
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:29,838
And the Drewes leave on Wednesday,
so there's no point in waiting.

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,667
And what about his old farm?

20
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,953
Mr Henderson's taken over the land.

21
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:37,071
He's going to move his uncle into
the house, much good may it do him.

22
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:39,190
Nay. There's no need for bitterness now.

23
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:40,770
Things have worked out well.

24
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,890
- You're right.
- Oh, I tell you what.

25
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:46,975
Why don't we go over on the day? We'll
take a picnic tea and lend him a hand.

26
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,375
I could come, too. Another pair of hands.

27
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,859
And very welcome, I have no doubt.

28
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,787
Good news?

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,645
Oh, it's just a friend who's
going to be in London.

30
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:00,723
- He wants to meet up.
- He?

31
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,095
It's nothing like that.

32
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:05,170
It's Bertie Pelham, the
agent from Brancaster Castle.

33
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:07,416
I remember him. He shot with us.

34
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:11,083
And he helped get the magazine
out during my night of terror.

35
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,152
The Dowager Countess.

36
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:15,105
Hello, Granny. What are you doing here?

37
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:18,774
My dear. I am in need of a favour.

38
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,299
Is Cora about?

39
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:24,001
Er, no, she's got some
charity thing in the village.

40
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,445
Oh, good.

41
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,035
Why don't I like the sound of that?

42
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:28,751
I'll leave you.

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,616
The Minister of Health
is paying us a visit.

44
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,643
Mr Chamberlain? I don't think so.

45
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:39,142
Now, listen. He's on an
inspection tour of the north.

46
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,668
He wants to see what's been
happening since the war.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,837
- Seems very sensible.
- And I want him to come here.

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,742
I want him to listen to our arguments
against the York Hospital's plans.

49
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,436
Mama, what is the point?

50
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:53,307
Don't be jejune. You know very well,

51
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:57,557
one word from Westminster and
the scheme would be abandoned.

52
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:01,505
But why would he say the word, and
why would he ever come to Downton?

53
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:06,494
You know, Neville Chamberlain's
wife was born Anne de Vere Cole.

54
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,141
Guess who was her godfather.

55
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:11,721
You guess for me.

56
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:15,929
Your late papa, the
sixth Earl of Grantham.

57
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:19,837
He and her father served in the
Crimea together when they were young.

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,946
I have known her since she was born.

59
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:24,982
I admit I am quite interested, but
when it comes to getting him here,

60
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:28,857
I would say you have no more chance
than a cat in hell without claws.

61
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,061
We'll see.

62
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:38,709
Mr Carson has suggested we might
have dinner in our cottage tonight,

63
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,735
so I thought I'd ask your advice.

64
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,022
Oh, is this going to be a regular thing?

65
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:45,391
I don't think so. Once in a while.

66
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,719
Well, there's pate left
over and some chops.

67
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,507
- I'll make up a basket.
- Would you?

68
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,045
Oh, that would be so kind.

69
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,624
When did you last cook?

70
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:53,954
I've done the odd thing...

71
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:57,498
Oh, well, of course, as we
all know, anyone can cook.

72
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,366
Don't be like that. It's not my idea.

73
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,603
But it might be nice.

74
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,099
Mrs Patmore's just jealous.

75
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,187
I'm sure she's not.

76
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,910
But I would be grateful for the basket.

77
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,205
Well, maybe I am.

78
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,863
I nearly forgot. That chap, Henry...

79
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:15,985
- Talbot?
- Exactly.

80
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:17,731
Yes, he telephoned while you were out.

81
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:19,352
He's going to be in Yorkshire on Wednesday

82
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:22,428
to look at a car and he wants
you to watch him doing it.

83
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,140
Hmm. To watch him looking at a car?

84
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,341
Well, not quite. He's driving
it round some track nearby.

85
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:29,744
- At Catterick.
- Testing it.

86
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:31,199
Seeing how it handles.

87
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,945
- I could take you, if you like.
- Would you?

88
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,608
Well, I'd like to see it.

89
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,101
- How about you?
- I'll be in London on Wednesday.

90
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:38,224
Edith has a date.

91
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:40,220
- No, I don't.
- Of course not.

92
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,633
What do you mean, "Of course not"?

93
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,919
Doctor Clarkson seems to be coming round.

94
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,662
Isobel's bringing him for a
drink tonight with Dickie Merton.

95
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,741
So that's why Mama paid her visit.

96
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,154
When? What did she want?

97
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,606
Neville Chamberlain is coming north.

98
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:56,026
She wants him to dine here, so she
can convince him to support her.

99
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:59,050
If he's on a tour, it'll be far
too late to alter his schedule.

100
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:02,718
That's what I said, but she seems
to think she can persuade him.

101
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,295
Is it wrong to hope she's mistaken?

102
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:10,980
Anything interesting?

103
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:16,394
It's Sergeant Willis saying he'll collect
me on Wednesday at nine, to go to York.

104
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,077
For the trial.

105
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:20,665
Would you like me to come, too?

106
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:22,826
- Could you get the time off?
- Well, I could ask.

107
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:24,864
You shouldn't have to
go to the trial alone.

108
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:25,985
What trial?

109
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:28,646
Miss Baxter has been called
to be a witness on Wednesday.

110
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:31,057
I want to go along, keep her company.

111
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,884
- I think you should.
- Mr Carson will understand.

112
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:35,214
I'm only a character witness.

113
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:37,583
Character witnesses can
make all the difference.

114
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:39,246
Why do they want you to testify?

115
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,114
There's a man being
tried for theft and I...

116
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,485
I knew him once.

117
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:45,772
Will your words affect the outcome?

118
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:48,059
- Possibly.
- You must think about it carefully.

119
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,332
She has thought about it,
Mr Bates. Very carefully.

120
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,629
- Where were you?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Barrow.

121
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:56,413
It was only coffee for the family,
so I thought Andy could manage.

122
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:59,240
He could. But it's for me to say, not you.

123
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,517
I'm going into the village in
a while. Do you want to come?

124
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,138
Thanks, but no, thanks.

125
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,634
I thought you needed some things.

126
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:09,965
Nothing urgent.

127
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,336
Right. Is that it?

128
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:12,843
Er... Yes.

129
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,447
I'm glad to see you here again, Dickie.

130
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,107
Well, it's very good to be here, but
it's only about the row, I'm afraid.

131
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,230
Oh, never mind that.

132
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,889
We've brought Doctor Clarkson with
us because there's something that you,

133
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,176
or at any rate, Cora, will want to hear.

134
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,546
Do I detect that you're changing sides?

135
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,052
Er, maybe.

136
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:31,455
Have you told my mother?

137
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:34,490
Poor man. If he's changing his
mind, don't let's put him off.

138
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,402
Oh, that reminds me. I
have a message from her.

139
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:40,569
She says that the Health Minister
is happy to dine here this Friday.

140
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,678
What? How did she manage that?

141
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:44,508
She must have found a
way to blackmail him.

142
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,793
- You don't mean that.
- I wouldn't put it past her.

143
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:50,462
If she's convinced him to come here,
she can make him condemn the scheme.

144
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:52,322
Well, she mustn't.

145
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:54,816
And I want the three of
you here to support me.

146
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,676
Aye, aye, Captain.

147
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:04,917
Is Mr Barrow getting on your nerves?

148
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,585
- Only earlier, you seemed to --
- No, it's not that.

149
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,030
He only means to be friendly.

150
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,773
I know. And he was good to
me when I first arrived.

151
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,769
So, what is it, then?

152
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:17,190
Well...

153
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:20,381
Since I've come, I've got to
know a bit more about him.

154
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:23,135
I don't like to say with a lady present.

155
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:25,701
We both know Mr Barrow pretty well.

156
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:28,112
The point is, I wouldn't want
to give him any wrong ideas.

157
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,443
I'm not sure that's fair.

158
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:31,645
Fair or not, I think it's
better if he knows what's what.

159
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:33,683
I bear him no ill will, mind.

160
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:34,930
We are what we are.

161
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:36,925
Isn't that the truth?

162
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,121
My compliments to the chef.

163
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:44,459
Who is Mrs Patmore, not me.

164
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,111
What was Mr Molesley asking?

165
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:50,195
Er, he wants to accompany Miss
Baxter into York on Wednesday morning.

166
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:52,845
Apparently, you've said she can go.

167
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:54,425
I have, yes.

168
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:56,753
- Will you let him?
- I don't see why not.

169
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:59,496
- What's it for?
- Sergeant Willis needs her help.

170
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:01,450
Sergeant Willis again?

171
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:05,119
Do other butlers have to contend with
the police arriving every ten minutes?

172
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,313
Not often.

173
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,236
Now, are you ready?

174
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,542
Hmm.

175
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,708
Are... Are these done enough?

176
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,048
Yes.

177
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,991
Shall I fetch the vegetables?

178
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:21,994
This plate's cold, which is a pity.

179
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,602
Ah, what's this?

180
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:30,879
What do you think?

181
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,668
Bubble and squeak.

182
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,964
As a vegetable with lamb?

183
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,918
I like it with lamb.

184
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,866
Well, we mustn't let it get cold.

185
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,588
This knife could do with sharpening.

186
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,855
All settled in for the night?

187
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:01,016
She is, but she won't sleep a wink.

188
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:03,303
She's too annoyed and I don't blame her.

189
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,462
- What's happened now?
- She says Doctor Clarkson has only planned

190
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:08,873
to throw her over for Mrs Crawley.

191
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,868
- She's seen it coming.
- What do you mean?

192
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,027
He doesn't want to support
her ladyship any more.

193
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,075
What cheek!

194
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:17,810
Don't go working yourself up.

195
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:20,813
Who does he think he is?

196
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:22,965
Jumped up little saw-bones!

197
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,960
I should steer clear.

198
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:27,214
No doubt.

199
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,031
But you and I don't think
alike, do we, Mr Spratt?

200
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,307
On this or any other subject.

201
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:35,404
I'll wish you good night.

202
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:43,458
When's your train?

203
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,035
- Nine. - Is this
another magazine crisis?

204
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,279
No. But I am interviewing
possible editors.

205
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,485
Women?

206
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,938
- Women. - Well, I approve.
Good luck with that.

207
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,556
- But then, who's the date with?
- It's not a date.

208
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:57,175
It's just a friend, as I keep saying.

209
00:09:57,476 --> 00:10:00,636
What are you up to today? Haven't
you got some plan with a racing car?

210
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:03,327
Later. We're looking for a site
for the repair shop this morning.

211
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,740
Then we'll go over to
Catterick after lunch.

212
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,359
I want to look in on Mason before we do.

213
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,019
- He's moving in today.
- As long as the pigs are settled.

214
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,848
You joke, but I am concerned.

215
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,883
I've asked him to take over, but
pig-keeping needs physical strength,

216
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:17,128
- now I think of it.
- You're right, of course.

217
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,583
They're strong and can be dangerous.

218
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:19,788
Ask him if he's up to it.

219
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,366
- I think I must.
- A day of racing cars and pigs.

220
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,360
Who could better that?

221
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:28,029
- Who's dining at home this time?
- Nobody.

222
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,848
It's to welcome Daisy's Mr Mason.

223
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,302
He's moving in today.

224
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:33,297
Wish him well from me.

225
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:36,966
And I hope he gets more fun out
of his hamper than Mr Carson did.

226
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:38,203
Why? What was the matter with it?

227
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,281
Nothing was the matter with it.

228
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:44,407
Except for the fact that, I don't
seem to cook like his mother.

229
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,270
Oh, I think the correct response
is to say "Men!" and sigh.

230
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,141
What's this?

231
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,219
Don't mind us.

232
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:56,077
- How can I help?
- Miss Baxter is expecting me?

233
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:58,208
Daisy, run and fetch her.

234
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,649
Look after Miss Baxter, Sergeant.

235
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,819
- She's in a very frail frame of mind.
- I'll do me best.

236
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,228
But we're after catching a nasty fish
and he's bound to thresh about a bit.

237
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:09,046
And we'll get caught in the spray?

238
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:10,833
Good luck, love.

239
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:21,152
If we put the gate here, you'd be on
a lane that links with the main road.

240
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:24,010
You'd get power and plumbing
from the supply at King's Barrow.

241
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:26,338
Why don't we put the repair shed there?

242
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,001
King's Barrow is a working farm.

243
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,994
There isn't a spare farmyard
half as accessible as here.

244
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:33,332
We ought to look at the costs.

245
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:35,816
It's good of you to come with me today.

246
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:38,227
Glad to, but he won't want me there.

247
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,435
Nonsense. You have far more
in common with him than I do.

248
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,181
Is it serious?

249
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:46,426
He's attractive and nice,

250
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:49,917
and it's good to remember
I'm a youngish woman again.

251
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,196
But that's all.

252
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:52,640
Youngish?

253
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,774
I don't mean to sound snobbish,
but I won't marry down.

254
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:01,338
Was Mr Matthew Crawley so
very special in that way?

255
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,841
Matthew was the heir to
the earldom and estate.

256
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,116
I don't want to be
grander than my husband.

257
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,571
Or richer.

258
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:12,489
It may surprise you, but I agree
it's important to be balanced,

259
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:15,222
that one should not be far
stronger than the other.

260
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:18,766
I just don't think it has much
to do with money or position.

261
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:21,468
Is that how you felt about Sybil?

262
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:24,284
To all of you, she had
everything and I had nothing.

263
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:28,119
She was the great lady, and
I the man who drove the cars,

264
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:30,529
but that wasn't true for us.

265
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:33,897
We were evenly matched, Sybil and I.

266
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,682
She was strong in her beliefs, so was I.

267
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:40,630
We were a marriage of
equals. We were very happy.

268
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,447
I think we see that now.

269
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,276
The family, I mean.

270
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,147
Not at first, you're right.

271
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,591
But now.

272
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:03,109
- Good day to you.
- Good day?

273
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:05,686
A wonder you've got the
nerve to speak to me.

274
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:08,814
- I beg your pardon?
- Throwing over my lady,

275
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,464
when she's been running this
village since you were eating

276
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:13,334
porridge in the glen with your mummy.

277
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:16,161
I don't believe I am required
to justify my actions to you.

278
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,823
Because you can't.

279
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,492
Tell me, what would you
call it? Gratitude?

280
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,184
Because I'd call it treason.

281
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:29,597
Would you? Well, I call it impertinence,
to a degree that is not acceptable.

282
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:33,173
And I'm afraid you haven't
heard the last of this.

283
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,776
Well, you look very chirpy.

284
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,190
Oh, I think we'll have fun.

285
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,268
Besides, I've had some news.

286
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,347
They've nearly finished
the work on my house.

287
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:45,051
- Oh, that was quick.
- Was it?

288
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:48,043
It doesn't feel very
quick, but it's almost done.

289
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,122
Now you just have to find some customers.

290
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,585
But it's exciting, isn't it?

291
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,800
- Did you hear?
- That he changed his plea? Yes.

292
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:04,796
I was in court. I've only just come out.

293
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:08,464
I expect when he heard that you turned
up, he must've known it was pointless.

294
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,418
So I've been spared.

295
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,193
How do you feel?

296
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:15,644
In one way, I feel relieved, of course.

297
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:18,856
The newspapers won't find me and
there'll be no repercussions.

298
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,381
- But?
- I suppose I'd worked myself up

299
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:24,592
into facing him across courtroom,
this man who ruined my life,

300
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:28,666
and now it feels a bit anticlimactic.

301
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:34,985
Shall I go back in and ask him
to plead not guilty after all?

302
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,227
No, thank you.

303
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:42,633
We should leave. Sergeant
Willis is fetching the car.

304
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:54,770
It does me good to see a friendly
woman bustling about a kitchen.

305
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,096
I've got tea for all of us,
and a snack for you later on.

306
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,458
You're an angel of mercy.

307
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,662
Are we interrupting?

308
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:01,826
Not a bit of it, m'lady.

309
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,157
You're very welcome here.

310
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,025
We had just wanted to look
in to see how you were doing.

311
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:08,395
Daisy can tell you where
to find our office.

312
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,879
Daisy will be a great help to me.

313
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:13,809
We wanted to discuss the pigs.

314
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:16,043
- Shall we go outside?
- We can talk here, m'lady.

315
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:18,080
There's nothing private about it.

316
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:19,410
Very well.

317
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,153
Of course, I understand you
have a lot of experience.

318
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,400
A great deal.

319
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,063
I'm top at pigs.

320
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:27,723
But Lady Mary is a little worried
about the physical side of it.

321
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,934
Prising a boar off a sow or taking
the piglets from their mother.

322
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,844
Is this because I'm older than I was?

323
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:39,040
Of course, you may have already
chosen a farm hand to help you.

324
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,239
We've discussed it, Mr Mason and I.

325
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,764
He'll give me warning when there's
any chance of a bit of strong arm

326
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,302
and I'll walk down from the house.

327
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,129
So you'll be there for the servicing,
and the separating and the rest of it?

328
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,914
We'll plan it round when
Mr Carson can release me.

329
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:55,407
- It's not every day.
- That's very good of you, Andrew.

330
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,653
I want to train in the
care of pigs, m'lady.

331
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,689
I want to learn as much
as I can about farming.

332
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:02,984
Oh, I see. Well, good.

333
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,802
That seems to settle it.

334
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:08,491
We must go. We're on our way
to Catterick and we're late.

335
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:12,004
- We hope you'll be very happy here.
- Thank you.

336
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:21,481
Well, I do want to train.

337
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,093
I do want to learn.

338
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:25,222
It were no word of a lie.

339
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,411
Why does Lord Hexham spend
so much time in Tangier?

340
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:31,156
I suppose he likes it there.

341
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,107
If I had Brancaster Castle, I'm
not sure I'd ever want to leave.

342
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,614
I agree.

343
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,308
He's not really a country type.

344
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,802
More arty than sporty,
if you know what I mean.

345
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,923
He doesn't hunt or shoot?

346
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:44,053
Hardly. He paints.

347
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,622
What does he paint?

348
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:48,417
The young men of Tangier, mainly.

349
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,777
You know, scenes of local life.

350
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:53,863
And he's never wanted to marry?

351
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,474
I wouldn't quite say that.

352
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:57,385
It's always been sort of
understood that he and his cousin,

353
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,506
Adela Graham, will marry eventually.

354
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,044
Understood by whom?

355
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:03,246
By the two sets of parents.

356
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:05,481
How romantic.

357
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,152
But you like him?

358
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:10,729
You wouldn't ever want to
find something else to do?

359
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,766
I'd hate to leave Brancaster

360
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:16,143
and I'm very fond of Cousin Peter,
even if he isn't a countryman.

361
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:18,720
He hasn't a nasty bone in his body.

362
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,537
What are we doing this evening?

363
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,075
Have I got your evening, too?

364
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,860
Come to my flat for a
drink, I'll show it to you.

365
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,605
Then we can go somewhere else. You choose.

366
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,393
What a racy plan.

367
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:32,053
Not as racy as all that, worse luck.

368
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,174
But I'd like your opinion.

369
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:36,168
And you shall have it.

370
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:01,359
Charlie's going to beat him
again. It infuriates him.

371
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,063
Mr Rogers is a good driver.

372
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,266
I know, but they take such risks.

373
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,220
I hate it. I just hate it.

374
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:09,174
There's no such thing
as slow motor racing.

375
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:10,763
Even so.

376
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:13,081
And there's no such thing as safe love.

377
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,450
Real love means giving
someone the power to hurt you.

378
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,726
Which I won't concede easily.

379
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:48,081
She went well.

380
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:51,116
She's perfect, Charles.
Don't change a thing.

381
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,067
I think I started after you.

382
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,854
You're a bad loser!

383
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:57,725
- Well?
- How fast.

384
00:18:57,777 --> 00:18:59,679
That is the general idea.

385
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:01,424
It looks like she handles well.

386
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:02,672
Will you take her to Brooklands?

387
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:03,919
Brooklands and other tracks.

388
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:06,038
I think I've found my new
car. What do you say, Charlie?

389
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,283
Well, she must be good to beat me.

390
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:10,154
- If you did.
- Oh, I did and I will again.

391
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,692
Then we must celebrate.

392
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,646
Well, there's a pub at Catterick.

393
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,973
Not for me, I'm afraid. I have to go home.

394
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,553
- Oh.
- Let's go anyway.

395
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:19,891
Okay. Just let me get changed.

396
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:22,957
Help him to enjoy it.

397
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:27,165
You don't have to marry him, but you
do have to let him enjoy this moment.

398
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,772
You're not nervous? Because I would be.

399
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:32,933
No. I'm looking forward to it.

400
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,429
We'll make a pig man of you yet.

401
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:36,591
I'll lend you some books
when we go inside.

402
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,296
- Books?
- On pig breeding and care.

403
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:40,166
You need to know the theory of it.

404
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:41,662
You'll be glad of the knowledge.

405
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,074
It makes the work more logical.

406
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,830
Well, then.

407
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:49,509
Thank you, we'll be in touch.

408
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,301
- How many more?
- Just one.

409
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:54,715
Miss Edmunds.

410
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:56,128
Send her in.

411
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,124
If you'd like to go in now.

412
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,911
Please sit down.

413
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,693
I've been reading about
your many achievements.

414
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,440
Oh, I see you were born in '92.

415
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:09,108
I know I might seem too young to be
an editor, but I do have experience.

416
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,508
I was just going to say
we're born in the same year.

417
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,636
Er, have you seen a copy
of our latest edition?

418
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,536
I produced it, actually.

419
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:21,329
Our editor had left, so it was down
to me and the rest of the office,

420
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:24,228
and during one horror-filled
night, we did it.

421
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,891
But then are you sure you need me?

422
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:29,808
Oh, I am. But I have at least proved
you're old enough to be an editor.

423
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,638
Because I was.

424
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:34,340
1892 seems a million years ago now.

425
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:36,916
Another time, another age.

426
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,736
That might be worth exploring.

427
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,187
Victorian babies grown into modern women.

428
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,391
And the price they've paid.

429
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,761
Oh. Thank you, Audrey.

430
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,667
Mmm, this is something like it.

431
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:52,297
I think you'll do well here.

432
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,658
So do I.

433
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,692
And you know what I wish?
That our Daisy would live here.

434
00:20:56,744 --> 00:21:00,237
You can still work at the big
house, but make a home with me.

435
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,889
- I don't know.
- What is it?

436
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,759
A 20-minute walk? What's that?

437
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,131
I'll have to think about it.

438
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:08,415
I wouldn't have to think long.
This place is like heaven to me.

439
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,625
You never set foot off a
pavement for 18 years,

440
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,234
and now it's all harvests and pig farming.

441
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:16,770
Well, not everyone's right
for what they're born to.

442
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:20,397
Very true. These are the books I spoke of.

443
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,922
You'll learn most from the work, I know,

444
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:25,208
but, er, they'll give you a grounding.

445
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,954
- If you're serious.
- I am.

446
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:31,495
Now, what else can I give you?
Another cup of tea, why not?

447
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,387
Don't mind if I do.

448
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:41,015
I'm afraid Mummy, and Daddy,
and Aunt Edith are all away,

449
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:43,582
so you must make do with Granny and Donk.

450
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,919
Is Granny Violet a Red Indian?

451
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,571
Why on earth do you say that?

452
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:50,408
Nanny said she was on the war path.

453
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:55,688
Come and look at these
books I've put out for you.

454
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:59,388
These are some of the places
Donk and I have visited.

455
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:05,332
Chamberlain's office rang to confirm
that he is dining here on Friday.

456
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:06,984
I wish he weren't.

457
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,771
But you'll line up the opposition?

458
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:10,476
Certainly. I already have.

459
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,180
What a nuisance it is.

460
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:13,635
Mama is not a good loser.

461
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:15,423
She's had so little experience.

462
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:18,966
You couldn't just back off and
let the cards fall as they may.

463
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:22,666
Robert, for 30 years, I've striven
to let your mother have her own way

464
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,360
but this is too important.

465
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:26,396
I appreciate that her
motives are honourable,

466
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:29,733
but that's not enough when
she's damaging people's lives.

467
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:31,343
Oh.

468
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:33,961
We can cancel, if I'm
allowed to say you're ill.

469
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:36,372
I'm not ill enough, and
she'd only rearrange it.

470
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:38,867
She can obviously get Chamberlain
to do whatever she wants,

471
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,654
though heaven knows why.

472
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:41,984
What's this?

473
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,354
That's the Sphinx, darling. In Egypt.

474
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,941
- What?
- The Sphinx.

475
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:50,225
A creature of secrets
that she never reveals.

476
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:52,469
Rather like Granny Violet.

477
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:57,998
What time will you get there, on Friday?

478
00:22:58,081 --> 00:23:00,409
Well, not much before eight.

479
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:04,982
I want to be in possession of the room
by the time Mr Chamberlain arrives.

480
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:08,265
Oh, dear!

481
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,710
Bad news?

482
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:10,957
Oh, dear...

483
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,994
I wouldn't have brought it if I'd known.

484
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:16,112
Er, Spratt, would you ask
Denker to come up here please?

485
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:17,972
Of course, m'lady.

486
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:19,686
You're quite agitated.

487
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:21,473
Denker has disgraced herself.

488
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,179
Well, how distressing for you.

489
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,890
It's not that so much.

490
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:28,706
It means I shall have to find a new maid.

491
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:31,045
Yes, I see. A real punishment.

492
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:33,363
M'lady?

493
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:35,773
Is it true you called
Doctor Clarkson a traitor?

494
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:39,026
What? Surely not? Denker?

495
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:43,224
I just thought he'd behaved
very badly towards your ladyship.

496
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:46,550
It is not your place even to
have opinions of my acquaintance.

497
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,285
Let alone express them.

498
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:52,868
He can't claim your friendship now?
Not when he's turned against you!

499
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:57,149
If I withdrew my friendship from
everyone who had spoken ill of me,

500
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,009
my address book would be empty.

501
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:00,173
Yes, but surely...

502
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:04,590
For a lady's maid to insult a
physician in the open street!

503
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:08,124
You've read too many novels, Denker.
You've seen too many moving pictures.

504
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,067
I was sticking up for you.

505
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,101
And for that, I will
write a tepid character,

506
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,845
which may enable you to
find employment elsewhere.

507
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:18,214
But from this house,
you must go, forthwith.

508
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:19,336
But m'lady...

509
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:22,038
You may stay tonight, but
you must go tomorrow.

510
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,275
Go!

511
00:24:25,707 --> 00:24:30,155
Are you sure? I can't believe Doctor
Clarkson could wish her to lose her position.

512
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:32,389
Then he shouldn't have sent it.

513
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:36,473
When we unleash the dogs of war,
we must go where they take us.

514
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:48,621
Sorry about that. There
was rather a queue.

515
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:50,035
It's popular. That's a good sign.

516
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:51,531
Oh, you don't know the place?

517
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,399
You'll laugh at me, but I've
hardly ever been in a public house.

518
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,818
Matthew wasn't really a pub man and
Papa goes into the Grantham Arms

519
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:00,177
about once a year to have
a drink with the tenants.

520
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:03,295
Well, I'm afraid my life is
an altogether rougher affair.

521
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:05,155
Consider me warned.

522
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,324
So the car's a success?

523
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,943
Well, I wasn't convinced
it would be, but it is.

524
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:12,315
You must have a go sometime.

525
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:13,479
I hope that's a real offer.

526
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:15,849
You know, I didn't realise
you were so keen, Tom. Blast!

527
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,220
You could have driven her today.

528
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:19,007
You know I came to Downton as a chauffeur?

529
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,172
Oh, Mary told me.

530
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:22,957
But then, not every chauffeur
has a real love of cars.

531
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:24,203
That's true enough.

532
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:25,991
Oh, I'll tell you who was
talking about you the other day.

533
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:27,238
Evelyn Napier.

534
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,316
- Oh, how is he?
- He's well.

535
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:33,027
Still single, of course, and, I
suspect, still pining for you.

536
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,227
He will pine in vain, but
I'm very fond of him.

537
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,336
La Belle Dame sans Merci.

538
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:40,040
What does that mean?

539
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:42,919
It means Lady Mary knows what she's about.

540
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,451
Tell you what, next time you're down
south, why don't we all have dinner?

541
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:49,103
I'd love that.

542
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:51,638
- You are funny.
- What do you mean?

543
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,966
The way you have to keep making
reasons for why you'll meet.

544
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:56,793
You to watch him drive cars, you
to have dinner with a friend.

545
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:59,962
Why can't you just say, "I'd
love to spend more time with you,

546
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:01,240
"when can we do it?"

547
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,984
You see? He may have
assimilated in some ways,

548
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:06,811
but he still fights playing by the rules.

549
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,213
What are those?

550
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:19,582
Oh! I didn't hear you come in.

551
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,111
Mr Mason's lent me some books on
pig-rearing and farming, generally.

552
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:26,556
I'm going to help with the pigs.

553
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:28,478
Oh, I see.

554
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:30,670
Which will you start with?

555
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,458
The red one, I think.

556
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,796
The "red one." Who's it by?

557
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:42,403
FJ Connell.

558
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:43,931
Does that mean anything to you?

559
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,438
Not a lot.

560
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,061
This must be the most sophisticated
room I've ever been in.

561
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:00,807
The taste is all Michael's.

562
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:03,426
He was very artistic and very clever.

563
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,005
So, are you going to live here?

564
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,001
I think I'll live here more.

565
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:09,630
I'd like a life away from Downton.

566
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:11,491
Because you like London?

567
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,994
Well, the house, the estate,

568
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:17,611
they're all Mary's now,
more than Papa realises.

569
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:21,102
It's time for me to strike
out in my own direction,

570
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:24,179
not just dawdle in Mary's wake.

571
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:26,538
When do you go home this time?

572
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,292
Tomorrow. My work is done here.

573
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,191
I've found my new editor and
we've got a government minister

574
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:35,059
coming for dinner on Friday,
so we're all on parade.

575
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,763
That's very swanky.

576
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:38,884
- Is your father political?
- Not at all.

577
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:40,588
It's my grandmother who's invited him.

578
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,794
How impressive!

579
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:43,591
She is rather.

580
00:27:43,674 --> 00:27:45,202
Shall we go?

581
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:51,156
I love the Cafe de Paris.

582
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,684
How did you know to choose it?

583
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:55,168
I knew we'd love the same things.

584
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:09,945
God, what a relief.

585
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:12,180
I thought I might be pushing my luck.

586
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,559
Oh, no.

587
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,918
I suppose you've guessed
how much I like you.

588
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,332
You don't know me.

589
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:22,000
I know you enough to think about
you all the time when we're apart.

590
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,891
That's very sweet.

591
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:27,362
Of course, I haven't much to offer.

592
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:29,773
You have a great deal to offer

593
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:33,015
and I am not sure I'm worthy of it,

594
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:37,588
but for now let's just enjoy a good dinner

595
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:39,199
and some dancing.

596
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,059
No arguments here.

597
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:49,892
- So it was a good day?
- Oh, yes.

598
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:53,041
A happy ending to a trying
time for the poor man.

599
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:54,786
Daisy fought well in his cause.

600
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:56,782
If not always very sensibly.

601
00:28:56,834 --> 00:29:00,201
He's a lovely chap, though,
kind and considerate.

602
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:03,349
Oh, he wants Daisy to live there,
but I suppose that's understandable.

603
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:04,472
He must be lonely.

604
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:07,091
He's not lonely. He's
lived on his own for years.

605
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:09,835
- He's used to it.
- He enjoyed a bit of company today.

606
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:11,331
He was just being polite.

607
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:14,043
I expect he was longing for us to go.

608
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:21,640
You mustn't mind when Mr Mason
makes new friends, Daisy,

609
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,468
now that he's here among us.

610
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,882
Of course I don't mind.

611
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:26,752
I just think he's fine as he is.

612
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:29,454
I'm ready to walk up to
the cottage if you are.

613
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,405
- Of course. - Ah, Mrs
Patmore, I haven't thanked you

614
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:33,611
for our supper the other night.

615
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:34,858
I'm always happy to help.

616
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,105
I'm very grateful.

617
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:40,314
But another time, I wonder if you might go
through the cooking of it with Mrs Hughes.

618
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:43,006
- Oh, yes? - It's been a
while since she's played

619
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:46,674
with her patty pans, and she's
got some catching-up to do.

620
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:48,493
You'd be glad of the help, wouldn't you?

621
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:51,538
Very glad and very grateful.

622
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:54,261
And now I must fetch my coat.

623
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:00,755
I'm sorry, Miss Denker.

624
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:03,499
I simply don't see I have a role to play.

625
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,948
So you're just going to sit
there and let me be dismissed?

626
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,611
How did it happen?

627
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:11,781
- Were you drunk?
- No, I was not drunk!

628
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:13,350
I was shocked!

629
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:17,393
Shocked at the short memory of a
doctor who's failed his patroness!

630
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,502
I doubt he sees it in that light.

631
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,630
That's the way I saw it
and I acted accordingly.

632
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:25,779
Am I to blame if I have
a very passionate nature?

633
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,273
Any more of that talk and
I won't be able to sleep.

634
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:32,980
You won't sleep a wink if I am
still sacked when we go upstairs.

635
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,475
That's a risk I'll have to take.

636
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:46,823
♪ Crying cockles and
mussels Alive, alive, oh ♪

637
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:50,855
I'm dreading this dinner on Friday.

638
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:52,923
So are we all, but we
have to get through it.

639
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:58,462
I'm afraid Mama seems to see this argument as
the last battle, the last big fight of her life.

640
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:01,704
If she loses, there'll be hell to pay.

641
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:04,198
Then there'll be hell to pay.

642
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,765
Added to which, I'm feeling pretty rough.

643
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:10,018
I'm sure it's only indigestion,
but whether it is or not,

644
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,294
I'll be glad of a chance
to put my feet up.

645
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:15,162
It's too late to cancel, but I'd be
happy to manage the evening without you,

646
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:16,284
if you're really ill.

647
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:18,570
Mama would only say I'd ratted on her.

648
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:20,441
No. As you say, I'll get through it

649
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:23,402
and then take things
quietly for a few days.

650
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,610
How did that happen?

651
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,731
I threw a book and it caught it.

652
00:31:38,783 --> 00:31:41,900
Oh, yes. The red one.
Why did you throw it?

653
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:50,650
Why did you throw the book, Andy?

654
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:58,112
- You can't read, can you?
- No. I can't bloody read!

655
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:00,180
Go on! Have a good laugh about it!

656
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:01,593
I'm not laughing.

657
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:03,879
You've been good at hiding
it. I must say that.

658
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:06,000
Flicking through your magazines.

659
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:08,275
I only look at the pictures.

660
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,567
Why did you not learn at school?

661
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:15,362
I fooled around until it was too late.

662
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:18,563
I learned how to sign my name,
which was all I needed in service.

663
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,714
But now you want to be a farmer.

664
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:24,549
I could be a farm labourer,
but I want more than that.

665
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:27,199
And if I can't read, then
it won't be possible.

666
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:29,454
So another dream goes west.

667
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:31,824
It doesn't have to.

668
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:35,357
I'll teach you to read and
write, too, if you want.

669
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,308
I must be too stupid.

670
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:41,717
I've never picked it up so far, and
I would have if I had half a brain.

671
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,876
That's not true. You're a clever lad.

672
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,599
You will get the hang of it. Trust me.

673
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,901
- But what would the others say?
- We won't tell them.

674
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:54,967
We'll talk about it in
the morning, all right?

675
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:59,259
Mr Barrow.

676
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:02,833
I've not behaved well towards you.

677
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,691
And I'm sorry for it.

678
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,268
I've known worse.

679
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:11,427
Good night, Andy.

680
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,037
Oh! You're up early.

681
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:24,480
I suppose you have quite a day ahead.

682
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:26,350
- Are you packed?
- No.

683
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:27,805
I have not packed.

684
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,177
Shouldn't leave it too long.

685
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:32,253
You should take up her
breakfast and dress her,

686
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:35,921
to be sure of your reference,
and then, er, head off.

687
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:37,449
Is that all you've got to say?

688
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:41,699
Don't look at me. It's not my fault
and there is nothing I can do.

689
00:33:44,484 --> 00:33:46,729
Did they catch your nephew?

690
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:48,048
- What?
- Your nephew.

691
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:50,003
The one who was on the
run from the police.

692
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:51,998
The one you sheltered here.

693
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,710
Did they catch him?

694
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:57,163
I don't believe so. No.

695
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:01,444
I wonder if that was because
he was allowed to rest here.

696
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:03,543
I think, maybe, it was.

697
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:08,926
Septimus Spratt, if I am sacked,
I am taking you down with me.

698
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:12,293
And my sin is not a criminal offence.

699
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,201
What can I do?

700
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:18,393
I can't talk to her before she's dressed.

701
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:21,428
No. Well, while you're waiting, you
can think of what you're going to say.

702
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,701
Unless you want to find
yourself sewing mail bags.

703
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:28,661
I'm not promising anything. I mean,
suppose she doesn't listen to me?

704
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:32,827
You'd better hope she does, Mr Spratt.

705
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:36,070
You'd better hope she does.

706
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:41,131
I think she likes him, yes. But
I don't believe she's serious.

707
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:42,544
Why not?

708
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,789
Lady Mary has quite a
sense of her own importance

709
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,867
and I doubt he's enough for her.

710
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,289
Besides, what would he do here?

711
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:51,731
Hang about, testing his cars on the drive?

712
00:34:51,783 --> 00:34:53,145
He could always get a job.

713
00:34:53,197 --> 00:34:54,432
Doing what?

714
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:58,641
I'm not convinced there's a big
demand for racing drivers in Thirsk.

715
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:02,881
So, Lady Mary does not believe
that love conquers all?

716
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:05,531
We mustn't be hard on
her. She is what she is.

717
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:09,616
But I'd say she'll want someone who
brings just as much to the table.

718
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:10,977
Maybe I'm wrong.

719
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:13,513
I hope so. I'd like her to be happy.

720
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:17,430
I'm happy, and I want
everyone to be happy.

721
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:18,833
Are you really happy?

722
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,787
I'm happier than I have ever been.

723
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:24,663
Happy, impatient, excited.

724
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:26,316
Don't say too much.

725
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:27,812
It frightens me.

726
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,849
We've still got months.

727
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:31,262
Nothing will go wrong.

728
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:33,174
Bad harvest, bad harvest.

729
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:35,512
What does that mean?

730
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:39,919
In the old days, when the crop was good,
the farmers used to shout "Bad harvest!",

731
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:43,826
so the gods wouldn't grow jealous
of their luck and destroy them.

732
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,530
Bad harvest!

733
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,181
That ought to do it.

734
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,227
Let's hope so.

735
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,428
We'd better hurry or we'll
be late for breakfast.

736
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:57,034
- Well? - She wants
you. In the drawing room.

737
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:58,406
What did she say?

738
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,570
What did you say?

739
00:35:59,622 --> 00:36:03,487
I told her your crime was
an excess of loyalty,

740
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,563
that your devotion to
her had made you blind.

741
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:10,596
It was the smugness of the
doctor that got my goat.

742
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,414
That, I did not say.

743
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:15,292
No, no. The point is, did it work?

744
00:36:15,377 --> 00:36:19,700
I reminded her how hard it is to
find properly trained staff now.

745
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:21,060
Yeah. And did it work?

746
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:23,596
I asked her how long it
had taken to break you in.

747
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,467
We'll have less of that talk.

748
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,137
I just want to know, did it work?

749
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:31,920
She's going to give you one more chance.

750
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:34,071
Hallelujah!

751
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:36,648
But mind you, act surprised
when she tells you.

752
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,566
I will rival Saint Paul
in my astonishment.

753
00:36:40,774 --> 00:36:42,094
Right.

754
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:44,682
Well, you better get upstairs.

755
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:45,918
Oh, and Miss Denker,

756
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,958
I don't want to hear another
mention of my unfortunate nephew.

757
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,785
Oh, well, that rather depends.

758
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:55,978
- On what?
- On whether or not

759
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,253
I need to mention him again.

760
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,448
He's not arrived, then?

761
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,027
No, not yet.

762
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,153
But what we want to know is, by
what power you made him come here.

763
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:16,180
Well, power of personality.

764
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:17,843
I'm not sure it would've worked for me.

765
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:20,804
Works for me. Are you quite well?

766
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:24,005
I will be all right as long
as no one asks me how I am.

767
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:26,904
You heard your note nearly
proved fatal to poor Denker?

768
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:29,980
Well, I only intended that she
be ticked off, not beheaded.

769
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:34,813
I gather it was Spratt who saved her,
which is a surprise in any number of ways.

770
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:37,099
Mama, what are you doing?

771
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:41,588
Carson, Carson, can you change these
place cards in the dining room?

772
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:43,947
- I'm not sure her ladyship...
- Robert?

773
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:47,158
- Just do it.
- Yes, very well, m'lord.

774
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:49,018
You'll be in a very junior seat.

775
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,730
Il faut reculer pour mieux sauter.

776
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:53,050
I found my editor.

777
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:54,256
And had some fun, too, I hope.

778
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:57,674
I went dancing at the Cafe de Paris,
which felt very young and gay.

779
00:37:57,758 --> 00:38:00,242
And we saw Henry Talbot
try out a racing car.

780
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:02,029
So, now we're all members
of the Bright Young Things.

781
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,567
I don't know about "bright."

782
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,521
The Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain,

783
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:06,976
Minister for Health.

784
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:09,771
Lord Grantham. Lady Grantham.

785
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,928
Minister, how kind of you to find
time for us in your busy schedule.

786
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:15,622
We're very grateful.

787
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:18,075
I wouldn't have the courage
to refuse your mother-in-law.

788
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,789
There you are.

789
00:38:19,872 --> 00:38:21,743
How is dear Anne?

790
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:23,270
She sends her greetings.

791
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,816
Oh, how grown up you all are.

792
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:32,384
You know, I remember so well when
you and she were young and carefree,

793
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:34,992
looking for fun wherever
you could find it.

794
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:36,530
I know you do.

795
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:41,695
Yes, well, but I always say,
let the past stay in the past.

796
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,794
I always say that, too.

797
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:48,430
Have you met my cousin Mrs Crawley?

798
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:50,290
No, indeed. It's a great honour.

799
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:54,291
I gather you're here to discuss the
new plans for managing our health.

800
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,281
I know I'm here to discuss a topic
Lady Grantham is interested in.

801
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:01,211
Excuse me, would you
care for one of these?

802
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:04,298
Thank you.

803
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,376
I thought you needed rescuing.

804
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,078
Our own scrapes are bad enough without
being dragged into other people's.

805
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,575
How well you understand me.

806
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:12,404
I'm afraid you're in for
some rigorous debate.

807
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:14,191
I wish I weren't.

808
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,072
Shall we go in?

809
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:20,977
We don't want to wear the minister out
before he's even had a chance to sit down.

810
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:25,456
She can't protect him in the dining room.

811
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:29,042
You'll stop at nothing to get
your own way. Isn't that the truth?

812
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,621
Indeed.

813
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:37,105
It is a quality I share with Marlborough,
Wellington and my late mother.

814
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:40,681
I was trained in a hard school

815
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:43,300
and I fight accordingly.

816
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:47,540
No, he's a coming man. I've read
he may be prime minister one day.

817
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:49,441
Well, he's no friend of the unions.

818
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:51,394
For which he is to be congratulated.

819
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:53,598
Is the consomme ready, Mrs Patmore?

820
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,935
We should get out of your way.

821
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,822
You never said how the trial went.

822
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:01,495
I didn't have to testify in the end.

823
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:04,706
He looked at the list of
witnesses and changed his plea.

824
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:07,398
You must have a sense
of unfinished business.

825
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,352
That's clever of you.

826
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:13,352
I won't ask what it was, but I
hope you can leave it behind.

827
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,504
I'm not sure. But thank you.

828
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:18,756
Mr Molesley says the Dowager's
got the bit between her teeth.

829
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,157
Then I don't give much for
Mr Chamberlain's chances.

830
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:24,327
- Nor me. - But surely, if
it's important to the area,

831
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,187
he'll want to listen?

832
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,671
He'll just want to get out alive.

833
00:40:30,022 --> 00:40:33,087
The system has worked well
here for a hundred years!

834
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,296
Why must we destroy everything in our
path simply for the sake of change?

835
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:40,538
I'm not sure that's a true
representation of the case.

836
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:43,479
Exactly. There are many
benefits to be had from the plan.

837
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:45,017
But benefits for whom?

838
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:46,222
Goodness.

839
00:40:46,274 --> 00:40:49,558
I thought I was here to be
lectured by a united group,

840
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:51,377
not to witness a battle royal.

841
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:53,860
Oh! Don't you enjoy a good fight?

842
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:55,284
I'm not sure I do, really.

843
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:59,410
My mother-in-law has a certain myopia when
it comes to anyone else's point of view.

844
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:02,309
On the contrary, I have
a clarity of vision

845
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:06,393
that allows me to resist a
housemaid's trap of sentimentality.

846
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:08,794
Your enthusiasm is getting
the better of your manners.

847
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:10,665
Can't we stop this beastly row?

848
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:12,119
How I wish we could.

849
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:13,325
Because I...

850
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:14,832
I...

851
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:16,577
I'm so sorry...

852
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:24,922
Thomas, on his left side.

853
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:26,460
Give me napkins!

854
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:27,832
I'll call the ambulance.

855
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:29,495
- Keep him warm.
- Take my coat.

856
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,407
- What is it?
- His ulcer has burst.

857
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:32,861
- What?
- Will he be all right?

858
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:35,023
We must get him to hospital
as quickly as we can.

859
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,653
I'm here, darling, don't worry.

860
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:42,017
If this is it, just know I
have loved you very, very much.

861
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:44,834
This isn't it, darling.
Don't... We won't let this be it.

862
00:41:44,886 --> 00:41:47,171
- Some water?
- No! No water.

863
00:41:48,086 --> 00:41:51,204
Just keep him steady until
the ambulance arrives.

864
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:05,493
Is he very bad?

865
00:42:05,545 --> 00:42:07,655
I've rung for the ambulance.
It'll be here at any moment.

866
00:42:07,707 --> 00:42:10,783
Miss Baxter, Anna, fetch
their ladyships' coats.

867
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:13,099
- Don't forget Lady Edith.
- What about me, Mr Carson?

868
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:15,718
You might put together some
things that could be useful.

869
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,171
But hurry, there's no time to lose.

870
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:20,884
I can't believe it.

871
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:24,499
Life is short, death is sure.

872
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,454
That is all we know.

873
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:31,639
There is a man who's been
shaken to the roots of his soul.

874
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:35,225
Everything he based his life
on has proved mortal, after all.

875
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:37,916
We've no time for philosophy, Mrs Patmore.

876
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:39,496
What can we do to help?

877
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:41,698
Let's send up some coffee.

878
00:42:49,524 --> 00:42:52,340
Lady Grantham, I'm not sure
how much use I can be here.

879
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,044
Of course, you should go.

880
00:42:54,096 --> 00:42:55,582
I will consider the new plan.

881
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:58,129
Don't. That is, let it stand.

882
00:42:58,212 --> 00:43:01,319
I believe the change will work
well for both establishments.

883
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,732
Very well.

884
00:43:02,784 --> 00:43:04,976
- Lady Grantham.
- Give my love to dear Annie.

885
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:06,348
I will.

886
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:08,842
The ambulance is here!

887
00:43:09,476 --> 00:43:12,709
Don't reprimand me, Mama, I think
the new system will be better

888
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,870
and I haven't got time to be diplomatic.

889
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:17,613
Don't you think I have
enough things to worry about?

890
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:19,941
It's better we should be honest.
There've been too many secrets.

891
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:22,570
Let's have no more of them.

892
00:43:22,654 --> 00:43:26,270
If you mean Marigold, that's
settled and you know I am sorry.

893
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,421
Now let us concentrate on Robert?

894
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:31,247
They're ready. They want to take him now.

895
00:43:32,297 --> 00:43:34,791
Girls. Mary. Edith.

896
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:36,402
We must go!

897
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:43,977
Edith, dear, telephone with any news.

898
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,420
- No matter how late.
- I will.

899
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,535
I'll take you home in my
car. And Lady Grantham.

900
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,115
In a moment.

901
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:54,360
You're quite pale.

902
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:56,147
We'll go together.

903
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,726
You've had a shock.

904
00:43:57,778 --> 00:44:00,813
I think I've had a few
shocks this evening.

905
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:15,528
- They're bringing your car round.
- Oh, let the ambulance get away.

906
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:20,755
There's a dinner that delivered
more than you bargained for.

907
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:22,667
Are you going to follow them?

908
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:25,577
I don't want to crowd him, but
they'll ring when they have news.

909
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,322
Can you let my office know?

910
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:28,829
Of course.

911
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:31,979
If you'll do me a favour
and answer one question.

912
00:44:32,031 --> 00:44:34,098
Why did you come here tonight?

913
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,226
Your grandmother-in-law
can be very persuasive.

914
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:39,378
I'd love to know how she did it.

915
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:42,080
My wife has a brother
called Horace de Vere Cole.

916
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:44,990
- You may have heard of him.
- The prankster?

917
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:48,325
Didn't he board a warship pretending to
be the leader of a Turkish delegation?

918
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:50,102
Abyssinian, but yes.

919
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,596
He was always doing that sort of thing.

920
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:57,220
Some years ago, he and a few friends
dug a trench across Piccadilly

921
00:44:57,304 --> 00:44:59,943
and London was thrown into total chaos.

922
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:03,206
- But what --
- I was one of the chaps responsible.

923
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:05,233
We dressed as workmen
and no one stopped us.

924
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,851
And by the time we'd finished
every road was jammed

925
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:10,262
from the East End to Belgrave Square.

926
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:12,424
And old Lady Grantham
threatened to give you away?

927
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,554
It was long ago now,

928
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:18,254
but the papers would be sure to
make it look as bad as possible

929
00:45:18,337 --> 00:45:22,119
and a dinner seemed a price
worth paying to avert it.

930
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:24,489
And there's my car.

931
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:27,150
So, I'd better be off.

932
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:13,041
Thank you, m'lady.

933
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,183
That was Lady Mary.

934
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:27,465
His lordship's had his
operation and now he's resting.

935
00:46:27,548 --> 00:46:29,408
Her ladyship is staying overnight,

936
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,985
but Lady Mary and Lady
Edith will come home.

937
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:35,570
- What was the operation?
- They performed a gastrectomy.

938
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:37,181
What's that?

939
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:39,509
No business of ours.

940
00:46:39,561 --> 00:46:41,462
Will he be all right?

941
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:43,791
It sounds as if he has a good chance.

942
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,547
Thank God.

943
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,781
I'll find out if there's
anything he needs in the morning.

944
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:50,150
I'll walk down there now with
some things for her ladyship.

945
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:51,980
I'll come with you.

946
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:53,684
I'm quite relieved.

947
00:46:53,736 --> 00:46:54,806
Of course you are.

948
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:57,976
No, I didn't think I'd mind one
way or the other, to be honest.

949
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:01,342
I must be getting soft in my old age.

950
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:04,117
Well, don't let the other animals
find out, or they'll pounce.

951
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:06,788
Leave him alone. Now, we should go.

952
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:11,734
We can take it in turns tomorrow.
So Mama can have some rest.

953
00:47:11,817 --> 00:47:13,137
Very well.

954
00:47:13,189 --> 00:47:17,429
I'll go first. Stark can take
me there and bring Mama back.

955
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:19,373
What a terrifying reminder.

956
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:21,742
In one second your whole life can change.

957
00:47:21,794 --> 00:47:22,979
Yes.

958
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:26,741
It only takes a moment for
everything to feel quite different.

959
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:29,058
I'm going to check on the children.

960
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,919
Of course you are.

961
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:33,256
Good night.

962
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:35,917
How is he?

963
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:38,577
He'll be all right, but it's
knocked the stuffing out of him.

964
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:41,238
We'll have to make sure the load
is lightened when he comes home.

965
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,305
To be more precise, Tom,

966
00:47:43,368 --> 00:47:47,400
from now on you and I need to take
full responsibility for the estate.

967
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:50,050
We'll involve him in the
big decisions of course,

968
00:47:50,102 --> 00:47:52,336
but he mustn't have any more worry.

969
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:54,996
It's why he got the
ulcer in the first place.

970
00:47:55,048 --> 00:47:57,407
So long live our own Queen Mary.

971
00:47:58,165 --> 00:47:59,693
Good night.

972
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,041
Mr Carson told us his
lordship is going to recover.

973
00:48:11,093 --> 00:48:12,538
They seem to think so.

974
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,492
Everyone was very happy to hear it.

975
00:48:14,544 --> 00:48:16,404
Can I fetch you anything?

976
00:48:16,456 --> 00:48:18,867
I just want to go to bed.

977
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,151
- You must be absolutely
exhausted. - Hmm.

978
00:48:23,938 --> 00:48:27,014
Anna, can I ask you something?

979
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:30,714
Is there any talk in the servants'
hall about Miss Marigold?

980
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:34,070
What sort of talk, m'lady?

981
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:39,277
Well, everyone thinks she's a lucky
little girl, being taken in by the family.

982
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,510
But they would think that.

983
00:48:43,475 --> 00:48:45,834
And that's all you want to say?

984
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,045
Why? What else should I say?

985
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,916
Never mind.

986
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:53,784
I'm too tired to talk any more tonight.
