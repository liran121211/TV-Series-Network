1
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,609
You didn't quarrel, then?

2
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:48,728
No. My cousin was good to me.

3
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,555
But in the end it was another country

4
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:52,425
and I'd moved away one time too many.

5
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:54,959
And besides, I'd taken
Sybbie away from you.

6
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,662
What right had I to do that?

7
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,988
You had every right.
But it did seem a shame.

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,021
I wish we had a photograph of all
our faces when you walked in.

9
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:04,139
- I hope I didn't steal
their thunder. - Oh, no.

10
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:06,507
I think it gave it an added lift.

11
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:09,041
- How was Sybbie this morning?
- Tired.

12
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:10,993
But glad to be here.

13
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:13,319
What will you do, Mary,
now that Tom's home?

14
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:15,563
Exactly what I was doing. Why?

15
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:18,595
Well, surely he'll go
back to being the agent.

16
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:22,334
Can't we allow Tom a few days to
settle in before we start fighting?

17
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:25,491
You'll get no fight from me. I want
to do what's right for everyone.

18
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,274
Come down to the office later
and I'll bring you up to date.

19
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:29,645
Any word from Carson?

20
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:32,926
He rang to say they'd arrived
safely, m'lord, but that's all.

21
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:36,208
He could have managed something
a little better than Scarborough.

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,244
I offered, but that's what they wanted.

23
00:01:38,295 --> 00:01:41,401
- When do we expect Rosamund?
- Tomorrow, for dinner.

24
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,644
- Why's she coming?
- She says just to see us

25
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:46,967
but I'm sure she wants to get stuck
in with the row about the hospital.

26
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,792
At least she'll be reinforcements
for Cora and Isobel.

27
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:53,416
- Do you think she'll take their side?
- Against Granny? Every time.

28
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:58,349
Miss Baxter, Sergeant Willis rang
earlier. He wants to look in.

29
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,506
- What's this?
- The sergeant is coming in later.

30
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:04,123
- What for?
- To see Miss Baxter.

31
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,574
Oh, that's her Ladyship.

32
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,703
I must go.

33
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,959
What do the police want with Miss Baxter?

34
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,362
- Makes a nice change.
- Good to know we can joke about it.

35
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:23,481
Well, it's no joke to Miss Baxter.

36
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,932
- Who spoke to him?
- Sergeant Willis?

37
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:29,463
- Me, I did. - Next time
run it past me, Mrs Patmore,

38
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:32,537
before you issue an invitation.
I am the butler now.

39
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:34,904
For the next five minutes.

40
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,649
Until Mr Carson gets back.

41
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,851
And don't let's forget it.

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,631
When did this arrive?

43
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:45,580
Mr Spratt walked up with it
first thing this morning, m'lady.

44
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,156
Lady Grantham wants to
bring Lady Shackleton

45
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,690
- when she comes for dinner tomorrow.
- That's nice.

46
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:54,760
Is it? It's only so dear Mama has
an ally when we start fighting.

47
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:58,053
She thinks Lady Rosamund and
Mrs Crawley are on my side.

48
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:04,356
Hey-ho. I'll telephone when I go down.

49
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:07,721
Now we're out of Edith's
earshot, what do you really want?

50
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,006
To be joint agents? I wouldn't mind.

51
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:12,415
Maybe. But if I am to
live out my life here,

52
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:15,531
I need to find something to do
that isn't just about the estate.

53
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:18,148
- How enterprising.
- I've changed since I've been away.

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,523
I'm still not a traditionalist. The
King should not rely on my support.

55
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:23,091
Which wouldn't surprise Papa.

56
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,293
But I don't feel the
same about capitalism.

57
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,037
Not American capitalism, anyway.

58
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,239
Where a hardworking man
can go right to the top

59
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,984
all the way in a single lifetime.

60
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,061
- Which still isn't true here.
- Not yet.

61
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,591
But I have a sense it's going to change
and in the not-too-distant future.

62
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:39,956
- I hope that doesn't worry you.
- Tom, you're my brother.

63
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:42,490
I want what you want. In
your work, in your life.

64
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,899
No more Miss Buntings
if you have any pity.

65
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:48,846
But even in that, don't
please us. Please yourself.

66
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:52,044
What about you? Have you regretted
dismissing your suitors?

67
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:54,173
No.

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,566
Come in here. Mr Carson won't mind.

69
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,695
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

70
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:04,631
- Good morning, Miss Baxter.
- Is this about the Bates?

71
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:07,747
No, no, no. It's not about the Bates.

72
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,533
They're off the hook.

73
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:13,354
Then what's Miss Baxter done
if it's not to do with them?

74
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,971
Would you rather I questioned
you alone, Miss Baxter?

75
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,090
Mrs Hughes wouldn't like it.

76
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:21,247
I've asked Mr Molesley to be with
me if I'm allowed. He's outside.

77
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,944
Oh. Well, of course. If I'm not wanted...

78
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,063
- It's not --
- I understand.

79
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:29,192
I understand.

80
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:33,470
Go on.

81
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,068
I won't beat about the bush, Miss Baxter.

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,477
You'll know who I mean by Mr Peter Coyle.

83
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,803
Yes, I do.

84
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:50,118
He's currently on bail for theft.
That doesn't seem to surprise you.

85
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,524
- Correct. - He's accused
alongside a young woman

86
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,936
who worked in the same house,

87
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:58,010
and I'm afraid that most of the
evidence will count against her.

88
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,378
Again, you do not surprise me.

89
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,496
Well, this is it.

90
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,906
He's pleading innocence
but our records show

91
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,817
that while he's never been convicted,

92
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,143
he's been close to several
crimes in the past.

93
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:13,962
Always carried out by women and
he's escaped prosecution every time.

94
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,371
We know he worked in the same house as you

95
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:20,317
and that he left on the day that you
stole the jewels from your mistress.

96
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:23,350
- That's true.
- And those jewels were never found

97
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:25,385
and you've kept silent.

98
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:28,542
But we believe he profited from the theft.

99
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:34,036
We want you to testify to that
effect as a character witness.

100
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,719
We're only trying to protect
vulnerable young women

101
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,848
from him in the future.

102
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,037
He's ruined several lives.

103
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:51,140
I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.
Please consider my request.

104
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,632
Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.

105
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:56,748
Then I'll er, take the
liberty of calling again.

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,877
Goodbye.

107
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:09,719
I dare say this... Mr
Coyle was a handsome devil.

108
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:13,499
He was a devil all right.

109
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:18,982
I know it's not my decision,
but I think you should do it.

110
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,222
You don't know what you're asking.

111
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:25,701
"All that's needed for evil to triumph

112
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:28,038
is that good men do nothing."

113
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,956
You won't believe this, except you will.

114
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:41,570
Lady Shackleton would love to
come, but can she bring her nephew?

115
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:43,107
What?

116
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,011
He's in Yorkshire for some reason
and he's only staying one night.

117
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:51,082
- What did you say?
- I didn't want to put Mama's back up.

118
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,284
Things are bad enough without that.

119
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:55,403
Mama is an old intriguer.

120
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:58,601
She will use tears or
terror with equal facility.

121
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,720
Who is this man?

122
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:03,129
I don't know. Her sister's son.

123
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,951
Mrs Cobb is going to live
with her daughter in Oswaldkirk

124
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:10,274
- so Mary's going to give the cottage
to the Carsons. - Excellent news.

125
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:13,057
Can we discuss Yew Tree Farm?

126
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:15,882
- What about it? - I don't see
why we can't get a new tenant

127
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:18,167
- when the Drewes are gone.
- No, Mary's right.

128
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,244
It makes more sense for
us to take it over.

129
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:23,276
- We could let the house, of course.
- But we will have some tenants.

130
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:26,101
Which reminds me, I want to
see Fairclough's new planting.

131
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,268
- Tom, do you fancy a walk?
- Let me make a call and then I'll be with you.

132
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,409
You're happy he's back, aren't you?

133
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:37,109
I really am. Funny, isn't it?

134
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:41,221
- What are the new maids like?
- Nice. Hard-working.

135
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,841
But they don't live in.

136
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:46,123
And they go home before we have our
tea so we don't really know them.

137
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,992
Not in the old way.

138
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:50,485
Miss Baxter and I turn the
beds down in the evenings.

139
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,146
I hope you're not working too hard.

140
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:55,345
I feel quite well, m'lady.
Though I'm thickening up.

141
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:57,962
I saw Mr Bates eyeing me the other day.

142
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:00,081
He'll think I ate all the pies.

143
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,781
- So you still haven't told him?
- When I know it'll be fine,

144
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,325
he can celebrate without worrying.

145
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:09,261
Ah, we were just talking about you.

146
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:10,590
Good things I hope, m'lady.

147
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,373
I wanted Molesley and Andrews
to take the cases down.

148
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,492
- They've both gone
into the village. - Both?

149
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:18,524
- Carson wouldn't allow that.
- When the cat's away, m'lady.

150
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,643
Can you manage?

151
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:22,014
Anna and I can take one each.

152
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,506
No, they're too heavy for Anna to lift.

153
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:26,999
Then I'll make a double journey.

154
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:30,540
Rather a bore for you. The car's
waiting in the stableyard.

155
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,390
It was sweet of them
to let me bring Henry.

156
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:39,004
Though why couldn't he stay
behind with a tray on his lap?

157
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,621
Don't be unkind. I never see him.

158
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:45,401
He's only up here now to look
at some horrid racing car.

159
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:48,350
- Does he get on with Philip?
- They were friends as boys.

160
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,718
I'm afraid she doesn't
like my daughter-in-law.

161
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,003
- Oh, dear.
- Who does?

162
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:56,575
Now, you understand the job on hand?

163
00:08:56,627 --> 00:09:01,020
We're to persuade Lady Grantham to
oppose all change at the hospital.

164
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,349
No, no, not quite.

165
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,254
To oppose change that
takes control away from us.

166
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:08,165
It would be so bad for the village.

167
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:12,194
Forgive me, but why, if it means
more modern and varied treatment?

168
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:15,393
How could the interests of
the village be protected

169
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:17,678
if every decision is made in York?

170
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,796
I see that, my dear --

171
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:22,621
Are you... are you here
to help or irritate?

172
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:26,079
- To help, of course.
- Then there's no more to be said.

173
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:45,281
I'd like some volunteers to clean
Mrs Cobb's cottage for the Carsons.

174
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,898
His Lordship wants it
done before they get back.

175
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,557
I don't mind. I could go up
with the maids in the morning.

176
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:52,800
It's a shame they can't
live in their own home.

177
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:54,171
The builders are still in it.

178
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,455
And they can't get there
and back without a car

179
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:58,657
which is a bit revolutionary
for Mr Carson.

180
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,952
"The Carsons."

181
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:04,348
Are we gonna have to
call her "Mrs Carson"?

182
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,294
I wish I knew how long Mr Mason's
got to wait for his farmhouse.

183
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,953
Is this Yew Tree Farm
you're talking about?

184
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,864
Mr Mason's taking over the lease.

185
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,896
I don't believe so. They're going
to farm the land themselves.

186
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,305
They may let the house, but that's it.

187
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:21,836
- What are you talking about?
- I heard them discussing it yesterday

188
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,955
- at breakfast.
- Don't say it.

189
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,406
They couldn't turn around
like that, could they?

190
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,895
- But they've not said they'll do it.
- They implied it.

191
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:31,557
She implied it.

192
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,631
I might go to Mrs Cobb's
cottage when they're changing.

193
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:37,113
- I'll come with you.
- No need.

194
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,443
I expect he's got
something to think through.

195
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:45,130
Keep your pity, Mr Molesley.
You need it more than I do.

196
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:54,653
You don't have to tell me
your mother's in the right.

197
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:56,107
We can't have a public quarrel

198
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,516
or they'll both be asked
to resign from the board

199
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:01,466
- and even I don't want that.
- Which means I'm not to make Granny

200
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:03,418
any angrier than she is already.

201
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,703
So how are you? What's the news?

202
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:08,569
I do have some as a matter of fact.

203
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:12,931
Have you heard of a place called
Hillcroft? It's in Turperton.

204
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:14,800
- What sort of place?
- A college.

205
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:20,159
For women from modest backgrounds.
But clever women with potential.

206
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:23,274
- I'm a trustee.
- How interesting.

207
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:24,604
I knew you'd think so.

208
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:28,051
So I'm going to suggest
you as a trustee, too.

209
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:31,084
Oddly enough, our treasurer lives up here.

210
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:32,912
It's one of the reasons I've come,

211
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:36,027
so I can meet him while I'm at
Downton. We'll ask him over.

212
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,855
What's his name?

213
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:41,095
John Harding. I like the sound of him.

214
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:44,501
Self-made, clever, successful.

215
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:46,963
And nearer your age than mine.

216
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:02,197
Might I have a word, m'lady?

217
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,984
You'll have to be quick, I'm late.

218
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:05,147
It's about Miss Baxter.

219
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,265
I hope this isn't gossip.

220
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,602
I don't believe it is, m'lady.

221
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,493
You couldn't be harder on those potatoes

222
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:16,570
if you wanted them to confess to spying.

223
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:18,481
I feel so let down.

224
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:22,137
They've got Mr Mason's hopes up,
let him think he had a future

225
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:23,923
- and now what?
- To be honest, Daisy,

226
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,709
wasn't it you that put his hopes up?

227
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,077
Only because I was sure
that's what she intended.

228
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:30,777
- She's led me on.
- Maybe it just wasn't possible.

229
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:33,436
Not possible? Don't
give me 'not possible'.

230
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:37,226
All right, Madame Defarge,
calm down and finish that mash.

231
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,571
The Dowager Lady Shackleton
and Mr Henry Talbot.

232
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:46,770
- Ah.
- Golly.

233
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:48,722
Nobody told me the nephew was you.

234
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,799
Oh, is that what I am? "The nephew".

235
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:53,043
You never said your
aunt was Lady Shackleton.

236
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:54,912
Did you know she was bringing you here?

237
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:57,030
One must be allowed some secrets.

238
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,900
Of course we'll invite Mr Harding.

239
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,894
He has a wife. We must ask her, too.

240
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,508
It's marvellous for ordinary women
to aim at rich and fulfilling careers.

241
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,163
They talk about making a difference
but this could actually change lives.

242
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:11,154
- Why are you in Yorkshire?
- Mainly looking at a car

243
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,062
- I might be racing at Brooklands.
- So you really are a car man?

244
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,180
I wasn't sure how much you meant it.

245
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:18,216
Oh, I really am a car man.

246
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,082
That's not a claim you often
hear in this neck of the woods.

247
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,447
- Did you say you race at Brooklands?
- Yes, I've driven there quite a lot.

248
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,565
I don't envy much, but I envy that.

249
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:28,933
What sort of Talbot is he?

250
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:31,716
Shrewsbury. But he's
nowhere near the earldom.

251
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:35,123
About 40 strong men
would have to drop dead.

252
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:37,864
Well, nothing is impossible.

253
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,437
Without it, what are his prospects?

254
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,555
Adequate, but not overwhelming.

255
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,840
Honestly, listen to yourselves.

256
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,959
Lady Shackleton is quite right.

257
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:53,442
Mary needs more than a handsome
smile and a hand on the gear stick.

258
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:55,685
I'm surprised you know
what a gear stick is.

259
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:58,063
I know more than you think.

260
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:03,079
It's very kind of you to let me and
Henry push into a family party.

261
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:05,946
In return, please don't let
Mama pull you into the fight.

262
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:09,809
Really, Robert? You paint
me as such a schemer.

263
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,969
No-one has sharper eyes than a loving son.

264
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,838
You read that somewhere.

265
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,943
Why do you never think
I can make anything up?

266
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,012
Didn't you trust your own
powers of persuasion?

267
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,668
- What? - Don't pretend. Who else
would her Ladyship have heard it from?

268
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,420
I think you'll regret being silent.

269
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,276
Come along, Mr Molesley.

270
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:37,485
Just because Mr Carson's away...

271
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,712
You look very preoccupied.

272
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,787
Anna?

273
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,058
- Can I help?
- I'm fine.

274
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:55,056
Just carry on, as they say in the navy.

275
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,031
The treatments available to the village

276
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,603
would be vastly superior to
anything we can lay claim to now.

277
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:05,971
You are making a grave mistake

278
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:08,879
and impoverishing the village by doing so.

279
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,008
Prudence, tell them.

280
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,315
I expect there's a good deal
to be said on both sides.

281
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,890
Don't be so feeble!

282
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:22,255
How can I present myself as an
expert when I don't know the facts?

283
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:24,373
It's never stopped me!

284
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:28,070
- She's still on cracking form.
- If she were 20 years younger,

285
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,189
you'd just call her a tyrant.

286
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:33,388
Have you thought more about what
you're going to do now you're back?

287
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:36,918
Before dinner, Mr Talbot was
saying he works with cars.

288
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,120
I wonder if that mightn't be right for me.

289
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,488
- Not as a racing car driver?
- Maybe not.

290
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,143
- But in that world.
- Which is a long way from Downton.

291
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,633
Your attitude is hardly conducive
to a peaceful settlement.

292
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:51,499
I won't explain, since every
village argument is the same.

293
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,241
Really? I'm not a village boy.

294
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,733
My father was in Parliament
so we lived in London.

295
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,893
Except for the summer
and then we'd shelter

296
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:02,175
- with various hunting, shooting
and fishing relations. - That's us.

297
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:06,796
- Yes, but it's not all you are.
- So do you make a living out of cars?

298
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,397
Yes, I suppose I do,
yes. I race on a team.

299
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:14,222
- Does that seem very odd?
- Quite odd.

300
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:17,669
- Although people do such
odd things nowadays. - Mm.

301
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,574
I once met a man who spent his time
importing guinea pigs from Peru.

302
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,440
Don't hide behind Lady Shackleton, Mama.

303
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:26,891
You're quite capable of
landing your own punches.

304
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:31,378
The question is which system is more
likely to deliver modern treatment

305
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,116
- to the local population?
- That is not the point.

306
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,484
I should have thought
that was exactly the point.

307
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:39,395
You've muddled your priorities!

308
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,303
I suppose cousin Isobel is
entitled to put up an argument.

309
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:45,678
Of course she is, she's
just not entitled to win it.

310
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,845
I'm afraid I've been rather a
disappointment to your mother.

311
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:58,171
Not to me. You could have
made things even worse.

312
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:01,951
So, do you ever make it up to London?

313
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,984
- Sometimes.
- Would you think it terribly common

314
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,684
- if I gave you my card?
- Fairly common.

315
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,802
But I'll take it anyway.

316
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:13,582
Telephone me. We'll have lunch or a drink.

317
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,711
Or something.

318
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:21,641
Do you know, I couldn't
be less interested in cars

319
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:23,760
if I took a pill to achieve it.

320
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:27,446
Well, that's because you
haven't been taught about them.

321
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,282
Properly.

322
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,812
The main thing I want to avoid is
Granny being kicked off the board

323
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:36,637
- of the new arrangement.
- We'll all be kicked off

324
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,085
- with the fuss we're making.
- Supporting her wrong thinking won't help.

325
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,370
Can I put in a word for
trying to remain friends?

326
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:45,070
Tom the peacemaker is back.

327
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:47,604
That's really the purpose of it --

328
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:50,885
Aunt Prudence. We're
outstaying our welcome.

329
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,586
- Indeed. Goodnight, Robert.
- Goodnight.

330
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,829
- Goodnight, Mary.
- Goodnight. Mr Talbot.

331
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:57,958
Lady Mary.

332
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,754
Not that pain again?

333
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:09,028
I can't drink port any more.

334
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,995
Oh, darling...

335
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:19,849
I don't think I've ever felt
such a lack... of reason.

336
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:23,214
What do you mean, reason?

337
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,485
Why am I here? What am I doing?

338
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,614
What are we all doing?

339
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,052
Trying to get through life as best we can.

340
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:35,790
Yes, but you, you make friends.

341
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:39,114
People like you. Her Ladyship likes you.

342
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,229
Mr Molesley more than likes you.

343
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:44,348
Don't be silly.

344
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,684
It's true. I'm quite envious.

345
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:50,994
Not of Mr Molesley, but the rest of it.

346
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:55,190
And I envy you. You don't
care what people say.

347
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:59,313
While I tremble at the mere
idea of public ridicule.

348
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,542
I should be used to it by now, but...

349
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:05,751
You are stronger than you think.

350
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:09,936
And you're wrong about me.

351
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:15,472
I mind what people say.

352
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:28,671
It's no use talking as if you can
force me. We both know you can't.

353
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,496
We can make you attend the trial.

354
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:35,068
Come on. Sergeant Willis is not the enemy.

355
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,931
Mr Coyle is the enemy
and here's your chance.

356
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:43,335
Chance for what? Revenge?
Much good that will do.

357
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:47,447
Not for revenge. To stop other girls
being tricked into a life of crime.

358
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:50,397
Two of the women he
used are prostitutes now.

359
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:54,062
At least one is dead. Do
you want him to go on?

360
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,840
If I say yes, what happens next?

361
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:03,731
We send a list of witnesses
to the prosecution.

362
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:07,345
It's not a Penny Dreadful
with confessions from the box.

363
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:10,585
They see who will testify on our side.

364
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:13,836
If he won't change his plea,
he'll go to the trial.

365
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:19,568
- Very well.
- Thank you, Miss Baxter.

366
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:22,663
I'll keep you informed at every step.

367
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,946
What changed your mind?

368
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:31,314
The thought of the girls he ruined.

369
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,432
Like he ruined me.

370
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:36,880
Oh, but he hasn't ruined you, has he?

371
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,746
And the proof is you're standing here.

372
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:41,875
Maybe.

373
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:45,655
But he changed me.

374
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:10,154
I've just seen the Hardings' car.
We'll be in the drawing room.

375
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:12,283
Certainly, m'lady.

376
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:18,088
- Hello.
- I believe we're expected.

377
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,466
Of course, Mr and Mrs Harding.

378
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:31,547
Would you like to leave your coats?

379
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,538
- Gwen?
- Anna?

380
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,656
It is you, isn't it?

381
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,066
Why didn't you telephone
and say you were coming?

382
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:42,140
I didn't know we were until
this morning or I would have.

383
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:45,463
He said we were visiting
somebody called Painswick.

384
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:48,744
Lady Rosamund Painswick.
His Lordship's sister.

385
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:50,873
I'd forgotten that.

386
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:54,010
I'll see you later if I can.

387
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:58,963
She hasn't got time to greet
her old friends, then.

388
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:01,840
When were you a friend of Gwen's?

389
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:10,927
We're so pleased to see you. I
want to hear all about Hillcroft.

390
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:12,755
Why did you first get involved?

391
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:15,787
Naturally I'd be happy to take
as much of the credit as possible,

392
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,823
but it was really Mrs Harding's idea.

393
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:20,356
What was it that drew you
to the work they were doing?

394
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,475
Forgive me, but have we met?

395
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:25,507
Er, I don't think we've met exactly.

396
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,626
Tell us more about Hillcroft.

397
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:31,489
You see, I never had any
higher education and so --

398
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,896
Who did? All we were taught was
French prejudice and dance steps.

399
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:39,963
- Who's Gwen? - She was
housemaid here before the war.

400
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:41,791
She got away to be a secretary.

401
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:45,114
Now she's having lunch upstairs
while we're still stuck down here.

402
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,981
- What does his Lordship think?
- They won't recognise her.

403
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,764
- They don't look us in the face enough.
- I wonder if Karl Marx

404
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:54,295
- might finish the liver pate (?)
- I don't think his Lordship will mind.

405
00:22:54,347 --> 00:22:56,787
He's not uncomfortable
about that sort of thing.

406
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,113
It won't bother him that
she used to work here.

407
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:01,938
Well, his daughter ran off with
a chauffeur in the interim.

408
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,591
And Mrs Harding was a supporter
when Hillcroft first opened in 1920.

409
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:10,205
Then later they needed a
treasurer, so she suggested me.

410
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:12,448
And how do you manage from Yorkshire?

411
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,816
It's not hard. I go there twice a month.

412
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:17,308
But the telephone's
really changed everything.

413
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,925
I want to hear Mrs Harding's story.

414
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:24,827
It was the telephone that
changed everything for me, too.

415
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:28,358
You see, I was a secretary
before I was married

416
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,429
for a telephone company back when
everyone was getting connected

417
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:35,378
- at the start of the war.
- Then she moved into local government

418
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,081
and that's where we met.

419
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:40,778
But if I'd had more education,
I might have gone further.

420
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,188
If that doesn't sound too vain.

421
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:47,342
No. Many women from all backgrounds
feel that. I know I did.

422
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,751
I was a nurse, but why
couldn't I be a doctor?

423
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,783
- Barrow, is that luncheon?
- It is, m'lady.

424
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:56,273
- Shall we go in? - I hope we'll have
a chance to continue this conversation.

425
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,628
- Look at you.
- I don't mean to pretend.

426
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,705
I didn't know we were coming to Downton

427
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,904
- until we turned into the drive.
- Does he not know you worked here?

428
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:10,770
He knows I was a housemaid,
so there's no pretence.

429
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:13,678
But by the time we met
that was all in the past.

430
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,845
I'm one to talk. I married
the boss's daughter.

431
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,401
So is she going to come down?

432
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:23,938
I don't know, she didn't say.

433
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,722
No, she's too important to
speak to the likes of us.

434
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:28,851
Take those up now.

435
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:35,445
We have to find ladders to help
them achieve their potential.

436
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:37,356
I do so agree.

437
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,599
We can't afford to waste working women

438
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:42,341
- by not educating them.
- It's lucky Carson isn't here.

439
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,044
Carson?

440
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,162
Our butler. He's a traditionalist.

441
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:48,831
You recall Mr Carson, madam, surely?

442
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:54,263
What do you mean, Barrow?

443
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:56,880
- Mrs Harding used to work here.
- What?

444
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:59,912
- She used to be a --
- Thank you, Mr Barrow.

445
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:02,872
I can tell it.

446
00:25:07,898 --> 00:25:11,627
I used to be a housemaid here for
a couple of years before the war.

447
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,828
Here? In this house?

448
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,697
I knew I'd seen your face.

449
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:17,816
Why didn't you say?

450
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:20,848
I don't know. Well, I was going to.

451
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,050
You had every opportunity.

452
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:29,364
You can take the pudding and
Andy can carry the cream.

453
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,192
How's it going?

454
00:25:31,244 --> 00:25:33,643
- Mr Barrow just landed her in it.
- Deliberately?

455
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:36,218
He only told the table she
used to work here as a maid.

456
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,963
I knew he'd do something like that.

457
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:40,372
Of course. How could he resist?

458
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:46,313
We've been hearing that you spoiled
Gwen's luncheon. Good work (!)

459
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:48,348
I couldn't have known she was planning

460
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,007
- to lie her way through it.
- That's not it though, is it?

461
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,081
You resent her luck. You're jealous.

462
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,947
Jealous? Why?

463
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,852
Because I dedicated my life to service

464
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:03,178
and I'm about to be thrown out on my ear

465
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,460
when she scarpered first chance she got

466
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,578
and now she's lunching in the dining room?

467
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,320
Why would that make me jealous, Mr Bates?

468
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:14,601
His Lordship won't like it,
your trying to wrongfoot her.

469
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:16,346
Well, we'll see.

470
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:18,880
I know Lady Mary didn't
like being made a fool of.

471
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:23,408
Now in case I have to remind
you all again, I am the butler.

472
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,537
So please get on.

473
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:32,131
Seems marvellous to me you leave
service, go into government.

474
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:34,458
Now you're married to a prominent man.

475
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,905
- 20th century story.
- I agree. Welcome back.

476
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:40,647
I just feel stupid for
not recognising you.

477
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,181
Why should you? We never spoke.

478
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:46,380
You worked here for two years
and we never spoke to you.

479
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:49,952
- We're the ones in the wrong.
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

480
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:52,652
- It was a good job.
- But not good enough to stay.

481
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:55,228
I didn't want to be in
service my whole life.

482
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,676
- That's all. - So you found
an opportunity and took it.

483
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:01,500
- Bravo.
- I didn't find it.

484
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:04,242
Lady Sybil found it.

485
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:06,360
Sybil helped you?

486
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:08,479
Yes.

487
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:10,598
She did everything.

488
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:13,381
She looked out for the
jobs, lent me clothes,

489
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:15,125
drove me to the interviews.

490
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,867
One time I remember the horse went lame

491
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,986
and we both got stuck in the mud.

492
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,810
Oh, the talking we had
to do when we got back!

493
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:27,089
I remember we were so worried. But
she never said a thing about you.

494
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,208
It was our secret pact.

495
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:31,492
And then one day she cornered the man

496
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:33,403
who was installing the telephone here

497
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:36,892
and er, that's how I got
my first job in business.

498
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:40,506
She wouldn't let me enter the
library while you met him.

499
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,625
So that was you?

500
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:44,744
Did you keep in contact?

501
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:47,371
Christmas cards and such.

502
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,933
And then I heard the news.

503
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:58,203
I'll never forget her. Her
kindness changed my life.

504
00:27:58,254 --> 00:28:00,747
What a lovely way to remember her.

505
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:03,779
She was a lovely person.

506
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,895
Darling Sybil.

507
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:12,659
Thank you, Barrow, for reminding
us of Mrs Harding's time here.

508
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,787
My pleasure, m'lady.

509
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:20,312
They're coming now!

510
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:26,824
I just wanted to come and say hello.

511
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:29,565
Oh, Mrs Hughes will be sad to miss you.

512
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:32,307
Now, tell us about your children.

513
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:35,464
We want to know every detail.
Where are you living now?

514
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:38,164
All right. Well, let's
begin at the beginning.

515
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,449
But afterwards, I'd like
to hear all about you.

516
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:43,814
Mr Branson, I wouldn't
bother you but now you're back

517
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:46,555
- and now you're the agent again --
- Lady Mary's the agent.

518
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:49,754
But still, you'll know what they're
planning for Yew Tree Farm.

519
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:51,083
I suppose so.

520
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:53,617
Only, Mr Mason was in the running for it

521
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,902
but now it seems they've
had second thoughts.

522
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:57,771
It's not quite as simple as that.

523
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,890
Well, it's as simple as this.

524
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:03,919
His son, my husband, left this
house to die for his country.

525
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:06,536
Shouldn't we help him now if we can?

526
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,368
I'll have a word.

527
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:16,423
I've an idea that when you mentioned
Mrs Harding's connection with us

528
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:18,167
you were trying to catch her out.

529
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:21,117
- Well, I -- - I don't like
to see such things, Barrow.

530
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,025
I don't care for a lack of
generosity. Do you understand me?

531
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,153
Yes, m'lord.

532
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:31,045
You are your own worst enemy.

533
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:33,381
If I am, I've got competition.

534
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:43,424
Mrs Harding rather put me in
my place when she was here.

535
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:45,002
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

536
00:29:45,054 --> 00:29:47,578
No. But when she was
talking about Lady Sybil

537
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,195
I had one of those moments
where you look at your life

538
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,812
and I realised how much
better Sybil was than I am.

539
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:55,886
- It was quite chastening.
- You're hard on yourself, m'lady.

540
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:59,167
Why did I have to be so pettish?
She'd made something of her life,

541
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,286
why shouldn't she?

542
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:05,949
Now, don't panic. Are you in pain?

543
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:10,923
I was then. A sharp pain.

544
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,052
I had it earlier.

545
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:16,531
I'm losing it. It's happening again.

546
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,356
We don't know that. Right,
we're going up to London.

547
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:22,679
I'll ring Dr Ryder, there'll
be a night telephone line.

548
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:24,798
But we've missed the last train.

549
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,872
We'll drive into York.
There may be a late train.

550
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:30,655
What do I tell Mr Bates? I
don't want to frighten him,

551
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,524
but I mustn't get his hopes up.

552
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:35,349
Tell him it's me, I need to
see a doctor double-quick.

553
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,800
What if I lose it on the way?

554
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:40,043
Then we'll be no worse
off than we are now.

555
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:42,785
But we'll make him see
you when we get there.

556
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:45,692
I don't care what time it is,
he'll come to Belgrave Square.

557
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,278
Now go, and meet me at the front.

558
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,991
- Why the suitcase?
- I'm racing up to London.

559
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,110
Whatever for? What's happened?

560
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:02,765
Don't tell anyone, but it's Anna.
She may be having a miscarriage.

561
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:04,469
How will you get there?

562
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:06,379
We've missed the last train from here

563
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,747
but if we drive into York
there may be a late one.

564
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,738
- If not, we'll get the milk train at dawn.
- I'll take you to York.

565
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,438
Remember, not a word to
anyone. Not even Bates.

566
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,848
She should tell him. But
anyway, I'll get the car.

567
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,966
Can I stay in Belgrave Square?

568
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:20,711
Of course. I'll telephone Mead.

569
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:23,743
- Haven't you missed the last train?
- Tom's driving us into York.

570
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:24,948
- Us?
- Anna.

571
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,108
- May we ask why?
- Something medical.

572
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,224
- Oh my lord. - I'm not in any
danger, but I need to go now.

573
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:31,719
I'll be back in a day or two.

574
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:34,918
- But what time will you get there?
- I'll get there when I get there.

575
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:37,036
Goodbye. I'll telephone tomorrow.

576
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:40,941
Carson and Mrs Hu -- Mrs
Carson will be back on Friday.

577
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:43,433
- It'd be nice if you were
to welcome them. - I'll try.

578
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,562
That's it, I must fly.

579
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:52,749
I don't understand the urgency.
Lady Mary didn't seem ill earlier.

580
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:57,391
- Do you want her medical history?
- No, but it seems so sudden.

581
00:31:57,443 --> 00:31:59,935
Sometimes these things are sudden.

582
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:03,373
So you're not hiding anything?

583
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:06,447
You've lived with suspicion too
long. It's got under your skin.

584
00:32:06,498 --> 00:32:10,227
I should get in. I mustn't
keep Mr Branson waiting.

585
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:13,124
- Before her Ladyship?
- Here she is now.

586
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,752
Good evening, Bates.

587
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:18,857
Don't worry, we'll be
back before you know it.

588
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:38,059
What's Lady Mary's emergency?

589
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:40,800
- It's none of our business.
- Very true, Miss Baxter.

590
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:43,002
For once I agree with you.

591
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,907
Daisy, what is it?

592
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:50,936
I've had enough. I don't
care what Mrs Patmore says.

593
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:54,965
Her Ladyship has cheated
Mr Mason of his farm

594
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:57,416
- and I'm going to have it out with her.
- Daisy, don't.

595
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:59,452
You'll lose your job and then what?

596
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:04,312
Look at Gwen. She's thrown off the
yoke of service to make a good life.

597
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:06,431
What am I doing with my mine?

598
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:09,089
- Why aren't you two up there now?
- They wanted to be alone.

599
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:11,083
We gave them coffee and they sent us off.

600
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:15,164
- You can't go barging in when they're
discussing something private. - I'll wait for
her.

601
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,280
I wish you wouldn't.

602
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:24,500
Poor Tom, racing across the county.
It's just Mary being dramatic.

603
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:25,830
She didn't look at all ill.

604
00:33:25,882 --> 00:33:27,699
Well, why else would she have gone?

605
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:29,818
We'll ask her tomorrow morning.

606
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,262
I'd like to take advantage of her
absence to settle Yew Tree Farm.

607
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,506
I want to offer it to Mr Mason.

608
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,663
I know you do. But he's quite old.

609
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,654
- He'll have Daisy to help him.
- Can we afford it?

610
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:46,268
We'd make more money if we farmed
it ourselves and let the house.

611
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,843
Shouldn't we wait for Tom to
get back before we decide?

612
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:52,218
- I'll ask him what Sybil would do?
- Is that fair?

613
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:54,908
Daisy, I beg of you.

614
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,483
You're a trained cook, you
could get work anywhere.

615
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,308
But you'll have to manage without
a reference if you do this!

616
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,050
She's right, Daisy. Have
you forgotten what happened

617
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:06,248
- when you let off steam at the auction?
- No. I've had it up to here.

618
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,367
I've come to the end. I must do it.

619
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:11,150
Well, I'm coming with you.

620
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:14,639
- Please yourself. I'm going.
- Why? It won't help Mr Mason.

621
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:18,004
Listen to him, Daisy. Listen to
him, if you won't listen to me!

622
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,621
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.

623
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:22,906
You're back. You made good time.

624
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,398
We made the last train so
they're on their way south.

625
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,101
I wish I knew what it was about.

626
00:34:27,153 --> 00:34:30,383
- Nothing to concern you, I promise.
- You missed a jolly good dinner.

627
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,333
I bought some sandwiches at the
station and ate them in the car.

628
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:35,617
You're a braver man than I am, Gunga Din.

629
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:38,234
We've been settling some
business while you were away.

630
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:41,973
- Oh? Yes? - Mama wants Mr
Mason to have Yew Tree Farm.

631
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,427
I see.

632
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,711
Of course, it's not a
business-like decision

633
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:48,578
and Cora has been using some
emotional blackmail on us.

634
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,153
I asked them what they felt
Sybil would want us to do.

635
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:53,023
Well, we all know the answer to that.

636
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:54,560
But is it enough to convince you?

637
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,761
I was reminded recently
of William's death.

638
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:59,503
And I suppose I do feel
old Mason's in our charge.

639
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,372
That's what I say.

640
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:04,612
- Shouldn't we wait for Mary?
- No. I'll handle Mary.

641
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:06,772
It'd be better if it's a fait accompli.

642
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:10,428
We don't have to do everything Mary
says. Not when we're all agreed.

643
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,388
Maybe it's underhand
to go behind her back.

644
00:35:14,343 --> 00:35:17,583
But it's much too important to
me to let scruples get in the way.

645
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:20,854
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

646
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:27,927
- Your Ladyship.
- Daisy?

647
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,738
Yes, it's me. And I have to speak to you.

648
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,857
- Daisy...
- What are you doing here, Baxter?

649
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:36,972
I was a little worried about Daisy,
m'lady. She's been very upset.

650
00:35:37,024 --> 00:35:39,215
- I have been upset.
- I'm sorry to hear it,

651
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,625
but I don't understand
what you're doing here.

652
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:44,034
Daisy, there you are. That was quick.

653
00:35:44,086 --> 00:35:46,651
Will you tell Mr Mason
the news or should we?

654
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:48,769
Tell him what?

655
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:51,054
He's got the farm if he still wants it.

656
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,882
Isn't that why you're here?

657
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,800
What wonderful news. Daisy...

658
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:59,238
Wonderful.

659
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,488
She's going downstairs now, m'lady,
and I'll see you in your room.

660
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:09,872
That was rather peculiar.

661
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:13,247
I have a feeling I've just dodged
something and I don't know what.

662
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,178
Don't start.

663
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,389
- How is she?
- Resting.

664
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:47,507
Sleeping, I hope by now.

665
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,626
- Has she lost the baby?
- No.

666
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:51,744
We got there in time.

667
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:55,483
I've put in the stitch I spoke of
and as they say in medical novels,

668
00:36:55,535 --> 00:36:57,986
I'm cautiously optimistic.

669
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:02,586
- And what shall I do now?
- Can you stay a day or two?

670
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,539
We could go back on Friday.

671
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,906
Good. Make her rest when she gets there

672
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,025
but don't fret too much.

673
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:12,805
I'm so grateful to you for
coming out here at dawn.

674
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:15,921
Don't worry. It'll be
reflected in my bill.

675
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:18,745
- Of course.
- And now I'll say goodbye.

676
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:27,261
I feel so... I don't know, dazed.

677
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:32,080
Yesterday I thought I hated her
and today she saved our lives.

678
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:34,988
It never does good to hate anyone.

679
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,391
So is this true? Your Mr Mason got
the farm after everything you said?

680
00:37:39,443 --> 00:37:41,842
- Seems like it.
- I envy him.

681
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:44,459
Ooh, high praise from a city boy.

682
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:47,117
Not me. Country life is what I'm after.

683
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:51,116
I don't care where I started,
this is where I want to end up.

684
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,656
When will Carson get here tomorrow?

685
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,733
6:00, m'lord, if the train's on time.

686
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:05,478
Is anything planned as a welcome?

687
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,511
We're having a bit of a do in
the servants' hall to say hello.

688
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:09,674
Well, we'll come down.

689
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:12,291
And please tell Mrs Patmore
we can have a cold dinner

690
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:14,451
- if that would be easier.
- Very good, m'lord.

691
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:18,407
- Back to normal at last!
- I've enjoyed my time as butler.

692
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:22,966
I hope you've learned something from it.

693
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:26,290
You see, Barrow, Carson is a kind man.

694
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:29,873
Don't overlook that. It's
why people are loyal to him.

695
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,815
I'll bear it in mind, m'lord.

696
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:36,976
Do. It should be helpful when you
-- That is, when the hour strikes.

697
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:41,005
To move on. Yes, m'lord.

698
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,483
Welcome to the Royal Automobile Club.

699
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,186
Do you know it?

700
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,606
No, but I like to be surprised.

701
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:05,462
I'm sorry if I look rather shabby.

702
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:08,370
I didn't bring any clothes, so
I've stolen this from my aunt.

703
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:10,499
Hm.

704
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:14,019
You are the opposite of shabby.

705
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:35,205
I can't think why, but I've
never been here before.

706
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:37,323
When was it built?

707
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,442
1911.

708
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:42,184
The temple of car lovers.

709
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:45,258
Your love is not fickle, I'll admit.

710
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:49,038
But I'm afraid for me, a car
is simply to get from A to B.

711
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,156
Nothing more.

712
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:55,144
What is your enthusiasm? Horses?

713
00:39:55,196 --> 00:40:00,544
No. I ride, I even hunt, but I
don't see horses in my dreams.

714
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:05,280
- What then?
- I like my work.

715
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:07,398
Do you work?

716
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,808
It's rather shocking, isn't it?

717
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:13,837
My father and I co-own the estate.

718
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,039
But I really function as the agent.

719
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:18,448
So many estates are going under these days

720
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,231
and I'm just determined that
Downton won't be one of them.

721
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:24,897
Far from shocked, I am
extremely impressed.

722
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:29,789
- And you have a son?
- Yes. George.

723
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:32,821
He'll take over eventually, I assume,

724
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,147
and when he does, I want to make sure

725
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,390
he's the master of a modern going concern.

726
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:40,340
He's also heir to his grandfather's title

727
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:42,541
for reasons too complicated
to bore you with.

728
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:45,293
So it's very neat and tidy.

729
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,440
Neat and tidy-ish.

730
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:51,130
But aren't you rather at a loose end?

731
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:55,460
I hope this means you're boiling
up to make a pass before we're done.

732
00:40:57,631 --> 00:40:59,697
Probably.

733
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,816
But will you accept?

734
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:06,271
No. But I shall enjoy
the process enormously.

735
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:18,432
I can't believe it. I feel like I'm
standing at the gates of paradise.

736
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:21,465
I don't think it's any
nicer than your old farm.

737
00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:25,909
But it's safe, Daisy. They'll not
sell this estate in my lifetime.

738
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:28,028
Lady Mary wouldn't allow it.

739
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,728
So I know now where I can lay my bones.

740
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,007
And it's down to you. You've
used your credit to rescue me.

741
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,291
I don't think I have got much credit.

742
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,867
Well, that's where you're wrong.

743
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:42,141
And here's the proof of it.

744
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:53,617
- They'll be here in a minute.
- Is that straight?

745
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:55,237
Down a bit on the left.

746
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:57,937
We're not striving for
a setting by Diaghilev.

747
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:00,481
The point is we've made an effort.

748
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:07,699
- Are you finished? - I've unpacked
and then they're changing tonight

749
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:09,817
so they can come down and say hello.

750
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,684
- And the trip went well?
- I think so, yes.

751
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:14,812
Why?

752
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:19,247
Because I believe I
know what you're hiding.

753
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:23,661
And I feel sure I know what it is
that took you to London in a rush.

754
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,984
And I hope I'm wrong.

755
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:30,213
You're not wrong in all of it.

756
00:42:30,265 --> 00:42:32,872
But you're wrong if you think
I'm hiding something sad.

757
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:36,663
What I've been hiding is very, very happy.

758
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:40,152
Oh, God...

759
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,057
Are you sure?

760
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,037
- Really?
- Really.

761
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:49,166
They're here!

762
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:52,988
Aw!

763
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:58,959
Home again at last. I feel
I've been away for months.

764
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:01,618
Very flattering, I don't think!

765
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,578
Oh, thank you.

766
00:43:05,948 --> 00:43:10,341
Oh, there you all are. Plotting!

767
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:11,878
You're the one who's plotting.

768
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,032
Is it really so important to keep
the Crawleys in command, Mama?

769
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:18,982
That is my sole motive, is it?

770
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:22,928
- Isn't it?
- No. No, it is not.

771
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,577
For years, I've watched governments
take control of our lives.

772
00:43:28,629 --> 00:43:31,236
And their argument is always the same --

773
00:43:31,288 --> 00:43:33,895
fewer costs, greater efficiency.

774
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:36,179
But the result is the same, too --

775
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:39,544
less control by the people,
more control by the state.

776
00:43:39,596 --> 00:43:43,698
Until the individual's own
wishes count for nothing.

777
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,814
That is what I consider my duty to resist.

778
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:49,098
By wielding your unelected power?

779
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,878
You see, the point of a
so-called 'great family'

780
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,495
is to protect our freedoms.

781
00:43:55,547 --> 00:43:59,608
That is why the barons made
King John sign the Magna Carta.

782
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,097
I do see that your argument was
more honourable than I'd appreciated.

783
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:05,922
But, Mama, we're not living in 1215.

784
00:44:05,974 --> 00:44:08,871
And the strengths of great
families like ours is going,

785
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:11,862
- that's just fact.
- Your great-grandchildren won't thank you

786
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:14,936
when the state is all-powerful
because we didn't fight.

787
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:17,346
Well, I won't have any,
so I can live with that.

788
00:44:17,397 --> 00:44:21,593
They've arrived, so we should go
down as soon as Mary gets here.

789
00:44:22,715 --> 00:44:24,366
Have you told her about Mr Mason?

790
00:44:24,418 --> 00:44:26,360
- I have.
- How'd she take it?

791
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:28,603
She's annoyed. But it
seems London went well

792
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:31,677
- so she's less cross than she might be.
- Good of you to come, Isobel.

793
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:36,039
We couldn't miss Carson's return.
And Mrs... Carson, of course.

794
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:39,570
I can't get my tongue round it.

795
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:41,688
We've simply got to learn.

796
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,894
We ought to go down. I could hear
them shouting from my bedroom.

797
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:51,211
I haven't been into the
kitchens for at least 20 years.

798
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:54,887
Have you got your passport?

799
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,343
Make sure his Lordship has a drink, Andy.

800
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:03,580
- Hello, Molesley.
- Has it changed much since your day?

801
00:45:03,632 --> 00:45:08,243
I only know I shall need Ariande's
thread to find my way out.

802
00:45:09,863 --> 00:45:12,054
When are you going to
appoint your new editor?

803
00:45:12,106 --> 00:45:13,259
Why can't it be you?

804
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,959
Well, I'd like to be a sort of co-editor,

805
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:19,739
but no man will put up with that so
I'm going to try and find a woman.

806
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:23,644
A woman editor? I applaud you.

807
00:45:23,696 --> 00:45:25,762
Of course you do.

808
00:45:25,814 --> 00:45:30,581
Presumably we may now look
forward to women field marshals

809
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:32,616
and a woman pope!

810
00:45:32,668 --> 00:45:34,943
Nonsense, Granny. I
think it's a good idea.

811
00:45:34,994 --> 00:45:37,061
It is a magazine for women.

812
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:39,979
Well, we should congratulate them.

813
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,986
That was nice of you,
to praise Edith's plan.

814
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:51,984
A monkey will type out the Bible
if you leave it long enough.

815
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,882
Carson, Mrs Carson.

816
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:58,164
I'm so sorry I missed the wedding but
I'm delighted to be here tonight.

817
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,700
Thank you.

818
00:45:59,752 --> 00:46:01,404
"Mrs Carson..."

819
00:46:01,456 --> 00:46:04,104
It's like Jane Eyre asking
to be called Mrs Rochester.

820
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:07,271
- I'll never get used to it.
- None of us will.

821
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,127
When will the trial be?

822
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:13,159
I don't know yet. No doubt I'll
find out when the time comes.

823
00:46:13,211 --> 00:46:15,278
At least he can't hurt you now.

824
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,397
Can't he?

825
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:21,135
Mama's slipped away. She was
tired, so I told her to go.

826
00:46:21,187 --> 00:46:24,666
- Quite right. - I'm afraid she
won't give up. About the hospital.

827
00:46:24,718 --> 00:46:27,034
I shan't think that at her funeral.

828
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:29,152
Who says she won't be at yours?

829
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:31,863
Oh, thank you.

830
00:46:32,777 --> 00:46:36,173
- Thank you.
- Anything to report, Mr Barrow?

831
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:40,078
Only that being a butler is more
complicated than I'd realised.

832
00:46:40,129 --> 00:46:43,027
If you've learnt that,
you've used your time well.

833
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,893
Your cottage is ready and your
things have been taken there.

834
00:46:45,945 --> 00:46:48,178
That's very considerate,
m'lady. Thank you.

835
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:52,041
You must let us know if anything
needs to be done, Mrs... Mrs Carson.

836
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:54,866
Well, now, m'lord, this is the thing.

837
00:46:54,918 --> 00:46:59,851
Won't it be confusing if we're to
be called Carson and Mrs Carson?

838
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:03,714
Rather as we resisted
Anna being Mrs Bates,

839
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:05,459
would it be very irregular

840
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:09,654
if we continued to be
Carson and Mrs Hughes?

841
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:12,894
Oh, hallelujah! You've
made me a happy man.

842
00:47:12,946 --> 00:47:17,339
Let us raise a glass and drink
the health of the newly-weds.

843
00:47:17,391 --> 00:47:21,368
Still to be known in this house at
any rate as Carson and Mrs Hughes.

844
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,027
Carson and Mrs Hughes.

845
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,146
Good heavens, there really is a God.

846
00:47:26,197 --> 00:47:29,521
- What a relief.
- To no-one more than his Lordship.

847
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:36,448
I just want to go and check my room.
Make sure they've taken everything.

848
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:38,576
Right you are.
