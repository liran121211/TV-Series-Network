2
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,827
Here we are, ma'am. Crawley House.

3
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:56,307
For good or ill.

4
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,747
I still don't see why
I couldn't just refuse it.

5
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,107
There's no mechanism
for you to do so.

6
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,907
You WILL be an earl,
you WILL inherit the estate.

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,227
You can throw it away
when you have it, that's up to you.

8
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:19,667
Can I help?

9
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,987
I'm Molesley, sir.
Your butler and valet.

10
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:25,787
Mr Molesley, I'm afraid...
May I introduce ourselves?

11
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:29,747
I am Mrs Crawley, and this is
my son, Mr Matthew Crawley.

12
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:32,187
I'll just give Mr Taylor a hand
with the cases.

13
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:33,947
I can...
Thank you, Molesley.

14
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,307
I won't let them change me.

15
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,867
Why would they want to?

16
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,787
Mother, Lord Grantham has made
the unwelcome discovery

17
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:45,547
that his heir
is a middle-class lawyer

18
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:48,227
and the son of a middle class
doctor. Upper middle class.

19
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:51,267
He wants to limit the damage by
turning me into one of his own kind.

20
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,587
When you met him in London
you liked him.

21
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:57,107
I simply do not understand why
we are rushing into this.

22
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,507
Matthew Crawley is my heir.

23
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:01,867
Patrick was your heir.
He never lived here.

24
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:04,627
Patrick was in and out of this house
since the day he was born.

25
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:07,307
You saw how many of the village
turned out for the service.

26
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:09,707
Nothing's settled yet.
It IS settled, my dearest one,

27
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:11,387
whether you like it or not.

28
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:13,027
I wouldn't say that.

29
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:16,067
Not while your mother breathes air.

30
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:27,467
Oh, Ellen, this is much better
than I thought it would be.

31
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,627
You have done well.
Thank you, ma'am.

32
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:32,147
Would you like this in here, ma'am,
or taken up to your room?

33
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:34,307
In here, thank you.

34
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:38,267
So, are you the whole
of our new household?

35
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,387
There's a local girl, ma'am - Beth.

36
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:42,827
She's to double under-housemaid
and kitchen maid.

37
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,987
This is ridiculous.
Thank you very much, Molesley.

38
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:48,387
Might we have some tea?
Very good, ma'am.

39
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,707
Well, he can go right now.
Why?

40
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:59,667
Because we do not need a butler,
or a valet if it comes to that.

41
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,387
We've always managed perfectly well
with a cook and a maid,

42
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:05,107
and they cannot expect us to...
What they expect, Matthew,

43
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:07,587
is that we won't know how to behave,
so if you don't mind

44
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,667
I would rather not confirm
their expectations.

45
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,867
I have to be myself, Mother.

46
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:15,427
I'll be no use to anyone
if I can't be myself.

47
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:18,587
And before they, or you,
get any ideas,

48
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:21,347
I will choose my own wife.
What on earth do you mean?

49
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:23,187
They'll push one of the daughters
at me.

50
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:25,787
They'll have fixed on that
when they heard I was a bachelor.

51
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,187
Lady Mary Crawley.

52
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,027
I do hope I'm not interrupting.

53
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:35,147
Lady Mary.
Cousin Mary, please.

54
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:38,947
Mama has sent me down to welcome you
and to ask you dine with us tonight.

55
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:41,267
Unless you're too tired.

56
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,787
We would be delighted.
Good.

57
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:45,427
Come at eight.

58
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,227
Won't you stay and have some tea?

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,947
Oh, no. You're far too busy.

60
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,907
And I wouldn't want to push in.

61
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:02,067
Lynch, I think we'll go back
by the South Lodge.

62
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,587
Very good, m'lady.

63
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:06,707
Lady Mary, I hope you didn't
misunderstand me. I was only joking.

64
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:08,867
Of course. And I agree.

65
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,867
The whole thing is a complete joke.

66
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,787
So what do you think
we'll make of them?

67
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:20,507
I shouldn't think much.
She hasn't even got a lady's maid.

68
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:23,747
It's not a capital offence.
She's got a maid. Her name's Ellen.

69
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:26,467
She's not a lady's maid.
She's just a housemaid

70
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,987
that fastens hooks and buttons
when she has to.

71
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:31,107
There's more to it than that,
you know. Daisy!

72
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:33,787
We want some very precise reporting
when dinner's over.

73
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,507
Are we to treat him as the heir?
Are we 'eck as like!

74
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,587
A doctor's son from Manchester?!

75
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:41,267
He'll be lucky if he gets
a civil word out of me.

76
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,867
We're ALL lucky if we get
a civil word out of you.

77
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,547
Gwen, parcel for you.
Came by evening post.

78
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,507
Thank you, Mr Carson.

79
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,067
William.

80
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,227
Have you seen them yet, Mr Carson?

81
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:56,507
By "them", I assume you mean
the new family. In which case, no.

82
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:59,427
I have that pleasure
to look forward to this evening.

83
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:02,947
Daisy, did you hear me call
or have you gone selectively deaf?

84
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,387
No, Mrs Patmore.
Then might I remind you

85
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,827
we are preparing dinner
for your future employer?

86
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:10,787
And if it goes wrong,
I'll be telling them why!

87
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,187
Why are they here at all
when you're going to undo it?

88
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:21,427
Your father's not convinced
it can be undone.

89
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:23,387
But you'll still try.

90
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,507
Granny and I are willing to try.

91
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:27,507
And Papa is not?

92
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,667
We'll bring him round, you'll see.

93
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,227
We're trying to find a lawyer
who'll take it on.

94
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:34,307
So what are they like?

95
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,507
She's nice enough,

96
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:39,987
but he's...very full of himself.

97
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:42,267
Why do you say that?
Just an impression.

98
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:44,627
Let's go down
and you can decide for yourself.

99
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:50,107
Hello again.

100
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,307
It's a pleasure to meet you at last,
Mrs Crawley.

101
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:54,467
We're delighted to be here.

102
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,547
Aren't we, Matthew?
Delighted.

103
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,867
Welcome to Downton.

104
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,107
Thank you. You've been so kind.

105
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:21,187
What a reception committee!

106
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,907
Yes. Thank you.

107
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:29,987
This is Carson.
We'd all be lost without him.

108
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:34,387
Mama, may I present Matthew Crawley
and Mrs Crawley?

109
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:36,387
My mother, Lady Grantham.

110
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:39,907
What should we call each other?

111
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:44,427
Well, we could always start with
Mrs Crawley and Lady Grantham.

112
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,667
Come into the drawing room and
we can make all the introductions.

113
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:51,987
Thank you, Carson.

114
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:02,387
Do you think you'll enjoy
village life?

115
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,907
It'll be very quiet
after life in the city.

116
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,467
Even Manchester.

117
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:09,787
I'm sure I'll find something
to keep me busy.

118
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:13,267
You might like the hospital.
What sort of hospital is it?

119
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,027
How many beds?

120
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:17,107
Well, it isn't really a hospital.

121
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:19,307
Don't let Dr Clarkson hear you.

122
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,347
He thinks it's second only to
St Thomas's.

123
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:24,587
It's a cottage hospital, of course,
but quite well equipped.

124
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:25,947
Who pays for it?

125
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,507
Oh, good. Let's talk about money (!)

126
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:31,947
My father gave the building
and an endowment to run it.

127
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:34,547
In a way,
he set up his own memorial.

128
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,147
But how splendid.

129
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:39,587
And Mr Lloyd George's
new insurance measures will help.

130
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:42,787
Please don't speak that man's name.
We ARE about to eat.

131
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:46,587
I will hold it steady
and you can help yourself, sir.

132
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,027
Yes, I know.

133
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,667
Thank you.

134
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,027
You'll soon get used to the way
things are done here.

135
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:56,907
If you mean that I am accustomed
to a very different life from this,

136
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,667
then that is true.

137
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,747
What will you do with your time?

138
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,747
I've got a job in Ripon.

139
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,307
I said I'll start tomorrow.

140
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,267
A job?!

141
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:09,227
In a partnership. You might have
heard of it. Harvell and Carter.

142
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:12,267
They need someone who understands
industrial law, I'm glad to say.

143
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:15,227
Although I'm afraid most of it
will be wills and conveyancing.

144
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,747
You do know I mean to involve you
in the running of the estate?

145
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:21,427
Well, don't worry. There are
plenty of hours in the day.

146
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,627
And of course I'll have the weekend.

147
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,947
We'll discuss this later.
We mustn't bore the ladies.

148
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:28,867
What is a weekend?

149
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,187
Why shouldn't he be a lawyer?
Gentlemen don't work, silly.

150
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:37,827
Not real gentlemen.

151
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:40,787
Don't listen to her, Daisy.
No, listen to me!

152
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,747
And take those kidneys
up to the servery

153
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:45,547
before I knock you down
and serve your brains as fritters!

154
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:47,107
Yes, Mrs Patmore!

155
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:49,867
I wonder what that Mr Molesley
makes of them.

156
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:52,507
Poor old Molesley. I pity the man
who's taken that job.

157
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,427
Then why did you apply for it?

158
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:58,907
I thought it might help me
to get away from you, Mr Bates.

159
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,147
I'm so interested
to see the hospital.

160
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:06,827
Well, you would be,
with your late husband a doctor.

161
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:09,027
Not just my husband.

162
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:12,147
My father and brother too, and
I trained as a nurse during the war.

163
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:14,107
Oh. Fancy.

164
00:09:14,107 --> 00:09:16,667
I'd love to be involved in some way.

165
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:20,067
Well, you could always help with
the bring-and-buy sale next month.

166
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,187
That would be most appreciated.

167
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,027
I should say so.
She's a match for the old lady.

168
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:28,627
She wasn't going to give in.

169
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:31,227
What old lady are you referring to,
Thomas?

170
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:34,427
You cannot mean her ladyship
the Dowager Countess.

171
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:36,427
Not if you wish to remain
in this house.

172
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:37,787
No, Mr Carson.

173
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:42,467
William.

174
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:45,747
Are you aware the seam
at your shoulder is coming apart?

175
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:48,747
I-I felt it go a bit earlier on.
I'll mend it when we turn in.

176
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:51,467
You will mend it now! And you will
never again appear in public

177
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,627
in a similar state of undress!
No, Mr Carson.

178
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,107
To progress in your chosen career,
William,

179
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:59,067
you must remember that a good servant
at all times

180
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,507
retains a sense of pride and dignity

181
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:06,147
that reflects the pride and dignity
of the family he serves.

182
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,587
And never make me remind you of it
again.

183
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,027
I'll do it.

184
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,587
And cheer up. We've all had a smack
from Mr Carson.

185
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:21,467
You'll be the butler yourself
one day.

186
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:24,267
Then you'll do the smacking.
I could never be like him.

187
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,827
I bet he comes from
a line of butlers

188
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:27,587
that goes back to the Conqueror.

189
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,747
He learned his business,
and so will you.

190
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:32,587
Even Mr Carson wasn't born
standing to attention.

191
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:34,467
I hope not, for his mother's sake.

192
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:50,867
(KNOCKS)
This was at the back door.

193
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,707
Thank you, William.

194
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:27,507
It's kind of you
to take an interest.

195
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:30,147
I'm afraid it's a case of
the warhorse and the drum.

196
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,307
You know my late husband
was a doctor.

197
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:36,107
I do.
I'm familiar with Dr Crawley's work

198
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:38,867
on the symptoms of infection
in children. Ah.

199
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:42,347
Even I studied nursing
during the South African war.

200
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:43,507
Really?

201
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,387
(SOBS)

202
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,267
Very distressing.

203
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:52,227
Young farmer. John Drake.
Tenant of Lord Grantham's.

204
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,867
He came in today.

205
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:56,067
It's dropsy, I'm afraid.

206
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,867
May I see him?
Yes, by all means.

207
00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:08,427
Is the dropsy of the liver
or the heart?

208
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,267
Everything points to the heart.
(BREATHES LABORIOUSLY)

209
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:14,587
(COUGHS)

210
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:18,307
Alright, Mr Drake.
You're in safe hands now.

211
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,987
What will happen to his wife?

212
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,307
She may try to keep the farm on.

213
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:32,587
Grantham is not a harsh landlord,
but...her children are young.

214
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,267
What can I do to help?

215
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,947
If I'm to live in this village,
I must have an occupation.

216
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:42,827
Please. Let me be useful.

217
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:46,027
He chooses his clothes himself.

218
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,507
He puts them out at night

219
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,387
and hangs the ones he's worn.

220
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,827
I get to take the linen down to
the laundry, but that's about all.

221
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,547
That's all?

222
00:12:57,547 --> 00:13:01,227
"I'll do this," he says. "I'll
take the other." "I'll tie that."

223
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,947
And I'm just stood there
like a chump,

224
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,827
watching a man get dressed.

225
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:10,227
To be honest, Mr Bates,

226
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:12,107
I don't see the point of it.

227
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,747
I thought you didn't like him.
So what?

228
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:19,387
I have plenty of friends
I don't like.

229
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,187
Would you want Mary
to marry one of them?

230
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:22,667
(SIGHS)

231
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,107
Why do you always have to pretend
to be nicer than the rest of us?

232
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:27,747
Perhaps I am.

233
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,387
Then pity your wife,

234
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,707
whose fortune must go to
this odd young man

235
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:35,107
who talks about weekends and jobs.

236
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,147
If Mary were to marry him,
then all would be resolved.

237
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,827
What have you got there?
Nothing.

238
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:50,907
What kind of nothing?

239
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:52,707
You haven't got an admirer.

240
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:55,987
I might have. Why shouldn't I?

241
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:58,107
Don't tell Mrs Hughes.

242
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:00,347
She'll bring the vicar round
to have you exorcised.

243
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,067
How are we supposed to find husbands

244
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,627
if we're never allowed to see
any men?

245
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,787
Perhaps she thinks
the stork brings them.

246
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:14,427
'Ey, Lady Mary's in for a surprise.

247
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:18,147
Thomas was in the library when
old Violet came in from the garden.

248
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:20,907
Seems they want to fix her up
with Mr Crawley.

249
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:24,747
Well, it makes sense.
She was gonna marry Mr Patrick.

250
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:27,107
Would she have, though,
when it came to it?

251
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:28,987
That's the question.

252
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:36,987
Ah, there you are, dear.

253
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:39,907
I was hoping you'd be home in time.
In time for what?

254
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:42,347
I've been paid the compliment
of a visit.

255
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:51,387
Hello!
Good afternoon, Cousin Matthew.

256
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:53,587
Good afternoon.

257
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:56,867
We were just saying
how charming this room is now.

258
00:14:56,867 --> 00:15:01,307
Mm. It always seemed rather dark
when my mother-in-law lived here.

259
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:04,787
But then she made everything
rather dark! (LAUGHS)

260
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:06,987
Sir.
No, thank you.

261
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:09,987
Cup of tea, sir?
It's alright, I'll help myself.

262
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:17,387
So, Molesley,

263
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:20,387
how do you find being home again?

264
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,707
Your father must be glad
you're back.

265
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:24,627
He is, your ladyship.

266
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:32,307
Might I give you this cup?
Ma'am.

267
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,187
I'm afraid we must be going.

268
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:37,027
Thank you.

269
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,547
You'll think about it?

270
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:44,067
Oh!
(CLATTER)

271
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:54,107
Oh. I thought no one was here.

272
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:56,867
Can I help, Mr Carson?

273
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,907
Er...

274
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,387
No. No thank you, Anna.

275
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:09,947
May I?

276
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:13,547
I must compliment you, Mrs Crawley.

277
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:16,627
When you made your offer I thought
you might be a Great Lady Nurse

278
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,787
and faint at the sight of blood,

279
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:21,467
but I see you're made of
sterner stuff.

280
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,267
It's definitely the heart.

281
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,907
It's almost too quiet
to hear at all.

282
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,427
I'm afraid so.

283
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:33,187
I've been thinking about
the treatments that are available.

284
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:36,427
Considerable success has been
achieved over the last few years

285
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:38,907
by draining the pericardial sac
of the excess fluid

286
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:40,747
and administering adrenalin.

287
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,547
Mrs Crawley,
I appreciate your thoroughness...

288
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,507
But you're unwilling to try it?

289
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:48,467
Injection of adrenalin is
a comparatively new procedure.

290
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,307
It's a while ago now,
but I saw my husband do it.

291
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:53,507
I know how.
Please, Mrs Crawley,

292
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:55,787
don't force me to be uncivil.

293
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:59,067
We will be setting
an impossible precedent.

294
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:03,267
When every villager could demand
the latest fad in treatment

295
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,467
for each new cut and graze.

296
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:08,107
I would remind you that we're not
talking of a cut or a graze,

297
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,427
but the loss of a man's life
and the ruin of his family.

298
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:11,827
Of course.

299
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:15,307
But I beg you to see
that it is not reasonable.

300
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,427
I'm sorry, but I have standards.

301
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,587
I've just seen something
ever so odd.

302
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:25,267
If anyone thinks I'm going to
pull my forelock and curtsey

303
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,987
to this Mr Nobody from nowhere...
O'Brien!

304
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,627
Were you discussing Mr Crawley?

305
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:33,747
Yes, m'lady.

306
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,627
Is it your place to do so?

307
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:39,947
I've got my opinions, m'lady,
same as anybody.

308
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,787
Can I help your ladyship?

309
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,267
This is the button we're missing
from my new evening coat.

310
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,787
I found it lying on the gravel.

311
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:49,347
But...I was shocked

312
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:51,227
at the talk I heard as I came in.

313
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:55,827
Mr Crawley is his lordship's cousin
and heir.

314
00:17:55,827 --> 00:18:00,387
You will, therefore, please accord
him the respect he is entitled to.

315
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:00,547
You will, therefore, please accord
him the respect he is entitled to.

316
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,467
But you don't like him yourself,
m'lady. You never wanted him...

317
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:06,827
You're sailing perilously close
to the wind, O'Brien.

318
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:10,587
If we're to be friends,
you will not speak in that way again

319
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:13,547
about the Crawleys or any member of
Lord Grantham's family.

320
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:18,107
Now I'm going up to rest.
Wake me at the dressing gong.

321
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:29,827
I don't think that's fair.
Not here in the servants' hall.

322
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:33,867
I agree. If she was a real lady,
she wouldn't have come down here.

323
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,987
She'd have rung for me
and given me the button.

324
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:38,827
This isn't her territory.
We can say what we like down here.

325
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,267
Who says?
The law.

326
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,107
And parliament.

327
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:44,467
There is such a thing
as free speech.

328
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,547
Not when I'm in charge!

329
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:49,467
Don't push your luck, Thomas.

330
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:52,347
Now, tea's over. Back to work.

331
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:54,307
You'd better take this.

332
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,347
Friends (!)

333
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,987
Who does she think she's fooling?
We're not friends.

334
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:02,507
No?
No!

335
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:05,107
And you're not friends
with the girls neither.

336
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:06,707
We're servants, you and me.

337
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:09,987
And they pay us to do as we're told.
That's all.

338
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:14,507
May I...?
I can manage.

339
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:18,187
Where have I put my cuff links?

340
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:21,347
I thought these would make a change.
Where are my usual ones?

341
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:27,547
I know I'm a disappointment to you,
Molesley, but it's no good.

342
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:30,427
I'll never get used to being dressed
like a doll.

343
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:33,387
I'm only trying to help, sir.
Of course.

344
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,187
And if I've offended you,
I apologise.

345
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:37,347
But surely you have better things
to do.

346
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:39,547
This is my job, sir.

347
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:43,187
Well, it seems a very silly
occupation for a grown man.

348
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,507
Look, I'm sorry if I'm...

349
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:54,627
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:03,587
Why are you so against him?

351
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,267
Aside from the fact he's planning to
steal our inheritance?

352
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,467
YOUR inheritance.

353
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,547
It makes no difference
to Sybil and me.

354
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:13,227
We won't inherit, whatever happens.

355
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:15,747
He isn't one of us.

356
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,867
Cousin Freddy's studying
for the bar.

357
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,467
And so is Vivian MacDonald.

358
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,547
At Lincoln's Inn! Not sitting at
a dirty little desk in Ripon.

359
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,707
Besides, his father was a doctor.

360
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:27,467
There's nothing wrong with doctors.
We all need doctors.

361
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,627
We all need crossing sweepers
and draymen too,

362
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:31,347
it doesn't mean
we have to dine with them.

363
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,987
Whom don't we have to dine with?

364
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:36,467
Mary doesn't care for
Cousin Matthew.

365
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:40,507
Sybil, be a dear
and fetch my black evening shawl.

366
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:41,947
O'Brien knows which one.

367
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,987
And Edith, can you see that
the drawing room's ready?

368
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:54,267
I'm glad to catch you alone.

369
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,987
You've driven the others away.
Perhaps I have.

370
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,947
Pretty.

371
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:04,187
The point is, my dear,
I don't want you, any of you,

372
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:07,147
to feel you have to dislike Matthew.

373
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,867
You disliked the idea of him.
That was before he came.

374
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,547
Now he's here,
I don't see any future in it.

375
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:15,147
Not the way things are.

376
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,947
I don't believe a woman can be
forced to give away all her money

377
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,747
to a distant cousin
of her husband's.

378
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:22,747
Not in the 20th century.
It's too ludicrous for words.

379
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:25,467
It's not as simple as that.
The money isn't mine anymore.

380
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,907
It forms a part of the estate.
Even so, when a judge hears...

381
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:31,547
For once in your life,
will you please just listen!

382
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,467
I believe there's an answer.

383
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:40,147
Which would secure your future
and give you a position.

384
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:42,547
You can't be serious.

385
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,627
Just think about it.

386
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:46,467
I don't have to think about it!

387
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:49,267
Marry a man who can barely hold
his knife like a gentleman?!

388
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,147
Oh, you exaggerate!

389
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:53,707
You're American,
you don't understand these things.

390
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:56,347
Have you mentioned this to Granny?
Did she laugh?

391
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,187
Why would she? It was her idea.

392
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,788
Have you been able to explore
the village?

393
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:12,127
Indeed I have.
And I thought the hospital

394
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:14,127
a great credit
to your father's memory.

395
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:17,487
But I'm afraid the good doctor and I
did not see eye to eye.

396
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:20,047
Oh! You amaze me (!)

397
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,807
He's treating one of your tenants,
John Drake, for dropsy.

398
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,927
But seems reluctant to embrace
some of the newer treatments.

399
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:29,847
Drake is a good man
and far too young to die,

400
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:32,327
but I suppose the doctor knows
his business.

401
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:34,727
Not as well as Mrs Crawley,
apparently.

402
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,767
By the way, if ever you want
to ride, just let Lynch know

403
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,727
and he'll sort it out for you.

404
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,967
Oh, Papa,
Cousin Matthew doesn't ride.

405
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,927
I ride.

406
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:50,007
And do you hunt?
No, I don't hunt.

407
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:53,647
I dare say there's not much
opportunity in Manchester! (LAUGHS)

408
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,327
Are you a hunting family?

409
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,647
Families like ours
are always hunting families.

410
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:02,567
Not always. Billy Skelton
won't have them on his land.

411
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,087
But all the Skeltons are mad.

412
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,607
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.

413
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:12,327
I suppose you're more interested
in books than country sports.

414
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,527
I probably am.

415
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,367
You'll tell me
that's rather unhealthy.

416
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:19,207
Not unhealthy. Just unusual.

417
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,207
Among our kind of people.

418
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,967
I'm changing round
the dessert services.

419
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,767
We're missing a sugar sifter.
I know I put three out.

420
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,407
I was talking to Anna earlier.

421
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:37,207
Why? What's she been saying?

422
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,247
Whatever's the matter?
What did Anna say?

423
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:43,607
Only that she thinks
Thomas is bullying William.

424
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:46,407
Ah. Yes, she may have a point.

425
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:48,287
I'll keep an eye out.

426
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,727
Here it is.

427
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,767
I've been studying the story of
Andromeda. Do you know it?

428
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,167
Why?

429
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,887
Her father was King Cepheus,

430
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,927
whose country was being ravaged
by storms.

431
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:07,367
And in the end, he decided
the only way to appease the gods

432
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:10,607
was to sacrifice his eldest daughter
to a hideous sea monster.

433
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:14,007
So they chained her naked
to a rock...

434
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:16,687
Really, Mary!

435
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,127
We'll all need our smelling salts
in a minute.

436
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:23,047
But the sea monster didn't get her,
did he?

437
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,607
No.

438
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:27,927
Just when it seemed he was the only
solution to her father's problems,

439
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:30,047
she was rescued.

440
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:32,447
By Perseus.
That's right.

441
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:34,487
Perseus.

442
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:36,647
Son of a god.

443
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:39,007
Rather more fitting,
wouldn't you say?

444
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,887
That depends.
I'd have to know more about

445
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:44,647
the princess and the sea monster
in question.

(JAUNTY PIANO MUSIC)

447
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:55,047
I wish I could dance like that.

448
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:57,207
Like what?

449
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,407
Don't you know the Grizzly Bear?

450
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:03,807
The Grizzly Bear! As if you do.

451
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:06,327
Certainly I do.
Miss O'Brien, shall we show them?

452
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:08,367
Not likely!
(LAUGHS)

453
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,607
William, give us a tune.
Come on, Daisy.

454
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,447
Hands up.

455
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,727
(PIANO STARTS)
(GROWLS)

456
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,807
(LAUGHTER)

457
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,527
Daisy! Daisy!

458
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:39,807
Stop that silly nonsense
before you put your joints out!

459
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:42,807
See to the range and go to bed.

460
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,687
Thank you. That was beautiful.

461
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:53,527
I'm sorry Mary was rather sharp
this evening.

462
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:56,247
I doubt if Cousin Mary and I are
destined to be close friends.

463
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:58,647
Mm.
I don't blame her.

464
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:01,887
Her father's home and her mother's
fortune are to be passed to me.

465
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,927
It's very harsh.

466
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:06,207
Well, what would you say...

467
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,487
..if the entail were set aside
in Mary's favour?

468
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:15,847
I should try to accept it with
as good a grace as I could muster.

469
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,207
Would you?

470
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:22,967
Oh. Good evening, Taylor.

471
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,127
Good evening, m'lady.
Thank you.

472
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:29,447
I'll say good night, Mr Carson.

473
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:31,567
Look at that scratch.

474
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,927
I'll have to get that sorted out
while they're up in London.

475
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,447
You can hardly see it.
Well, I'll know it's there.

476
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,607
Are you alright now? Only you seemed
a little upset earlier.

477
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:44,727
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I'm just um...

478
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:47,807
..a bit tired.

479
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:50,207
And no wonder.
Did the dinner go well?

480
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,127
Oh, well enough.

481
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:55,247
They won't make a match between them,
if that's what they're thinking.

482
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,927
Lady Mary doesn't like him.
And why should she like the man

483
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,887
she's been passed over for?
And why has she been?

484
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,767
That's what I'd like to know.
It's the law.

485
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,647
Well, it's a wicked law.

486
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:11,847
Why does Mr Carson let you do that?

487
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,767
Because my dad was a clock maker.

488
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:18,127
Did you really ask him for the job
with the Crawleys?

489
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:19,847
I'm sick of being a footman.

490
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,807
I'd rather be a footman
than wait on someone

491
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,847
who ought to be a footman himself.

492
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:25,927
But Mr Carson
shouldn't have told Bates.

493
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,287
How are things with Lady G?

494
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:32,487
Same as usual.

495
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:34,487
Yes m'lady, no m'lady,
three bags full.

496
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,927
I'd like to give her three bags
full, preferably on a dark night.

497
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:40,127
Will you hand in your notice?

498
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:42,367
And let her ruin me
with a nasty reference?

499
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,287
Oh, I think not.

500
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:50,567
I don't want to exaggerate. She's
been very generous, in many ways.

501
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,207
Generous?

502
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,247
To instruct you
in your own practice?

503
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:56,407
She may even have a point.

504
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:59,087
But it does not seem to me
realistic.

505
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:00,567
Well, nor is it!

506
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:03,087
Put an end to her meddling.

507
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:06,847
I am your President and I say
get rid of her.

508
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:08,807
Will that not be awkward?

509
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:13,447
She's planning to stay in the
village for the foreseeable future.

510
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:15,647
No one can foresee the future,
Doctor.

511
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:18,807
Not you, not I,
and certainly not Mrs Crawley.

512
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:28,767
You do not love the place yet.

513
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:32,287
Well, obviously it's...
No, you don't love it.

514
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,527
You see a million bricks
that may crumble,

515
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,007
a thousand gutters and pipes
that may block and leak,

516
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,047
and stone that will crack
in the frost.

517
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:42,527
But you don't?

518
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:46,567
I see my life's work.

519
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,727
Was it ever in danger?
(CHUCKLES)

520
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,327
Many times.

521
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:57,287
My dear Papa thought the balloon
would go up in the 1880s.

522
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:59,207
What saved it?

523
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:02,527
Cora.

524
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:08,767
Where is everyone?

525
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,527
They've gone down to the village.

526
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:13,207
Some travelling salesman
set up at the pub for the afternoon.

527
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:15,767
Alone at last.

528
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,647
We shouldn't be without
both footmen.

529
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:23,327
Does Mr Carson know?

530
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,447
Mrs Hughes does.
She's gone with them.

531
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,327
They won't be long.

532
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:34,207
So, you see to the girls AND you're
supposed to be head housemaid.

533
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,967
You should put in for a raise.

534
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,687
What do you mean "supposed to be"?

535
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:41,167
(BELL RINGS)

536
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:46,927
I said they shouldn't have let
both footmen go.

537
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:49,527
Well, you'll have to answer it.

538
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:52,047
Mr Carson wouldn't like a maid
answering the front door.

539
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,047
Sorry to have kept you waiting, sir.

540
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:02,887
I'm here to see Lord Grantham.

541
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:05,327
Is he expecting you?
No.

542
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:07,927
But he'll be very interested in
what I have to tell him.

543
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:11,927
His lordship is not at home,
but if you will leave your name...

544
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:14,247
Uh-uh, don't come
all high and mighty with me.

545
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,807
I don't know who you are,
but you're certainly not the butler

546
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:18,567
so don't try and make out you are.

547
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,807
How do you know?

548
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:23,247
Because Charlie Carson's the butler
round here.

549
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,527
Does your business concern him?

550
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:30,247
It might do.

551
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,167
Excuse me for one moment, sir.

552
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:39,527
Fetch Mr Carson as fast as you can.

553
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:42,807
Use the front door.

554
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,647
If you would like to follow me, sir.
No, no.

555
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,487
If you think you're tucking me away
somewhere

556
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:52,167
you've got another think coming.

557
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,567
You'll be more comfortable, sir.
Sorry, chum.

558
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:04,607
Oh, aye,
I'll not mind waiting in here.

559
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,807
Bates?

560
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:20,007
This gentlemen is an acquaintance
of Mr Carson, m'lady.

561
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:22,207
What's he doing in here?

562
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,327
He says he has urgent business
with his lordship.

563
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:26,807
Urgent.

564
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:29,567
I've sent for Mr Carson to come
at once.

565
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,687
Then I'll stay with you.

566
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:34,127
In case explanations are needed.

567
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:36,327
(Thank you.)

568
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,807
Mr Carson!

569
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,687
You're needed at once
in the library.

570
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:45,367
How long are you expecting me
to wait?

571
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,527
I'm a very busy man, you know.

572
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:50,127
If you could just be patient
for a little longer, sir.

573
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:54,927
Oh.

574
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:58,407
May I ask who this is
and precisely what is going on?

575
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:00,327
Mr Bates, what are you...

576
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,287
Er...

577
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,047
I'm sorry, your lordship.

578
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,407
Mr Bates, you may go now.
Stay where you are.

579
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:08,967
Nobody's going anywhere.

580
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:10,407
Do I take it you know this man?

581
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:12,447
Don't try and deny it.

582
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,487
No, I won't deny it.

583
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:16,287
I do know him, my lord,

584
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:18,567
but not what he is doing
in the library.

585
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,967
I tried to take him downstairs
out of sight, Mr Carson.

586
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,007
Thank you, that was thoughtful.

587
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,887
But who is he?

588
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,767
Will you tell him, or shall I?

589
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,327
His name is Charles Grigg.

590
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:33,927
We worked together at one time.

591
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:37,087
Oh, I'm a little more than that,
aren't I, Charlie?

592
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,887
We're like brothers, him and me.
We are not like brothers.

593
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:45,127
We were a double act. On the halls.

594
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:48,247
You were on the stage?!

595
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,167
Carson, is this true?

596
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:53,367
It is, my lord.

597
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,447
The Cheerful Charlies,
that's what they called us.

598
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,527
We did quite well, didn't we?

599
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:02,247
Until you couldn't keep your hands
out of the till.

600
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,647
Would you like us to go, Mr Carson?
No.

601
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:06,767
You know it now.

602
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:09,567
You might as well bear witness
to my shame.

603
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:13,367
He turned up in the village
with no warning some days ago.

604
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,727
On the run. Asking for somewhere
to hide and, of course, for money.

605
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,087
God in heaven.

606
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:21,007
He is wanted for some petty crime,
of which he is, of course, guilty.

607
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:22,407
Here, steady on.

608
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:26,247
He threatened to expose my past,

609
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,447
to make me a laughing stock
in this house.

610
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:31,167
And in my vanity and pride,

611
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,287
I gave him what he wanted.

612
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:35,047
(SCOFFS) You did not!

613
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:38,767
I put him in an empty cottage
and fed him from the kitchens.

614
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:43,087
I couldn't buy food in the village -
it would raise to many questions.

615
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:46,167
I stole.

616
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,047
I'm a thief.

617
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,207
She...saw it.

618
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:55,647
I've never have said anything, Mr...
And now my disgrace is complete.

619
00:33:56,807 --> 00:34:00,167
My lord, you have my resignation.

620
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:03,047
Really, Carson, there's no need
to be quite so melodramatic.

621
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:04,927
You're not playing Sidney Carton.

622
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:08,047
So why have you come here

623
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,967
if he has done everything
you asked of him?

624
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,847
Because he hasn't.

625
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:15,447
He wouldn't give me any money.

626
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,167
If I had, how could I prevent
his returning to Downton

627
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,647
once it was spent?

628
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:21,607
(CLEARS THROAT)

629
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:23,567
My dear Mr Grigg...

630
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,687
Oh, it's nice to see
someone's got some manners.

631
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:27,407
Hold your tongue!

632
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:29,767
I'll tell you
what is going to happen.

633
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:33,207
When I have given you £20,
you will leave Downton immediately

634
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,127
and we will never set eyes on you
again.

635
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,007
I'll have to see about that.

636
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,927
If you return to this area,

637
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:43,367
I will personally ensure your
conviction for theft and blackmail.

638
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:46,527
Just a minute.
You will serve from five to 10 years

639
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,407
in His Majesty's custody.

640
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:51,967
You think you're such a big man,
don't you?

641
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:55,727
Just cos you're a lord, you think
you can do what you like with me.

642
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,647
I think it...

643
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,287
..because it is true.

644
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,607
You'll not always be in charge,
you know!

645
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:15,047
The day is coming when your lot
will have to tow the line

646
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,927
just like the rest of us!
Perhaps.

647
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:19,167
But happily for Carson,

648
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,287
that day has not come yet.

649
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:34,647
I..take it my resignation
has not been accepted.

650
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:39,487
My dear fellow, we all have chapters
we would rather keep unpublished.

651
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,527
To be honest, Carson...

652
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,727
..I'm rather impressed.

653
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,847
Did you really sing and dance
in front of an audience?

654
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,167
I did.

655
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,047
And do you ever miss it?

656
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:56,287
Not in the least, my lord.

657
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,127
Poor Mr Carson.

658
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:08,647
We'll have to treat him like a god
for a month to calm his nerves.

659
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:11,247
He'll be afraid this will change
the way we think of him.

660
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:13,287
Then we mustn't let it.
Oh, but it will.

661
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,367
The Cheerful Charlies?!

662
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:17,567
(CHUCKLES)

663
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,007
For all his talk of dignity,
we know his story now.

664
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,327
And admire him more because of it.
Maybe.

665
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:25,447
But it will change the way
we think of him. It always does.

666
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:27,647
I don't see why.

667
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:30,287
I shouldn't care what I found out
about you, whatever it was.

668
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,287
It wouldn't alter my opinion
one bit.

669
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:34,367
But it would. It certainly would.

670
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,607
VIOLET:
We're running out of options!

671
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:40,207
The lawyers I write to
only huff and puff.

672
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:44,647
They echo Murray
and say nothing can be done.

673
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:47,127
Or they don't want the bother
of opposing him.

674
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:49,087
Precisely.

675
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:54,407
I wish Mary wasn't so confident
it could all be put right.

676
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:57,687
Meanwhile, we have to watch
that dreadful woman

677
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:00,247
parade around the village
as if she owned it.

678
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:04,007
I think she means well.
Meaning well is not enough.

679
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:06,207
Poor Dr Clarkson.

680
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:09,847
What has he done to deserve
that termagant?

681
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:13,727
I think he's in for
an uncomfortable afternoon.

682
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:15,527
Really? Why?

683
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,527
On my way here,
I saw her go into the hospital.

684
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,927
She looked extremely determined.

685
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,927
Not as determined as I am.

686
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,967
I have the adrenalin here
in my hand.

687
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:30,207
Will you really deny the man
his chance of life?

688
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:34,327
I just wish it was a treatment
I was more familiar with.

689
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:36,327
Will that serve as your excuse
when he dies?

690
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:45,567
Nurse!

691
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:48,327
Will you prepare Mr Drake
for his procedure, please?

692
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,167
Well, Mrs Crawley,

693
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:56,527
I have a feeling
we will sink or swim together.

694
00:37:58,327 --> 00:38:01,727
Mr Drake, your heart
is not functioning properly.

695
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:04,847
And as a result, the pericardial sac
is full of fluid.

696
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,887
I am proposing first
to withdraw the fluid

697
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,847
and then to inject the adrenalin
to stimulate the heart

698
00:38:11,847 --> 00:38:13,487
and restore normal activity.

699
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:15,367
Is it dangerous, Doctor?

700
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:18,447
The draining may stop the heart.

701
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:21,367
And the adrenalin may not be able
to restart it.

702
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,647
Mrs Drake, the choice is simple.

703
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:27,607
If your husband endures
this procedure, he may life.

704
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:29,087
If not, he will die.

705
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:32,527
NURSE: He's with a patient.
VIOLET: No, let me pass!

706
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:35,567
I must see the doctor...at once!

707
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,207
Your ladyship.

708
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:38,767
It is just as I thought.

709
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,967
Doctor Clarkson,

710
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,407
tell me you will not permit
this amateur

711
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,607
to influence
your professional opinion.

712
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:49,687
Amateur?
My dear woman,

713
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:51,407
do not let them bully you.

714
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:54,487
They'll not disturb the peace
of your husband's last hours

715
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:56,527
if I can help it.

716
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:58,727
But that's just it, my lady.

717
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:01,287
I don't want them to be
his last hours.

718
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,687
Not if there's a chance.

719
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,647
Please, Doctor,

720
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,727
do what you must.

721
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,167
As...

722
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:26,287
(DRAKE GROANS)
Steady.

723
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:33,367
Yep, alright.

724
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,287
Nice and steady.

725
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:40,207
As President of this hospital,
I feel I must...

726
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:42,047
Valve.

727
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:50,047
..tell you...I shall bring this
to the attention of the board.

728
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:53,487
You're doing very well.

729
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,247
Have you no pity?

730
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:03,327
Adrenalin.

731
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:05,087
Quickly, quickly.

732
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:07,007
His heart's stopped.

733
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:09,327
(SOBS)

734
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:14,127
Ready?
Mm-hm.

735
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:23,927
Yes.
(GASPS)

736
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,567
Oh, John!

737
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:39,687
My dear.

738
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:47,887
You don't have to worry -

739
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:49,807
she may be President,
but I am the Patron

740
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:52,087
so you're quite safe with me.
Please.

741
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:56,407
My mother was right, then.
The man's life was saved.

742
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:59,607
Well, I like to think
we were both right.

743
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:03,127
But I'm not sure Lady Grantham
will be so easily convinced.

744
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,527
Then we must strengthen
the argument.

745
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:08,327
Cousin Isobel wants something to do?
Very well.

746
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:10,167
Let's make her
Chairman of the Board.

747
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,087
She'd like that, wouldn't she?
Certainly she would.

748
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:15,687
Then my mother
will have to listen to her.

749
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:17,767
She's been an absolute ruler there
for long enough.

750
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,647
It's time for some loyal opposition.

751
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:21,687
Well, if you're quite certain,
my lord.

752
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:25,327
What were you going to say?

753
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:27,527
Well, at the risk of
being impertinent,

754
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,847
on your own head be it.

755
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:33,327
(CHUCKLES)

756
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:37,407
About your scheme for restoring
the estate cottages.

757
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:39,567
You don't mind my interfering?

758
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:42,367
My dear fellow,
I brought you here to interfere.

759
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,167
In fact, why don't you stay
for dinner and we'll talk about it?

760
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,287
We'll send down to Molesley
for your clothes.

761
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,567
I better not.
My mother's expecting me.

762
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:52,727
In fact, I've been meaning
to speak to you about Molesley.

763
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,967
Oh?

764
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:58,767
Would you find me very ungrateful
if I dispensed with his services?

765
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,727
Why? Has he displeased you
in some way?

766
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:05,087
Not at all. It's simply that he's
superfluous to our style of living.

767
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,287
Is that quite fair?

768
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:10,207
To deprive a man of his livelihood
when he's done nothing wrong?

769
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:13,247
Well, I wouldn't quite put it...
Your mother derives satisfaction

770
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:16,007
from her work at the hospital,
I think, some sense of self-worth?

771
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:17,287
Well, certainly.

772
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:20,207
Would you really deny the same
to poor old Molesley?

773
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,807
And when you are master here,
is the butler to be dismissed,

774
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,247
or the footman?

775
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:27,047
How many maids or kitchen staff
will be allowed to stay?

776
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:28,927
Or must every one be driven out?

777
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:33,167
We all have different parts to play,
Matthew.

778
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:35,367
And we must all be allowed
to play them.

779
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,487
(BIRDSONG)

780
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:46,647
Why must we all go to the hospital?

781
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,527
I'm afraid Papa
wants to teach Granny a lesson.

782
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:53,287
Poor Granny. A month ago,
these people were strangers.

783
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,887
Now she must share power with
the mother and I must marry the son.

784
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:58,767
You won't marry him though,
will you?

785
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:01,487
What, marry a sea monster?
(LAUGHS)

786
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:03,527
We shouldn't laugh.
That's so unkind.

787
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:05,487
But he must marry someone.

788
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:09,127
Edith, what are you thinking?

789
00:43:09,127 --> 00:43:11,607
You know, I don't dislike him
as much as you do.

790
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:13,767
Perhaps you don't dislike him at all.

791
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:15,927
Perhaps I don't.

792
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,647
Well, it's nothing to me.
I've bigger fish to fry.

793
00:43:18,647 --> 00:43:21,967
What fish? Are we talking about E-N?

794
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,967
How do you know that? Have you been
poking around in my things?

795
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:26,967
Of course not.
Come on.

796
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,727
Who is he?
It's not fair if you both know.

797
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:32,407
You won't be any the wiser,
but his name is Evelyn Napier.

798
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:34,807
The Honourable Evelyn Napier.

799
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:36,967
Son and heir to Viscount Branksome.

800
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:40,247
Who wants an old sea monster
when they can have Perseus?

801
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:42,127
(KNOCKS)

802
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,487
If you're going to the ceremony,
I thought we might walk together.

803
00:43:46,487 --> 00:43:48,327
Certainly I'm going.

804
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:52,487
I want to see the old bat's face
when they announce it.

805
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:54,327
I must try not to look too cheerful.

806
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:58,247
Or shouldn't I talk like that
in your presence?

807
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:02,407
Do you find me very ridiculous,
Mrs Hughes?

808
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:05,007
Putting on airs and graces
I've no right to?

809
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:07,727
What's brought this on?

810
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,287
Nothing.

811
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:15,007
Except at times I wonder
if I'm just a sad old fool.

812
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,567
Mr Carson,

813
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:22,607
you are a man of integrity
and honour,

814
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:25,487
who raises the tone of this
household by being part of it.

815
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,087
So no more of that, please.

816
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:35,007
Come on! We mustn't be late!

817
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:37,447
I wondered if you'd like to
walk with me down to...

818
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:40,487
Is Thomas going?
Well, I think everyone is.

819
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:42,527
Sorry, what were you saying?

820
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:45,367
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

821
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:47,487
Put this away before you go.

822
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,367
And never mind your flirting!
I wasn't flirting. Not with him.

823
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,047
William's not a bad lad.

824
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:55,607
He's nice enough,
but he isn't like Thomas.

825
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:58,207
No, he's not.

826
00:45:01,207 --> 00:45:02,967
Cuff links, sir?

827
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:05,607
Those are a dull option
for such an occasion.

828
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:07,527
Don't you agree?

829
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:11,167
Might I suggest the crested pair,
sir?

830
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:14,127
They seem more appropriate,
if you don't mind me saying.

831
00:45:15,527 --> 00:45:17,727
Mm.

832
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:20,367
They're a bit fiddly.
I wonder if you could help me.

833
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:23,607
Certainly, sir.

834
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:49,087
Oh, I see you got that mark out of
the sleeve. How did you do it?

835
00:45:49,087 --> 00:45:52,367
I tried it with this and tried it
with that until it yielded.

836
00:45:53,647 --> 00:45:55,767
Very well done.

837
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:57,607
Thank you, sir.

838
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:05,007
You go in, Mrs Hughes. I want
a quick word with Mr Bates here.

839
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:06,887
Mr Bates.

840
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:10,887
Um...

841
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:12,687
I must thank you,

842
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,727
both for what you did
and for keeping silent afterwards.

843
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:18,447
It was kind of you, and Anna.

844
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:20,287
It was nothing, Mr Carson.

845
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:23,327
Well, I hope you don't judge me
too harshly.

846
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:26,367
I don't judge you at all. I have
no right to judge you, or any man.

847
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:43,607
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this happy event -

848
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:48,167
the investiture of our first
Chairwoman, Mrs Reginald Crawley,

849
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:52,607
who has graciously agreed to share
the duties of our beloved President,

850
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:55,447
the Dowager Countess of Grantham.

851
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:58,567
Our little hospital must surely grow
and thrive

852
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:02,207
with two such doughty champions
united as they are

853
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:06,367
by the strongest ties of all -
family and friendship.

(APPLAUSE)

855
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:14,407
Lady Mary Crawley, I presume.

856
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,167
Mary has more suitors tonight
than the Princess Aurora.

857
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,727
Is that one mine?

858
00:47:20,887 --> 00:47:23,327
I hope the day's living up to
your expectations.

859
00:47:23,327 --> 00:47:24,567
Exceeding them in every way.
