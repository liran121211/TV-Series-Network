Mr Crawley was his Lordship's cousin
and heir to the title.

Does this mean I'll have to go into

No. I mean with the other thing.

152

After all, it wasn't official.

153

If you're saying you do not wish
to mourn Patrick as a fiance,

154

knew about it outside the family.

in the attic

the summer and winter stuff.

I'll show you later.
What about studs and links?

160
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,080
Do I choose them or does he?

161
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,640
Lay them out unless he asks for
something in particular.

162

these for an ordinary dinner,

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
No, none of it's ours.

171
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,960
I can't believe I've been passed
over for Long John Silver.

172
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,320
You should have spoken up
when you had the chance.

173
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't make the same mistake
next time.

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,880
Who says there'll be a next time?

175
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,120
Is this a public holiday
no-one's told me of?

176
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,840
She was certainly reluctant
to go into mourning.

177
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,760
Well, she'll have to. We all will.

178
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,360
O'Brien's sorting out my black now

179
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,520
and I've told Anna to see what
the girls have that still fits.

180
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,280
Of course, this alters everything.

181
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,400
You won't try to deny it? You must
challenge the entail now, surely?

182
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,240
Can't we at least wait until we know
they're dead before we discuss it?

183
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,960
Don't talk as if I'm not
broken-hearted, because I am.

184
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Of course, I have never understood
why this estate must go

185
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,400
to whomever inherits your title.
My dear, I don't make the law.

186
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,320
What is it? The Dowager Countess
is in the drawing room.

187
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,960
I'll come now.
She asked for Lady Grantham.

188
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
I wonder what I've done wrong
this time.

189
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,720
And the new valet has arrived,
my Lord.

190
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Has he? Hm... Thank you, Carson.

191
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
(CLEARS THROAT)

192
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,560
What is it?

193
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,280
I'm not entirely sure that he will
prove equal to the task,

194
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,640
but your Lordship will be the judge
of that.

195
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,280
I'd better go.

196
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,920
Tell her about James and Patrick.
She won't have heard.

197
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
Of course I've heard!
Why else would I be here?

198
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,840
Robert didn't want you to read about
it in a newspaper and be upset.

199
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,400
He flatters me.
I'm tougher than I look.

200
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm very sorry about poor Patrick,
of course.

201
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,080
He was a nice boy.
We were all so fond of him.

202
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,800
But I never cared for James.

203
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,840
He was too like his mother and
a nastier woman never drew breath.

204
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
Will you stay for some luncheon?
Thank you.

205
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,400
I'll let Carson know.
I've already told him.

206
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
Shall we sit down?

207
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,360
Do you know the new heir?
Only that there is one.

208
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,400
He's Robert's third cousin
once removed.

209
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,720
I have never, to my knowledge,
set eyes on him.

210
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,680
Of course, if your late husband
hadn't forced me to sign
that absurd act of legal theft!

211
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,720
My dear, I didn't come here
to fight.

212
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,320
Lord Grantham wanted to protect
the estate.

213
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,840
It never occurred to him that you
wouldn't have a son. Well, I didn't.

214
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,800
No, you did not.

215
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,560
But when Patrick had married Mary

216
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,920
and your grandson been hailed
as master,

217
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,840
honour would have been satisfied.

218
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,160
Unfortunately, now...

219
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,640
Now a complete unknown has the right
to pocket my money,

220
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,600
along with the rest of the swag!

221
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,600
The problem is, saving your dowry
would break up the estate.

222
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,880
The problem is, saving your dowry
would break up the estate.

223
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
It would be the ruin of everything
Robert's given his life to.

224
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,280
And he knows this?
Well, if he doesn't, he will.

225
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,560
Then there's no answer.

226
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,800
Yes, there is,
and it's a simple one.

227
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,840
The entail must be smashed

228
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,760
in its entirety

229
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,160
and Mary recognised
as heiress of all.

230
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,440
There's nothing we can do
about the title.

231
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,040
No, she can't have the title.

232
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,720
But she can have your money...

233
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,560
and the estate.

234
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,800
I didn't run Downton for 30 years

235
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,040
to see it go, lock, stock and
barrel,

236
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,680
to a stranger from God knows where.

237
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
Are we to be friends, then?

238
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,840
We are allies, my dear.

239
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,800
Which can be a good deal
more effective.

240
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,320
Downton is a great house, Mr Bates,

241
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,520
and the Crawleys are a great family.

242
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
We live by certain standards

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,480
and those standards can at first
seem daunting. Of course.

244
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,080
If you find yourself tongue-tied
in the presence of his Lordship,

245
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,160
I can only assure you that his
manners and grace

246
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,240
will soon help you to perform your
duties to the best of your ability.

247
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,600
I know.

248
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,200
Bates! My dear fellow!

249
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,360
I do apologise. I should have
realised you'd all be at luncheon.

250
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,760
Not at all, my Lord.
Please, sit. Sit, everyone.

251
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,960
I just want to say a quick hello
to my old comrade-in-arms.

252
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,480
Bates, my dear man.
Welcome to Downton.

253
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,720
Thank you, sir.

254
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm so sorry to have disturbed
you all. Please forgive me.

255
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,400
You never asked.

256
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,300
Thomas, take that up!

257
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,620
Leave it, Daisy! He's a grown man.

258
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,060
I suppose he can lift a meat pie.

259
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,300
Now, put that apple tart
in the lower oven.

260
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,020
Oh, and take that away! Mr Lynch
shouldn't have left it there!

261
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,700
What is it?
Salt of sorrel.

262
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,380
I asked him for some to clean
the brass pots.

263
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,020
So, put it somewhere careful.
It's poison.

264
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,700
It seems like a lot of food, when
you think they're all in mourning.

265
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,740
Nothing makes you hungrier
or more tired than grief.

266
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,460
When my sister died,
God rest her soul,

267
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,940
I ate my way through four platefuls
of sandwiches at one sitting

268
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,340
and slept round the clock.
Did it make you feel better?

269
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,260
Not much, but it passed the time.

270
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,420
Oh, my Lord, what was this chopped
egg supposed to be sprinkled on?

271
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,380
Was it the chicken?
It was. Take it upstairs now.

272
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,300
I can't go in the dining room!
I should think not!

273
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,980
Find Thomas or William
and tell them what to do.

274
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,220
For heaven's sake, get a move on,
before they get back from church!

275
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,540
Well, we've given them a memorial
in London and a memorial here.

276
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,580
I prefer memorials to funerals.
They're less dispiriting.

277
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,540
We could hardly have held a funeral
without the bodies.

278
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,540
I gather they're putting up a stone

279
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,060
to mark those whose bodies
were never found.

280
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,620
In fact, I hear the Canadians are
making quite a thing

281
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,260
of the Titanic cemetery. I'm
surprised at the number they found.

282
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,300
You'd think the sea would have taken
more of them.

283
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,620
So, Murray, what have you to tell me
about the lucky Mr Crawley?

284
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,940
Nothing too terrible, I hope.

285
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,500
I've only made a few enquiries but,
no, there's not much to alarm you.

286
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Matthew Crawley is a solicitor,
based in Manchester. Manchester?

287
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,340
His special field is company law.

288
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,900
His mother is alive
and he lives with her.

289
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,220
His father, obviously, is not.
He was a doctor.

290
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,540
I know.

291
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,420
It does seem odd that my third
cousin should be a doctor.

292
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,500
There are worse professions.

293
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,380
Indeed.

294
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,100
(BUSY CHATTER)

295
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,580
Do me a favour. This must be
sprinkled on the chicken.

296
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,020
Isn't there more to go up?
Please! It won't take a moment!

297
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,340
Go on then, give it here.

298
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,660
We ought to talk about the business
of the entail.

299
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,180
As you know, on your death the heir
to the title inherits everything,

300
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,300
As you know, on your death the heir
to the title inherits everything,

301
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,940
except for the sums set aside for
your daughters and your widow.

302
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,260
Yes. Owing to the terms of
her settlement,

303
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,180
this will include the bulk of your
wife's fortune.

304
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,940
It has been our sole topic of
conversation

305
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,620
since the day the ship went down.

306
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,660
Of course, it must seem horribly
unjust to Lady Grantham,

307
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,500
but that is how the law stands.

308
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,380
Is there really no way to detach
her money from the estate?

309
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,900
Even to me, it seems absurd.

310
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,580
Your father tied the knots pretty
tight. I'd say it's unbreakable.

311
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,140
I see.

312
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,300
Really, Edith. Do you have to put on
such an exhibition?

313
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,380
She's not.

314
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,380
I was supposed to be engaged to him,
for heaven's sake, not you,

315
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,180
and I can control myself.
Then you should be ashamed.

316
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
Don't tell me you've not sent up
the egg yet!

317
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,620
Oh God, help me!
Please, God, help me!

318
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,340
What on earth's the matter?
Run upstairs to the dining room

319
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,460
and find William, I beg you!
I can't do it now.

320
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,500
You've got to!
I'll be hanged if you don't!

321
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,420
What?
WILLIAM: Daisy? Is that you?

322
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,980
Is it the chicken in a sauce
or the chicken with sliced oranges?

323
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,660
Oh, thank you, blessed and merciful
Lord! Thank you!

324
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,860
It's the chicken in the sauce.

325
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,740
I'll never do anything sinful again,
I swear it! Not till I die!

326
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,220
Mr Murray, how lovely to see you.
Do come in.

327
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,180
You're very kind, Lady Grantham,
but I must get back to London.

328
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,860
But you'll stay for luncheon?
Thank you, but no.

329
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,740
I'll eat on the train.

330
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,580
In fact, if you'd be so good as to
ask for the motor to be brought
round?

331
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,660
But didn't you want the afternoon
to talk things through?

332
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,020
I think we've said everything
we have to say, haven't we, my Lord?

333
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,940
For the time being, yes.
Thank you, Murray.

334
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,020
It's given me a good
deal to think about.

335
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,060
Mary, try to get everyone
into the dining room.

336
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,300
Edith, make sure old Lord Minterne
sits down.

337
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,580
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Mm-hm?

338
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,700
They've all gone?
They have, thank the Lord.

339
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,100
What about the lawyer?
He was the first away.

340
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,140
Didn't even stay for the luncheon.

341
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,660
I wish they'd make their minds up.

342
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,980
Gwen's put clean sheets
on the Blue Room bed.

343
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,140
Now she'll just have to strip it
again.

344
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,500
Can't you leave it
for the next guest?

345
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,780
Well, only if you don't tell.
(WRY CHUCKLE)

346
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,660
So, has it all been settled?

347
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,340
No, I don't know if anything's been
settled.

348
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,380
There's a fellow in Manchester with
claims to the title, I gather,

349
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,900
but it's all a long way
from settled.

350
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,100
You mustn't take it personally.

351
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,060
Oh, I do take it personally,
Mrs Hughes.

352
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,420
I can't stand by and watch our
family threatened

353
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,300
with the loss of all they hold dear.
They're not OUR family.

354
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,220
Well, they're all the family
I've got!

355
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,340
I beg your pardon.

356
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,580
Do you...ever wish
you'd gone another way?

357
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,380
Worked in a shop or a factory?

358
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,340
Had a wife and children?

359
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,260
Do you?

360
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,980
I don't know.

361
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,140
Maybe. Sometimes.

362
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,500
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

363
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,900
William's laid tea in the library,
but her Ladyship hasn't come down.

364
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,260
She'll be tired.
Take a tray up to her bedroom.

365
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,780
Is Thomas back?
Not yet, Mr Carson.

366
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,500
He asked if he could run down
the village. I didn't see why not.

367
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,300
It's iniquitous. They can't expect
you to sit by silent

368
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,500
as your fortune is stolen away.

369
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,980
Can't they?
His Lordship'd never let it happen.

370
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,540
How's Bates working out?
Well...

371
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,820
I don't like to say.

372
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,420
Only, it seems unkind to criticise
a man for an affliction, my Lady.

373
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,220
Even if it means he can't do his job.

374
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,500
How are you settling in?

375
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,180
Very well...I think. Unless your
Lordship feels differently.

376
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,380
No complaints?

377
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,980
If I had any, I should take them
to Mr Carson, my Lord, not you.

378
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,340
You're probably right.

379
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,900
And the house hasn't worn you out
with the endless stairs and so on?

380
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,140
I like the house, my Lord.
I like it as a place to work.

381
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,900
What happened?
It's only the old wound.

382
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,260
After I left the army, I had a spot
of bother

383
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,540
and just when I'd got through that,
about a year ago,

384
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,460
my knee started playing up.

385
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,900
A bit of shrapnel got left in
or something, and it moved.

386
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,580
But it's fine. It's not a problem.

387
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,340
And you'd let me know if you felt
it was all too much for you?

388
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,980
I would. But it won't be.

389
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,980
Thomas.

390
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,260
And where have you been?
The village.

391
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,980
To send a telegram,
if you must know.

392
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,860
Oh, pardon me for living.

393
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,900
Well, Murray didn't stay long.

394
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,980
Does her Ladyship know
how they left it? No.

395
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,420
They talked it all through
on the way back from the church.

396
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,500
If I was still his valet,
I'd get it out of him.

397
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,620
Bates won't say a word.

398
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,060
He will not.

399
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,020
I'd bet you a tanner he's a spy in
the other direction.

400
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,980
I wanted that job. We were all right
together, his Lordship and me.

401
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,820
Then be sure to get your foot in
the door when Bates is gone.

402
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,580
We can't get rid of him just because
he talks behind our backs.

403
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,020
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

404
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,140
Perhaps she misunderstood.

405
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,340
No, it was quite plain.

406
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,940
O'Brien told her Bates can't do
the job properly.

407
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,580
Why was he taken on?
Oh, he was Lord Grantham's batman

408
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,820
when he was fighting the Boers.
I know that, but even so!

409
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,740
I think it's romantic.
I don't!

410
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,620
How can a valet do his work
if he's lame?

411
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,820
He's not VERY lame.

412
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,660
There.
Anything else before I go down?

413
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,540
No. That's it. Thank you.

414
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,260
Oh, I hate black.

415
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,860
It's not for long.

416
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,420
Ma says we can go into
half-mourning next month,

417
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,820
and to colours by September.
Still a lot for a cousin.

418
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,340
But not a fiance.

419
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,460
He wasn't really a fiance...
No?

420
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,540
I thought that was what you call
a man you're going to marry.

421
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,940
I was only going to marry him
if nothing better turned up.

422
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,820
Mary, what a horrid thing to say!
Don't worry.

423
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,060
Edith would have taken him,
wouldn't you?

424
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,940
Yes. I'd have taken him.

425
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,860
If you'd given me the chance,
I'd have taken him like a shot.

426
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,260
I just think you should know
it's not working, Mr Carson.

427
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,740
Do you mean Mr Bates is lazy?

428
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,300
Not lazy, exactly.
But he just can't carry.

429
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,460
He can hardly manage his Lordship's
cases.

430
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,020
You saw how it was
when they went up to London.

431
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,860
He can't help with the guests'
luggage,

432
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,780
and as for waiting at table,
forget that.

433
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,740
And what do you want me to do?
It's not for me to say.

434
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,860
But is it fair on William
to have all the extra work?

435
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,980
I don't believe you'd like to think

436
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,340
the house was falling below
the way things ought to be.

437
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,100
I would not.
That's all I'm saying.

438
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,660
I'm going down. Coming?

439
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,380
In a moment. You go.

440
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,580
I know you're sad about Patrick,
whatever you say, I know it.

441
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,980
You're a darling.

442
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,020
But you see, I'm not as sad
as I should be.

443
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,420
And that's what makes me sad.

444
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,060
Thank you.
(DROPS BRUSH)

445
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,060
I'll do that.
No. No, thank you, my Lord.

446
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,980
I can do it.
I'm sure.

447
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,180
I hope so, my Lord.
I hope you are sure.

448
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,940
Bates, we have to be sensible.

449
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,060
I won't be doing you a favour in the
long run if it's too much for you.

450
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:34,100
Whatever we've been through,
it has to work.
Of course, sir. I mean, my Lord.

451
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,380
Whatever we've been through,
it has to work.
Of course, sir. I mean, my Lord.

452
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,340
Do you miss the army, Bates?
I miss a lot of things,

453
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,980
but you have to keep moving,
don't you?

454
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,900
Ha! You do, indeed.

455
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,780
I'll show you, my Lord. I promise.
I won't let you down.

456
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,700
We've managed so far, haven't we?

457
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,260
Yes, we have. Of course we have.

458
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,140
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

459
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,380
You look very nice.
Thank you, darling.

460
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Did Murray make matters clearer?
Yes, I'm afraid he did.

461
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,020
O'Brien says Bates is causing
a lot of awkwardness downstairs.

462
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,580
You may have to do something about
it. She's always making trouble.

463
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,660
Is that fair, when she hasn't
mentioned it before now?

464
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,900
I don't know why you listen to her.

465
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,460
It is quite eccentric, even for you,
to have a crippled valet.

466
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,100
Please, don't use that word.

467
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,060
Did he tell you he couldn't walk
when he made his application?

468
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,100
Don't exaggerate. Doesn't it strike
you as dishonest not to mention it?

469
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,300
I knew he'd been wounded.
You never said.

470
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,420
You know I don't care to talk about
all that.

471
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,940
I understand what it must be like,

472
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,180
to have fought alongside someone
in a war.

473
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,700
Oh, you understand that, do you?
Certainly I do.

474
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,900
You must form the most tremendous
bonds, even with a servant.

475
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,900
Really? Even with a servant?

476
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,060
Oh, Robert, don't catch me out.

477
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,700
I'm simply saying I fully see why
you want to help him. But?

478
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,780
But...is this the right way to employ
him for a job he can't do?

479
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,340
Is it any wonder if the others' noses
are put out?

480
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,500
I just want to give him a chance.

481
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,060
Mama, I'm sorry.
No-one told me you were here.

482
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,380
Oh dear, such a glare!

483
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,060
I feel as if I were on stage
at the Gaiety.

484
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,940
We're used to it.

485
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,220
I wish you'd let me install it in
the Dower House. It's so convenient.

486
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,460
The man who manages the generator
could look after yours as well. No.

487
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,420
I couldn't have electricity in
the house. I wouldn't sleep a wink.

488
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,700
All those vapours! Even Cora won't
have it in the bedrooms.

489
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,460
She did wonder about the kitchens -
I couldn't see the point.

490
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,860
Before anyone joins us, I'm glad of
this chance for a little talk.

491
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,620
I gather Murray was here today.
News travels fast.

492
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,420
Yes, I saw him, and he's not
optimistic

493
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,860
that there's anything we can do.
I refuse to believe it.

494
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,500
Be that as it may, it's a fact.

495
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,420
But to lose Cora's fortune...

496
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,180
Really, Mama.
You know as well as I do

497
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,300
that Cora's fortune is not
Cora's fortune any more!

498
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,820
Thanks to Papa,
it is now part of the estate

499
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,100
and the estate is entailed
to my heir!

500
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,740
That is it! That is all of it!

501
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,260
Robert, dear, I don't mean to sound
harsh... But I bet you will.

502
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,140
24 years ago you married Cora,
against my wishes, for her money.

503
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,500
Give it away now, and what was
the point of your peculiar marriage
in the first place?

504
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,580
If I were to tell you
she'd made me happy,

505
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,020
would that stretch belief?
It's not why you chose her.

506
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,500
Above all the other girls who could
have filled my shoes so easily...

507
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,300
If you must know, when I think of
my motives for pursuing Cora,

508
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,860
I'm ashamed. There's no need
to remind me of them.

509
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,580
Don't you care about Downton?

510
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,380
What do YOU think?

511
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,260
I've given my life to Downton.

512
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,620
I was born here
and I hope to die here.

513
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,780
I claim no career beyond the nurture
of this house and the estate.

514
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,340
It is my third parent
and my fourth child.

515
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,260
(EMOTIONAL) Do I care about it?
Yes, I do care!

516
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,220
I hope I don't hear sounds of
a disagreement.

517
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,500
Is that what they call discussion
in New York?

518
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,580
I'm glad you're fighting. I'm glad
somebody's putting up a fight.

519
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,500
You're not really fighting Granny?

520
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,060
Your grandmother merely wishes to do
the right thing. And so do I.

521
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,140
Your grandmother merely wishes to do
the right thing. And so do I.

522
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,980
Dinner is served, my Lady.

523
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,820
Does anyone else keep dreaming about
the Titanic?

524
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,820
I can't get it out of my mind.
Not again. Give it a rest.

525
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,860
Daisy, it's time to let it go.
But all them people,

526
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,860
freezing to death in the midnight,
icy water.

527
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,940
Oh, you sound like a penny dreadful.

528
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,420
I expect you saw worse things
in South Africa, eh, Mr Bates?

529
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,220
Not worse, but...pretty bad.

530
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Did you enjoy the war?
I don't think anyone enjoys war,

531
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,260
but there are some good memories too.
I'm sure there are.

532
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,900
Mr Bates, could you hand me
that tray?

533
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,940
Blast!
I'll do it.

534
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,100
The ladies are out.
We've given them coffee

535
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,580
and his Lordship's taken his port
to the library.

536
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,900
Anna, Gwen,
go up and help clear away.

537
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,700
Daisy, tell Mrs Patmore
we'll eat in 15 minutes.

538
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,340
I keep forgetting. Does this go
next door or back to the kitchen?

539
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,020
Those go back, but the dessert
service and all the glasses

540
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,220
stay in the upstairs pantry.
Put it on here.

541
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,340
What is it? Her Ladyship's told him
she thinks Mr Bates ought to go.

542
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,980
She said to me, 'If only his Lordship
had been content with Thomas.'

543
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Did she really?

544
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,420
What are you doing up here?
It's a free country.

545
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,740
Well, I'm going for my dinner.

546
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,020
You two can stay here...plotting.

547
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,980
So, the young Duke of Crowborough
is asking himself to stay.

548
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,340
So, the young Duke of Crowborough
is asking himself to stay.

549
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,580
And we know why.
You HOPE you know why.

550
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,940
That is not at all the same.

551
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,020
You realise the Duke thinks
Mary's prospects have altered?

552
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,420
I suppose so.
There's no 'suppose' about it.

553
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,820
Of course, this is exactly the sort
of opportunity

554
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,300
that will come to Mary,

555
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,740
if we can only get things settled
in her favour.

556
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,700
Is Robert coming round?
Not yet.

557
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,460
To him, the risk is, we'd succeed in
saving my money but not the estate.

558
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,100
He feels he'd be betraying his duty
if Downton were lost because of him.

559
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,180
Well, I'll write to Murray.
He won't say anything different.

560
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,220
Well, we have to start somewhere.
Our duty is to Mary.

561
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,340
Well, give him a date for when
Mary's out of mourning.

562
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,260
No-one wants to kiss a girl
in black.

563
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,780
Oh, do stop admiring yourself!

564
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,660
He's not marrying you for your looks.

565
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,100
That's if he wants to marry you
at all.

566
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,420
He will.

567
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,340
You look beautiful.
Thank you, Sybil.

568
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,180
(DOOR OPENS)
CORA: We should go down.

569
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,140
They'll be back from the station
at any moment.

570
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,620
Let's not gild the lily, dear.
(And Mary, try and look surprised.)

571
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,540
Are you all ready?

572
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,100
Very well.
We shall go out to greet them.

573
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,820
And me, Mr Carson?
No, Daisy, not you.

574
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,940
Can you manage, Mr Bates,
or would you rather wait here?

575
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,980
I want to go, Mr Carson.
There's no obligation
for the whole staff to go.

576
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,900
I'd like to be there.

577
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,980
Well, it's certainly a great day
for Downton

578
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,260
to welcome a duke under our roof.

579
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,180
Help me with the luggage.
Don't go running off.

580
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,620
I'll give you a hand.
I couldn't ask that, Mr Bates,

581
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,020
not in your condition.

582
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,300
How long do we have to put up
with this, Mr Carson, just so I know?

583
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,060
(DOG BARKS)

584
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,940
Welcome to Downton.

585
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,740
Lady Grantham,
this is so kind of you.

586
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,260
Not at all, Duke. We're delighted
you could spare the time.

587
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,780
You know my daughter Mary,
of course. Lady Mary.

588
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,540
And Edith. But I don't believe
you've met my youngest, Sybil.

589
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,980
Ah. Lady Sybil.
How do you do?

590
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,900
Come on in. You must be worn out.

591
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,100
Oh, Lady Grantham,
I have a confession to make
which I hope won't cause any bother.

592
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,380
My man was taken ill
just as I was leaving, so I...

593
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,420
Oh, well, that won't be a problem,
will it, Carson? Certainly not.

594
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,300
I shall look after his Grace myself.

595
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,340
Oh, no. I wouldn't dream of being
such a nuisance. Surely, a footman...

596
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,540
I remember this man.

597
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,060
You served me when I dined with
Lady Grantham in London.

598
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,700
I did, Your Grace.
Ah, there we are.

599
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,700
We shall do very well together,
won't we...? Thomas, your Grace.

600
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,620
Thomas...
Good.

601
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,580
I hope you had a pleasant journey.
Hm.

602
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,180
Bates, are you all right?
Perfectly, my Lord. I apologise.

603
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,780
Mr Bates.

604
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,180
That's better.
Please, don't feel sorry for me.

605
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,740
What shall we do?
What would YOU like to do?

606
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,060
I think I'd rather like to go
exploring.

607
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,740
Certainly. Gardens or house?

608
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,420
Oh, house, I think.
Gardens are all the same to me.

609
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,940
(POLITE CHUCKLE) Very well...

610
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,260
We can begin in the hall,
one of the oldest - No!

611
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,460
Not all those drawing rooms
and libraries.

612
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,420
Well, what, then?

613
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,900
I don't know...

614
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,780
The secret passages and the attics.

615
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,780
It seems a bit odd, but...why not?

616
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,660
I'll just tell Mama.
No, don't tell your mama.

617
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,260
But there's nothing wrong in it.
No, indeed.

618
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,180
I'm only worried the others
will want to join us.

619
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,060
Mary's settling him in.

620
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,980
Cora, don't let Mary
make a fool of herself.

621
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,100
By the way, I'll be going
up to London next week.

622
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,900
Do you want to open the house?

623
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,100
No, I'll just take Bates
and stay at the club.

624
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,340
I won't be more than a day or two.
I see.

625
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,500
Are things progressing?

626
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,260
What things?

627
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,900
It's just a regimental dinner.

628
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,220
It was a pity Bates spoiled
the arrival this afternoon.

629
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,020
He didn't spoil anything.
He fell over.

630
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,020
It was so undignified.
Carson hates that kind of thing.

631
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,300
I don't care what Carson thinks.
(CARSON CLEARS THROAT)

632
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,500
A message from the Dowager Countess,
my Lady.

633
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,140
She says she won't come to tea,
but she'll join you for dinner.

634
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,180
Look, Carson, I hope you weren't
embarrassed this afternoon.

635
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,420
I can assure you the Duke very much
appreciated his welcome. I'm glad.

636
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,540
Is Bates all right?
I think so, my Lord.

637
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,740
It must be so difficult for you,
all the same.

638
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,860
Don't stare.

639
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,420
Do you realise this is the first
time we've ever been alone?

640
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,820
Then you've forgotten when I pulled
you into the conservatory
at the Northbrooks'.

641
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,740
How sad.
No, I haven't.

642
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,660
It's not quite the same with 20
chaperones hiding behind every fern.

643
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,340
And are you pleased to be alone
with me, my Lady?

644
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,380
Oh, dear. If I answer truthfully,
you'll think me rather forward.

645
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,740
I don't think we should pry.
It feels rather...disrespectful.

646
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,060
Nonsense.
It's your father's house, isn't it?

647
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,220
You've a right to know what goes on
in it.

648
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,340
Where does this lead?
To the men's quarters,

649
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,500
with the lock on the women's side.

650
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Only Mrs Hughes is allowed
to turn it.

651
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,540
(TURNS DOOR HANDLE) Mrs Hughes...

652
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,420
and you.

653
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,940
In here?
A footman, I imagine.

654
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,980
Should you do that?
Why not?

655
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,260
I'm making a study on the genus
'footman'.

656
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,820
I seek to know the creature's ways.
(CHUCKLES)

657
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,700
(DOOR BANGS)
Someone's coming!

658
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,500
Can I help you, my Lady?
We were just exploring.

659
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,780
Did you want Thomas, your Grace?

660
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,500
No. As Lady Mary said,
we've just been exploring.

661
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,940
Would you care to explore my room,
my Lady?

662
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,420
Of course not, Bates.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

663
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,060
We were just going down.

664
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,420
Why did you apologise to that man?
It's not his business what we do.

665
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,940
I always apologise when I'm in
the wrong. It's a habit of mine.

666
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,660
The plain fact is, Mr Bates,
through no fault of his own,

667
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,700
is not able to fulfil
the extra duties expected of him.

668
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:09,060
He can't lift,
he can't serve at table,

669
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,740
he's dropping things
all over the place.

670
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,300
On a night like tonight,
he should act as a third footman.

671
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,100
As it is, my Lord, we may have to
have a maid in the dining room.

672
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,340
As it is, my Lord, we may have to
have a maid in the dining room.

673
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,460
Cheer up, Carson. There are worse
things happening in the world.

674
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,020
Not worse than a maid
serving a duke.

675
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,260
So you're quite determined?

676
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,900
It's a hard decision, your Lordship,
a very hard decision,

677
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,300
but the honour of Downton
is at stake.

678
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,980
Don't worry, Carson.

679
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,580
I know all about hard decisions when
it comes to the honour of Downton,

680
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,660
don't I, boy?

681
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,940
William, you mustn't let Thomas
take advantage.

682
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,100
He's only a footman, same as you.

683
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,820
It's all right, Mrs Hughes.

684
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,020
I like to keep busy.
Takes your mind off things.

685
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,260
What things have you got to take
your mind off?

686
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,300
If you're feeling homesick,
there's no shame in it.

687
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,380
No.

688
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,060
It means you come from a happy home.

689
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,140
There's plenty of people here
would envy that.

690
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,740
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

691
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,380
Will that be all, my Lord?
Yes.

692
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,340
That is, not exactly.

693
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,660
Have you recovered from your fall
this afternoon?

694
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,860
I'm very sorry about that, my Lord.

695
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,860
I don't know what happened.

696
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,780
The thing is, Bates.

697
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,020
I said I would give you a trial,
and I have.

698
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,860
If it were only up to me...

699
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,740
It's this question of a valet's
extra duties.

700
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,500
Waiting at table
when there's a large party?

701
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,740
That, and carrying things, and...

702
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,180
You see that Carson can't compromise
the efficiency of his staff?

703
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,580
I do, my Lord. Of course I do.

704
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,140
Might I make a suggestion?

705
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,020
That when an extra footman is
required,

706
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,740
the cost could come out of my wages.
Absolutely not. I can't allow that.

707
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,380
Because I am very eager to stay,
my Lord. Very eager, indeed.

708
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,900
I know you are. And I was eager
that this should work.

709
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,580
You see, it is unlikely that I shall
find another position.

710
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,340
But in a smaller house,
where less is expected of you...

711
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,820
It's not likely. I mean to help
until you find something.

712
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:48,940
It's not likely. I mean to help
until you find something.

713
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,820
I couldn't take your money, my Lord.
Just wages for a job done.

714
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,060
Very good, my Lord. I'll go at once.
Don't rush out into the night.

715
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,740
Take the London train tomorrow.
It leaves at nine.

716
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,660
You'll have a month's wages too.
That I insist on.

717
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,500
It's a bloody business, Bates,
but I can't see any way round it.

718
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,980
I quite understand, my Lord.

719
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,480
I'm afraid we're rather a female
party tonight, Duke.

720
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,760
But you know what it's like trying
to balance numbers in the country.

721
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,880
A single man outranks
the Holy Grail!

722
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,040
No, I'm terribly flattered
to be dining en famille.

723
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,680
What were you and Mary doing
in the attics this afternoon?

724
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,760
I expect Mary was showing the Duke
the house, weren't you?

725
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,360
Are you a student of architecture?
Absolutely.

726
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,760
Then I do hope you'll come
and inspect my little cottage.

727
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,360
It was designed by Wren
for the first Earl's sister.

728
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,600
The attics?
Yes.

729
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,440
Mary took the Duke up to the attics.

730
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,720
Whatever for?

731
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,760
Why was this, dear?
We were just looking around.

732
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,400
Looking around? What is there
to look at but servants' rooms?

733
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,080
What was the real reason?
Don't be such a chatterbox, Edith!

734
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:29,120
What was the real reason?
Don't be such a chatterbox, Edith!

735
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,600
I think we'll go through.
I still don't understand.

736
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,760
Will you hold your tongue?

737
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,760
How long do you think they'll be?
I'm starving.

738
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,200
Have you settled the ladies?
Yes, Mr Carson.

739
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,560
Then it won't be long
once they go through.

740
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,680
Do you think he'll speak out?

741
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Do you think we'll have a duchess
to wait on? Imagine that!

742
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,040
You won't be waiting on her!

743
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,160
There is no reason why the eldest
daughter and heiress of the Earl

744
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,880
should not wear a duchess's coronet
with honour.

745
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,840
Heiress, Mr Carson?
Has it been decided?

746
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,520
It will be,
if there's any justice in the world.

747
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,680
Well, we'll know soon enough.

748
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,200
What are you doing, Anna?

749
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,720
I thought I'd take something
up to Mr Bates,

750
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,400
him not being well enough
to come down.

751
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,440
You don't mind, do you, Mrs Hughes?
I don't mind.

752
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,120
Not this once.
No, take him whatever he might need.

753
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,960
Mr Bates is leaving without a stain
on his character.

754
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,040
I hope you all observe that
in the manner of your parting.

755
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,520
I don't see why he has to go.
I don't mind doing extra -

756
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,440
It's not up to you.

757
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,560
I'll take care of his Lordship,
shall I?

758
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,280
Not while you're looking after
the Duke, you won't.

759
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,120
I'll see to his Lordship myself.

760
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,040
(MUFFLED CRYING AND SNIFFLING)

761
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,800
Mr Bates?

762
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,440
Are you there?

763
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,680
I brought something up,
in case you were hungry.

764
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,680
That's very kind.

765
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
I'm ever so sorry you're going.

766
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,400
I'll be all right.

767
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,280
Of course you will.

768
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,640
There's always a place for a man
like you.

769
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,840
Oh, yes...

770
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Something'll turn up.

771
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,080
Tell us...when you're fixed.

772
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,840
Just...drop us a line.

773
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,920
Else I'll worry.

774
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,480
Well, we can't have that.

775
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,320
(SNIFFS)

776
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,240
We must go and let the servants
get in here.

777
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,280
I'd be grateful if we can stay
a minute more.

778
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,160
I have something to ask you.

779
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:04,440
I was terribly sorry to hear about
your cousins. You said.

780
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,760
Did you know them? Not well. I used
to see Patrick at the odd thing.

781
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,080
I imagine it will mean
some adjustments for you all.

782
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,960
To lose two heirs in one night
is terrible.

783
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,200
To lose two heirs in one night
is terrible.

784
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,680
Indeed. It was terrible.
Awful.

785
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,280
But then again, it's an ill wind...

786
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,200
At least Lady Mary's prospects
must have rather improved.

787
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,720
Have they?

788
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,920
Haven't they?

789
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,440
I will not be coy and pretend I do
not understand your meaning,

790
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,840
though you seem very informed
on this family's private affairs.

791
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,120
But you ought perhaps to know that
I do not intend to fight the entail,

792
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,000
not any part of it.

793
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,760
You can't be serious.

794
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,600
It pains me to say it, but I am.

795
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,680
You'll give up your entire estate,

796
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,880
your wife's money into the bargain,
to a perfect stranger?

797
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,160
You won't even put up a fight?

798
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,000
I hope he proves to be perfect,
but I rather doubt it.

799
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,440
Ah...

800
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
Very odd thing to joke about.

801
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,320
No odder than this conversation.

802
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,360
So, there you have it.

803
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,440
But Mary will still have
her settlement,

804
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,000
which you won't find ungenerous.
(COUGHS) I-I'm sorry?

805
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,240
I only meant that her portion,

806
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,160
when she marries,
will be more than respectable.

807
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,840
You'll be pleased, I promise you.
Oh, heavens.

808
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,960
I hope I haven't given the wrong
impression.

809

You know the -
My dear Lord Grantham -

810
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,040
Don't 'My dear Lord Grantham' me!

811
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,160
You knew what you were doing
when you came here.

812
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,800
You encouraged Mary, all of us,
to think -

813
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,960
Forgive me, but I came to express
my sympathies and my friendship,

814
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,600
nothing more.

will be a lucky man.

He will not, however, be me.

I see. And what was it that you asked
me to stay behind to hear?

room?

822
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,480
I-I'm tired.
I think I'll just slip away.

823
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,760
Please make my excuses.

824
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,920
I'm afraid I've worn you out.

825
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,840
Tomorrow, we can just -
I'm leaving in the morning.

826
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,760
Good night.

827
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,520
Oh, you might tell that footman...
Thomas. Thomas.

828
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,200
You might tell him I've gone up.

829
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,000
So he slipped the hook.

830
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,880
At least I'M not fishing
with no bait!

831
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,420
I don't believe that!

832
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,740
Well, believe what you like.

833
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,260
He won't break the entail.

834
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,940
The unknown cousin gets everything

835
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,500
and Mary's inheritance will be
the same as it always was.

836
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,260
How was I to know?
When the lawyer -

837
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,740
You weren't to. You did the right
thing to telegraph me.

838
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,660
It's just not going to come off.
So what now?

839
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,500
Well, you, you know how I'm fixed.

840
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,180
I have to have an heiress - if it
means going to New York to find one.

841
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,500
What about me?

842
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,300
You...You will wish me well.

843
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,660
You said you'd find me a job
if I wanted to leave.

844
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,540
And do you?

845
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,940
I want to be a valet.
I'm sick of being a footman.

846
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,340
Thomas, I don't need a valet.

847
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,380
I thought you were getting rid of
the new one here. I've done it,

848
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,180
but I'm not sure Carson's going to
let ME take over.

849
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,060
I want to be with you.

850
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,620
I just can't see it working,
can you?

851
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,420
We don't have the basis of a
servant-master relationship, do we?

852
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,900
You came here to be with ME!
Among other reasons.

853
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,700
And...one swallow
doesn't make a summer.

854
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,140
Aren't you forgetting something?
What?

855
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,180
Are you threatening me?

856
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,100
Because of a youthful dalliance?

857
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,180
A few weeks of madness
in a London Season?

858
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,140
You wouldn't hold that against me,
surely? I would if I have to.

859
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,620
And who'd believe a greedy footman
over the words of a Duke?

860
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,820
If you're not careful,
you'll end up behind bars.

861
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,460
I've got proof.

862
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,300
Hm...

863
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,700
Do you mean these?

864
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,100
You know,
my mother's always telling me,
never put anything in writing.

865
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,380
And now, thanks to you,
I never will again.

866
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,420
How did you get them, you bastard?

867
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,580
No need to be a bad loser, Thomas.
Go to bed.

868
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,180
Unless you want to stay?

869
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,900
(DEEP BREATH)

870
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,340
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

871
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,540
I think I'll turn in.

872
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,820
No big announcement, then?

873
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,540
No, nor likely to be.
He's off on the nine o'clock train.

874
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,260
He never is?

875
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,980
And when we've had a turkey killed
for tomorrow's dinner!

876
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:24,220
I wonder what she did wrong.
She did nothing wrong,

877
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,220
not from the way his Lordship was
talking.

878
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,660
So his Grace turned out to be
graceless! Hm!

879
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,900
Good night, Mrs Hughes.
Goodnight, Mr Carson.

880
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,980
(DOOR SHUTS)

881
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,860
If you knew that was your decision,
why put Mary through it?

882
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,780
But I didn't know it was my decision,
my final decision, until tonight.

883
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,180
But I find I cannot ruin the estate
or hollow out the title

884
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,980
for the sake of Mary,
even with a better man than that.

885
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,300
I try to understand. I just can't.

886
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,540
Why should you? Downton is in
my blood and in my bones,
it's not in yours.

887
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,620
And I can no more be the cause of
its destruction

888
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,820
than I could betray my country.

889
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,740
Besides, how was I to know he
wouldn't take her without the money?

890
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,100
Don't pretend to be a child
because it suits you.

891
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,780
Do you think she would have been
happy, with a fortune hunter?

892
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,460
She might have been. I was!

893
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,860
Have you been happy? Really?

894
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,420
Have I made you happy?
Yes.

895
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,860
That is,
since you fell in love with me,

896
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,860
which if I remember correctly was
about a year after we were married.

897
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,820
Not a year. Not as long as that.

898
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,540
But it wouldn't have happened
for Mary. Why not?

899
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,820
Because I am so much nicer
than the Duke of Crowborough.

900
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,180
I'll be the judge of that.

901
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,980
Just don't think I'm going
to let it rest, Robert.

902
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,700
I haven't given up, by any means.

903
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:02,900
I must do what my conscience
tells me. And so must I.

904
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,220
And I don't want you to think
I'll let it rest.

905

(BIRDSONG)

906
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,420
my Lord, would it be acceptable for
Bates to ride in front with Taylor?

907
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,540
Otherwise it means getting
the other car out.

908
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,740
He and his Grace are catching
the same train.

909
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,780
Perfectly acceptable.

910
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,220
And if his Grace doesn't like it,
he can lump it.

911
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,060
You've been so kind, Lady Grantham.
Thank you.

912
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,940
Goodbye, Duke.

913
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,620
You'll make my farewells
to your delightful daughters?

914
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,900
They'd have been down
if they'd known.

915
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,100
Alas, something's come up which has
taken me quite by surprise.

916
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,100
Obviously.

917
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,700
Grantham, this has been
a highly enjoyable interlude.

918
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,900
Has it? And I feared it had proved
a disappointment.

919
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,580
Not at all, not at all.

920
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,820
My stay in your house
has driven away my cares.

921
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,420
We ought to go, my Lord,
if His Grace is to catch the train.

922
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,700
Goodbye, Bates. And good luck.

923
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,940
Good luck to YOU, my Lord.

924
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,660

925
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,180
Wait!

926
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,180
Get out, Bates.

927
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,060
THE DUKE: I really mustn't be late.

928
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,180
Get back inside
and we'll say no more about it.

929

(MOTOR CAR DRIVES OFF)

930
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,180
It wasn't right, Carson.

931
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,060
I just didn't think it was right.

932
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,220
First post, Ma'am.
Thank you, Ellen.

933
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,700
One for you.
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

934
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,540
It's from Lord Grantham.
Really?

935
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,380
What on earth does he want?

936
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,380
He wants to change our lives.

937
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,660
Welcome to Downton.

938
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,060
Why are you so against him?
He isn't one of us.

939
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,420
I stole. I'm a thief.
You have my resignation.

940
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,380
For once in your life,
will you please just listen?

941
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,700
No-one can foresee the future,
Doctor. Not we

942
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,900
and certainly not Mrs Crawley.

943
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,460
Oh, no. You're far too busy,
and I wouldn't want to push in.
