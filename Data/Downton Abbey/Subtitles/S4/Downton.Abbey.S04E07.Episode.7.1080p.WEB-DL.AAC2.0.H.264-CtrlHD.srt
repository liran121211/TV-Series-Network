2
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,947
His lordship is going to America.

3
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:16,660
What are you talking about?
A telegram has just arrived.

4
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:21,331
He's leaving today. Something's
happened to her ladyship's brother.

5
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,625
So, you mean you have to go, too?

6
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,212
I can't leave Anna, Mrs Hughes.
Not now.

7
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,757
How can she put me in this position?
It's not fair!

8
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,719
I agree.
But, why does your mother need me?

9
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,554
"Robert must be there. " Why?

10
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,556
My being there won't
make a difference.

11
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:39,266
They obviously feel it will.

12
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:43,645
Maybe they don't want the Committee
to think Harold's a wildcat driller.

13
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:46,398
An earl as a brother-in-law
will make him respectable?

14
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,358
They seem to believe so.

15
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,196
I know plenty of relatives of
English earls who belong in jail!

16
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,158
I suppose we've made the decision.

17
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,578
I can't stop his lordship from going.
Of course not.

18
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,415
But, I wonder if it's necessary
for Mr Bates to go with him.

19
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:07,544
It'll be very hard for Anna
to lose his support at this time.

20
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,547
Mrs Hughes,
I hope we are good employers,

21
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,675
but even we expect
to get what we pay for.

22
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,345
Bates is in this house
as his lordship's valet.

23
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:21,059
I know that, m'lady,
but this is a special circumstance.

24
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,228
Why, particularly?

25
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,607
It's not my secret to tell.

26
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:32,820
If you wish to enlist my help,
I must know the facts.

27
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,617
I won't go.

28
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:42,537
I see, so you'll leave
his lordship in the lurch,

29
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,334
and probably lose your job,
and all this to help me?

30
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,380
Go home and pack.

31
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,019
You are asking me
to travel without a valet?

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,355
I'm asking you not to take Bates.

33
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,774
You do know the Americans
have a correct uniform

34
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,943
for practically every
activity known to man?

35
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:15,696
Thomas was your valet the whole time
Bates was in prison.

36
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,824
He knows how you like things done.
Suppose he doesn't want to go?

37
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,993
Why wouldn't he? It's an adventure.

38
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:23,954
All those handsome stewards
strutting down the boat deck.

39
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,707
Don't be vulgar.
What do you know of such matters?

40
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,626
I've been married.
I know everything.

41
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,129
But if you could just explain
why Bates can't come?

42
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,881
I can't explain it.

43
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,427
If I could, you would agree with me.

44
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,224
I found this for the shoes, m'lord.

45
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,935
I'm afraid it seems you won't
be coming with me, Bates.

46
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,021
Thomas has been selected
as your deputy.

47
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:50,355
What?

48
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,191
Lady Mary persuaded me
you are more needed here,

49
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,693
though why I couldn't tell you.

50
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:56,612
I'd better get on.

51
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:59,365
Your grandmother will arrive shortly.

52
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,957
What have they told you?

53
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,961
That Anna was...

54
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,090
.. 'attacked' by some ruffian
who'd broken in.

55
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,471
While I sat upstairs,
enjoying the music.

56
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,724
It's not your fault, Bates.

57
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:29,604
It wasn't hers, but it wasn't yours.

58
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,277
Thank you.

59
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,821
I thought I'd come
to wish Lord Grantham

60
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,949
good luck on his journey.

61
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,327
He's upstairs getting ready, m'lady.
Everyone else is in the library.

62
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,371
Oh, Rose, my dear...

63
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,582
I wonder, I wonder if I might
please have a glass of water?

64
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,709
Thank you.

65
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,712
Judging how things are
going, he can manage very well.

66
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:59,132
Oh? Are we disturbing the conclave?

67
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,968
We're just discussing the pigs.

68
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,846
Ah, the arrival of the pigs
and the departure of their master.

69
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,140
It's sad Lord Grantham
has to miss it.

70
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,185
Are the pigs a good idea, Mr Blake?

71
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,397
It's a good idea for estates
to maximise and diversify.

72
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,566
The question is whether or not
Lord Grantham and Lady Mary

73
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:18,777
fully appreciate what
they're taking on.

74
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:22,197
Oh? You ask as if the answer were no.

75
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,574
Mr Blake is not under Mary's spell.

76
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,451
Oh?

77
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:27,661
Mrs Crawley.

78
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,997
Morning. Good morning.

79
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,541
Your water, m'lady.
Thank you, Carson.

80
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,210
Are you feeling hot? I am.

81
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,922
I've just walked up
from the village.

82
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:43,302
I am a bit hot, but I didn't walk.

83
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,512
I envy you.

84
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:48,348
Well, I'm not sorry. I can say that.

85
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,060
How do you know you'll get a ship?
There's always empty cabins.

86
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,688
Sure we'll find something.
Oh, I wish it were me.

87
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,898
Wouldn't you miss Ivy?

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,027
Nothing's gonna come of that.
It were a waste of money and effort.

89
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,362
I'm sure something's
around the corner.

90
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,240
I wish it'd get a move on
or I might do something stupid.

91
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:09,202
Ha! Well, when I get back,
I want to find you happy and healthy

92
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,455
and courting a girl
from the village.

93
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,915
Come on, let's go up.
You can wish me luck.

94
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:17,586
Darling, I do think your going to
rescue my hopeless brother

95
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,464
is an act of real love,
and I cherish you for it.

96
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:24,134
That'll keep me warm
as I cross the raging seas.

97
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,763
Good. Now, kiss me.

98
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,653
Lady Grantham says we can stay
'til we're done.

99
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:45,238
But, it'll be a few weeks more.
I hope you don't mind.

100
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,492
Not if you make yourselves useful.
We will.

101
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,329
Try to be strong, my darling.
I will.

102
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,289
Gregson must be out there somewhere.

103
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,668
I wish you'd let me send a detective.
There's no point.

104
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,337
His firm's already done all that
to no avail.

105
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,130
If there's anything
you want us to do,

106
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,259
Mama will give you whatever you need.

107
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,013
Goodbye, Mama.
Goodbye, my dear.

108
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:13,100
Try not to let those Yankees
drive you mad.

109
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,394
Mary? Why so preoccupied?

110
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,772
Am I? I'm afraid my mind
is on other things.

111
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:22,609
Anyway, goodbye, Papa,
and please try to enjoy yourself.

112
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,778
Good luck with the pigs.

113
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,531
Rose, I leave you in charge of fun.

114
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,283
Mission understood, Captain.

115
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,243
Goodbye, Isobel.

116
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,577
Bye, Tom.

117
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,038
Look after all my womenfolk,
including Isis.

118
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,625
Especially Isis.
I'll try my best.

119
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,922
Goodbye, Miss Baxter. I look forward
to a full report when I get back.

120
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,217
Why am I going instead of Mr Bates?

121
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:48,635
I don't know.

122
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:52,181
No, but that's what
you're going to find out.

123
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:16,872
Oh... Well, that's a relief.

124
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,206
Is it?

125
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,751
Yes, I'm... I'm feeling rather ill.

126
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:24,254
I wanted him away before I keel over.

127
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:27,341
I am sorry. Would you like me
to come back with you?

128
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:30,469
That is the very last thing
I would want.

129
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,931
Oh, Carson, can I have a car please,
to take me home?

130
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,684
Certainly, your ladyship...
Yes, now.

131
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,646
Thank you for seeing him off.
Evelyn wanted to.

132
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:42,940
But, now we must go
or we'll be late.

133
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:46,069
Is it just lack of money,
why these places are all failing?

134
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:50,697
Usually. But, why is that?

135
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,784
Because so few owners make the most
of what an estate has to offer.

136
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:56,161
So few think about income.

137
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,872
So few are ready to
adjust their way of life.

138
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,625
You have to understand
what these people are used to.

139
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,795
No. They have to get used to
something different.

140
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,089
They think nothing needs to change.

141
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,675
That God will be upset
if the old order is overturned.

142
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:12,469
And you don't think He will be?
No.

143
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,056
To farm an estate is hard work,
and never more than now.

144
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,058
The owners must face up to that,

145
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,519
or they don't deserve
to keep what they have.

146
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,937
You look very intense.

147
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:25,315
Mr Blake was saying he finds
people like you and me infuriating.

148
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,236
I should point out...
We must get going or we'll be late.

149
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:38,704
It's nice of you to drive me home.
I'm meeting the new pig man.

150
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:43,542
I do worry about your life away
from the estate. Is there any?

151
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,502
Huh, I've no time.

152
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:48,338
What happened to your politics?

153
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,510
They vanished. Along with that
silly chauffeur chap named Branson.

154
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,972
I don't believe that.

155
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:58,807
I gather the MP, John Ward,

156
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:02,519
is coming to speak in Ripon tomorrow
at the Town Hall.

157
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,563
I could get tickets.

158
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,565
I don't think so.

159
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:09,192
I'm not a fan of the Coalition,
as it is.

160
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,321
He's only here because Lloyd George
thinks an election's coming.

161
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:14,781
Well, I doubt he has long, poor dear.

162
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,284
But, I don't think
you're being fair to Mr Ward.

163
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,411
Let's go. What do you say?

164
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,747
I'd say you better be nice to me,

165
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:26,586
or I'll tell old Lady Grantham you
called Lloyd George "poor dear. "

166
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:40,042
Well, they've pieced together
a little more.

167
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:46,130
He arrived in Munich
and signed into his hotel.

168
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:50,343
Then, that evening,
he went out and never came back.

169
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:55,140
But, it doesn't make any sense.
What was his reason for being there?

170
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,685
To see the castles of King Ludwig.

171
00:10:58,686 --> 00:11:01,771
But darling, surely if he was
attacked or set upon,

172
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:03,607
they would have found him long ago?

173
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,320
Oh, my dearest one, come here.

174
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:17,996
I don't ask you not to worry,
only not quite to give up hope.

175
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:22,125
Of course you must go up to London.
It would do you good.

176
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:25,296
Mama, can I ask you something?

177
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:31,384
You don't think I'm bad, do you?

178
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:34,304
You can be a bit sharp-tongued
every now and then!

179
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:36,932
But, bad? No.

180
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:40,643
Sometimes I have bad feelings.

181
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:43,314
We all have bad feelings.

182
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,693
It's ACTING on them
that makes you bad.

183
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,744
I've had a letter from Alfred.

184
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,288
What's he got to say for himself?
He's doing well.

185
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:03,708
Some French chap with a name
I can't pronounce,

186
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,919
seems to have taken a shine to him.

187
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,504
I don't think we need praise
from the French quite yet.

188
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:10,298
Does he mention us?

189
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,259
Er, his father's ill
so he's coming up to visit.

190
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,220
He hopes to look in on his way home
to see us all.

191
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:18,097
Really? Why should you care?

192
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:21,685
She thinks it'd be nice to see him,
Daisy, and so it would be.

193
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,942
Rose? What is it?

194
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:33,071
I saw Edith on the stairs. She says
she's going to London tomorrow.

195
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:35,573
So, I wondered if I could go, too.

196
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:39,035
Rose, in a few months you'll have
been presented, you'll be out.

197
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:40,703
Everything will be possible.

198
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:43,957
You said most girls of my age
would already be presented.

199
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,459
Why do you want to go?

200
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,255
Just to see some old friends
you'd approve of madly.

201
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:54,385
Edith's so worried about Mr Gregson.
Maybe I could cheer her up.

202
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:58,472
Cousin Robert did leave me
in charge of fun!

203
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,519
Why is he always so superior?

204
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,772
He's frustrated by all the families
who are giving in.

205
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:11,067
The axe falls
and they do nothing to fight back.

206
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:13,361
But if they can't afford to go on?

207
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:16,864
They could if they'd take a new
approach to their inheritance,

208
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:20,827
instead of watching it being
carted away in boxes to be sold.

209
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:23,496
He can't think we're doing that.
Well, no.

210
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:26,082
But, he doubts you'd fight
if it came to it.

211
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:31,463
He says you're aloof. Aloof?

212
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:37,010
Well, I hope you've stuck up for me.
Of course I did, but, well...

213
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:38,888
Go on.

214
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,559
Charles thinks I'm blind
where you're concerned.

215
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,981
We should go in.

216
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:01,326
Has anyone told Mr Carson
that tea's ready?

217
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:04,287
There was a telegram earlier.
He took it up to her ladyship.

218
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,331
That means they've got the boat.

219
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:09,918
What a bonus for Mr Barrow.
A trip to America out of the blue.

220
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,713
I wouldn't fancy it,
all steaks and ketchup

221
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:15,840
and 'hail fellow, well met'.

222
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:19,011
What do you know about it?
I go to the pictures too, you know!

223
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,681
His lordship has secured passage
on the Cameronia.

224
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:26,392
They sail tomorrow and they'll
be in New York on Monday.

225
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:28,686
It's hard to credit, isn't it?

226
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:31,231
I've robbed you of such a chance.

227
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:34,359
You've robbed me of nothing
I wouldn't gladly give.

228
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,320
What did Mr Barrow mean about
expecting a report?

229
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,323
Something and nothing.

230
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:49,707
Are you still awake?

231
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,670
I was on my way to bed and something
told me to put on my coat

232
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:55,380
and walk over and check on you.

233
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:57,174
I hope you don't...

234
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,847
How long have you been like this?

235
00:15:04,848 --> 00:15:07,642
I really don't feel well at all.

236
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:11,521
Right. I'm going now to fetch
Doctor Clarkson...

237
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:13,856
No, it's too late. It's too late!

238
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:16,818
I'll be back as soon as I can.
No fuss. Please.

239
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,990
Try and drink. I'll send your maid up
with some tea and some more water.

240
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:26,160
How was dinner?

241
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:29,289
Uphill. I'm so bored with
Mr Blake's cold shoulder.

242
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,249
He hasn't warmed up, then?

243
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,669
According to Mr Napier,
he finds me aloof.

244
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,963
I'm not aloof, am I?

245
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:40,593
Do you want me to answer truthfully
or like a lady's maid?

246
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:42,845
Let's move on.

247
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:54,480
I heard you persuaded his lordship
to let Mr Bates stay here

248
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:56,775
and I'm so very grateful.

249
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:01,405
Then, you know Mrs Hughes
asked me to intervene...

250
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:05,325
.. and told me why.

251
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:07,744
Yes. So she said.

252
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:10,456
We still can't find out who he was?

253
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:13,416
No.

254
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,628
He was a stranger, a...

255
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:20,132
I don't know, a robber, but after...

256
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:25,303
Afterwards, he just ran off.

257
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:27,389
But, if you described him?

258
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:32,310
And ought you to see
Doctor Clarkson,

259
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:34,437
just to make sure?

260
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:36,524
M'lady, I...

261
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:40,735
I don't mind your knowing.

262
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:44,572
In fact, I'm glad in a way that
there's honesty between us again but,

263
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:46,908
but I can't talk about it.

264
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:50,412
Even to me? Because I want to help.

265
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:54,832
You've helped me,
God knows, in the past,

266
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,877
and now I want to help you.

267
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:00,923
I can't talk about it, m'lady.

268
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,343
Not even to you.

269
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,557
That's it. I should be in bed.

270
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,938
Before you go, I'm worried about
Alfred coming back quite so soon.

271
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,525
I thought you liked the lad?
Oh, I do. Very much.

272
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:23,069
But, we've had such trouble
with Ivy and Daisy.

273
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,905
We don't want it stirred up again.

274
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,074
Can we put him off, just this once?

275
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:31,536
I don't think I've got his
parents' address, if I ever had it.

276
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:33,788
It's a shame.

277
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,750
We're to end by mithering again.
Oh!

278
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:45,842
She was a bit ill this morning,
but I thought it was just influenza.

279
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:48,970
This was never 'flu.
It looks like bronchitis.

280
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:53,099
But there is a lot of 'flu about and
my nurses are run off their feet.

281
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,811
I won't be able to spare...
I can do whatever needs to be done.

282
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,771
She'll need proper supervision,

283
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:01,733
otherwise there's a real danger it
could turn into pneumonia.

284
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:04,485
We'll have to hire someone...
No. I can manage.

285
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:08,448
There'll be no let up.
I know. What's the treatment?

286
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:11,284
Inhalants, really.
I'll bring some in the morning.

287
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:13,661
The main thing is to keep
her temperature down

288
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:15,873
and to stop pneumonia taking hold.

289
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:20,753
Morning, Ivy.

290
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:25,214
Oh, come on! I only asked
what a million men would ask.

291
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:28,802
And I only answered what
a million women would answer.

292
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:31,888
He's coming this tea time!

293
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:34,307
I'll meet him off the train,
give him a drink

294
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:36,601
and send him on his way.

295
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:40,396
It'll be too late to send him on
his way if he gets here after five!

296
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:43,775
Then I'll have to bite the bullet
and put him up at the pub.

297
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:46,027
Won't he find that peculiar?

298
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:49,657
I don't think so.
I'll tell him we're all very busy.

299
00:18:55,788 --> 00:19:00,208
Say there's 'flu in the house and
he mustn't miss out on his course.

300
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,378
You're quite a plotter
when you want to be, aren't you?

301
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,006
It's a skill all women must learn.

302
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:18,059
But are you certain?

303
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,104
There must be something we can do.
There isn't.

304
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:24,148
I can manage easily with help
from the servants.

305
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:27,151
We just have to stop it
turning into pneumonia.

306
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:28,778
That's the real danger.

307
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:32,115
It seems rather unfair
to saddle you with it all.

308
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:35,243
Why should you do it and not us?
Because I'm a trained nurse.

309
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:38,622
Why is the food so disgusting,
suddenly?

310
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:44,419
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I wouldn't be too sure.

311
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,465
Everything she puts into my mouth
is absolutely disgusting.

312
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:51,426
Perhaps we'd better
get out of your way.

313
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:54,887
That's all I ask.
I'll ring up if there's any change.

314
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:59,392
I'm disappointed, Mr Carson.
You don't want the 'flu.

315
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:02,729
You can't risk missing any more of
the course when you started late.

316
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,399
That's true...
I've booked you a room at the pub.

317
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,861
And it's on the house.
You didn't need to do that.

318
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:13,114
I think I did.
You've missed the last train.

319
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:15,283
You're very kind, Mr Carson.

320
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:18,620
We'll have a drink first.
You and me, man to man.

321
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,207
And then, I'll leave you to it.

322
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:29,047
Why did Alfred change his plans?
Mrs Hughes won't know, will she?

323
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:30,757
That's rather disappointing.

324
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:33,593
What have you got to be
disappointed about?

325
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:35,970
It'd be nice to see him.
I don't know why.

326
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:38,264
Why not? I'll tell you.

327
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:41,267
Because you made his life a misery
with your unkindness

328
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:43,436
and your cold and vicious heart.

329
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:46,314
Steady on, Daisy. I don't think
Ivy's quite deserved this.

330
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:50,610
Well, we know one thing...
You were right to put him off!

331
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:52,654
Tonight there can be no let up.

332
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:56,366
You mustn't sleep, you must not let
her temperature get higher.

333
00:20:56,367 --> 00:21:02,038
I want another nurse! I insist!
This, this one talks too much!

334
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,833
She's like a drunken vicar!

335
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:09,003
The family took me in
and kept me close

336
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:11,298
when my link with them had gone.

337
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,927
I owe them a great deal.
If you insist.

338
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:19,598
I'll look in later.
Ring at the slightest change.

339
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:22,518
Well, the pigs have arrived.

340
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,020
Oh, I'd have come, if I'd known.

341
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:28,314
They said you'd gone
to your grandmother's.

342
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:31,734
It all went off smoothly.
We can see them tomorrow.

343
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,737
Did you get the message about
the tickets for the talk in Ripon?

344
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,322
I did. Why can't she come?

345
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:39,659
Because Mama's ill
and Isobel is nursing her.

346
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,078
What's the thing in Ripon?
A Liberal MP is speaking.

347
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,454
I don't think I'll bother.

348
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:47,166
Just because we're not political,
you mustn't be put off.

349
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:50,212
You won't come with me, then?
I'd rather go to the stake.

350
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:56,217
But what sort of errands?
Oh, you know. This and that.

351
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:59,137
Seeing friends, buying clothes,
errands.

352
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:02,724
I hope Sir John Bullock isn't one
of your "errands". He is not!

353
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:05,310
Oh, let her go, Aunt Rosamund.

354
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:08,688
All right, but you'll be back
in time for dinner.

355
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:11,316
I'm sure I will. You're a darling.

356
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:12,692
Taxi!

357
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,903
"I'm sure I will. "
What does that mean?

358
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:17,864
I don't know
why Mama let her come.

359
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:20,116
Darling, please tell me
what's the matter.

360
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:23,078
You seem so preoccupee lately.

361
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:29,459
What do you mean you'll be 'out'
tomorrow night?

362
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,170
I'll be away,
but I don't want Mama to know.

363
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:35,798
It's not very difficult.
It is difficult for me.

364
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,303
To be put in a position of falsehood
where your parents are concerned.

365
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:44,474
You said yourself I'm a grown woman
and you're not a spy.

366
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:48,020
The last time you did this you were
with your Mr Gregson, weren't you?

367
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:51,690
So it can't be a repetition.

368
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:57,112
Oh, my dear.

369
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,493
My dear...

370
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,057
I'm so pleased to see you.

371
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:28,434
I keep thinking
you'll forget about me.

372
00:23:28,435 --> 00:23:30,603
Rose!

373
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:33,565
I won't forget you. Ever.

374
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:36,317
But... But, what?

375
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:39,862
Rose, I like you very much...
But?

376
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:41,948
What can we hope
to come out of this?

377
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:45,660
Can't we just be in the moment?

378
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:49,998
I don't know many men like you and
you don't know many girls like me.

379
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:53,376
Ain't that the truth?
Then let's enjoy it!

380
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:55,712
You know what the French say?

381
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:57,964
Vive le difference!

382
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:01,050
Do you think Lord Grantham
will enjoy the 'difference'?

383
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:03,011
Or Lady Mary?

384
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:05,263
You're not scared of them, are you?

385
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:07,016
No. Good.

386
00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:10,561
Then you'll take me
to the club tonight.

387
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:14,273
But first... Kiss me.

388
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:18,109
Or don't you want to?

389
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,655
Oh, I want to.
Don't you worry about that.

390
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:37,128
I'm not even sure which
frightens me most...

391
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:41,090
What may have happened
to Michael or... the baby.

392
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:46,305
What do you propose to do?

393
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:49,808
It's...

394
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:52,645
.. hard to say the words but...

395
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,065
I've decided to get rid of it.

396
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:59,359
How terrible it is to hear that.

397
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,071
Please don't pretend
you won't be relieved when I do.

398
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:04,948
You're not being fair.

399
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:07,533
I will support you
whatever you decide,

400
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:10,119
just as Cora will and Robert.

401
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,040
That sounds like a speech from
The Second Mrs Tanqueray.

402
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,417
But, you don't mean a word of it.

403
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,044
I do.

404
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:21,047
So, I'd be welcome in your
drawing room, would I?

405
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:24,008
"Have you met my niece
and her charming bastard?"

406
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:26,053
I refuse to be shocked!

407
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:32,558
But, what will you say when
Mr Gregson walks through the door,

408
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,937
with a full explanation
for his silence?

409
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:37,981
Nothing.

410
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:40,858
I pray he is alive,

411
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,361
but, if he is, I won't say a thing.

412
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:45,154
And you will marry him?

413
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:47,448
If he still wants me to.

414
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:50,493
So, your whole life
will be based on a lie?

415
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:52,788
Have you thought about that?

416
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:58,001
I am killing the wanted child
of a man I'm in love with

417
00:25:58,002 --> 00:26:00,129
and you ask me if
I've thought about it?

418
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:09,345
I assume you'll be
away for the night

419
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:11,557
because you have booked into some...

420
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:17,730
.. some place where
they will do this?

421
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:21,233
How did you find it?

422
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:26,070
There was a magazine in the ladies'
waiting room at King's Cross.

423
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:28,865
You do realise it is quite illegal?
Of course.

424
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:30,409
And dangerous!

425
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:34,495
What will I say to your parents
if it goes wrong?

426
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:36,790
You'll think of something.

427
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:42,337
Very well.

428
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:44,632
If you've made up your mind...

429
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:48,129
.. I shall come with you.

430
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:00,724
He telephoned earlier, and Tom's
gone off to a political meeting,

431
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:02,934
so I'm afraid it's just us.

432
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:06,021
Don't be afraid.
But, we are afraid!

433
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:10,025
How can brainless dullards like us
ever hope to entertain Mr Blake?

434
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,819
Mary?! That sounded a little rude.

435
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,489
I can take it. Did the pigs arrive?

436
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,200
Absolutely.
Although un-witnessed by me.

437
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,118
I'll go with Tom tomorrow.

438
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,121
Well, I'm curious to see them
and I'll be out all day.

439
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:25,999
Why don't we walk down after dinner?
Lady Grantham?

440
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,627
You two go. I'll take it on trust.

441
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:31,421
Well, it's a nice evening.
What about it?

442
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:34,216
Well, it's quite a long walk,

443
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:37,970
but I don't mind,
if you really want to.

444
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,352
Is this seat taken?
I was keeping it for a friend.

445
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:52,943
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
I'm John Ward.

446
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:55,195
In a while I'll ask for questions

447
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:57,906
so please remember
what made you indignant

448
00:27:57,907 --> 00:28:00,034
when you last read a newspaper.

449
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:05,997
Are you trying to attract my
attention ahead of the rest, madam?

450
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,333
I just wanted him
to take this chair.

451
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:10,585
Do you know this gentleman? No.

452
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:12,380
You just wanted to sit next to him?

453
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:16,508
Er no, it was because he asked.

454
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:18,593
He asked to sit next to you?

455
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:22,597
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been
made privy to a very romantic story.

456
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,099
Why don't I sit down?

457
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,185
Of course, the question uppermost
in all of your minds is,

458
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:31,314
why the split between Mr Asquith
and Mr Lloyd George?

459
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:34,276
Because a divided party
spells electoral defeat.

460
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,487
Well, can I say this?

461
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:39,447
It doesn't have to.

462
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,824
He's wrong there.

463
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:42,242
Since 1910...

464
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:44,286
But you support them?
Not really.

465
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,538
I'm a Socialist. Or I was.

466
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,415
And in 1915...

467
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:51,877
What happened to your friend?
I don't know.

468
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:54,963
It just seemed silly
to keep the chair empty.

469
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,674
I'm glad.

470
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,180
Of course,
history teaches us that in 1910...

471
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:08,894
The idea is to learn from these,
then, if it's going well, expand.

472
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:12,022
And you have a good pig man?
He comes highly recommended.

473
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:14,108
Well, that's important because...

474
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:18,070
What is it?

475
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,656
What is it? What's happening?

476
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:23,366
This one's almost dead. Why?

477
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,036
It looks dehydrated.
It's had no water.

478
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:28,622
Isn't there a water trough?

479
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:30,207
They've kicked it over.

480
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,001
How could this have happened?
All too easily.

481
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:35,045
Should I fetch the pig man?

482
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:38,215
I could run back to the house?
If only we'd brought a car!

483
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,717
There's no time.
Where's the nearest clean water?

484
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:44,721
There's a water pipe, in the barn.
Should we drive the animals to it?

485
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:48,975
When they've had no water this long
you must give it to them gradually.

486
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,770
Wait a moment.

487
00:29:55,608 --> 00:29:58,318
I'm sorry about that earlier.

488
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,863
You can't blame him
for having a bit of fun.

489
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:05,158
There won't be much fun for them
after the election.

490
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,954
What do you care,
if you're a Socialist?

491
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:11,289
I'm not sure what I am,

492
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,959
except a man in search
of a better world.

493
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,296
Why did you leave Ireland?
Sometimes I ask myself that.

494
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:20,340
Will you go back? No.

495
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:24,177
Why not? It's a long story.

496
00:30:24,178 --> 00:30:27,140
I'd better go.
Thanks for the seat. Goodnight.

497
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:36,274
Does no-one care
whether I live or die?

498
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,360
There, there.

499
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:44,574
This will make you feel better.
Hmm?

500
00:30:45,616 --> 00:30:47,577
Compared to what?

501
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:15,104
I'm fine.

502
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,482
I'm fine!

503
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:20,276
Suit yourself.

504
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:42,506
I'm off. Erm...

505
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:46,176
Well done, for containing
the Downton heart-breaker.

506
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,886
Everyone's gone to bed,

507
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,138
but Lady Mary's still out
with Mr Blake.

508
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:54,100
What should I do about locking up?
I wonder what's taking the time.

509
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,602
Nothing.

510
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,563
Well, nothing like that.

511
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:01,775
I should leave the front door open
with the key in the lock.

512
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:05,111
They can turn it when they come in.
You're not frightened of burglars?

513
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:08,698
Mr Carson, this is England.

514
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:23,463
Are they going to be all right?
I think so.

515
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:26,633
I'll watch them for another hour
and give them one more drink.

516
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:30,638
But you, you should go.
I'm not going! They're my pigs.

517
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,061
Here, take my coat.
At least it's dry.

518
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:48,738
Not quite the evening we planned.

519
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:56,289
What do I look like?

520
00:32:57,498 --> 00:32:59,249
You belong in Country Life.

521
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,293
"Lady Mary Crawley,"

522
00:33:01,294 --> 00:33:04,671
"seen here to advantage relaxing
at the family seat in Yorkshire. "

523
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:40,540
Where have you been?

524
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,210
Having such a dreamy time.

525
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:46,838
Is she furious that I missed dinner?

526
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,218
Why can't you just fit in for once?
Shall I go and make my peace.

527
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,054
Good night, Rose.

528
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,204
Who'd have thought it?

529
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,791
I can scramble eggs,
but that's about it.

530
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:29,673
I suspect Carson had plans for this,
but too bad.

531
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:32,759
I don't deserve such attention.
You certainly do.

532
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,304
You've completely saved our bacon.
Literally!

533
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:45,313
So, you're a practical farmer,
as well as a theoretician.

534
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:47,358
Not sure I was expecting that.

535
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:51,778
I didn't expect to see you
as a cook and a water carrier.

536
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:53,238
A night of discovery.

537
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,909
Good discoveries. For me, anyway.

538
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,165
I love how they've all gone to bed,

539
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,458
without the slightest
concern about us.

540
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,794
What did they think we were doing?

541
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:12,800
We went for a walk and vanished.
Who knows what they thought?

542
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:20,224
I'm ever so sorry, m'lady.
Please, don't apologise...

543
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,101
Ivy, m'lady.

544
00:35:23,102 --> 00:35:24,603
Ivy.

545
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:27,690
Well, if you're getting up,
it's time for us to go to bed.

546
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:33,321
Would you please tell Anna
I'll ring when I'm awake?

547
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,285
Good night.

548
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:41,996
Good night.

549
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:52,048
Thank you. Ma'am.

550
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,343
It's right.

551
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:59,180
This is it.
It doesn't look very right.

552
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:07,480
It should say Thompson on the bell.

553
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:09,857
Well, here goes.

554
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:22,495
If you'll wait, the doctor will be
with you very soon.

555
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:25,873
As long as he is a doctor.

556
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:37,593
You don't have to stay.
Of course I do.

557
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:41,805
Would you like a glass of water?

558
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:43,099
No, thank you.

559
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,396
It's not that I don't love him,
you know.

560
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:51,232
I do love him...

561
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,861
.. and I would have loved his baby.

562
00:36:57,405 --> 00:36:58,865
But, I just...

563
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,742
.. can't see over the top of this.

564
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:04,579
No.

565
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,416
I don't want to be an outcast.

566
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:13,628
I don't want to be some funny woman
living in Maida Vale

567
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:15,631
people never talk about.

568
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:19,718
Sybil might have brought it off,
but not me.

569
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:22,263
Oh no, I see that.

570
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:25,765
But, you think I'm terribly selfish.

571
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:28,560
Please don't put words into my mouth.

572
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,313
I don't know what I think,

573
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:33,858
except that I wish it were over.

574
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,696
I can't go back to the nursery.

575
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:44,202
Not with Mary's son and Sybil's
daughter waiting there.

576
00:37:46,412 --> 00:37:48,372
I can't do that.

577
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:52,167
I won't be able to do that.

578
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:53,878
Not for a while.

579
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:56,672
Not for ever, I don't think.

580
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:27,953
The doctor's just...
I'm afraid this is a mistake.

581
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:30,789
There's no reason...
I'm sorry to waste your time but...

582
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,000
This is a mistake.

583
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,713
It seems it was a mistake.

584
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:47,925
Then un-arrange them.
Why should I?

585
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,887
Because I'm telling you to.
Just do it, dear.

586
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,144
Are you going to tell Cora?

587
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:01,855
I suppose I must do, at some stage.

588
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:04,650
If you want me to be there,
let me know.

589
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:08,905
I'm certain there's a way forward.
Certain of it.

590
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:12,826
Well, the decision's been made now.

591
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:20,249
You've heard about our adventures?
I'm very impressed.

592
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,502
There you are!
I'm afraid I slept late.

593
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:26,755
Have you remembered
Tony Gillingham's coming tonight?

594
00:39:26,756 --> 00:39:29,842
What? Why?
He's driving up to fish the Spey.

595
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:33,345
He asked if he could stay the night.
I'm sure I told you.

596
00:39:33,346 --> 00:39:37,015
Did he used to be Tony Foyle?
That's right. Why?

597
00:39:37,016 --> 00:39:40,769
We served together in the war
on the Iron Duke with Jellicoe.

598
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,272
Were you at Jutland? We were.

599
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:45,316
Well, you'll see him again tonight.

600
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,446
I tried to put him off, but he
didn't seem to want to be put off.

601
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,532
Don't worry. It's perfectly fine.

602
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:58,871
I gather you were the heroine
of the pig drama.

603
00:39:58,872 --> 00:40:00,998
So, I'm not aloof now?
Not a bit.

604
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,334
Mucking in with the best of them.
Only trouble for me is...

605
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,172
I'm afraid it's increased
the competition.

606
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,432
Hello, Daisy. Hello, Ivy.

607
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:23,313
We thought you weren't coming.
Mr Carson warned me about the 'flu.

608
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:25,939
What 'flu?

609
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,736
Mrs Patmore and I both think we're
coming down with the 'flu, don't we?

610
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:35,157
We do, indeed, and we're wanting to
spare Alfred from it if we could.

611
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:37,659
You look well enough to me.

612
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,121
Looks can be deceptive.

613
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:47,211
We're so pleased to see you.
Aren't we? Daisy? Jimmy?

614
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:51,256
We've missed you.
I don't know about that.

615
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:54,093
Have you really missed me, Ivy?
Oh, I have.

616
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:57,889
The place isn't the same
without you, is it, Daisy?

617
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:02,101
If I thought you meant that,
I'm not sure I could go.

618
00:41:02,102 --> 00:41:06,355
Which makes it sadder you have to.
You're right. I can't stay long.

619
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:10,359
I've got to get back to London.
I should have come last night.

620
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,237
Mr Carson was being over careful.

621
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,406
Yes, I'm sure that's what it was.

622
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:18,325
Alfred? What are you doing here?

623
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:22,204
He, he thought he'd look in,
before he catches the train.

624
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:24,040
We've warned him about our 'flu!

625
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:32,464
So, we got all the trouble and a bill
to pay at the pub to pay, too!

626
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:35,551
Oh, go on with you. I'm sure you
don't grudge him a decent dinner.

627
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:37,886
But I do grudge him
the tears and heartbreak

628
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:41,014
that'll flavour my puddings
for weeks to come!

629
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:45,270
Well, you've given me summat
to think about, Ivy, and I will.

630
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:54,486
That's such good news,
if you really are hungry.

631
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:57,239
Well, I'm, I'm not ravenous,

632
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,160
but I wouldn't mind
a piece of toast.

633
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:04,037
I'll ask straight away.
Can't you ring...?

634
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,416
Well, really, really.

635
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:09,918
Doctor Clarkson, when you go,

636
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:13,214
would you please take
that mad woman with you?

637
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:16,216
That mad woman

638
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:20,012
has refused to leave your side
for the last two days and two nights

639
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:24,475
and she has not slept nor eaten
since you were taken ill.

640
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,478
But, there were nurses here?

641
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:31,315
I remember a nurse wiping my brow.

642
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,651
She was that nurse, Lady Grantham.

643
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:37,154
But, what about Cora and Mary?

644
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,323
They offered,

645
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:42,159
but Mrs Crawley felt she had
more knowledge than they.

646
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,496
I suppose that has a ring of truth.

647
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:49,041
I've asked them to bring up
some toast and tea.

648
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:52,795
Now Lady Grantham's a little better,
it's time you had a break.

649
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:57,217
I might go home and have a bath.
Shall I come back later?

650
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:03,722
Oh yes... Yes, dear.
That would be very kind.

651
00:43:03,723 --> 00:43:05,809
Good.

652
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:10,854
I can stay all evening.
Perhaps we can play cards.

653
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:16,653
You will be rewarded in Heaven.

654
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:19,739
The sooner the better.

655
00:43:23,952 --> 00:43:25,870
I think this is the right place.

656
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:29,832
Well, if it isn't Mr Gillingham!

657
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:32,376
Welcome back!
Pull up a chair and sit down.

658
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,795
I suppose you've come
to shake us up again.

659
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:37,005
Will there be any more
Racing Demon this time?

660
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:40,551
Depends if you're up to it, but I
expect you've all got things to do.

661
00:43:40,552 --> 00:43:42,137
Miss Baxter, I wondered if you...

662
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,016
If I could what?

663
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:52,146
If you could let me have
some white thread.

664
00:43:52,147 --> 00:43:55,066
I seem to have run out.
Of course.

665
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,776
Go on then.

666
00:43:57,777 --> 00:44:00,738
What've you been up to
since we saw you last?

667
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:03,282
Having fun and games at other
people's expense?

668
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:06,536
I'd better not tell you too much.
I don't want to shock the ladies.

669
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:15,210
I hope you don't mind
my turning up again.

670
00:44:15,211 --> 00:44:18,839
It's the perfect stopping point
between London and Inverness.

671
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,217
I don't mind at all. How are you?

672
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:23,887
Well, missing you, mainly.

673
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:27,932
Sounds to me
as if the needle's got stuck.

674
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,977
How's Mabel?

675
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:35,647
I gather Charles Blake's here.

676
00:44:35,648 --> 00:44:37,775
Of course, you served together.

677
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,777
We don't really know him,

678
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:43,530
but he and Evelyn Napier are
writing a report for the Government.

679
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:46,742
He'll be up here for a few weeks.
Lucky devil.

680
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:49,286
Don't get to like him
better than me.

681
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,288
No chance of that.

682
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,040
They're out all day,

683
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:56,418
and even in the evenings
we've hardly spoken until yesterday.

684
00:44:56,419 --> 00:44:58,545
Erm, what happened yesterday?

685
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:02,883
Some pigs arrived and of course,
as usual, Mr Blake was...

686
00:45:02,884 --> 00:45:05,720
Anyway, what does it matter?

687
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,019
Hello, Charles.
It's good to see you again.

688
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,772
This is nice.
What task brings you to Yorkshire?

689
00:45:16,773 --> 00:45:20,567
Nothing as meaningful as yours.
What report are you working on?

690
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:23,904
Current health of the landed estate.
My usual stamping ground.

691
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:26,741
So, did you get everything done?

692
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,786
Why do you ask? No reason.

693
00:45:30,787 --> 00:45:34,748
By the time we got back, we looked
as if we'd been wrestling in mud.

694
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:36,708
And had you? No!

695
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,838
But then, it's always nice to leave
something for another time.

696
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:49,556
So, what are the chances for Downton?

697
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,724
I'd say they look bright.

698
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:55,853
Lady Mary and the family mean to
give it everything they've got.

699
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:58,564
If Mary means to give it
everything she's got,

700
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:00,941
then that is a very
considerable gift.

701
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:03,277
I couldn't agree more.

702
00:46:03,278 --> 00:46:04,571
Dinner everyone.

703
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,623
They said you were in here.

704
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:21,295
What can I do for you, Mrs Hughes?
Nothing. You can do nothing for me.

705
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:24,757
Because I know who you are
and I know what you've done.

706
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:29,428
And while you're here,
if you value your life,

707
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:33,058
I should stop playing the joker
and keep to the shadows.

708
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:43,609
I'm afraid we were a bit drunk
that night, Anna and I,

709
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:46,905
so you're right,
we were both to blame.

710
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:50,616
No, Mr Green.

711
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:53,328
YOU were to blame and ONLY you.

712
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:56,748
Does Mr Bates know?

713
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,126
Not that it was you.

714
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:02,379
Thank you.

715
00:47:03,505 --> 00:47:05,631
Don't you dare thank me!

716
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:09,344
I've not kept silent for your sake.

717
00:47:18,728 --> 00:47:21,189
I think it's Gin.

718
00:47:22,357 --> 00:47:24,608
Oh, so it is.

719
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:27,694
I'd forgotten
what a good game this is.

720
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:31,115
Yes. I'd forgotten.
How long does it go on for?

721
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:33,827
Oh, ages! Oh, goody, goody.

722
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:42,960
Oh, dear. Alfred's relit the taper.

723
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:45,838
Well, to be young is to have
your heart broken,

724
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,799
in the kitchens at Downton,
like everywhere else.

725
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,010
I've spent half the day brushing
the mud out of his dinner jacket.

726
00:47:52,011 --> 00:47:54,723
Why can't he have his own valet
instead of making work for me?

727
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:58,685
Anna?

728
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:04,022
Sorry. Yes. What were you saying?

729
00:48:04,024 --> 00:48:07,651
Mr Blake's evening shoes were
quite a challenge, I can tell you.

730
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:11,613
I wasn't working here then.
It's a pity. I admire Nellie Melba.

731
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:14,950
I'd have loved to hear her sing.
You must be joking.

732
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:18,036
Why? I thought she had
a beautiful voice.

733
00:48:18,038 --> 00:48:22,416
Screaming and screeching, as if her
finger was caught in the door?

734
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:25,002
I couldn't take it
for one more moment.

735
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:26,253
So, what did you do?

736
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:29,965
Well, I came down here for a bit
of peace and quiet, that's what.

737
00:48:29,966 --> 00:48:32,927
Is that more
of the cauliflower cheese?
