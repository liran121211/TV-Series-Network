2
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,950
Why didn't you wait for me?

3
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,350
I wanted to finish these before
breakfast. Is it something I've done?

4
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,310
No, not anything.

5
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,350
Nobody's done anything.

6
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,990
Blimey. What happened to you?

7
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,310
Leave her alone. I fell. I cut my
lip.

8
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,750
Now, if either of you need help to
carry things down just ask.

9
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,790
Alfred and James will be glad to
help. That's good to know.

10
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,150
What was that, James? Nothing, Mr
Carson.

11
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,310
I'd better go up. Lady Mary hasn't
rung yet.

12
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,350
I've things to do.

13
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,950
How was Anna when you lent her that
dress last night?

14
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,990
How should she be? She told me she'd
fallen and cut her lip,

15
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,470
but I wondered if it might be more
serious.

16
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,670
She always minimises things. I'm sure
I don't know anything you don't know.

17
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,350
What's the matter with everyone this
merry morn?

18
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,590
I think there's something rather foreign
about high spirits at breakfast.

19
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,190
I shall be supervising the departure
if anyone wants me.

20
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,910
Well, Mr Gillingham, I hope you
haven't forgotten anything.

21
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,830
On the contrary, Mr Carson. I shall
remember this visit for a long time.

22
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,750
Goodbye, Lord Grantham, and thank
you for everything. Oh, nonsense.

23
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,910
I'm the one who should be thanking
you.

24
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,230
You look as if you're glad to see
the back of us.

25
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,070
No. You've been kind to me.

26
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,310
I'm afraid I haven't been much fun
to be with.

27
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,910
Grief's odd, Tom. When the Duke died
it made me terribly clumsy.

28
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,030
I kept dropping and breaking things.

29
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,870
It was because it felt disloyal...

30
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,550
to manage anything properly without
him, do you see?

31
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,910
But you could manage. Yes, I could.

32
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,950
And so can you. I wonder.

33
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,070
The trouble is that I'm not really out
and all that. But it should be possible.

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,150
I don't think people care about those
rules like they used to. Well, I don't.

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,310
The luggage is loaded, m'lord.

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,190
It's nice to see you're well looked
after.

37
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,310
It seems rather ungrateful, but I
can't pretend I like him.

38
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,030
But I'm lucky to have anyone
nowadays.

39
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,670
You said it.

40
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,910
I'll say goodbye to Tony Gillingham.
Don't interrupt them yet.

41
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,550
You're sure we can't meet?

42
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,830
I'm sure you're much too busy and
I'll be chasing my tail.

43
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,710
In other words, no.

44
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,430
I'm afraid you'll have to get
started. They won't hold the train.

45
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,390
Not even for you?

46
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,550
Not for me, nor for you either,
Duchess. Not these days.

47
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,870
You look very earnest.

48
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,670
I'm on my way to convince the board
of the merits of an out clinic,

49
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,830
so people can come early for
treatment.

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,350
I don't suppose... Don't suppose
what?

51
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,710
I could do with some help. I know you suspect
me of trying to get you back into harness.

52
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,510
But, well, it would leave a nurse
free for other duties.

53
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,550
I'll think about it.

54
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,910
I will.

55
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,950
I promise.

56
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,750
The tax people have had a cancellation,
so they can see us on Wednesday at noon.

57
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,150
But we should go up tomorrow. I
wouldn't like to risk being late.

58
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,070
And you don't want me to come? No
point in you all going.

59
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,110
Are you afraid I might put the case
for selling? It's not a question of that.

60
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,830
They don't care how they get the
money so long as they get it.

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,430
I'll ask how long they can give us and
what scale of payment they'll accept.

62
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,830
Then I'll report back. And we'll make
a decision together.

63
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,870
But I will try to persuade you.

64
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,790
Even though you'd be dragging a debt
behind you for 20 years? I don't care.

65
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,630
Not if Downton is self-sufficient by
the end of it.

66
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,350
I can see I'll spend the rest of my
life paying by instalments.

67
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,390
Papa, you always say we're not the
owners of Downton but the caretakers.

68
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,430
Very well. Let's take care of it.

69
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,910
Aunt Rosamund said we can stay with
her.

70
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,590
Do you mind keeping an eye on the
children, Mama?

71
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,150
Is this London? When are you going?
Can I come?

72
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,230
Tomorrow, and I don't see why not.
Nor me.

73
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,070
Will you meet Tony Gillingham while
you're there?

74
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,110
I don't think so. Why should I?

75
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,630
Just thought you might.

76
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,390
Don't be transparent, Mama. It
doesn't suit you.

77
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,630
I thought you might come down to see
me.

78
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,110
After last night. Look, Edna,

79
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,990
I blush to admit it, but I was very
drunk.

80
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,510
So you're not going to deny it? Of
course not.

81
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,110
And if I behaved badly, I am sorry.

82
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,670
We'll have to put it down to our low
spirits and self indulgence.

83
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,270
I suppose you're so cold because
you're ashamed of what you did.

84
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,550
I'm neither cold nor ashamed. But,
as I say,

85
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,990
if I made a mistake, then I'm sorry.

86
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,630
I dare say we both are.

87
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,270
What are you making
there? Feuilletes.

88
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,030
What's that? Puff pastry layers with
asparagus.

89
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,550
I'm doing the hollandaise. Do they really like
that stuff or do they order it to show off?

90
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,310
We don't all have to live off
battered fish and meat pies.

91
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,910
It's the first thing Mrs Patmore's
trusted me with. First big thing.

92
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,190
I'm quite nervous. So you should be.

93
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,990
Mess it up and it's back to
kindergarten.

94
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,030
What are you doing?

95
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,230
You can't treat a poor girl like
this.

96
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,430
Like what? To use her one minute and
to cast her aside the next.

97
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,790
I've said I'm sorry - Yes, you're
sorry. I know.

98
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,390
But suppose I'm pregnant.

99
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,710
What will you do then?

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,550
Don't be ridiculous. You can't be
pregnant. It's not as easy as that.

101
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,590
But it is. Just as easy.

102
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,550
Why talk about it now? You won't
know for weeks.

103
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,990
I must be sure that you'll marry me
if I'm carrying your child.

104
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,030
I need to know that you won't cast
me off, that you'll be a man of honour.

105
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,110
And don't say I'm not good enough.

106
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,790
If you were good enough for Lady
Sybil Crawley, I'm good enough for
you. Don't speak her name.

107
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,390
You weren't so severe last night.

108
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,830
All I need is your word that you'll
marry me if there's a baby.

109
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,270
Don't worry. If it happens, I mean
to make a go of being your wife.

110
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,470
I won't hold you back.

111
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,510
You won't have any regrets.

112
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,390
I am already full of regrets.

113
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,310
There is nothing but regret in me.

114
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,990
Did you enjoy the concert? I did.

115
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,510
It was a great treat to hear Melba in
person.

116
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,750
Hm. And the evening generally?

117
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,510
You mean did I find it hard to see
Mary come alive again?

118
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,710
Yes, I did, I confess it.

119
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,190
But I don't think my feelings are at
all defensible.

120
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,590
They are defensible to me. But it's
immoral

121
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,150
to react in such a jealous and
selfish way.

122
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,150
Well, if we only had moral thoughts,

123
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,790
what would the poor churchmen find
to do?

124
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,230
I'm fond of Mary.

125
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,870
I love her.

126
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,110
I don't want her to be alone and
unhappy.

127
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,150
It makes no sense, even to me.

128
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,150
I don't criticise either you or her.

129
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,670
But I hope you find a way to make
friends with the world again.

130
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,470
When we get to London, would you mind
helping Lady Rose?

131
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,510
We can't take Madge off Lady Edith.

132
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,630
Anna, are you all right? Yes.

133
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,790
Only you've been very quiet.

134
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,670
Will that be all, m'lady?

135
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,270
Yes, I suppose so. Very good, m'lady.

136
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,470
I telephoned Rosamund.

137
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,950
I thought Mary was doing that. Yes,
but I wanted to speak to her.

138
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,710
That's a first. She'll give a little
dinner.

139
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,350
What about Tom? She said she won't
mind if he wants to be included.

140
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,390
Who could resist such a love call?

141
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,550
She'll ask that young man for Rose,
so it won't be too obvious.

142
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,190
It'll be pretty obvious. Do you
think something might come of it?

143
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,630
Probably not but I wouldn't mind if
it did.

144
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,630
After all, being a family means
welcoming new members.

145
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,670
Don't you agree, Braithwaite?

146
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,430
I think anyone would be lucky to be
a part of this family, m'lady.

147
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,630
That's nice. Thank you.

148
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,270
Aren't we encouraging a nation of
hypochondriacs if they rush to a
doctor at every twinge?

149
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,550
I think it encourages people to look after
themselves and not become a burden.

150
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,750
So you mean to help? A little.

151
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,990
Just to provide some free labour. No
more than that.

152
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,870
I wish someone would provide me with
some free labour. Oh.

153
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,910
Lloyd George would never allow it.

154
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,230
Rosamund is so looking forward to
seeing you. Poor Aunt Rosamund.

155
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,870
We use her like an hotel.
She enjoys it.

156
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,230
It gives her a surrogate real life.

157
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,790
What do you think, Tom? Do you think
she minds?

158
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,910
Tom?

159
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,750
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

160
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,190
I'd far rather know what you were
thinking.

161
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,470
Let me taste it. Go on, then.

162
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,110
It's like eating paper. Thank you.

163
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,870
I mean it. Do you really care about
this stuff?

164
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,270
I want to be a good cook. I want a
skill.

165
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,510
Why shouldn't I? You sound like
Alfred.

166
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,870
Well, what do you want?

167
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,430
To have a good time. To see the
world.

168
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,870
To meet beautiful women and spend
money and drink champagne.

169
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,910
You can't make a career out of that.

170
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,830
Some people do. I want a life that's
fun.

171
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,870
I wish I was more like you.

172
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,670
I should report you to Mrs Patmore.

173
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,350
Report me for what? You know.

174
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,270
No, he does not know and nor do I.
What don't you know?

175
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,630
Why everyone's making a fuss over my
cooking.

176
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,190
Because you did well, Ivy. They're
not very hard.

177
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,590
They're hard enough for a beginner,
as you ought to remember.

178
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,390
Yes, but Ivy moves so fast for a
beginner, don't she?

179
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,750
Just one night. We'll be back for
dinner on Wednesday.

180
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,910
I'll miss you. Don't.

181
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,630
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,190
I'm just tired.

183
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,990
Before you ask, you've done nothing
wrong. I must have done something.

184
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,390
You won't talk to me, you won't look
at me. I can't come near you.

185
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,910
We're in each other's pockets.

186
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,390
We live together, we work together.

187
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,830
Sometimes I think it's just too much.

188
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,870
There's not a lot to say.

189
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,910
We worked in a few theatres
together.

190
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,790
She had a singing act with her
sister.

191
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,110
The Lark and the Dove they were
called.

192
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,350
Which was she? The dove, I suppose.

193
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,790
Her sister had the voice...

194
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,790
but Alice was a gentle soul,

195
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,030
a sweet and a gentle soul.

196
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,350
And you were courting?

197
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,990
Well, you know how it was then.

198
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,990
Not like today. You were lucky if
you got to walk them to the corner.

199
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,710
But you wanted to marry her.

200
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,430
So much I could taste it.

201
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,870
I know, where is that young man now
so full of passion?

202
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,030
Anyway, she chose Charlie and that
was that.

203
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,430
But what's changed?

204
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,070
He told me that she regretted it.

205
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,470
That she wished she'd chosen me.

206
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,430
She's dead now, so it doesn't
matter, but that's what she said.

207
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,590
I disagree. It matters a lot.

208
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,630
The woman you loved... loved you.

209
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,390
But it doesn't change anything.

210
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,750
It changes you from where I'm
looking.

211
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,030
You're busy. No, no, no.

212
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,870
I'll say goodnight. Goodnight, Mr
Carson.

213
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,830
What is it?

214
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,590
When I get back from London I want to
move back upstairs.

215
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,190
What? Why, for heaven's sake?

216
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,230
Because I can't...

217
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,710
..I can't let him touch me.

218
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,390
But whatever happened was not Mr
Bates's fault, surely?

219
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,430
Of course not.

220
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,110
He is without fault and that's the
point.

221
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,470
I'm not good enough for him. Not now.

222
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,590
Why say that? Because I think that
somehow I...

223
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,910
..I must have made it happen.

224
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,670
Stuff and nonsense. You were
attacked by an evil, violent man.

225
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,350
There is no sin in that. But I feel
dirty.

226
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,510
I can't let him touch me because I'm
soiled.

227
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,030
Anna, I've been thinking.

228
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,150
We must go to the police. No.

229
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,430
But suppose you're with child. What
will you do then?

230
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,110
I'll kill myself. I won't listen to
that.

231
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,430
No man should be able to do what he
did and get away with it.

232
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,910
And when Mr Bates has killed him,

233
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,270
will you come with me to the prison
when my husband is hanged?

234
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,310
But the poor man's heart is breaking
for not knowing.

235
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,990
Better a broken heart than a broken
neck.

236
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,510
So can I have a room, please?

237
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,950
You can.

238
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,030
You must wait until there's some
reason for you to give Mr Bates,

239
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,030
but I wish you would decide that
honesty is the best policy.

240
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,750
In the meanwhile, try to take a
break from it...

241
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,910
..while you're in London.

242
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,750
There can be no break from it.

243
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:02,958
Come and talk to me while I'm cleaning
them. I've got work to do. Five minutes.

244
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:18,534
Ivy can make the savoury. There's
only three of them, it'll be good practice.

245
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:22,928
What about me? Collect the trays
from the nursery and make the
pancakes for pudding.

246
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:25,328
Put them in the steam warmer. Have
you seen this?

247
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:28,968
What? They're setting up a training
school at the Ritz Hotel in London

248
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,888
in honour of Monsieur Escoffier.

249
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:35,048
Just for a few candidates. How much
will it cost? Nothing.

250
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:39,848
If they pass the test they get free training,
a basic wage and the chance of a job after.

251
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:43,528
They have two examinations a year.
You could do that, Daisy.

252
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:46,768
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Where's Ivy? She ought to see it.

253
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,808
She's around here somewhere.

254
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:52,648
She's in the boot room.

255
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:22,048
Sorry to keep you waiting, but Anna
couldn't find -

256
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,648
Oh.

257
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:27,088
I hope I'm a surprise and not a
shock.

258
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,928
Well, you're certainly unexpected.

259
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:34,368
I thought I'd get up a small party,
just an informal one.

260
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,608
You remember Sir John Bullock?

261
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:39,328
He and Lord Gillingham have just been
staying with us.

262
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:43,528
Cora said it had been a success.
How clever of you both to be free at
such short notice.

263
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:45,488
They brought your message to my
club.

264
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:49,648
I had an evening of cards and whisky
ahead so it was a welcome change of plan.

265
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:54,408
And what about you? Well, I cancelled
what I was supposed to be doing.

266
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,088
I hope Miss Lane Fox didn't mind.

267
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,728
Don't punish me for wanting to see
you again.

268
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:03,848
John's got a marvellous idea for
later on, haven't you?

269
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:07,648
After dinner I could take you all to
hear the new band at the Lotus Club.

270
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,928
You and Mary can be my chaperones, so
what could be more proper?

271
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:14,568
It isn't too jazzy, Lady Rosamund.
Just a club with a good dance band.

272
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:16,608
We can keep the young in order.

273
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,968
That's if you like the sound of it.

274
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:21,008
Please say yes, Mary, do.

275
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,488
It's such eons since we've had any
fun.

276
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:26,808
What about you, Tom?

277
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:32,008
I'll stay here with Lady Rosamund.
Oh, I was thinking I might go, too.

278
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:35,808
That settles it. Tom can come as
Aunt Rosamund's partner.

279
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,688
Well?

280
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:40,728
I give in.

281
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,928
Some more champagne over here. I
don't need any more.

282
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:59,128
Nonsense. How can we keep going if we're
not properly fuelled? I can keep going.

283
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:12,848
His evening of cards and whisky had already
begun when he got your aunt's invitation.

284
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:22,008
# Still it holds a goodly share of
bliss...

285
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:26,408
I hope you don't mind my ambushing
you like this.

286
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:29,328
It was Mama and Aunt Rosamund who
ambushed me.

287
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,528
And I'm glad you came.

288
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,528
Really? Absolutely.

289
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:39,008
When I'm at Downton I feel so weighed
down,

290
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:42,848
as if I were stuck at school for the
rest of my life.

291
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,248
But tonight you've made me play
truant.

292
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,288
And I like it.

293
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,328
# ..flowers

294
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:54,128
# That bloom in May

295
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:58,048
# So if it's raining...

296
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:00,088
Can I see you again before you go?

297
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:05,928
How? The meeting's at noon and then
we go straight to the station.

298
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,848
Oh.

299
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,968
# It's raining violets...

300
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,528
And, anyway, you've told me you're
engaged to be married.

301
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,568
Almost engaged.

302
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,608
Almost is good enough for me.

303
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:22,088
And even if you weren't the truth
is...

304
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,208
..I'm not ready

305
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:28,408
and I won't be for some years.

306
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:31,848
I don't believe that.

307
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:34,248
Don't misunderstand me.

308
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,888
It's been lovely, here and at
Downton.

309
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,008
I feel quite refreshed.

310
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:43,408
But now it's time to go back to real
life again.

311
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,448
And that's doesn't include me.

312
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:50,128
How could it?

313
00:20:54,048 --> 00:21:02,808
# Whenever April showers
come along #

314
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:09,808
When I go through these I can tell
I've got some big gaps.

315
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,888
Make a list and we'll see what we
can do.

316
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:14,328
You'll help, won't you? Course.

317
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,968
I just think it's a shame if Alfred
has to go.

318
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:20,728
They might not even test me, let
alone offer me a place.

319
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,608
I couldn't go to London, me. Oh, you
could

320
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:26,408
if London was right for the next
step in your journey.

321
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:29,688
Are you sure you want to be a chef?
Not this chef business again.

322
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,848
Oh, just because you have no dreams.
I have dreams.

323
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:35,208
But they don't involve peeling
potatoes.

324
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:38,368
That's it, I'm off to bed. Me, too.
Goodnight, Mrs Patmore.

325
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,288
You must help him, Daisy.

326
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:46,208
Although it'll be hard,

327
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:48,888
it'll be better if you part friends,
I promise.

328
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:54,688
One moment of nastiness, and I'll be
paying for the rest of my days?

329
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:57,368
Maybe it's good if he goes.

330
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,128
Sometimes you can spend too long on
a one-sided love.

331
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:13,848
# I see a light in your eyes...

332
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:16,328
So, how are you enjoying it? What?

333
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:20,128
Being a member of the family
Crawley?

334
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:23,368
They've been kind to me. Kinder than
I deserve.

335
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,408
Oh, I'm sure that's not true. It is
true. Too true.

336
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:28,488
Oh! Oh, dear! Er...

337
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,448
should we sit down?

338
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:35,248
Aunt Rosamund's gone back to the
table. Should we go?

339
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:37,288
Absolutely not.

340
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:39,728
Um... please.

341
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:43,808
We're making a show of ourselves.
Then let's put on a great show.

342
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:49,288
People are looking at us. Good. Let
them see how it's done.

343
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:53,128
John. Oh, my -

344
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:01,368
Are you all right? Oh, um...

345
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,648
He's not normally like that.

346
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,568
Oh, Mary.

347
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:09,608
I don't think he is. I don't know
him that well.

348
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:11,648
I should keep it that way.

349
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:15,488
I really am all right now.

350
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:19,088
Thank you, you've saved my face.
Jack Ross at your service.

351
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:21,088
I'm Rose MacClare.

352
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:23,448
How do you do? Rose.

353
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:26,288
I've been sent to fetch you.

354
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,528
Well, if your friends are waiting...

355
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:34,648
I'm so sorry. This is my cousin, Tom
Branson.

356
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:39,008
This is Mr Ross. He rescued me from
deep humiliation.

357
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,688
We should be going.

358
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:47,368
There was no need to be rude. I
wasn't rude.

359
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,528
Where's John? I should think he's
gone home.

360
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:54,208
Well, have we all had enough? I hope
he paid the bill before he left.

361
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:56,808
Honestly. If it hadn't have been for
Mr Ross...

362
00:23:56,848 --> 00:24:00,528
You were having quite an adventure
with your gallant band leader.

363
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:02,808
He was terribly nice. And...

364
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,808
..John had made me look such a fool.

365
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:09,088
# A violet renamed but still blue

366
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:12,528
# The dappled dew will form in
spring

367
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,568
# No matter what you call the thing

368
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:17,048
# So what's in a name?

369
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:20,968
# The grass is always greener

370
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:22,968
# On the other side... #

371
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,528
I'm going up. I'll come with you.
I'm whacked.

372
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:28,968
I'm assuming Sir John Bullock has
blotted his copybook for you.

373
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:33,528
Oh, I don't know. Doesn't everyone
deserve a second chance? Not everyone, no.

374
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:37,368
Things have come to a pretty pass when you
have to be rescued by a black bandleader.

375
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:41,168
I was jolly pleased anyone wanted to
rescue me and so would you have been.

376
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:44,568
What's the matter? You've been in a
glump all day.

377
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,528
If I told you, you'd despise me.

378
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:53,928
It may surprise you to hear that I
said that to someone once.

379
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:57,968
But I did confess in the end and it
made things a lot better.

380
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:02,608
Well, I couldn't say it. Not to you.

381
00:25:03,688 --> 00:25:05,688
Then find someone you can tell.

382
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:09,128
It will help more than you know.

383
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:13,168
And on that modest note... goodnight.

384
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:16,008
Goodnight.

385
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:31,147
I'm glad someone's cheerful.

386
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,710
Although I'm surprised it's you.

387
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:35,524
Why?

388
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:39,244
You were very down in the mouth when
you were talking to Mr Branson.

389
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:44,204
You think you can read me like a
book, don't you?

390
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:46,924
I pride myself on keeping my eyes
open, yes.

391
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:51,404
You'll need to keep your eyes open
and your ears too where I'm concerned.

392
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:56,284
Meaning? Meaning there'll come a day
when you'll be glad you kept in with me.

393
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:07,124
Hello, James, Alfred.

394
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:11,964
Rose, Anna needs to use your curling
irons. All right. Mine are broken.

395
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,724
Of course.

396
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,644
You're back.

397
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,844
Good.

398
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:24,884
How was it?

399
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:27,404
All right.

400
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:30,124
Lady Mary seemed quite pleased. Come
here.

401
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:32,164
Better get on. Kiss me.

402
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:33,804
Please.

403
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:38,284
Or tell me what's happened. One or
the other. Don't bully me.

404
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:42,804
Anna, you're upset. You're unhappy
and I don't know why.

405
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:48,844
You say it's not me. I hope that's
true. But there is a reason and I
need to find out what it is.

406
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:54,884
I won't press you now if it makes things
worse but in the end I will find out.

407
00:26:56,044 --> 00:27:00,724
Anna, could you tell Lady Mary, Lord
Gillingham is here?

408
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:02,444
Lord Gillingham?

409
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:05,724
But we just saw him in London.
Well, he's come back.

410
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:08,844
Is his valet with him?

411
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:11,484
I mean, is he staying? She'll want
to know.

412
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:13,844
He doesn't seem to be.

413
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:16,804
Now, will you give her the message,
please?

414
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,844
Well, this is a sorry tale.

415
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:24,084
Damn right it is. And it's all my
fault.

416
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:28,364
Not all but it is partly your fault.
There's no point in denying that.

417
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,844
And you expect me to help you with
it?

418
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,044
I couldn't think of anyone else to
turn to.

419
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:37,244
Not the most flattering invitation
I've ever known.

420
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:41,124
The question is, what's to be done?

421
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,964
Should I speak to her again? Should
I beg?

422
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:46,004
We've not quite come to that.

423
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,604
It is you.

424
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:04,204
When Anna told me I thought there
must be a mistake.

425
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:07,364
How did you get here? On the same
train as you.

426
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,604
But I was travelling in third.

427
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:13,124
Why? Because I didn't want to speak
to you in a railway carriage

428
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:16,324
with, you know, Tom and everyone
else listening.

429
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:20,964
Would you like some tea? Yes, if I
may.

430
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:30,164
I assume you're going to give me an
explanation at some stage.

431
00:28:30,764 --> 00:28:32,764
It's not complicated.

432
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:35,524
I have made a long journey to ask a
short question.

433
00:28:38,364 --> 00:28:40,364
Will you marry me?

434
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:45,404
Tony, you don't know me.

435
00:28:45,444 --> 00:28:48,724
How can you say that? We've known
each other since we were children.

436
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:51,364
Yes, but with a very long gap in the
middle.

437
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,964
We only met properly a few days ago

438
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:57,084
and now you want to spend the rest of
your life with me?

439
00:28:57,964 --> 00:28:59,964
Yes.

440
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,004
That's exactly what I want.

441
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:06,324
I love you, Mary, and there must be
a way to convince you.

442
00:29:09,284 --> 00:29:13,244
Ah, James, could you bring us some
tea?

443
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,604
Very good, m'lady.

444
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:24,324
Look,

445
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:27,404
I never met Matthew but I'm sure he
was a splendid chap.

446
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:30,924
He was. But he's dead and I'm alive.

447
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,204
We're good together, Mary.

448
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:37,604
We could be so very happy if you'd
let us.

449
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,204
And Miss Lane Fox?

450
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,364
I like Mabel... a lot.

451
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:48,164
I even think that I could come to
love her.

452
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,124
But I'm not in love with her as I am
with you.

453
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:54,804
You fill my brain.

454
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:56,684
I see you when I close my eyes.

455
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:58,844
I can't stop thinking about you -

456
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,924
where you are, what you're doing.

457
00:30:03,244 --> 00:30:06,284
You're very persuasive. Then be
persuaded.

458
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:09,404
I only wish I could.

459
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:11,604
Not now, if you don't want to.

460
00:30:12,884 --> 00:30:14,884
You take as long as you need -

461
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:17,324
two years, three.

462
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:21,644
Just so long as I know that you'll
marry me in the end.

463
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:28,484
Tony! Why on earth are you here? Did
you leave something behind?

464
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:31,764
No, I had some business nearby, so I
thought I'd look in.

465
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:34,244
Are you staying? Er, yes, if, if you
don't mind.

466
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:36,804
I brought a bag on the off chance.
And your man?

467
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:39,964
I didn't want to make a fuss. It's
only one night.

468
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,204
I can't stay much longer. Nanny's
bringing down Sybbie in a moment.

469
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,324
It won't take long. She's coming
now.

470
00:30:55,524 --> 00:30:57,244
I see.

471
00:30:57,284 --> 00:30:59,284
What do you see?

472
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,324
Well, I know now why you sent for
me.

473
00:31:02,004 --> 00:31:04,964
You're going to gang up on me and
try to pay me off.

474
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:07,844
Why would we pay you off?

475
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:12,164
Well, if I'm pregnant.

476
00:31:13,244 --> 00:31:16,924
I want my baby to have a father and
I won't change my mind about that,

477
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:19,124
however much you offer.

478
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:21,164
I wasn't planning to make an offer.

479
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:23,724
Because there is no child.

480
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:26,084
What? You can't know that.

481
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:29,044
Nobody can. But I do know that,
actually.

482
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,764
Edna's not pregnant.

483
00:31:31,804 --> 00:31:35,884
Do you think she would have let herself
get pregnant before she was sure of you?

484
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:38,284
And she knew how to prevent it.

485
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:42,484
Why else would you buy this book of
instructions?

486
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:45,884
Marie Stopes. Married Love.

487
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:49,044
Though in your case it was unmarried
love, wasn't it, dear?

488
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:53,324
You've been through my things. What if I'd
agreed to marry her and there was no baby?

489
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:55,964
Once you'd agreed she would have got
pregnant.

490
00:31:56,484 --> 00:32:00,084
I don't know whom she would have
selected as the father,

491
00:32:00,124 --> 00:32:02,324
but no doubt she had a candidate in
mind.

492
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:06,924
What proof have you got? Oh, none at
the moment.

493
00:32:07,364 --> 00:32:09,364
But if you persist in your lie

494
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:12,084
I'll summon the doctor and have him
examine you.

495
00:32:13,004 --> 00:32:15,204
You can't force me. Oh, yes, I can.

496
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:18,364
I'll lock you in this room and when
he's arrived

497
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:21,644
I'll tear off your clothes and hold
you down, if that's what it takes.

498
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:26,404
You can't stop me from speaking to
her ladyship.

499
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,364
No, you're right.

500
00:32:29,804 --> 00:32:31,804
That I cannot do.

501
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:34,404
But if you want a reference...

502
00:32:34,844 --> 00:32:39,284
or another job during your natural
lifetime, you'll hold your tongue.

503
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,204
This is yours, I think.

504
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:52,244
But even with the book, how did you
know she wasn't pregnant?

505
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:56,124
I didn't. And the doctor couldn't
have told a thing yet, either.

506
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:59,124
But at least we know the truth now.

507
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:05,804
What's the matter with you? Never
mind.

508
00:33:05,844 --> 00:33:08,564
I thought we were all about to be
dancing to your tune.

509
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:11,644
Do you ever wonder why people
dislike you so much?

510
00:33:12,884 --> 00:33:16,244
It's because you are sly and oily
and smug.

511
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:19,364
And I'm really pleased I got the
chance to tell you before I go.

512
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:21,524
Well, if we're playing the truth
game,

513
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,244
then you're a manipulative little
witch,

514
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:27,164
and if your schemes have come to
nothing, I'm delighted.

515
00:33:28,844 --> 00:33:31,684
Are you leaving Downton then? What's
it to you?

516
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:33,964
Oh, plenty.

517
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:36,004
It's plenty to me.

518
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,004
You won't believe what's happened.

519
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:47,964
Braithwaite's handed in her notice.
What? Why?

520
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:50,244
Family troubles. Or so she says.

521
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:55,124
Are we living under a curse, doomed to
lose our lady's maids at regular intervals?

522
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:57,164
Anna, did you know about this?

523
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,004
Is anything the matter?

524
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:04,524
No, m'lord. You seem very quiet
lately.

525
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,564
I hope Bates is behaving himself.

526
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,284
He never does anything else.

527
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:12,804
Will that be all, m'lady? Yes, thank
you.

528
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:17,484
Did they tell you Tony Gillingham's
asked himself for the night? They have.

529
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,844
We must try not to read too much
into it.

530
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:24,164
Why are you in your rompers?

531
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:26,284
Tony only brought black tie.

532
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:29,204
He didn't think we'd be changing if
no-one was staying.

533
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:31,844
So another brick is pulled from the
wall.

534
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:35,684
Why is Lord Gillingham back so soon?

535
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:38,164
That's the big question. But we're
very glad he is.

536
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,084
Not all of us, I imagine.

537
00:34:41,124 --> 00:34:45,604
Are you ready to go? Carson says the
car's outside. Oh, yes, I think so.

538
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:49,644
So, you're off in the morning? I am.
Pity we didn't get Edith to wait a day.

539
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,684
Why did she go to London, anyway?

540
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:54,204
I asked but she assumed an air of
mystery.

541
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:57,444
Honestly, Papa. Edith's about as
mysterious as a bucket.

542
00:34:57,484 --> 00:34:59,284
She's gone to see Michael Gregson.

543
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:03,004
Ooh, that's the next thing to look
forward to. I don't dislike him.

544
00:35:03,364 --> 00:35:05,364
Oh, what a recommendation.

545
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,924
Goodnight, dear. Goodnight, Granny.

546
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:12,084
Goodnight, Lord Gillingham.
Goodnight. Goodnight, Isobel.
Goodnight.

547
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,644
Goodnight, Lord Gillingham.

548
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:20,284
I hope we see you up here again
before too long. I hope so, too.

549
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:27,244
That was nobly done. Mm-hm.

550
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:29,284
She is a good woman

551
00:35:29,324 --> 00:35:32,204
and, while the phrase is enough to
set one's teeth on edge,

552
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:36,124
there are moments when her virtue
demands admiration.

553
00:35:36,404 --> 00:35:39,844
I agree, although I'm rather
surprised to hear you say it.

554
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:42,324
Not as surprised as I am.

555
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,804
Ah, Monk's left the coffee.

556
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:49,844
He's cleared off till the morning.

557
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:53,764
Does that mean we have to do the
washing up? No, he'll do that tomorrow.

558
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,244
He comes back at eight. That's quite
a discipline.

559
00:35:57,764 --> 00:35:59,644
Why do you say that?

560
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:02,084
It reminds me of Lady Warwick

561
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:04,444
having the stable bell at Easton
rung at six,

562
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:08,804
so everyone had to time to get to the right
beds before the maids and valets arrived.

563
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:11,524
Isn't that apocryphal? No, actually.

564
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:14,964
Papa and Mama stayed there once and
said it was quite true.

565
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:18,804
Of course they already were in the
right bed.

566
00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:23,484
I don't know why I said all that. I
hope I do.

567
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:26,964
Don't be silly.

568
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:29,164
Will you miss me? Of course.

569
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:33,604
Is it really only a week until you
leave? Mm.

570
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:38,244
Is there anything I can do to keep
things running whilst you're in Munich?

571
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:41,764
Well, as a matter of fact I've got
something I want you to sign.

572
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:45,284
It will give you some authority over
my affairs.

573
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:47,324
Come here.

574
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:57,804
What'll you do when you get there?

575
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,404
Well, I thought I'd write a novel.

576
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:03,924
Or try to. I always fancied myself a
novelist and never had the time.

577
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:05,964
Now I've got nothing but.

578
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,284
How long is it going to take? I'm
not sure.

579
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:11,804
I'll set the wheels in motion when I
arrive

580
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:14,164
and we'll stop when and if we hit a
rock.

581
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:16,324
But the lawyers are quite
optimistic.

582
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,684
I thought lawyers were never
optimistic.

583
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:20,724
That's why it's a good sign.

584
00:37:22,644 --> 00:37:24,644
Are we going out tonight?

585
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:28,044
Rose was talking about the new band
at the Lotus Club.

586
00:37:28,084 --> 00:37:31,484
Hm. Well, no, I hadn't planned on
going anywhere.

587
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,284
No?

588
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:36,204
No.

589
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,844
Michael, I... Oh, my darling.

590
00:37:57,634 --> 00:38:00,594
So I can move back in? Edna's room
will be empty now

591
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:04,434
and if I'm to dress her ladyship and
Lady Mary, I think it makes sense.

592
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,879
If that's what you really want.

593
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,399
I'm sorry it didn't work out with
Miss Braithwaite.

594
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:19,679
Not that I care much for her.

595
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,439
I'm sorry about the disruption for
her ladyship.

596
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,559
One day I'll tell you the whole
story. Then you'll be less sorry.

597
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,399
The truth is we were mad as hatters
to let her back in the house.

598
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,359
I've got a present for you.

599
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,919
It's for your desk.

600
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,079
What made you think of that?

601
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,719
It's good for you to be reminded you
once had a heart.

602
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,399
And it'll reassure the staff to know
you belong to the human race.

603
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,039
This frame looks expensive.

604
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,479
She was pretty though, wasn't she?

605
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:05,039
She was. Very pretty.

606
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,479
And I'm sure she was very nice.

607
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:10,239
And now you can look at that and
remember her.

608
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,439
You're right, Mrs Hughes. I will.

609
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:19,377
The business of life is the
acquisition of memories.

610
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:22,617
In the end that's all there is.

611
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:26,417
Thank you.

612
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:34,337
Bates, do you know anything about
why Braithwaite left?

613
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:36,377
I don't, m'lord.

614
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,537
They say she had some troubles at
home.

615
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:41,017
I hope it's not too much for Anna.

616
00:39:45,857 --> 00:39:47,857
Bates?

617
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:51,857
She wants to move back into the
house, m'lord.

618
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,457
She says she needs to if she is to
perform her duties properly.

619
00:39:57,257 --> 00:39:59,257
Is something wrong between you?

620
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:03,577
Yes.

621
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,817
But I don't know what it is.

622
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:10,097
She says it's nothing I've done but
I can't believe that.

623
00:40:10,137 --> 00:40:12,937
It must be my fault because she is
incapable of fault.

624
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:17,617
I don't know what to do.

625
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:21,377
There is no such thing as a marriage
between two intelligent people

626
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:24,417
that does not sometimes have to
negotiate thin ice.

627
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:26,457
I know.

628
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:28,577
You must wait until things become
clear.

629
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:30,617
And they will.

630
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:33,137
The damage cannot be irreparable

631
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:35,897
when a man and a woman love each
other as much as you do.

632
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:41,097
My goodness, that was strong talk
for an Englishman.

633
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:03,897
I don't really want to go back
to London,

634
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:05,937
but I suppose I have to. Hm.

635
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,297
That's after I get your answer, that
is.

636
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:12,657
I was wondering how long it would
take you to get to the point.

637
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:16,257
Are you ready?

638
00:41:17,337 --> 00:41:19,337
What happens if I refuse?

639
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:21,857
We both know I must marry.

640
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:25,617
I don't need to explain to you how
the system we're trapped in works.

641
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:28,137
Please, don't rush into anything.

642
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:32,057
I won't make a fool of Mabel. It
wouldn't be fair.

643
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:37,417
I'd break up with her for you and I will
credit her by saying that she'd understand.

644
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:40,857
She sounds rather fine.

645
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:45,737
If you don't want me then...

646
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,777
I think I'm honour-bound to go
through with it.

647
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:00,177
It's no good, Tony.

648
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,137
I can't.

649
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:05,577
I'm not free of him.

650
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:10,057
Yesterday you said I fill your
brain.

651
00:42:11,017 --> 00:42:14,617
Well, Matthew fills mine.

652
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:17,497
Still.

653
00:42:18,857 --> 00:42:20,857
And I don't want to be without him.

654
00:42:21,937 --> 00:42:23,937
Not yet.

655
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:38,697
Can I ask one favour?

656
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:43,337
And then I really will go and leave
you in peace.

657
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:47,297
What is it? Will you kiss me?

658
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:51,617
Please.

659
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:54,817
I will never love again as I love
you in this moment.

660
00:42:57,097 --> 00:42:59,217
And I must have something to
remember.

661
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:23,977
Goodbye, Mary.

662
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:26,817
My darling Mary.

663
00:43:27,817 --> 00:43:30,537
My prayers go with you for
everything that you do.

664
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:46,377
May I have a word, your lordship?
Hm.

665
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:48,497
If Miss Braithwaite is not coming
back,

666
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:51,737
I wondered if her replacement had
been decided on. Not yet.

667
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:56,657
I have a candidate I'd like to put forward who I
know very well and is more than qualified.

668
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:59,777
You must discuss it with her
ladyship but I've no objection.

669
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:03,217
She's a little older than Miss
Braithwaite. That won't hurt.

670
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:06,097
Why do you say that? No reason.

671
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:10,457
Where's Tony? Has he gone? He
thought he'd said all his goodbyes

672
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:12,857
and he wanted to catch the half past
nine.

673
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:15,217
Are you ready? Where are you going?

674
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:18,137
York. For estimates to re-equip the
saw mill.

675
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,337
So, will we be seeing Tony
Gillingham again?

676
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:24,137
I'm sure we will... eventually.

677
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:28,297
He was telling me about Mabel Lane
Fox.

678
00:44:28,337 --> 00:44:30,537
Apparently, they're getting engaged.

679
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:33,377
I imagine he'll be very taken up
with that.

680
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:36,097
Yes, I dare say.

681
00:44:36,897 --> 00:44:38,897
Right, I'll get my hat.

682
00:44:47,297 --> 00:44:49,137
There you are.

683
00:44:49,177 --> 00:44:50,937
Well, you don't look too bad.

684
00:44:50,977 --> 00:44:53,697
I thought you might be a little the
worse for wear.

685
00:44:53,737 --> 00:44:56,777
Why should I be? After only two
hours' sleep.

686
00:44:57,777 --> 00:45:02,857
My maid saw you come in. Aren't you
going to tell me what kept you out
until six in the morning?

687
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:05,937
Well, we...

688
00:45:06,457 --> 00:45:09,737
Please don't say you were talking
and you lost track of time.

689
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:13,137
Quite apart from the morality - or
lack of it in this situation -

690
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,497
you do realise you are taking a
great risk?

691
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,977
You're trusting this man with your
name and your reputation.

692
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,497
He wants to marry me. Of course I
trust him.

693
00:45:23,537 --> 00:45:25,617
As you trusted Sir Anthony Strallan?

694
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:30,257
That was rather unkind.

695
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:35,217
Are you going to tell Mama?

696
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:38,257
No.

697
00:45:38,297 --> 00:45:41,257
You're a grown woman and I'm not a
spy.

698
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:45,217
But you're gambling with your
future, my dear.

699
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,337
Be under no illusions.

700
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:51,497
A lot may be changing, but some
things will stay the same.

701
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:55,657
I'm not a bit sorry. No, you don't
look sorry.

702
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:59,937
But you may find yourself feeling
very sorry later.

703
00:46:11,337 --> 00:46:14,217
You seem more cheerful than you were
in London. I am.

704
00:46:14,657 --> 00:46:17,737
I took your advice. I talked it over
and I'm off the hook.

705
00:46:18,697 --> 00:46:20,697
So whatever it was, it's gone away?

706
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,817
I think so.

707
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:24,857
I envy you.

708
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:26,417
Why?

709
00:46:26,457 --> 00:46:30,377
Because I've just done something which
I have a sneaking fear I may regret...

710
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:32,937
for a long time to come.

711
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:52,377
My life is perfect and then, in the
space of one day, it is nothing.

712
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:54,457
Good morning, Miss Baxter. Hello, Mr
Bates.

713
00:46:54,497 --> 00:46:56,497
What do you make of her? She's nice.

714
00:46:56,537 --> 00:47:00,137
How are you getting on with her
ladyship? That is so considerate.

715
00:47:00,177 --> 00:47:02,897
She'll be eating out of your hand.
That's the intention.

716
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:06,497
You owe your place to Mrs Crawley.
She would not let me go until I'd promised.

717
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:10,417
You make me sound very fervent. Wars
have been waged with less fervour.

718
00:47:10,457 --> 00:47:13,537
His forebears have been tenants
since the reign of George III.

719
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:15,977
Be that as it may the rent's not
been paid for ages.

720
00:47:16,017 --> 00:47:19,158
We gave your father a long time. You
want to farm the land yourself.

721
00:47:19,222 --> 00:47:52,280
