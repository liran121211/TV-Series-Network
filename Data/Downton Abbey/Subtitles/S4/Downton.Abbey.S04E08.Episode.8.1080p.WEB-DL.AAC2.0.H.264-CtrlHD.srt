2
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,531
I assume Drewe knows we're coming.

3
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,325
I sent a note yesterday.

4
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,704
Have the pigs recovered,
do you think?

5
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,422
They look in good shape to me,
after the shock of their arrival.

6
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:52,966
But why didn't he check to see

7
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:55,428
they all had water
before he left for the night?

8
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,724
Maybe he thought a full trough
was enough.

9
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,643
He wasn't to know
they'd kick it over.

10
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,105
Mr Branson is right.
He should have made sure.

11
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,691
You would have done.

12
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,402
Where did you learn about pigs?

13
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:07,697
We've always had pigs at Yew Tree,
m'lady.

14
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,992
Not many,
but enough to learn their ways.

15
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:11,828
Thank heavens you did.

16
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,460
So, have you found a man
to take over?

17
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:18,213
Not yet.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,513
First, we'd like to know
if you'd want the job.

19
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:28,103
Me? You mean I'm to manage the pigs
for the estate, as well as my farm?

20
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:30,565
It's asking a lot.

21
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:33,611
I can do it. If you're sure.

22
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:36,533
Let's give it a try,
see how we get on.

23
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,744
I'm very grateful, m'lady.

24
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:42,750
This is the second good turn
I've received from your family,

25
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,755
and I just hope
I can pay back a favour one day.

26
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,215
How nice of you.

27
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,302
I don't know if it's much of
a favour.

28
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:53,433
We're giving you a lot of work.
Work's like old age, m'lady.

29
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:56,939
The worst thing in the world
except for the alternative.

30
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,201
It's only me.

31
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:09,833
I always feel that greeting betrays
such a lack of self worth.

32
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:14,340
How are we today?

33
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:18,513
My dear, please stop talking to me
as if I were a child past hope.

34
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,600
Very well. How are you feeling?

35
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,811
Like Doctor Manette.

36
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,732
If I don't get out of this house
soon,

37
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:27,902
I shall remember nothing
but my number.

38
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:31,282
Then why don't we walk to the Abbey
this afternoon, if it's fine?

39
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:33,411
Hear how Robert's getting on
in America.

40
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,373
Is it really called
the Tea Pot Dome scandal?

41
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:39,169
It seems so unlikely.
What's it about?

42
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,842
What is it always about?
Bribery and corruption.

43
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:47,349
Taking money
to allow private companies

44
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,937
to drill for oil on Government land.

45
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,066
Mr Levinson has
one of these companies?

46
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,651
I assume so.

47
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:58,198
Have you ever met him?
Once. At the wedding.

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,953
And once was quite enough.

49
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,626
I can't tell you how thrilling
that sounds. I'll be waiting for you.

50
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:08,130
We'll have such a lovely day.

51
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,428
Who was that?
No-one. Just a friend.

52
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,723
You have to pull your weight
with the bazaar.

53
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:16,560
It seems to have crept up on me.

54
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:18,521
Does Cousin Robert usually do it?

55
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:20,941
He does. Half the village
hates the other half

56
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:24,739
and only he can stop them
tearing each other's throats out.

57
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,932
I admire that. It's a real skill.

58
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:48,608
Mr Molesley, erm,
is it true that you were a valet?

59
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,236
For the late Mr Crawley?

60
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:52,948
And butler to his mother
before that.

61
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,497
I've come down in the world.
You can climb up again.

62
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:02,922
Maybe. But life kicks the stuffing
out of you sometimes, doesn't it?

63
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:07,303
Oh, I've had my stuffing kicked out
more than once.

64
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:09,974
I've woken and wondered
if there was any point to it.

65
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,064
Yet here I am,
lady's maid to a countess.

66
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:17,152
So, it can happen.

67
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,156
Now you've made me curious.

68
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:23,954
I'm curious about something
and you could help me.

69
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:29,754
Do you know if Mr and Mrs Bates
have had a falling out?

70
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:33,510
Mr and Mrs Bates?
That doesn't sound very likely.

71
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:35,680
Can I ask you
to put that machine away?

72
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,893
We'll be laying for tea in a minute.
Of course.

73
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:42,691
Is everything ready
for the servants' tea?

74
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:48,241
Oh, is it just me or do we have
twice the bills we used to?

75
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:50,327
Ivy, this is for you.

76
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:54,792
Did you find those oyster shells
for the kettle?

77
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,546
I've put them in. About time.
It were full of scale.

78
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,933
What in God's name was that about?

79
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:08,688
Don't rise to it. She just wants us
to think her life's interesting.

80
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,492
Anything interesting?
I'm reading about County Politics.

81
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:19,371
They're looking for candidates
for the local Council.

82
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:21,792
Why don't you put yourself forward?

83
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,172
But what are my politics these days?
I'm not sure.

84
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:27,217
You could always read a bit
about it.

85
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,807
You won't find many books
on the Liberal ideals in this room.

86
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,561
And nothing at all about Socialism.

87
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:37,858
If you're serious about driving me
to Thirsk tomorrow,

88
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,403
perhaps we might find some then.

89
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,576
Are you better now, Granny?

90
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:47,581
If you'd been to see me, you'd know.

91
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:51,754
Don't bully me. I'm not up to it.

92
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:54,258
No. Rosamund told me.

93
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:58,431
When? What did she say?

94
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:02,103
Only that you needed
a little cherishing, that's all.

95
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,483
So Mr Drewe's accepted your officer.

96
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,944
I'm so pleased.

97
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:09,698
The Drewes have been at
Yew Tree Farm for many years.

98
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,744
I suppose you think
that's sentimental bosh, Mr Blake.

99
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,331
Don't be too hard on him, Granny.

100
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:18,419
Mr Blake has a softer side
than we first gave him credit for.

101
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,883
I'm relieved to hear I am redeemed
before we leave for London.

102
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,345
I hope I'm forgiven, too.

103
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:27,809
I know you thought me very snobbish
when you first arrived.

104
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,067
I don't blame you. Given my work,
I came as an envoy of the enemy.

105
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:36,572
Are we too early?
Bring them in, Nanny.

106
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:39,159
I don't think anyone will mind.

107
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:42,164
Your Papa might,
but he isn't here to complain.

108
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:45,127
One moment, darling,
while Mummy puts away her cup.

109
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:48,799
Oh, here, let me. Hello there.

110
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,593
Oh, it's all right.

111
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:54,057
He's turning into quite a bruiser.

112
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,978
Yes, and I must go.
Stay and have some dinner, Mama.

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,774
You needn't change.
No. Thank you, my dear, but no.

114
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:03,613
You should change and I should go.

115
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:12,293
When you go down, can you give
a message to Mrs Hughes?

116
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:13,503
Of course.

117
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:16,007
Lord Gillingham telephoned today.

118
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,970
He wants to break his journey home.

119
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,472
Tomorrow night.

120
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,392
He'll be here again?

121
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,815
You're right.
I shouldn't encourage him,

122
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:31,489
but I couldn't think what to say
to persuade him not to.

123
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,952
Do you think me very feeble?

124
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,877
It's not that, m'lady.

125
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,796
Then what is it?

126
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:47,680
Anna?

127
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,104
It's nothing to bother you with.
Please bother me.

128
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,740
If I did, you'd have to promise
to do nothing about it.

129
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:02,745
But how does this concern
Lord Gillingham?

130
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,378
It doesn't, m'lady. It's nothing to
do with Lord Gillingham himself.

131
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,258
But then...
It's his man, m'lady.

132
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:15,305
His servant, Mr Green,
who travels with him.

133
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,441
Oh, my God.

134
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,322
But the police ought to -
No!

135
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:29,243
I must tell Lord Gillingham.
No, m'lady, you promised.

136
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:31,413
Mr Bates doesn't know it was him.

137
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:32,790
But the more he comes here,

138
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:35,586
the more likely it is
that Mr Bates will find out.

139
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:39,926
Then I'll telephone him and tell him
not to come, or not to bring Green.

140
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:43,682
I'm frightened every time Mr Green
and Mr Bates are in the same room.

141
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,979
You think, if he guesses,
he'll do something.

142
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,860
And if he does, they'll hang him.

143
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,447
Or lock him up
and throw away the key.

144
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:57,870
Jimmy, the savouries can go in
and Daisy'll bring up the sauce.

145
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,045
And now perhaps you can explain why

146
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:06,383
you have apparently been
under hypnosis since dinner began.

147
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:08,887
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.

148
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,683
Mooning about
like a sloth under water.

149
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,352
Well?

150
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:16,023
You know I had a letter earlier?

151
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:18,944
It were from Alfred.
It seems his father died

152
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:21,489
and Alfred's coming up
for the funeral.

153
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:23,910
Oh, I am sorry.
That's not all.

154
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:25,788
He says he wants to marry me.

155
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:27,832
What?! Just like that?

156
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,962
He says the way I behaved
towards him when he were last here

157
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,591
made him hope
that things had changed between us.

158
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,804
Well, you were very friendly.
That's not all.

159
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:39,517
He wants me to leave Downton
and go up to London.

160
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,313
He says he can find me a job.
Blimey.

161
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:44,441
He puts a lot in a letter,
does Alfred.

162
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,529
They're serving the savouries.
We'll talk about it later.

163
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:50,242
Now, er,
put the water on for the coffee.

164
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:03,345
That's enough for one day, surely.
You can finish them tomorrow.

165
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:08,686
Shall we walk back to the cottage?
The others are going to bed.

166
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:10,940
What were you saying to Mrs Hughes?

167
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:14,904
Just that Lord Gillingham's
asked himself for the night again.

168
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,326
He can't stay away.

169
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,663
Yes. It's a bit of a tangle.

170
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,000
Do you think she's sweet on him?

171
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,630
They're sweet on each other, but
it's not as simple as that, is it?

172
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:32,222
Then there's Mr Blake.
I thought she didn't like him.

173
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,101
She didn't. At first.

174
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:39,525
Anyway,
they can sort it out between them.

175
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,449
And Mr Green.

176
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,831
He'll be coming back.

177
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:54,589
Have you gone off him?

178
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,384
Why do you say that?

179
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:58,721
You liked him so much
when he first came.

180
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:02,643
You thought he was funny.
Did I?

181
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,771
I can't remember.

182
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,070
So, you're pleased with Mr Drewe?

183
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,092
I am. And I'm very pleased with the
pigs too. They're a grand addition.

184
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,659
When they've settled,
you ought to consider dairy.

185
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,410
Another job
for the splendid Mr Drewe.

186
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,088
I think he IS rather splendid.

187
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,134
He seems to want to make farming
at Downton his life's work.

188
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,553
That's very lyrical.

189
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:29,392
Lady Rosamund Painswick
is on the telephone, m'lady.

190
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,112
Do you have anything planned
for today?

191
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,826
Some shopping. That's all.

192
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,873
Do you think I should write
and give him my answer?

193
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:46,961
If you're sure about it.
I don't want to marry Alfred.

194
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,630
Then there's no more to be said.

195
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:51,760
Even if I did, I wouldn't care to
tie myself down yet.

196
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:54,180
How do I know
what life has in store?

197
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:58,061
You're a very optimistic generation,
I'll say that.

198
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,314
What are you talking about?
Nothing.

199
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:03,903
I wish you'd say, cos it's clear
as day you're up to something.

200
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:06,323
None of us know
when Papa's coming back.

201
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:09,662
But yes,
we must tell her before then.

202
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:12,207
In fact, I've had an idea.

203
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:17,757
Well, if you're sure, then why not?

204
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,723
We've already got friends of Mary
staying. Ring with the train time.

205
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,267
'Bye-bye dear.'

206
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:27,856
Who was that?
Aunt Rosamund.

207
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:31,695
She's coming to see how Granny is.
Why are you down so early?

208
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:35,493
I've got to check some figures with
Tom before he goes into Thirsk.

209
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,788
Quite the businesswoman.

210
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,418
We must rise to life's challenges.

211
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,882
Yes, I suppose we must.

212
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:50,349
Let's meet in the book shop
in ten minutes.

213
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,186
I've got some letters to post.
I'll see you there.

214
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:06,664
Thank you.

215
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,585
Good day.

216
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:31,118
Don't, don't do that.

217
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,999
You mustn't be so self-conscious.

218
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,629
A black singer with the daughter of
a marquess in a Yorkshire town?

219
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:42,343
Why should we attract any attention?
Well, that's their problem.

220
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,096
It doesn't have to be ours.

221
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,107
I'm terribly puffed
that you made the journey.

222
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,736
Me too, but...
But what?

223
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:57,158
I hope we're brave enough for this.
Of course we are!

224
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,246
Isn't it time people knew
there are bigger and better values

225
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,416
than the mean-spirited ones
they live by?

226
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,961
Does Lady Grantham know
you're out for the day?

227
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:08,174
It won't matter
as long as I'm back for dinner.

228
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,973
Are you playing tonight?
I wouldn't be here if I were.

229
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:14,768
I can stay for as long as you want.

230
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:18,398
Well, I want you to stay forever,
but six o'clock will do.

231
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,282
You're not very talkative.
What's the matter?

232
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:26,243
I was thinking about
a couple of people

233
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:28,831
who are in a situation
which will cause trouble.

234
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:31,543
Will it make them unhappy?

235
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:34,840
It's hard to say.

236
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:38,345
It'll make some people unhappy.

237
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:41,308
I thought I might make some coffee.
Would you like a cup?

238
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,186
No, thank you.

239
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:48,193
It's just coffee. You won't have to
surrender any of your independence.

240
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:52,408
Er, you win.

241
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,370
Er, milk but no sugar.

242
00:14:57,124 --> 00:14:59,169
Miss Baxter,

243
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,590
I do know what it's like,
to feel fragile.

244
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:05,511
I've felt fragile my whole life.

245
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,771
You'll have realised by now that,
down here,

246
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:15,819
we don't much care for Mr Barrow,
which may offend you.

247
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,656
I'm not... offended.

248
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:23,080
But I wish you'd give us credit for
making up our own minds about you.

249
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,095
Hello.

250
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:37,978
This is Miss...
Bunting. Sarah Bunting.

251
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,022
And this is Mrs Crawley.

252
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:44,112
I met Miss Bunting at the political
meeting you sent me to. In Ripon.

253
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:47,283
Ah, so that was the reason.
Why do you say that?

254
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,204
He wasn't exactly enthralled
to the cause of the Liberals.

255
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:54,377
Though I'm not now convinced
by his Socialism. Why not?

256
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:57,883
I didn't know then that you were
the land agent and son-in-law

257
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:00,887
of our local milord.
I'm surprised I'm so famous.

258
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,932
Won't you defend your principles?

259
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:04,935
No, not now.

260
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:08,399
Then I will. Mr Branson
is a keen political thinker.

261
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:12,029
He proves this by not being afraid
to question his own beliefs.

262
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,286
Very eloquent.
I'd stay to argue, but I'm late.

263
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,208
Do you live around here?

264
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,836
I work here.

265
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:24,048
At the school.

266
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,759
It was nice to see you again.

267
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,933
Hello, Miss.
Hello.

268
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,564
She knows her own mind.
Yes, I think she does.

269
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:39,655
Apparently, he left the Dalrymples
straight after breakfast,

270
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,492
so I missed him when I telephoned.

271
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:47,333
You did your best.
I am so sorry.

272
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,630
Come in!

273
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:56,221
No tails? You know Granny's coming.

274
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:58,850
Oh, God, is she? I didn't realise.

275
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,731
No, don't change. It's time
she learned about the real world.

276
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,027
A phrase with more than
one definition.

277
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,952
Can I have a word?

278
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:15,876
I've seen something,

279
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,672
and I'm not saying
there's anything wrong about it,

280
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:21,260
but I'd feel uncomfortable
if I kept it to myself.

281
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,471
I'm all ears.

282
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:27,310
This morning in Thirsk...
I saw Rose.

283
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:30,440
Yes, she was shopping.

284
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,779
No, she was not shopping.

285
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,493
She was... meeting a man.

286
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,165
I saw her as she reached up
to stroke his cheek.

287
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,877
Oh, golly. Who is it this time?

288
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,635
It was Jack Ross -
the singer with the band

289
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,554
who came up for your father's party.

290
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:54,059
Well, that's it. I've told you
and I have nothing more to add.

291
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,452
Anna?

292
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:09,458
She's told you, then?

293
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,546
Don't give me away Mrs Hughes,
please.

294
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:15,091
I can get through it.

295
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,808
My maid said
you were waiting in here.

296
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,811
Everyone else
is in the drawing room.

297
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:26,275
I know,
but I thought you'd want to hear.

298
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:29,906
I think I know how
I can keep the baby.

299
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,284
What? How?

300
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,247
There's a tenant farmer,

301
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,295
whose family has been at Downton for
years. I'm sure he can be trusted.

302
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,632
This is very reckless.

303
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,972
Well, what would you suggest?

304
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:50,854
I'd suggest that we go away,

305
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,693
you and me, on an extended trip
to... somewhere.

306
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:58,991
Then the baby can be adopted by
a childless couple in that country,

307
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,871
wherever it may be,
and they are made very happy.

308
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:03,957
And the baby is happy,
and you are...

309
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:08,631
well, if not happy, at least free.

310
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:12,178
But I wouldn't be part of
its growing up?

311
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,849
You wouldn't be part of its life.

312
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,605
Why is my idea so reckless?

313
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:20,733
Oh my dear, where shall I start?

314
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,529
Suppose the farmer talks?

315
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:26,116
Suppose you're seen
visiting his home,

316
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:28,161
which I presume is the idea?

317
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:32,417
Suppose the baby looks like you
and people in the village notice?

318
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,671
Suppose you talk?

319
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:41,014
I left a list somewhere
that I need for Mrs Patmore.

320
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,017
You know Lord Gillingham is here.

321
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,521
Er, yes. We were just chatting.
We're coming now.

322
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:48,316
I'm desperately trying to take
control of the bazaar.

323
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:51,947
Talk about herding cats.
I'll stay and help if you want.

324
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,867
You may regret saying that.

325
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:57,747
And while I'm here, we can discuss
a plan that I'd like to get settled.

326
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:02,588
I've always wanted to speak
better French than I do,

327
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,804
so I thought I'd take a few months
off, go to... Switzerland

328
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:11,811
and really learn it.
I see. Not France?

329
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:13,939
You know what the French are like.

330
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,650
While Switzerland is so clean.

331
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:20,240
And they have wonderful hospitals...
in case we get ill.

332
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:25,415
We? I wondered if Edith might like
to come. Keep me company.

333
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:27,292
I'll pay.

334
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:29,713
What do you have to say about that?

335
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,676
I'd like to.

336
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:37,141
Goodness. Oh. Well... why not?

337
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:40,730
Golly, life is full of surprises.

338
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:44,485
But I'd better check to see that
the young men are keeping the peace.

339
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:53,082
So we won't have to tell her?

340
00:20:53,123 --> 00:20:55,961
I don't think we need to, do you?

341
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:03,514
Can you really afford to spend four
months reading novels in the Alps?

342
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:06,560
Why ask the question
when the decision has been made?

343
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:10,316
Come on, we ought to join the others.

344
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:16,242
Have you been wandering round
Scotland since we saw you?

345
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:19,121
I have. I was on the Spey.

346
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:22,042
I did a tour of the cousinage,
then a wedding in Ayrshire.

347
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:25,756
I've enjoyed myself.
It gave me time to think for once.

348
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:28,051
Oh, what about particularly?

349
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,430
My life, I suppose.

350
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,892
Everyone should, from time to time.

351
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:37,399
Oh, I can't agree. In my experience
it's a dangerous occupation.

352
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:40,737
Dangerous?
Well, no life appears rewarding

353
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,365
if you think too much about it.

354
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:45,787
I gather you've launched into pigs
these days.

355
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:48,624
Yes. And their arrival
was quite the adventure,

356
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,422
in which Mr Blake and Mary
were the hero and heroine.

357
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:55,385
Is this what you wouldn't tell me
when I was last here?

358
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:58,723
Only because I didn't want to make
too much of it.

359
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:02,604
Lady Mary was perfectly splendid.
Lady Mary IS perfectly splendid.

360
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:05,358
Really, Charles,
are you a pig expert, as well?

361
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,987
He was that night, thank heaven.

362
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:10,992
Rosamund and Edith
have some exciting news.

363
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,411
What's that?

364
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:15,832
We're going on a sabbatical
so we can really improve our French.

365
00:22:15,874 --> 00:22:18,879
The only thing I ever learned from
my governess was how to say

366
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,134
"please", "thank you"
and "I have a temperature."

367
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,596
Very useful if one were travelling.

368
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:27,475
Do you remember her, Mama?
She was always in tears.

369
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:31,648
Oh, poor Mademoiselle. Her life was
full of... complications.

370
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:35,237
I think she quite enjoyed it,
though.

371
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,699
But why you?
You don't want to learn French.

372
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:41,455
Or is this an incognito search
for the missing Mr Gregson?

373
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:44,584
Don't tease her.
It's much more serious than that.

374
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,629
Thank you, Tom.

375
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:49,759
If you must know,
I fancy getting away for a bit.

376
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,138
Oh. Like Lord Gillingham,

377
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:55,267
thinking his way around
the Highlands.

378
00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:00,358
I like Scotland, me. At least,
I would if I'd ever been there.

379
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,572
Well, I've had a bellyful of heather
and no mistake.

380
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:06,409
Aren't you going to fight back,
Mrs Hughes?

381
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,164
Mr Green can think what he likes.

382
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:14,839
So you're glad
you're on your way to London?

383
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:17,843
It'll be all I can do to stop
singing when I get in the car.

384
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:22,559
Where do you live when you're there?
His lordship's got a set at Albany.

385
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,146
Is that handy for the West End?
You're joking.

386
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:27,483
Piccadilly one end,
Saville Row the other.

387
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:30,321
Oh, you lucky tyke.
I AM a lucky tyke.

388
00:23:30,362 --> 00:23:34,160
Do you like London, Miss Baxter?
Not particularly.

389
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:37,540
I lived there at one time
but it didn't work for me.

390
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,628
What about you, Anna? Do you fancy
a taste of Mr Green's life?

391
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,881
I'm happy where I am, thank you.

392
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:49,224
Rose was badgering me
about going up to London again

393
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:53,272
but she's been enough lately,
don't you think? I certainly do.

394
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:56,569
After all, she's got to have
some novelty when we bring her out.

395
00:23:56,611 --> 00:24:00,241
Quite right.
She can help with the bazaar.

396
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:02,995
That'll take her mind off things.

397
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,167
Trouble is, parenting an adult

398
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,879
especially when it's someone
else's daughter -

399
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:11,717
is really a matter of
mutual agreement.

400
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,429
There's a limit to how much
one can simply forbid.

401
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:17,726
Sshh. Here she is.
Actually, I want a word with her.

402
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:22,358
Rose, darling. Can I drag you into
my room for a moment?

403
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:29,244
Anna, could you leave us
for a minute?

404
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:30,913
Of course.

405
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:38,383
This is early for you to go to bed.
I had rather a tiring day.

406
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:40,219
So I heard.

407
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,515
Well, I heard you had
an interesting day.

408
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:47,354
Whether or not it was tiring,
you know better than I.

409
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,402
Who told you?

410
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:55,492
My dear, all I want is for you
not to lose control of your life.

411
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:57,286
I love him.

412
00:24:57,328 --> 00:25:00,875
And I won't listen to any
imperialist nonsense

413
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,419
about racial purity

414
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,465
and how he should be horsewhipped
for daring to dream.

415
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:07,552
Don't you know me better than that?

416
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:09,388
I'm going to marry him, Mary.

417
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,226
I don't care what it costs
and I won't keep it a secret.

418
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,062
Not once I've told Mummy.

419
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:17,609
I want to see her face crumble
when she finds out.

420
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,320
Rose!

421
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:29,678
I feel we're driving you away.

422
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,952
Oh, hardly. We're in grave danger
of outstaying our welcome.

423
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,912
If Tony hadn't offered us a lift
we'd be here forever.

424
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,916
I hope you'll be back soon.
Good luck with your bazaar.

425
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:41,879
Can't you stay and lend me a hand?
Don't tempt me.

426
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:44,675
I'm so grateful for your advice
and wisdom.

427
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:48,556
And not least for the very practical
and muddy pig rescue.

428
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:51,352
Glad to be of service, m'lady.

429
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:58,947
Are you going straight there?
We might stop for some lunch...

430
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,991
It's kind of you
to give them a lift.

431
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:04,831
Pure self interest. I couldn't leave
Charles here, alone with you.

432
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,379
Will you let me see you
when you're next down south?

433
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:12,926
What would be the point, Tony?

434
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:15,931
I'm never going to be your mistress.

435
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:18,017
That's not me at all.

436
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:21,815
I've made up my mind
to call off the engagement.

437
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:25,696
Does Mabel know?
Not yet.

438
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:29,994
I haven't been in London since...
and I must tell her face to face.

439
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:35,085
Of course you must, but I wish
you'd think seriously before you do.

440
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,464
You mean you're going to
turn me down again.

441
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:41,303
I've told you
I'm not on the market, Tony.

442
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:43,598
I'm not free.

443
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,896
Sometimes I almost wish I were,
but I'm not.

444
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:50,525
And that's all there is to it.

445
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,574
Oh, you have been incredibly kind
to put up with us for so long.

446
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,329
We'll miss you.
The house will seem rather empty.

447
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,375
If it were my choice,
I should never be away from here.

448
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,880
Can I ask you one thing?
How do you feel about your man?

449
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,886
I'm still not very keen on him.
Why?

450
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:15,062
We'd better get started.
So, this really is goodbye.

451
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:16,940
Not for long, I hope.

452
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:19,611
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

453
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:42,062
I'm sorry to see them go.
Not as sorry as Mary.

454
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,898
What's a group noun for suitors?

455
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,195
What do you think? A desire?

456
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,740
A desire of suitors. Very good.

457
00:27:49,782 --> 00:27:53,997
If you're going to talk nonsense,
I have better things to do.

458
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:03,469
I've posted the letter.
Well, he'll probably still come.

459
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,724
He's got to be in Yorkshire for
the funeral, whatever you said.

460
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:08,686
Whatever she said to who?

461
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,234
Oh, just tell me.
I know you've got a secret,

462
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:16,406
and if you're trying to spare
my feelings it's not working.

463
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:18,242
Alfred's written.

464
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:20,829
His father's died,
so he's coming for the burial.

465
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:24,668
He wants to look in and see us all.
See us all, or see her?

466
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:29,634
Alfred's asked me to marry him.
But she's turned him down.

467
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:33,807
So his heart's broken properly
this time. Are you satisfied now?

468
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,895
Why don't we leave the subject
there? We don't want to fall out.

469
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:39,524
We can't fall out,
we've never fallen in!

470
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:47,787
So they got off in good order.

471
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:51,167
I wonder how long it'll take
for them all to propose to Mary.

472
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:53,587
Isn't Lord Gillingham engaged?

473
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:57,844
He's supposed to be, but he still
seems as keen as mustard.

474
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,641
Well, that is very interesting.

475
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:05,355
But it's not why I asked you here.

476
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,483
Oh?
No.

477
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:11,698
I want to know what you were doing
at Downton.

478
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,618
I don't understand.

479
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:16,873
Why shouldn't I come to Downton?
I grew up here.

480
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:20,754
I see I'll have to take
the slow path.

481
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:26,053
You telephone to say
Edith is to be cherished,

482
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:28,682
but you don't say why.

483
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:30,936
Didn't I?
No.

484
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:35,192
Next, you invite yourself to Downton
and reveal at dinner

485
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:40,784
that you and Edith are retreating
to the continent for several months

486
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:44,540
so you can improve your French.
Yes.

487
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:49,255
Rosamund has no interest in French.

488
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:53,804
If she wishes to be understood
by a foreigner, she shouts.

489
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:55,181
That's not fair.

490
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,063
Isn't it time
one of you told me the truth?

491
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:09,369
If I told you the truth, Granny,
you would never speak to me again.

492
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:11,497
Then you HAVE told me the truth.

493
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:17,632
But I would like to hear it
enunciated more clearly.

494
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:20,970
Right. Now, we must all look lively.

495
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:24,058
They're starting to set up
the stalls for the bazaar today

496
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,520
and her ladyship will need
all hands on deck.

497
00:30:26,562 --> 00:30:29,900
James, Mr Molesley, if you could
both keep an eye on things.

498
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:32,029
Do we get paid extra?
No,

499
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,325
but if you play your cards right,
you'll avoid a clip round the ear.

500
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,914
I'll ask Mrs Patmore for some
refreshment for the village people.

501
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:43,337
This is an early warning that they're
coming to set up the stalls for Saturday,

502
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:46,050
so we'd better have sandwiches
and beer at the ready.

503
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:50,849
As I feared. Alfred's looking in on
Saturday on his way back to London.

504
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,187
So he'll be here for the bazaar.

505
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:59,570
He does know
there's no hope with Ivy?

506
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:03,201
Well, that's why he's written to me.
But he says he wants to see her.

507
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:05,413
It's not going to be very easy
for Daisy.

508
00:31:05,454 --> 00:31:08,835
I thought I'd give her the day off.
You won't mind, will you?

509
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:13,592
If you think it best. It's you
who'll do the extra work, not me.

510
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:16,388
What a nightmare.

511
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:19,476
The man selling ices is ill
so I've got to find another.

512
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:22,647
The grocers from Easingwold
and Malton can't be side by side,

513
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:25,693
and I've got to decide
the house menus with Mrs Patmore.

514
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:27,738
I'll do that. Tend to the bazaar.

515
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,743
Are you sure? Because if you are...
I'm sure.

516
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:37,253
When's Cousin Robert coming back?
I don't know. I wish I did.

517
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:40,090
We've had no word from him in days.

518
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:47,435
What is it?

519
00:31:48,562 --> 00:31:51,316
I've got to tell someone,
or I'll just explode.

520
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:55,572
Tell someone what?
Oh, Mary.

521
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,784
What do you think?

522
00:31:57,826 --> 00:32:00,121
I'm engaged!

523
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:03,418
But what was so urgent?

524
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:08,133
First,
can you join me for luncheon today?

525
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:13,391
Well, I suppose so. I ought to go
back and tell Mrs Field. Why?

526
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,060
I've got Lord Merton coming.

527
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,980
Mary's Godfather?

528
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:21,153
Mm. It was fixed years ago,
but now Robert's off on his travels,

529
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:25,660
Cora is too busy...
and Mary's chucked.

530
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:30,542
For what reason?
Suddenly she has to be in London.

531
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:34,757
I think Rosamund's still here.
Oh, no, she can't stand him.

532
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,054
I could ask Edith.
She might be free.

533
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:39,431
Oh, I hope so.

534
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:42,352
I'm a feeble substitute
for the entire Crawley family.

535
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,732
Mmm, yes,
but you're better than nothing.

536
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:48,653
How warming you make that sound.

537
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:52,909
Oh, I'm ever so glad to find you.
Can you help me do these?

538
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:54,746
What's the rush?

539
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:57,166
Lady Mary has to go to London.

540
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,586
Why?
I'm not sure.

541
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:02,007
But she wants me to go with her.
Of course.

542
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:07,807
When will you be back?
Tomorrow evening, but we'll be late.

543
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,982
It's not fair.

544
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:16,320
I stop you going to New York
and then I set off for London.

545
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:17,906
Don't be silly.

546
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:28,004
Come in.

547
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:32,970
Mr Carson, I'd like to go into York
tomorrow. I hope you don't mind.

548
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:36,017
You've got no duties here.
Why should I mind?

549
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:39,021
I'll set off first thing,
if you've no objection.

550
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:40,941
Be my guest, Mr Bates.

551
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:44,112
I still don't understand why
you're not in NEW York,

552
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:46,449
so I can hardly object to York.

553
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,910
Enjoy yourself.

554
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:03,350
Very good. Well done, ladies.

555
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:12,614
Can I have a go?
It's not ready yet.

556
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,867
Anyway, you're a bit of a shrimp,
aren't you?

557
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,537
I'm a shrimp with muscles, me.

558
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:18,873
We'll find that out on Saturday.

559
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:22,963
I've never had a go on one of those.
It's not your sort of thing.

560
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:26,760
More sandwiches and more beer.
It's like a plague of locusts.

561
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:28,889
Busy, Mr Molesley?
I like the bazaar.

562
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,892
I always enjoy it. I hope you will.

563
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,062
Can't you help her to, Mr Molesley?

564
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,357
Oh, get off with you,
you cheeky devil.

565
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:43,327
Alfred's coming Saturday, in't he?
How do you know that?

566
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:47,667
I heard you and Mrs Hughes talking.
Well I, I were going to mention it,

567
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:50,672
because I wondered
if you'd rather be away.

568
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,927
What about all the work?
Oh, it's mostly done by then.

569
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,016
If you'd rather avoid him,
I won't mind.

570
00:34:58,058 --> 00:34:59,978
Could I go and see Mr Mason?

571
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,605
That's a good idea.

572
00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:05,110
Stay away as late as you like.
Just to be safe.

573
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,117
But why the urgency?

574
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:12,622
I can't explain, but I swear
if you knew, you'd approve.

575
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:16,044
What this? What's happened?
Mary has to go to London.

576
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:18,464
It's no big thing.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

577
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:20,008
Can I come?
No.

578
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,263
Well, why not?
Because Mama needs you here.

579
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:25,391
Goodbye, then. Bye, Rose.

580
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:28,271
Do you want to stay at the house?
I'll telephone if you do.

581
00:35:28,312 --> 00:35:29,773
Could you? You're an angel.

582
00:35:29,815 --> 00:35:32,652
I told Mead he could visit
his sister in Swindon,

583
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:35,615
but they'll do the best they can.
Thank you.

584
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:39,037
How mysterious.

585
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,652
Is anything wrong?

586
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:02,322
The car's packed in,
my friend's gone for help.

587
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:05,285
Would you like me to have a look?
I don't want to hold you up.

588
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,873
I've no appointment.
I was on my way to Skipton

589
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:11,002
to see some suppliers
and compare prices.

590
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,671
How impressive.

591
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:16,636
I thought that when the agent
was a cousin or son-in-law,

592
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:19,640
he had free shooting for life,
but others did the work.

593
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:22,311
To quote my wife's grandmother,

594
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:24,898
you've been reading
Socialist newspapers again.

595
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:28,696
You should know.

596
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:32,410
Is this wise?

597
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:34,997
You've heard some of my story,
but not all of it.

598
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:38,336
I came to Downton
to be the chauffeur.

599
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:40,464
Now...

600
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:46,682
That was a splendid luncheon.

601
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:50,813
Quite a change for me.
Oh, I can't believe that.

602
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:53,442
It's true.
I eat nothing but nursery food.

603
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:57,156
Perhaps you need a new cook.
It's not her fault.

604
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,700
I never know what to order.

605
00:36:58,742 --> 00:37:01,704
A husband is told so often
he's going to die first,

606
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:04,834
you never think you're going to
have to manage on your own.

607
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:08,214
I doubt Doctor Crawley
would have managed any better.

608
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:10,009
I'm so interested he was a doctor.

609
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,556
I wanted to study medicine myself,
but my father didn't really...

610
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:17,186
Didn't see it as a profession
for a gentleman.

611
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,774
I don't believe he'd have gone that
far.

612
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:23,279
But he didn't think it
quite suitable for a peer, no.

613
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:26,909
I must try and find an example
to rebut that.

614
00:37:28,787 --> 00:37:31,166
Well, I must be going.

615
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,546
Let me take you. My car's outside.

616
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,048
I can easily walk.

617
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,302
I'd like to. Please.

618
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,597
Then... thank you.

619
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:44,519
I should go too, Granny.

620
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,523
No. Stay.

621
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,567
I want to speak to you.

622
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,785
So were you still the chauffeur
when you married?

623
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:58,541
That's a long story.

624
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,504
Everything with you's a long story.

625
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,632
That one had a happy ending.

626
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:07,054
For a time, anyway.

627
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,519
I know she died.

628
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,567
I'm so sorry.

629
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:19,155
She must have been a very unusual
and independent person.

630
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,618
You could say that again.

631
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:27,585
It's nice that they asked you
to stay, to make your life here.

632
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:32,342
I have a little daughter,
and it seemed the right thing.

633
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:36,640
Still, it makes me take
a kinder view of the family.

634
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:39,603
Oh? What do you have against them?

635
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:41,189
Nothing.

636
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:45,320
But, as a rule,
I don't really warm to their type.

637
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,532
I don't believe in types.

638
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:49,869
I believe in people.

639
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,997
Now give it a try.

640
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:06,644
I really am very grateful.
Thank you.

641
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:25,608
I don't often say it,

642
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:27,986
but Rosamund is right.

643
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:31,932
I do not know this Mr... Mr Drewe...

644
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:36,506
but even if he is everything
you say,

645
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:39,346
to keep the child here

646
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:44,479
would be like a permanent sword of
Damocles, inches from your head.

647
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:48,068
But I can't bear the thought
of giving it away.

648
00:39:49,278 --> 00:39:52,074
And is it right
that it should grow up Swiss?

649
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:55,537
Well, Switzerland
has everything to offer...

650
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,959
except perhaps conversation.

651
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:01,839
And one can learn to live
without that.

652
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,468
And if Michael turns up?

653
00:40:04,509 --> 00:40:08,182
Well, if you want my advice,
start again.

654
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:10,769
Now, I will pay for everything.

655
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:13,314
Aunt Rosamund said she would.

656
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:16,569
You'll be quite enough in her debt
as it is.

657
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:18,572
Take any more,

658
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:22,620
and she'll start exacting
annual tribute.

659
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:27,002
What do your sons do?
I assume they do something.

660
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:29,923
Remember I met Larry at that dinner?

661
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,926
Ah, don't remind me.

662
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:34,221
They do work.

663
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:37,727
Larry's in banking
and Tim's in the diplomatic,

664
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,773
so nothing very startling there.
What about yours?

665
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:43,485
Matthew was a lawyer.

666
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,238
Oh, has he given it up?

667
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,076
He's...

668
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:50,997
He's dead.

669
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:53,417
I thought you would know that.

670
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:55,545
Oh, good God.

671
00:40:56,589 --> 00:41:00,052
I'm terribly sorry. I... I'd
forgotten for a moment who you were.

672
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:01,554
Don't worry. Please.

673
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:07,605
How is Mary? I do wish
I could have seen her today.

674
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:11,904
Well, slow to start with, but now
she's on her way, which I'm glad of.

675
00:41:11,945 --> 00:41:14,407
I heard they were well suited.
Yes.

676
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:17,954
They were happy,
which makes the parting worse,

677
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:21,752
but gives you strength in the end,
as we know.

678
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:27,886
You maybe. Not me.

679
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:32,894
Lady Merton and I were not exactly
meant to be together.

680
00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:36,650
We struggled on, of course,
as everyone did in those days,

681
00:41:36,691 --> 00:41:40,071
but I'm not sure now
how sensible it was.

682
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:46,498
I envy you, your wonderful memories,
but I can't pretend to match them.

683
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,653
Is Mr Ross here yet?

684
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:10,201
Who shall I say is calling?
Rose's cousin.

Lady Mary. Huh.

694
00:42:33,194 --> 00:42:35,739
I was wondering if it would be you.

695
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,742
How did you know
someone was coming?

696
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:39,745
Rose telephoned.

697
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:42,917
She said she'd told you
we were about to set the date.

698
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:46,381
I just made some tea.
Would you like a cup?

699
00:42:46,422 --> 00:42:47,549
Thank you.

700
00:42:51,013 --> 00:42:53,892
I suppose you're here to say that
Lord Flintshire

701
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:57,481
would find the prospect of
a black son-in-law preposterous.

702
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:59,526
And your father would agree.

703
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:02,989
To be fair to Papa,
he'd find your being a band singer

704
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:05,576
even harder to swallow
than your colour.

705
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:13,171
Mr Ross, are you sure about this?

706
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:18,054
Marriage is a challenge,
even when everyone wants it.

707
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,726
Even if everyone prays
you'll be happy.

708
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:25,649
You mean in our case, they'll all be
trying to pull us apart.

709
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,236
Every hour of every day.

710
00:43:39,086 --> 00:43:41,882
Tell me, do you think she loves you?

711
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:45,053
Don't you believe in us?

712
00:43:45,095 --> 00:43:48,642
I believe in you.
I'm not so sure about her.

713
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,399
She may love you a bit,
but mostly I'd say

714
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:57,238
she wants to shock her mother,
whom incidentally, she hates.

715
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:01,244
That's what my mother said.

716
00:44:01,286 --> 00:44:04,541
She said Rose
must be proving some point.

717
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:07,754
You and my mother
have a lot in common.

718
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,723
Tell me honestly: Do you think you
can survive what they'll do to you?

719
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:17,811
Because I don't believe Rose could.

720
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:21,150
It may come as something
of a relief for you to hear that

721
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,612
I will not be marrying Rose.

722
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:26,741
You won't?
No.

723
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:30,330
I've enjoyed her dreams.

724
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:32,333
I think she's more than you allow.

725
00:44:33,335 --> 00:44:35,380
But?

726
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:38,259
I don't want to spoil her life.

727
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,974
I don't want to watch
while people point at her and jeer.

728
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:46,271
I love her.

729
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:49,317
I want her to be happy.

730
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:52,865
So you'll end it?

731
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:54,534
Yes.

732
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:58,790
I should probably have stopped it
sooner, but at any rate...

733
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,170
I'm stopping it now.

734
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,720
So will you tell Rose, or shall I?
I'll tell her.

735
00:45:07,762 --> 00:45:09,348
I'll write to her.

736
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,184
She'll get it tomorrow.

737
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:18,445
It doesn't mean I think it's right.

738
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:22,576
I wouldn't give in if we lived in
even a slightly better world.

739
00:45:25,247 --> 00:45:27,542
It may surprise you, Mr Ross,

740
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:32,049
but if we lived in a better world,
I wouldn't want you to.

741
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:59,967
I've been downstairs, m'lady.
They're making dinner for you now.

742
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:02,554
I don't want a lot.
I've told them that.

743
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,640
How are you?

744
00:46:07,436 --> 00:46:09,398
Much as I was yesterday.

745
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:12,110
Much as I will be tomorrow.

746
00:46:12,152 --> 00:46:14,572
Anna,

747
00:46:14,614 --> 00:46:17,785
I've decided to see
Lord Gillingham.

748
00:46:17,827 --> 00:46:20,832
I'm sorry, but I must do something.

749
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:23,461
I'll telephone
and suggest we meet for luncheon.

750
00:46:23,502 --> 00:46:26,257
Then I'll ask him straight out
to dismiss his valet.

751
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:27,884
I won't say why.

752
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:32,057
That makes me so nervous.
Don't be.

753
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,477
No-one needs to know the reason.

754
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:37,816
Green simply won't be back
at Downton again.

755
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:40,111
Is Bates going to challenge
Lord Gillingham

756
00:46:40,153 --> 00:46:41,822
as to why he has a different valet?

757
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:44,826
I suppose not.

758
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,622
So you have nothing to fear
if he pays us a visit.

759
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,837
And will he, m'lady?

760
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:54,967
Er, dinner's on the table, m'lady.

761
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:58,639
I'm not sure Mead would have put it
like that, but thank you.

762
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,963
So, we decorate the stalls today.
You all know the drill.

763
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:22,008
And remember,

764
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,472
anything shabby
shows Downton in a bad light.

765
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:29,102
And we can't have that.
No, Mrs Hughes, we can't.

766
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:33,025
Will you come?

767
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:36,113
It'll give you a chance to meet
a few people from the village.

768
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:38,617
Is it not just the estate workers?
Oh, no, no.

769
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:41,204
The whole area gets behind
the Church bazaar.

770
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:44,584
You're very lucky, you know.

771
00:47:46,545 --> 00:47:49,508
Nobody's ever called me that.
Least of all myself.

772
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,596
To grow up in a village where
people know and like you,

773
00:47:52,638 --> 00:47:56,936
where your family's respected.
Plenty would give an eye for that.

774
00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:01,151
I'm not used to feeling lucky.

775
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:03,613
Well, you should be.

776
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:12,293
Are we trying for a colour scheme?

777
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:14,838
Goodness, I thought I'd be down
before anyone.

778
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,262
Oh, no. This is one task
that demands an early start.

779
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:23,143
The tent's up for the tea. They're fetching
tables and chairs from the barn.

780
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:26,147
Don't let them mess up the grass
when they drive them back.

781
00:48:27,316 --> 00:48:29,652
Rose!
One, two, three, lift.

782
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:31,656
Oh!
I can manage.

783
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,080
Rose...
Should you be doing this?

784
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:41,420
Why? What are you afraid of?
That I'll lose the baby?

785
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,844
So they've made you
a beast of burden now?

786
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:48,514
That's right.
And they're not taking advantage?

787
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:52,395
Are they ready for these?
Give me those. James!

788
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:54,816
Could you take these to the tent,
please?

789
00:48:58,071 --> 00:49:00,032
May I present Miss Bunting?

790
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:03,788
She teaches at the village school.
I'm very interested in the school.

791
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:06,917
You know Lady Grantham?

792
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:10,548
Of course.
It's nice to meet you,

793
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,634
but I'm afraid I must get on.

794
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:19,770
So that's the great Countess
of Grantham.

795
00:49:19,812 --> 00:49:22,900
It is. Another beast of burden.

796
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:35,085
I'll sack him if you insist,
but tell me why. It's only fair.

797
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:37,881
I don't know if it's fair
or unfair, but I can't.

798
00:49:37,923 --> 00:49:40,051
Not even a hint?
I've said what I can.

799
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:46,519
He's done something
you'd find... abhorrent.

800
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:51,235
Well, you win.

801
00:49:52,278 --> 00:49:55,783
But it does seem mean,
even if I don't like him very much.

802
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:58,621
You wouldn't think it mean
if you knew the truth.

803
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:02,043
Well, I believe you.

804
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:04,588
I love you and I believe you.

805
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:07,969
Have you spoken to Mabel?

806
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:11,850
I have.
But I wasn't going to bring it up.

807
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:15,146
Why not?
I don't want to twist your arm.

808
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:18,860
And I know that you won't make
a decision until it suits you.

809
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:21,948
How did she take it?
I'm so pleased you asked.

810
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,118
I think the answer is
with real style.

811
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,998
Well, I'm glad.

812
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:30,628
And now, can you get the bill?
I'm terribly late.

813
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,676
I must catch the last train.
It's the Church bazaar tomorrow.

814
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:38,306
I won't give up, Mary.

815
00:50:38,348 --> 00:50:41,728
Not until you walk down the aisle
with another man,

816
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,566
and very possibly not even then.

817
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,907
I find that both irritating
and beguiling in equal measure.

818
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,915
Should I take comfort from that?
Take what you like.

819
00:50:54,957 --> 00:50:57,043
I'm going.

820
00:51:05,556 --> 00:51:07,684
And do what I ask with Green...

821
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:11,398
and please let me know
when you've done it.

822
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:25,059
You sent for me?

823
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,020
I wouldn't put it like that.

824
00:51:27,062 --> 00:51:29,774
I just wondered if you might be free.

825
00:51:29,816 --> 00:51:32,528
Oh. Your wish is my command.

826
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:37,160
These came this morning
from Lord Merton. As a thank you.

827
00:51:37,202 --> 00:51:40,332
That was kind of him.
But what part do I play in it?

828
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:43,670
They're for you.

829
00:51:45,006 --> 00:51:46,591
For me? Surely not.

830
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:51,224
Yes, he sent me some too,
these came with them.

831
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:54,019
I read the card.

832
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:58,651
He asks forgiveness
for his tactlessness.

833
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:03,409
Was he tactless?
He didn't mean to be tactless.

834
00:52:05,078 --> 00:52:07,498
How nice.
Mmm.

835
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,461
Very nice.

836
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:15,218
Quite... quite surprising,
but very nice.

837
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:21,436
I'm just going up
to see if they need anything more.

838
00:52:21,478 --> 00:52:23,856
Can you leave these
for one of the hall boys?

839
00:52:23,898 --> 00:52:26,444
I'll do them, Mr Carson.
I don't mind.

840
00:52:27,487 --> 00:52:29,073
You took your time in York.

841
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:32,036
Yes, it was quite a long day.

842
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:39,756
What were you up to?
Oh, this and that.

843
00:52:43,428 --> 00:52:46,057
One, two, three, go!

844
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:02,206
Lovely to see you again.
Thank you very much.

845
00:53:17,229 --> 00:53:19,399
You got his letter, then?

846
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:21,235
You're so disappointing, Mary.

847
00:53:22,696 --> 00:53:25,909
I thought you understood,
and you're just like my mother.

848
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:30,207
No, I'm not. But I understand this -

849
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,796
if you're going to complicate your
life, do it for the right reasons.

850
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:39,138
James, I'm putting the tea tent
in your charge.

851
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:42,226
Make sure they don't
run out of anything.

852
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:45,063
But her ladyship said
we were to enjoy ourselves.

853
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:46,899
Let us consider this.

854
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:50,238
She wants you to enjoy yourself,
I want you to run the tent.

855
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,034
Now, which of us can make your life
more uncomfortable?

856
00:53:57,207 --> 00:53:59,126
Mr Molesley.

857
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:01,922
Mr Molesley! Mr Molesley!

858
00:54:01,964 --> 00:54:05,010
Tell those people
where they're supposed to park.

859
00:54:05,052 --> 00:54:08,057
Wait a minute. It's his lordship!
His lordship's back!

860
00:54:08,098 --> 00:54:10,602
Tell the others!
His lordship's back!

861
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:11,979
James!

862
00:54:18,906 --> 00:54:20,743
How can you be here?!

863
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:22,620
Why didn't you send a message?

864
00:54:22,662 --> 00:54:25,458
We would have made such a fuss!
You're a beast!

865
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,336
Oh, not quite a beast, I hope.

866
00:54:27,378 --> 00:54:29,798
I wanted to surprise you
and I think I have.

867
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,427
Papa, you should have let us know!
When did you get in?

868
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,847
This morning.
I'd forgotten about the bazaar.

869
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:37,810
I was right not to distract you all
from your labours.

870
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:42,442
What happened to Uncle Harold?
A reprimand, but nothing more.

871
00:54:42,484 --> 00:54:44,237
So it was worth your going.

872
00:54:44,278 --> 00:54:48,034
I don't think I made a bit of difference,
but let's hold on to that fiction.

873
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,705
How was it?
Interesting.

874
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:54,794
Very modern... and very interesting.

875
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:57,340
How's it been here?

876
00:54:57,382 --> 00:54:59,593
Not very interesting
and not very modern.

877
00:55:00,595 --> 00:55:03,516
Carson.
Hello, Bates. Have you missed me?

878
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,687
Because I've certainly missed you.

879
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:08,816
Good to see you back, m'lord.

880
00:55:11,987 --> 00:55:13,448
You're back.

881
00:55:14,616 --> 00:55:16,661
I can't believe it.

882
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:19,916
If you knew how many times
I'd imagined this scene.

883
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:30,432
This is a treat. It's been a while.

884
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:33,979
I'm sorry if I've stayed away.

885
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:37,317
Nay, no apologies. Not from you.
Not here.

886
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,487
You're my daughter-in-law,

887
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:42,575
you're all that I've got left
of my son.

888
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:46,164
Whether you come here or not,
this is your home.

889
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:49,836
I do love it when I come.
I'm glad.

890
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,799
That's it.

891
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:58,015
Oh, there you are, Alfred. Nice
to see you. Have a glass of this.

892
00:55:58,057 --> 00:56:01,103
Is Ivy about?
I'm just here.

893
00:56:05,402 --> 00:56:06,904
Thank you.

894
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:14,207
How was the funeral?
Was well attended.

895
00:56:14,248 --> 00:56:17,670
So that's something
for my mother to hold on to.

896
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:20,049
I read your letter.

897
00:56:21,885 --> 00:56:24,723
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
No, I'm sorry.

898
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:27,435
I got the wrong end of the stick
when I were last up here,

899
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:29,021
but it were my mistake.

900
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:33,027
All you did was... try and give me
a nice welcome,

901
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:35,280
and you can't feel sorry for that.

902
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:37,033
We can part as friends?

903
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:39,746
We can, as far as I'm concerned.

904
00:56:44,169 --> 00:56:46,089
Is Daisy here?

905
00:56:47,424 --> 00:56:51,806
I wanted to see if she and I could
be friends an' all before I go.

906
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:54,810
She's gone to Mr Mason's farm
for the day.

907
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:57,189
She won't be back till late.
Oh.

908
00:57:02,697 --> 00:57:06,661
Daisy, are you here
to avoid seeing Alfred?

909
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:11,377
Ivy's turned him down again,
so he won't come back after today.

910
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:13,923
What does Mrs Patmore say about it?

911
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,218
To stay away so I don't meet him.

912
00:57:18,137 --> 00:57:20,307
I would advise against that.
But why?

913
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:22,853
I thought you'd be glad
if I stayed a bit longer.

914
00:57:22,894 --> 00:57:26,066
I wish you'd stay and never leave,
and I hope you will one day,

915
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:28,528
but Mrs Patmore's wrong.

916
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:34,913
Daisy, there won't be too many people
that you love in your life,

917
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:36,874
and he's one.

918
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:39,920
I don't know what I feel about him.
Not now.

919
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:43,926
Even so, you need to say goodbye
to this young man,

920
00:57:43,968 --> 00:57:46,013
with nothing jagged,

921
00:57:46,055 --> 00:57:48,934
nothing harsh, between you.

922
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:51,688
I couldn't think of the words.

923
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,025
We'll find them together.

924
00:57:55,277 --> 00:57:59,283
And er, we'll get you back to Downton
in time.

925
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,955
Are you bearing up?

926
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:05,209
In here.

927
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:07,796
I'm never going to see Michael again,
am I?

928
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,762
If you want to go out there
and look for him, I'll support you.

929
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:15,182
They've already done all that.

930
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:17,937
Police and private detectives
and everything.

931
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:20,399
Well, then you must be patient.

932
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,862
Sometimes I feel that God
doesn't want me to be happy.

933
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:26,616
My dear, all life
is a series of problems

934
00:58:26,658 --> 00:58:28,953
which we must try and solve.

935
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:32,542
First one, then the next,
and the next...

936
00:58:34,086 --> 00:58:36,006
until at last we die.

937
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:42,975
Why don't you get us an ice cream?

938
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:46,355
Yes. That should sort it out.

939
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,798
Isn't that Lord Gillingham?
What? It can't be. Where?

940
00:59:07,053 --> 00:59:10,308
What does Miss Lane Fox think
about it? That's what I wonder.

941
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,938
I agree. He's the most unconvincing
fiance I've ever come across.

942
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,317
Perhaps she doesn't know.

943
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:19,864
If we know, she knows.
You can count on that.

944
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:24,830
Green. But how could he be dead?

945
00:59:24,872 --> 00:59:27,292
I'm only telling you what they told
me.

946
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:30,046
That he was in Piccadilly and he...

947
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:34,261
slipped or stumbled
and fell into the road.

948
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:36,556
I don't know what to say.

949
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:40,687
It just seemed so odd
after our conversation yesterday

950
00:59:40,729 --> 00:59:43,567
that I felt that I should...
bring you the news myself.

951
00:59:47,406 --> 00:59:51,036
Can you explain to me now
why you wanted him sacked?

952
00:59:51,078 --> 00:59:53,248
No.

953
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,376
Hello, Tony. Heavens,

954
00:59:55,418 --> 00:59:58,297
what a gathering of the clans
today's turning out to be.

955
00:59:58,339 --> 00:59:59,967
Would you excuse me for a moment?

956
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:05,225
I don't suppose it's a good sign
to find you back at Downton?

957
01:00:06,226 --> 01:00:08,313
Not really. Not this time.

958
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:17,509
You mean he fell into the road
and he was hit? Yesterday?

959
01:00:17,551 --> 01:00:20,013
By a bus or lorry, apparently.

960
01:00:21,265 --> 01:00:23,351
And someone saw this?

961
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:27,441
The pavement was crowded.
Lots of people saw it.

962
01:00:30,737 --> 01:00:34,076
That's a relief.
What do you mean?

963
01:00:36,204 --> 01:00:39,501
Nothing. I don't mean anything.

964
01:00:40,627 --> 01:00:42,589
Mary!

965
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,259
Did your mother warn you
I was coming?

966
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:47,346
She did.

967
01:00:47,388 --> 01:00:49,516
Why are you back in Yorkshire
so soon?

968
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:54,315
I'd no sooner got back than I was despatched
to a tenant farmers' convention in Whitby.

969
01:00:54,357 --> 01:00:57,153
But it's over now,
so I'll go home from here.

970
01:00:57,194 --> 01:01:00,324
Can I ask you something?
Of course.

971
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:03,454
It's an odd question.
Go on.

972
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:08,545
If you thought a man was involved
in a crime, or an incident,

973
01:01:08,587 --> 01:01:11,049
but you didn't blame him,

974
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:14,471
in fact you thought right
was on his side,

975
01:01:14,512 --> 01:01:16,557
what would you do?

976
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:19,353
It's a bit theoretical
for an opinion.

977
01:01:19,395 --> 01:01:22,817
But you don't believe he was wrong?
No.

978
01:01:22,858 --> 01:01:27,699
Well, I'm guessing in the dark,
but... I suspect I would say nothing.

979
01:01:32,707 --> 01:01:35,419
That isn't fair. It's weighted.

980
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:39,050
Go on. You have a go, Mr Molesley.

981
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:42,221
No, no, I won't manage it
if Jimmy can't.

982
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:45,559
Try. I want to see it.

983
01:01:57,286 --> 01:01:59,873
Well done!

984
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,126
That was cheating.

985
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,673
Well, it... it's in the arms.

986
01:02:05,715 --> 01:02:09,846
It's all to do with the swing,
and the swing is in the arms.

987
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:12,308
So, Miss Baxter,

988
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:16,064
anything to tell me about life
since I've been away?

989
01:02:16,106 --> 01:02:19,444
No. Nothing's happened.

990
01:02:22,991 --> 01:02:24,911
I'll find out if it has, you know.

991
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:26,622
Leave her alone, Mr Barrow.

992
01:02:26,664 --> 01:02:30,211
We don't want any bullying
brought back from overseas.

993
01:02:30,252 --> 01:02:32,130
Do we, Miss Baxter?

994
01:02:32,172 --> 01:02:36,095
Now, are there any stalls
you'd still like to see?

995
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,451
God, what a relief
to be able to drink in public

996
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:54,665
without a policeman pouncing.
Down with Prohibition.

997
01:02:54,706 --> 01:02:58,128
You can't mean you never had
a drink all the time you were there.

998
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,632
Harold has his uses.

999
01:03:00,674 --> 01:03:02,677
I suppose he does.

1000
01:03:02,718 --> 01:03:06,349
And let us hope
they both leave us in peace.

1001
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:08,394
A slim hope, I'm afraid.

1002
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:12,108
Martha wants to bring him over next
summer for Rose's coming out ball.

1003
01:03:12,149 --> 01:03:13,276
Why?

1004
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:16,656
She says she wants to see another
London Season before she dies.

1005
01:03:22,457 --> 01:03:24,209
Oh!

1006
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:30,845
You're still here. Thank goodness.

1007
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:35,018
I caught an early bus, but it was
delayed. I thought I'd missed you.

1008
01:03:35,059 --> 01:03:37,188
I'm off to the station now, Daisy.

1009
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:38,732
And I won't be back.

1010
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:42,988
My dad's gone and mother's moving
to Crewe to be nearer my sister,

1011
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:45,742
so I'm glad you're here
to say goodbye. I really am.

1012
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,620
I've brought you a present.

1013
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:50,750
Mr Mason's made you
a basket full of things.

1014
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:53,713
Rolls and cheese and ham,
and jams and pickles,

1015
01:03:53,754 --> 01:03:57,260
and he's put some cider in too,
to keep you going on the train home.

1016
01:03:57,301 --> 01:04:01,308
That was kind of him, Daisy. Are you
sure it wasn't meant for you?

1017
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:03,060
No, he did it for Alfred.

1018
01:04:03,102 --> 01:04:06,107
I told him we were old friends,
so he did it for you.

1019
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:16,372
You know Ivy turned me down?
I do, yes.

1020
01:04:16,414 --> 01:04:19,210
I think I've been a bit blind
where she's concerned.

1021
01:04:19,252 --> 01:04:20,712
Love is blind.

1022
01:04:20,754 --> 01:04:24,134
Maybe. But I wonder now
I've not been a fool.

1023
01:04:24,176 --> 01:04:27,598
You've always been so good to me,
Daisy. So true.

1024
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:29,517
But I could never see it.

1025
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:33,064
That's kind of you to say,
and good to hear.

1026
01:04:34,733 --> 01:04:37,780
I loved you, Alfred.
I'll not deny it.

1027
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:41,953
But that's done with now,
and what I felt won't come back.

1028
01:04:41,994 --> 01:04:44,623
It's time for you to go your way
and me to go mine.

1029
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:49,214
But you wish me well?
Oh, I do, Alfred, yeah.

1030
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:51,718
So well. So very well.

1031
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:53,554
Friends forever.

1032
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:56,642
Friends forever, Daisy.

1033
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,943
Right, now this really is goodbye.

1034
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:16,422
Are you all right, Daisy?

1035
01:05:16,463 --> 01:05:20,303
I'll just get this off
and pop in the pantry for my apron.

1036
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:38,455
Well, that's that, then.

1037
01:05:42,712 --> 01:05:46,301
Do you know,
when you brought up that basket...

1038
01:05:47,386 --> 01:05:52,226
I were so proud of you,
I felt like crying out.

1039
01:05:52,268 --> 01:05:55,523
If you were my own daughter,

1040
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:58,611
I couldn't be prouder than I am now.

1041
01:06:17,097 --> 01:06:20,853
You do know why I came today.
To see the bazaar.

1042
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,773
To see you.

1043
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:28,448
I find - perhaps to my surprise -
that since I left,

1044
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:30,493
I can't think of anything but you.

1045
01:06:30,534 --> 01:06:32,913
To your surprise and my surprise.

1046
01:06:34,248 --> 01:06:36,001
I'm only asking for a chance.

1047
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,924
Was there really a conference
in Whitby?

1048
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:42,511
Of course not.

1049
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:47,936
I'm flattered, Charles,
and even moved.

1050
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:52,526
But rather than add to the list
of men I've disappointed,

1051
01:06:52,568 --> 01:06:57,450
it might be kinder to refuse you now
and let you off the hook.

1052
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:02,583
Hmm,
I'm afraid I couldn't allow that.

1053
01:07:05,963 --> 01:07:07,758
Not without putting up a fight.

1054
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:23,323
What are you still doing here?

1055
01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:25,618
I wish I knew what you were up to
yesterday.

1056
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:29,332
Why did you go?
I wanted to get away.

1057
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:33,130
You'd never do anything foolish,
would you?

1058
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:36,635
You'd never risk everything
we've built together?

1059
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,888
Certainly not. You know me.

1060
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:42,185
When I do a thing, I like to have
a very good reason for doing it.

1061
01:07:58,376 --> 01:08:00,171
Where have you two been hiding?

1062
01:08:00,212 --> 01:08:02,633
In plain view,
where all good tricksters hide.

1063
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:04,761
Look what I've found.
Tom, will you see

1064
01:08:04,803 --> 01:08:07,432
if there are some clean glasses
on that table?

1065
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:11,939
Well done, my dear. A real triumph.

1066
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:14,693
I hope so.

1067
01:08:14,735 --> 01:08:17,697
I've told them
they can clear up the rest tomorrow.

1068
01:08:17,739 --> 01:08:20,493
I thought that was the best bazaar
I've known here.

1069
01:08:20,535 --> 01:08:24,249
Certainly. At least since
your father and I were running it.

1070
01:08:25,751 --> 01:08:28,589
And now, as the Prodigal Husband
home from the sea,

1071
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:31,594
let me raise a glass
to my extraordinary wife

1072
01:08:31,635 --> 01:08:36,100
who can clearly manage far better
in my absence. Cora.

1073
01:08:36,142 --> 01:08:38,354
Lady Grantham.
Cora. Mama.

1074
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:42,443
Very well done, Lady Grantham. And
now, I'm afraid, I should be going.

1075
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:44,279
It was so kind of you to come.

1076
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:47,743
I don't suppose I could ask YOU
for a lift this time? I came by train

1077
01:08:47,785 --> 01:08:50,748
but I'd much rather drive.
Certainly.

1078
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:52,918
I'll see you off.

1079
01:08:57,341 --> 01:09:01,931
What sort of menage has that
turned into while I've been away?
