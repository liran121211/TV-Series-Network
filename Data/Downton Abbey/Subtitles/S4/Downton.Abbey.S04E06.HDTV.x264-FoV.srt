2
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:37,111
Shouldn't the hot toast come to me
first, Daisy? Sorry, Mr Carson.

3
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:40,408
Why is Alfred getting special
treatment? I'm sure he's not.

4
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,487
Why is he getting special treatment?

5
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:48,035
Why do you think?
Because he's staying here with us.

6
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:51,483
Oh, this is nice.

7
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,690
Mr Napier and Mr Blake
are coming up in a few days.

8
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:57,917
He asks if I'm serious about
their staying here.

9
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:58,660
And are you?

10
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:00,987
Certainly. They could be useful.

11
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:04,855
They're writing a report on why
estates like this are going wrong.

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,011
But you don't think Downton's
going wrong, do you, My Lady? No.

13
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,481
But I wouldn't mind
having it confirmed.

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,779
You seem brighter lately.

15
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,217
Have things sorted
themselves out?

16
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,507
Not quite, but...

17
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:19,634
It's better.

18
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:20,785
Yes.

19
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,669
And you've moved back
into the cottage.

20
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:24,153
I have, My Lady.

21
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,881
Well, you're obviously not going to
tell me what it was about.

22
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,130
But I'm glad if it's resolved.

23
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,896
Nothing for me?

24
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:34,316
Afraid not.

25
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,879
This is a fine kettle of fish,
I must say.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,935
Your Uncle Harold is in a proper fix.

27
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:42,387
Why? What's he done this time?
Something to do with oil leases.

28
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:44,463
Who's Uncle Harold?
Cora's brother.

29
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:47,278
I always think him rather good at
business, if nothing else.

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,793
But it seems he's backed
a very lame horse this time.

31
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:54,528
Why is he bothering you with it?
I'm not entirely sure. What's that?

32
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:58,422
It's about the Tamworths. We had Tamworths
at Duneagle. Daddy swears by them.

33
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:01,423
It's a new thing for us. We haven't
done much with pigs before.

34
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:04,723
I thought you were convinced.I am.
But... I'm allowed to be nervous.

35
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:07,395
Intensive farming's a big step.

36
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,396
Half past eight. I must skedaddle.

37
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:13,163
Penny for your thoughts.

38
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,101
You'd pay twice that
not to know them.

39
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,102
If there was anything I could do...
I know.

40
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,292
It's not your fault, it's mine.

41
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:21,964
Your husband is a brooder.

42
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:25,744
And brooders brood.
Then brood about me?

43
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:34,441
I'm making anchovy sauce
for the fish souffle.

44
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:37,126
Do you want to watch?
No, you're all right.

45
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,855
His heart's not in it any more.

46
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:48,400
Oh, I think it is. But when you fall
off a horse, you need a bit of time
to get back in the saddle.

47
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:56,002
Cousin Cora?
I think you can call me Cora now.

48
00:02:56,086 --> 00:03:00,076
I wouldn't dare with Cousin Robert.
You must dare with me. How can I help?

49
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,300
I...I wanted to tell you that I've
settled the surprise. For his birthday.

50
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:09,511
Since you won't tell me what it is,
I don't know what to say. Good?

51
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:11,862
Well, the thing is...

52
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:15,334
I need Carson to keep the secret.
Do you think he will?

53
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,020
It's only on the day.
And it's only till after dinner.

54
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,995
Mrs Hughes is the one for a secret.

55
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,134
Yes. That's true.

56
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,915
And it'll be she
who has to deal with it.

57
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:36,187
The second post, Your Ladyship.

58
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:42,098
Thank you, Spratt. You haven't
taken the netsuke carving from here?

59
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,619
You know the one I mean?
The little ivory fisherman.

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,620
I know it, but I've not touched it.

61
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,916
Not to wash it or mend it
or something?

62
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,224
No. And who else has been
in this room in the last day or so?

63
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:57,033
The maids, of course.
and young Pegg.

64
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,009
He was watering the pot plants.

65
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,610
But Betty was with him.
Watching all the time? Well, no.

66
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,560
She was cleaning.
But... I wouldn't want her blamed.

67
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:07,158
Oh, I wouldn't blame her.

68
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:12,885
You know, of course,
the netsuke is very valuable.

69
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,247
That's the risk with little things.

70
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:16,996
They fit into a pocket easily.

71
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,681
I have a feeling most things would
fit into this particular pocket!

72
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,448
Thank you, Spratt.
My Lady.

73
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:30,414
We have to get the sums right.
We must speculate to accumulate.

74
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,769
So speaks the American half of you.

75
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:38,019
Will you really go to America?
Don't worry. I won't go until the
pig business is up and running.

76
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:40,825
We can give you
masses of introductions.

77
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,015
Grandmamma and Uncle Harold,
for a start.

78
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,584
Lord Grantham got a letter
from him today.

79
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,128
It wasn't good news.

80
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:51,492
I shouldn't worry. It only means
a yacht's gone aground.

81
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,872
Or a girl's gone back to mother!
That's not what it sounded like.

82
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,783
Right. I'll get the car.

83
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,672
Anything to report?

84
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:08,233
It's nothing... I'm sure.

85
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,473
But Lady Rose seems to have some
secret she wants Mrs Hughes to keep.

86
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:14,790
That's more like it.

87
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:17,510
What secret?

88
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:20,837
I don't know. It'll be nothing.

89
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,944
Now. Must take this up.

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,281
You were dismissed?!
From one minute to the next?

91
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:32,738
Mr Maley came over. Said I wasn't
needed no more. And that was that.

92
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:33,997
It's disgraceful!

93
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,852
Is there nothing you can do about it?

94
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:40,224
No. But I don't understand it.

95
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:42,686
I had a good touch
with the greenhouses.

96
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:46,680
I did all the house plants.
I was working well. I know I was.

97
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,079
I'm sure. I'll see if I can
get to the bottom of it.

98
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:54,261
I'm very grateful, Your Ladyship.
I'm not your la- Oh, never mind.

99
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,315
A band?!
Shh!

100
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:01,126
No-one must know.

101
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:04,842
We'll get the carpets rolled up
and everything set during dinner.

102
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:08,657
So that when His Lordship walks out
of the dining room, there it is.

103
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,658
And we're to hide them until then?

104
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:12,651
Hide them?

105
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:16,175
You just have to keep them with you.
His Lordship won't come down here.

106
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:19,988
So I have to find them food and beds.
How many are there?

107
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:21,906
Six, I think. But I'll check.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,648
And Her Ladyship knows about it?

109
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:27,490
Well, not that it's a band, because
it's a surprise for her too.

110
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:30,968
But she knows that there is a surprise
and that you're helping me with it.

111
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,515
Very well. I'll see what I can do.

112
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,926
Thank you.

113
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,393
I wondered why
Lady Rose was down here.

114
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:48,603
And I'm afraid
you will continue to wonder.

115
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,157
That's very mysterious, Mrs Hughes.

116
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,632
You know me, Mr Barrow. A woman
of mystery, if ever there was one.

117
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,134
Well, her secret won't affect us.

118
00:06:58,497 --> 00:06:59,978
How can you be so sure?

119
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,372
Now you have got me worried.

120
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,245
I am sorry to hear that, Mr Barrow.

121
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,329
But now you must let me get on.

122
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,149
All I know is this.

123
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:17,129
I find Pegg in this room
and my paper knife is gone.

124
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:22,914
He comes into the room again
and a very valuable piece of Japanese
netsuke is missing.

125
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:25,582
Things. Things. Things!

126
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,166
I don't understand your position.

127
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:32,134
Are you saying he's justified
in stealing my possessions?

128
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:33,740
Or do you not believe he took them?

129
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:36,469
I'm saying you put too much
importance on material objects

130
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,633
and not enough on justice.
Oh, really?

131
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,936
I wonder you don't just set fire to
the abbey and dance round it,

132
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:44,727
painted with woad and howling!

133
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:46,596
I might, if it would do any good.

134
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:47,809
Ah. Well -

135
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:52,282
I beg your pardon, Your Ladyship.
No. Don't apologise.

136
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,448
I'm glad to have an ally in the room.

137
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:57,652
This was found
in Betty's cleaning bucket.

138
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:00,095
It must've rolled in there,
and she's just found it.

139
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:02,610
Oh.

140
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:05,362
Thank you, thank you.

141
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:08,716
I'm very relieved.

142
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,406
Relieved? Or irritated?

143
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,766
If that will be all, My Lady?

144
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,402
Aren't you going to say
you're sorry? Certainly not.

145
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:24,712
He may not have taken this,

146
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:28,956
or he may have sneaked it into
the maid's bucket when we weren't looking.

147
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,327
How you hate to be wrong.

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,182
I wouldn't know.
I'm not familiar with the sensation.

149
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,939
So you're determined
to dig in your heels.I am sorry.

150
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,970
But whether or not he took this,
he certainly took the knife.

151
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,955
That is all I have to say
on the subject.

152
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:55,998
Edith.

153
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,078
Whatever's the matter?

154
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:01,529
Michael's vanished into thin air.

155
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:04,771
Nobody's heard from him,
no-one can reach him.

156
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,165
I'm sure it's just
a failure of communication.

157
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,505
If anything had happened,
we'd've heard.

158
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:11,856
Maybe.

159
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,575
I just wish to God
he'd pick up the telephone.

160
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:16,599
He will.

161
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:18,799
Come on.

162
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:20,562
We ought to get changed.

163
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:28,251
Last post. One for me and er...
one for you, Alfred.

164
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,151
I've got it! It's from The Ritz.

165
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,169
One of the chosen candidates has
dropped out of the course. And I was next.

166
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:45,652
I was fifth.
See, Jimmy? I was the fifth.

167
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,090
I never said you weren't.
So, they want you, do they?

168
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:51,159
Yes. I'll have some catching up
to do, but I don't mind that.

169
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:53,814
Alfred, I'm so pleased for you.
We all are.

170
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:56,584
That's right. Thank you very much.
When do you go?

171
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:59,162
As soon as I can. The less I miss,
the less I'm behind.

172
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:02,756
But it's up to Mr Carson. Oh, I've
no wish to stand in your way, Alfred.

173
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:06,269
I'm sure I can manage with James
and Mr Barrow. So I can go!

174
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:09,971
Now? Wait until tomorrow.
We ought to let the family know.

175
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,975
Aren't you going to
congratulate him, Daisy?

176
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,501
Daisy, run and put the kettle on.

177
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:15,502
You can leave that there.

178
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:20,374
If you need anything washing,
give it to me tonight.

179
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,554
And me. We'll get you shipshape.

180
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:25,566
I'm quite nervous now.
What's there to be nervous about?

181
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:28,432
You're nervous because
you're intelligent, Alfred.

182
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,899
Only stupid people are foolhardy.

183
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:39,693
I'm ever so sorry, Daisy. Are you?
When you're the one that's driven him away?

184
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:41,394
How do you make that out?

185
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:45,673
Because you wanted Jimmy and not him
and that's why he were forced to go.

186
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,912
He knew that.
Come on, girls.

187
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,992
Dry your tears and
let's get on with the dinner.

188
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,719
Ivy, come and beat these eggs.

189
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:59,643
You're back. I thought
you must've missed the last train.

190
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,159
No. But I only just caught it.

191
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:04,451
Do you want some dinner?
I ate in the restaurant car.

192
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,334
You weren't very long in London.

193
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:12,266
There wasn't much to do.
Just sign some papers for a trust
Billy Sheffield set up for his son.

194
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:16,603
What will that entail?
Mainly, telling the boy to drink
less and be nicer to his mother.

195
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:18,684
We learned at dinner
that Alfred's leaving.

196
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:22,126
He's got a place on the Ritz
cookery course after all. Ah.

197
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,678
I'm sorry to cut and run, My Lord.

198
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,754
Don't worry about it.
We're proud of you.

199
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,979
You must return one day
as a famous chef.

200
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,579
My Lord, there's something
I wanted to say.

201
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,745
I've been well treated in this house and I want
you all to know that I'm very grateful.

202
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:37,986
Thank you, Alfred.

203
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,396
Mr Carson has been a kind...

204
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:43,637
..and wonderful teacher.

205
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:48,581
Much more and we shall all
burst into tears.

206
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:52,633
I'm sorry, My Lord. Come along,
Alfred. Let's get back to work.

207
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:56,385
How's my birthday dinner coming on?

208
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,853
How do you know about the dinner?

209
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,876
The Coldhursts rang yesterday
and said they'd love to come.

210
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:05,184
Weren't we all sworn to secrecy?
God! People are so hopeless.

211
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:08,357
I don't mind. It won't spoil it
if it's not a surprise. Not for me.

212
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:11,570
There may still be a surprise.
So I should hope!

213
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:20,032
So, what about tomorrow? I know you'd
enjoy it. What are you going to see?

214
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,074
The Sheikh.
Ooh!

215
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:24,400
I like that Rudolph Valentino.

216
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:27,899
Ooh! He makes me shiver all over.

217
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:30,666
What a very disturbing thought.

218
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:34,740
Let's us go for a date. We could
leave when we've dressed them

219
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:36,371
and be back in time
to put them to bed.

220
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,493
Lady Mary wouldn't mind.

221
00:12:39,395 --> 00:12:42,162
Why not? It's been a long time
since we went out to dine.

222
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,677
Too long.
I quite agree.

223
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:49,440
Will you send a message
to Mr Molesley in the morning?

224
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,023
Why should I?
Because Alfred's going?

225
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,711
So?
Won't you need him now?

226
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:57,176
I'll need a new footman, yes.
But Mr Molesley has,

227
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,511
as the saying goes,
had his chance and missed it.

228
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,657
You don't mean that. Not
when he agreed to come last time.

229
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,447
Yes, he agreed. Much as
Kaiser Bill agreed to abdicate.

230
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,561
With the greatest possible
reluctance.

231
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,969
But surely -
I'm sorry, Mrs Hughes.

232
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,609
Young Alfred gave thanks tonight

233
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,733
for the courtesy and kindness he has received
here, both from the family and from me.

234
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:21,218
And that is what I like to see.
Gratitude.

235
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:25,441
I don't want someone who has to be
dragged into the house by his heels.

236
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:28,903
Yes, but Mr Molesley has had a lot -
A lot to put up with.

237
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:32,056
We've all had a lot to put up with,
Mrs Patmore.

238
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:35,247
And it is not made easier by working
with people who don't want to be here.

239
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:42,321
It may be worse than you think. They may be
getting ready to lay some people off.

240
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,512
Why would that concern Lady Rose?

241
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,726
Not sure.

242
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:49,158
But Mrs Hughes seems to think
we could all be affected.

243
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,313
You've got to find out more.

244
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:55,660
But how?
You'll think of something.

245
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:12,233
I'll arrange something tomorrow.
Book somewhere special.

246
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:13,483
If you like.

247
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,695
I know it can't
be the same as it used to be.

248
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,520
I don't deceive myself about that.

249
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,259
But I want to make some
new memories.

250
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:27,981
Good memories.

251
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,056
So it's not as if
all our happiness was before.

252
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,685
I'm happy... whenever I look at you.

253
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,429
But you're not, are you?

254
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,192
Everything is shadowed.

255
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:51,865
Every moment we share is shadowed.

256
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,776
You're right.

257
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,221
Let's have... one evening...

258
00:14:57,222 --> 00:15:00,222
when we don't think about it -
we leave it all behind.

259
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:04,424
Thank you.

260
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,425
Tonight, I'll change before the gong.

261
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:12,202
I have a committee meeting, and then we're all
dining together in some frightful hotel.

262
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:15,472
I should leave around six.
What will you wear, My Lady?

263
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:18,368
Well... I don't want to insult them.

264
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:22,456
I should look as if I've tried.
Elegant, but sensible. I know.

265
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,522
I'll let you choose. Thank you.

266
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,577
Don't forget to write.
And good luck.

267
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,690
I know you'll get what you want.
Do you? Cos I don't always.

268
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:41,791
Just remember, you're as good as any
Frenchman. I don't care what they say.

269
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:45,558
Ah, you're off.
Well... all the luck in the world.

270
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,087
Don't do anything I wouldn't.
There's a bit of leeway!

271
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:50,081
Where's Daisy?
In the kitchen.

272
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:52,770
Right. There's a car waiting
to take you. I've just got to...

273
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,718
I'm off!
Goodbye, then.

274
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,854
Daisy, I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

275
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,617
You're good person. You're gonna make
someone very happy one day, but,
it were never gonna be me.

276
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,048
Good luck. I mean it.

277
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:22,132
You work hard
and you know what you want.

278
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,104
I hope you do well, Alfred.
I think you will.

279
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,138
Alfred? Come along.
We've not a minute to lose.

280
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,990
Thank you, Daisy.
That means a lot to me.

281
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:32,949
An awful lot.

282
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:36,305
Ah. Thank you, Mr Carson.

283
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:49,754
Good morning, ma'am.

284
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,186
I'm afraid you just missed Her
Ladyship. She'll be gone some time.

285
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,009
What a shame. Thank you.

286
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,599
Ooh! Er...
Oh, my goodness.

287
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:04,271
I feel a bit dizzy.

288
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:09,391
Might I sit down for a moment?
Of course, ma'am. Please come in.

289
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:17,813
May I fetch you a glass of water?
No. Thank you, Spratt. I just...

290
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:20,199
need to sit quietly
for a few minutes.

291
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,020
Certainly, ma'am.
Please ring if you need anything.

292
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:56,134
Eureka!

293
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,295
You've been kind.
But I'm feeling much better.

294
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:12,487
So... I'll be on my way.

295
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,311
Oh.

296
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:18,839
Would you give this to Lady Grantham

297
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:19,993
on her return?

298
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:23,735
I found it down the side
of the chair I was sitting in.

299
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,394
She will be pleased.
She was very upset at its loss.

300
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:28,395
I hope she'll be pleased.

301
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:30,396
I'm not certain that she will.

302
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,175
But I hope so.

303
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:47,964
Mr Molesley.

304
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,624
What can I do for you?

305
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:51,929
I was at the station this morning.

306
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:55,587
We're... we're renewing
the gravel out front.

307
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:58,152
And erm... I ran into young Alfred.

308
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:01,398
He's off on his way to London.
Yes.

309
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:06,987
So er... as he is going after all,
I thought...

310
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:13,673
..I'll look in... to confirm my
willingness to... return to Downton.

311
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:18,697
Mr Molesley. I'm glad you are,
as you put it, willing.

312
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:23,162
But I cannot feel
the word expresses... the kind of...

313
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,163
enthusiasm I am looking for
in a new footman.

314
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:29,317
What?
When we last discussed it,

315
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:35,138
you made it quite clear that you didn't wish
to plunge down the ladder of preferment.

316
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:37,551
I was willing to.

317
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:41,843
As you keep saying.
But I don't want to humiliate you.

318
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:44,299
You feel you're meant for
better things.

319
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,127
And I won't contradict you.

320
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:49,491
Unfortunately,
we have no higher place to offer

321
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,958
in this house.
I know. But I said...

322
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,344
And you have your pride...
and I respect you for it.

323
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:01,235
Good day, Mr Molesley.

324
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,946
Mrs Crawley and Dr Clarkson,
Your Ladyship.

325
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,812
Oh. To what do I owe this treat?

326
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,425
Lady Grantham,
you've already changed for dinner.

327
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,417
We'll erm...
we'll come back tomorrow.

328
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,708
No. My curiosity...
would not brook such a delay.

329
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,092
Did Spratt give you the paper knife?

330
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,183
Yes. Then it's quite clear
that Pegg did not steal it.

331
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:36,420
Or are you going to argue now that
he sneaked it back in here when
he realised what trouble he was in?

332
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,476
Well...

333
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:39,766
It's a thought.

334
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:40,917
But a despicable one.

335
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:46,201
What can I say to persuade you
out of your injustice and stubbornness?

336
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,738
Can't you see the damage you do?
Now...

337
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,624
Hold your horses, Mrs Crawley.

338
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:54,216
Lady Grantham has a right of reply.

339
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:59,129
Oh, thank you, Dr Clarkson. Now, if you
will put up your cudgels for a moment...

340
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,414
Oh, Spratt. Has the young gardener
Pegg brought in the vegetables yet?

341
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,824
What?
He's in the kitchen now, My Lady.

342
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:11,296
Please ask him to step in here.
Into the drawing room, Your Ladyship?

343
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:15,307
Well, ask him to remove his boots,
if that will soothe your nerves.

344
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:21,801
I don't understand. No.
If you wish to understand things,

345
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:25,256
you must come out from behind
your prejudice and listen.

346
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:33,972
Your Ladyship? Yes. Could you
give an account to Mrs Crawley

347
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:36,710
of what transpired between us
this afternoon?

348
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,877
I'm... sorry, My Lady?

349
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,847
Tell her what I said to you.

350
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,804
Her Ladyship sent for me. So I came.

351
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:46,502
She said she'd been mistaken
in saying that I were a thief,

352
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:49,324
which she knew now to be untrue.
She gave me my job back.

353
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:52,007
Said she was sorry and...
asked if I could forgive her.

354
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:54,122
Which you have.
I certainly have, Doctor.

355
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,409
Thank you. You may go.

356
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:57,973
Out. Come on.

357
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:02,905
Well?

358
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:09,886
Well... I'd say that was game,
set and match to Lady Grantham.

359
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:15,663
You're dining at The Netherby?

360
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:18,350
I know. It's quite something,
isn't it, My Lady?

361
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:22,076
I don't think we've eaten in a hotel
since before we were married.

362
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:23,799
You don't mind, do you?

363
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:26,399
Not at all. And don't rush back.

364
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,135
It won't kill me
to get myself to bed.

365
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:30,944
I'll be back, don't you worry.

366
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:37,274
Did I tell you that Mr Napier and
Mr Blake will be here in time for dinner

367
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:39,256
on his Lordship's birthday?

368
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:41,682
Rather a baptism of fire.

369
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:43,934
How long are they going to stay?

370
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:45,464
I'm not sure.

371
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,399
It's open-ended.

372
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:49,922
Which Granny would never approve of.

373
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:54,593
Bates?

374
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,188
I don't seem to have it.

375
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:05,827
Could you look again? Because
we definitely made a reservation.

376
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:08,047
Maybe you each thought
the other had done it.

377
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:11,048
I made the booking.
I'm afraid we're very full tonight.

378
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:14,155
The Countess of Grantham
has a large party with her.

379
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:16,355
Lady Grantham's here?
Among our patrons

380
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:18,746
are some of the greatest names
in Yorkshire society.

381
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:22,370
And the countess is among them.
Yes. We know her.

382
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:24,704
Huh! Oh.

383
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,278
These people claim to know you,
Your Ladyship.

384
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:30,759
Well, we didn't...
I know them both very well indeed.

385
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,521
You're dining here, Anna? We were. But
there seems to be a mix-up with the table.

386
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:37,349
Well, I'm sure it can be sorted out.

387
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:39,967
In a jiffy, My Lady. In a jiffy.

388
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,463
If you would like to wait
one moment.

389
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:48,167
That seems to have made
a difference. Thank God he's a snob.

390
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:52,875
My Lady, I promise you - I'm sure not.
But don't let's spoil the effect now.

391
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,159
To be honest,
I wish I could join you.

392
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,623
But I'd better get back.

393
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:04,771
Well, if you'd like to follow me...

394
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,386
And er... please excuse
the little hiccup earlier.

395
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:20,951
It will be the last.

396
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:23,479
Ah. Yes.

397
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:30,614
I do apologise, My Lady.
But this came in the evening post

398
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:32,599
and it appears
to have been overlooked.

399
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,643
Not to worry.

400
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:46,760
Is anything the matter?

401
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:49,729
No. Not at all.

402
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,135
Why, Mr Molesley.
How can we help you?

403
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,469
I was... wondering...

404
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:05,375
..if by any chance er...
Mr Carson had changed his mind.

405
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,092
I'm afraid not.

406
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:13,865
I'd've thought
he'd value my... caution.

407
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:15,284
My wanting to...

408
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:18,250
weigh up the pros and cons
before rushing in.

409
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:21,670
So, is this it, then?

410
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:24,196
Do I just go back to
mending the roads?

411
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:27,091
Oh, don't give up so easily.

412
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:31,228
Now. Let me get some more hot water.

413
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:38,944
Look. There's a seat over there.

414
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,515
Let's sit down.
We're not in a hurry.

415
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:43,248
If you say so.

416
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,496
Such a lovely night.

417
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,429
Look at that moon.
It's as bright as a light bulb.

418
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,973
So, what do you make of
this Valentino chappy, then?

419
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:03,868
Is he your type?
He is not. I think he's slithery.

420
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:07,881
If I were Agnes, I'd've gone straight back
to London as quick as I could find a boat.

421
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,775
So, you don't like romance?

422
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:12,870
Well... I wouldn't say that.

423
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,934
Get off, will you?! Get off me!

424
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:36,917
I've been good to you, Ivy.

425
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:41,647
I've taken you to the theatre, and to the cinema. I've
never been that nice to any girl before.

426
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:46,794
Am I supposed to feel lucky?
It's dishonest to take from a bloke
without giving him in return.

427
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:49,300
I don't think it's playing the game.

428
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,626
Well, I'm not playing YOUR game!

429
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:53,661
And you'd better
get used to that idea.

430
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,117
Here's to us.

431
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:04,531
Sorry.

432
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:08,195
I was a fool to think
we could leave it behind.

433
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,846
Don't be sorry. I'm sorry.

434
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:14,071
But you see, every time I remember
what you've been through...

435
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,389
I want to murder.

436
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,737
But I'm not a victim.

437
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,938
That's not who I am.

438
00:27:21,452 --> 00:27:23,635
The worst part is,
you see me as a victim.

439
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:27,200
No, my darling. I see you as
a woman I should've protected.

440
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:28,810
I'm the failure here, not you.

441
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:30,207
Can I interrupt?

442
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,321
I wondered if you
want a lift home. Stark's here.

443
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:35,483
That seems such an imposition.

444
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:40,058
Not at all. And it should mean you
get a table here for the rest of your life.

445
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,822
Can we have our coats, please?
The three of us?

446
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:48,316
It would be my pleasure.

447
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,755
This is very kind, My Lady.
Have you had a good evening?

448
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,229
Yes.
Yes, very good, thank you.

449
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,195
Well, don't sound so hesitant, or
the maitre d' will kill himself!

450
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:01,227
No, we've had a lovely time.

451
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,662
He didn't hurt you?
No.

452
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:11,996
But he asked for things no man
should want before they're married.

453
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:15,303
Yes. I think we're a bit more clear
about that than they are.

454
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:17,794
I suppose he's been sweet-talking me
so he could have his way.

455
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:22,796
I thought he was so nice. How many women
have said that since the Norman Conquest?

456
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:26,952
Alfred would never have done such
a thing. He had too much respect.

457
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,759
Don't start.
What do you mean?

458
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:33,705
You break Alfred's heart, so now he's alone
in a city that terrifies him.

459
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,282
You break my heart
by driving him away.

460
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,921
I don't care about
your good opinion of Alfred.

461
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:41,922
If you'd discovered it earlier,
you'd've spared us a lot of grief.

462
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:47,111
What was all that about?

463
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:50,281
Oh, I'd say it was about the fact
that you've had it coming.

464
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,930
It was nice of you to
give them a lift. I was glad to.

465
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:58,290
But...

466
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:04,930
I may be mistaken, but I'm afraid
things have gone wrong between those two.

467
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:08,930
That's sad to hear. It's not just
a case of a marriage gone sour.

468
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:12,444
Anna's been hurt somehow. And Bates
feels he should've protected her.

469
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:14,576
I don't want any of that
to leave this room, Baxter.

470
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:16,730
Course not, My Lady.

471
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,982
Edith? My most darling girl.
What's the matter?

472
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:33,309
But I'm not your most darling girl,
am I?

473
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:36,264
I love my children equally.

474
00:29:37,724 --> 00:29:40,794
I don't know why people say that
when it's almost never true.

475
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:45,647
Look, if this is about Michael Gregson, do you
want me to get involved? Send someone over?

476
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,016
No.

477
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:49,125
His office has already done that.

478
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:53,565
There's a detective in Munich now,
working with the German Police.

479
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:55,717
Then you just have to be patient.

480
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:57,795
I want to know what's happened.

481
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:01,735
If he's... trapped somewhere or...

482
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:03,810
falsely imprisoned.

483
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,789
Or even dead.

484
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:08,896
I mean it.

485
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:13,321
If the worst's happened,
I want to know.

486
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:18,798
It's just so impossible to plan
in this... fog.

487
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:21,242
Well, I'm sure he's not dead.

488
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:23,825
No, you aren't.

489
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:26,487
Because none of us can be.

490
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,703
But how was she hurt?

491
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:37,220
What happened to her?

492
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,274
I'm just telling you what
Her Ladyship told Lady Mary.

493
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:43,166
I don't know anything else.
Then keep your ears open.

494
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:45,251
I always do.

495
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:48,846
What's the matter?

496
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,280
I don't really like telling tales.

497
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:55,476
You knew the conditions
when you came here.

498
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:57,697
I did.
So, what's changed?

499
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:00,611
She's polite, she's...

500
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,274
considerate.
I don't feel she's deserved it.

501
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,328
Now, listen.

502
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,370
What you have to decide
is where your first loyalties are.

503
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
With her... or with me.

504
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,061
All right.

505
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:20,415
Have it your own way.
Oh, I intend to.

506
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:36,982
Thank you.

507
00:31:46,925 --> 00:31:48,505
It's so kind of you all to have us.

508
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:51,941
Isn't it, Charles?
It is.

509
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,479
We're anxious to do our bit.

510
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:56,026
What do you mean by that?

511
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:01,381
Well, you're here to advise
the landowners on how to get through
this crisis, aren't you?

512
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:03,418
To save the estates that need saving.

513
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,719
I'm afraid Evelyn may have given you
the wrong impression.

514
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,713
In what way?
The government is aware

515
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:11,313
that great estates are being sold
in large numbers.

516
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:15,652
Precisely. North Yorkshire has a lot
of these estates, big and small.

517
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,752
And many are in difficulty. We will have
every variety of problem to study.

518
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:22,756
And you're here to help.
Not quite.

519
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:26,984
We're here to analyse the situation
and ask whether our society
is shifting fundamentally.

520
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:29,531
Will it affect food production,
and so on?

521
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:34,771
So... you don't care about the owners,
just about food supply.

522
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:37,018
If that's how you want to put it...

523
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:39,564
And doesn't that seem mean-spirited?

524
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:43,156
Mr Lloyd George is more concerned
with feeding the population
than rescuing the aristocracy.

525
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:47,450
I don't find that mean-spirited.
You may find us disappointing guests

526
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:49,972
if you want us to stay up till
two in the morning being witty.

527
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:52,841
Don't worry. I don't expect
Mr Blake to be witty!

528
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,883
How long will you be here? Until the job is
done and we can write a report.

529
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:00,323
If you'll have us.
You must be sure to get rid of us
when we become a nuisance.

530
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:03,473
The gong is rung at seven and we
meet in the drawing room at eight.

531
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,350
You know it's Robert's birthday?

532
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:08,021
So you must try to be witty tonight,
Mr Blake.

533
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:10,192
After that,
we'll lower our expectations.

534
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:12,058
The girls will show you up.

535
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:19,368
Hello, Mr Molesley. There's a chair
here. No, I'm not here to eat.

536
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,650
Why have you come, then?
Mrs Hughes sent for me.

537
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:26,702
She said you had a big party tonight
and it'd be useful to Mrs Patmore
if I serve the servants tea.

538
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:30,490
What?
Mrs Patmore has a lot to do.

539
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,960
Mr Molesley said he would help.

540
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,689
To serve the servants tea?

541
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,805
He's not proud, Mr Carson.

542
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,850
He wants to be useful
where he can be.

543
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:49,461
Oh, all right. I give in!

544
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,721
I cannot fight a war on every front.

545
00:33:53,476 --> 00:33:55,436
Mr Carson?
Look out a livery.

546
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:57,698
You can start tonight,
move in tomorrow.

547
00:33:57,862 --> 00:33:59,852
Thank you, Mr Carson. Very much.

548
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,558
And don't forget the gloves.

549
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:12,337
Lady Rose! Can I help? Oh, please.
Don't let me disturb you.

550
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:14,292
But I wanted to make a speech.

551
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:16,403
Mrs Hughes may have told you -

552
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:19,308
I haven't yet.
Well, we should tell them now.

553
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,525
As a treat for His Lordship,

554
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,844
a London band is coming to play
after dinner.

555
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,086
A London band. That's the berries.

556
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:27,835
From a nightclub called The Lotus.

557
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:30,245
A nightclub, My Lady? Really?

558
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:32,664
But it must be a complete surprise.

559
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:35,468
No-one knows anything.
And they mustn't. That is,

560
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,883
Her Ladyship knows something's going
to happen, but even she doesn't know what.

561
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,650
And you think she'll be pleased.
She'll be thrilled.

562
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:44,979
We'll look after your secret.
So, until then, if you can just
make them comfortable.

563
00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:47,424
I know musicians are outside
your daily round.

564
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,423
Don't worry about that, My Lady.
We can take it in our stride.

565
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:55,820
We may be Yorkshiremen, but we do
know a little of life in the city.

566
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,769
Hello? Uh... is anyone there?

567
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,456
I think this is where
we're supposed to be.

568
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:13,534
Welcome to Downton.

569
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,179
I thought I'd come up early...

570
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:23,811
and spend some time with George.

571
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,595
I told Nanny I'd feed him.
But now you can do it.

572
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:28,470
He'd like that.
Oh, I doubt it.

573
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:32,920
He probably thinks, who's this
funny old lady? But never mind.

574
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:38,757
By the way...
I thought I'd be Grandmamma.

575
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:40,618
And then Cora can be Granny.

576
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:44,022
And what about Sybbie?
What should she call you?

577
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:48,247
Well, Aunt Isobel, I think. I'm not
quite a real aunt, but I nearly am.

578
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,480
Did I read that your friend
Lord Gillingham is engaged?

579
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,945
Yes. To Miss Lane Fox.

580
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,296
I hope you don't mind. I should so
hate for you to be unhappy.

581
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:01,360
I'm not unhappy.

582
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,623
I'm just... not quite ready
to be happy.

583
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:12,528
When I got engaged, I was so
in love with Reginald I felt sick.

584
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:14,815
I was sick with love.

585
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,857
Literally.

586
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:21,838
It seems so odd to think about it
now. It really does.

587
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:23,507
It was the same for me.

588
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:29,274
As if I'd gone mad, or been
hypnotised, or something. For days.

589
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:30,783
Weeks.

590
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:33,276
All I could think about was her.

591
00:36:33,913 --> 00:36:34,962
And me.

592
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,159
I was standing outside
in the snow...

593
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:40,358
and I didn't have a coat.

594
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:45,471
But I wasn't cold...
because all I kept thinking was...

595
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:49,583
He's going to propose.
He's going to propose.

596
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:53,995
Well.

597
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:56,860
Aren't we the lucky ones?

598
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,154
Oh! Look who's here!

599
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,115
Hello, Sybbie.
Hello.

600
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:10,192
Have you never thought of
visiting Africa?

601
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:12,778
And why should I go to Africa,
Mr Carson?

602
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:14,310
I'm no more African than you are.

603
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,293
Well... not much more.

604
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:21,418
My people came over in the 1790s.
We won't go into why or how.

605
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:24,170
Oh, no. Better left unsaid.
Mr Ross.

606
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:29,165
You've uncovered something about the
past that Mr Carson doesn't approve of.
Well done!

607
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:33,278
Not so fast, Mrs Hughes. We led the
world in the fight against slavery.

608
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:36,387
Remember Lord Henley's judgment
of 1763?

609
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:39,228
'If a man sets foot
on English soil...

610
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:43,235
then he is free.'
Don't undo Mr Ross's good work.

611
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:50,762
Ivy. When I said that I could -

612
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:56,536
Oh, goodness. Is that the time?

613
00:37:56,537 --> 00:37:59,335
I'm first down. I just want to check
everything's on track.

614
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:03,223
I gave them something to eat, as they'll be
playing during the servants' dinner.

615
00:38:03,224 --> 00:38:05,728
Yes, that was very kind.
Wait until Carson has

616
00:38:05,729 --> 00:38:08,086
everyone in their seat
before you start setting up.

617
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,061
I will.

618
00:38:11,528 --> 00:38:13,982
Well...
..she's quite a character.

619
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:15,269
Lady Rose?

620
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,517
That's one word for her!

621
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,401
But I can't help feeling sorry
for the poor pigs.

622
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:32,809
Do you eat bacon?

623
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,444
Yes.

624
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:37,278
Sausages?
Yes.

625
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:40,319
Then you are a sentimentalist
who cannot face the truth.

626
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:42,715
I'm not often called sentimental.

627
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,776
Your friend seems to be putting
Mary through her paces.

628
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:49,611
I'm afraid, Charles will take on
anyone with a sense of entitlement.

629
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:53,854
You mean, Mary feels entitled to take
charge? She's welcome to take charge of me.

630
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,752
Molesley. Glad to be back?

631
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:00,435
Surprised, more like, My Lady.

632
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,850
But I suppose I'll be called...
Joseph now.

633
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:07,089
I...I don't think I can manage that.
Nor can I.

634
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:12,659
Carson, you don't mind if we go on calling Molesley
Molesley, do you? Of course not, My Lord.

635
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:15,507
Why do you want to emigrate?

636
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:19,105
Because I realised
I'd never fit in at Downton.

637
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:23,040
They're very fond of you here.
I think they are.

638
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:27,274
And I'm fond of them.
I love them, really.

639
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,547
Though, it surprises me to say it.

640
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:31,692
But I'm not one of them.

641
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,683
And I cannot make a life here.

642
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,690
Why not?

643
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,728
Would there be another earl's daughter
who'd be keen to take me on, do you think?

644
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:41,884
Oh, I don't know.

645
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,477
It would depend on her.

646
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,251
No. She wouldn't.

647
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,479
There aren't many...
as free as my Sybil.

648
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:54,593
Well, I agree with that.

649
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,157
So... should I bring a nice
Irish working girl to live here?

650
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:01,553
Would that make everyone comfy?

651
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:06,183
Isobel really appears to be
coming out of the mist.

652
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,655
I'm so pleased.
Well, don't be too pleased.

653
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,504
Part of her recovery
is going back into battle.

654
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:15,126
If she's fighting for her causes
again, that seems a good sign.

655
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:16,980
A sign of what?

656
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:20,549
That we should close the shutters
and bar the door?

657
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,278
She likes to fight
for what she believes in.

658
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:26,804
Oh, no. It's not a matter of
what she likes. It is her fuel.

659
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:30,838
Some people run on... greed...

660
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:32,723
..lust, even love.

661
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:36,439
She runs on indignation!

662
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:39,527
I'm catching the ladies' eye.

663
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:41,857
Oh, no.
Rose?

664
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:44,131
No. We're not splitting tonight.

665
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,326
We're all going out together.

666
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,136
What on earth is she talking about?
What?

667
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:52,337
Quick - play!
And a one, two, three.

668
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,818
Happy birthday, Cousin Robert!

669
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:57,733
I say!

670
00:40:57,734 --> 00:41:02,000
♪ I'm just wild about Harry ♪

671
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:07,211
♪ And Harry's wild about me ♪

672
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:12,212
♪ The heavenly blisses of his kisses ♪

673
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:16,591
♪ Fill me with ecstasy ♪

674
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:21,672
♪ He's sweet, just like chocolate candy ♪

675
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:26,267
♪ And just like honey from bees... ♪

676
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,436
Who is this singer?
And how did he get here?

677
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:31,182
Isn't it... rather odd?

678
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:32,911
No, I think it's fun.

679
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:39,584
♪ He's just wild about me... ♪

680
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:43,407
But, Granny, is it really... suitable
that Rose has brought this man here?

681
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:47,912
Oh, my dear, we country-dwellers
must beware of being provincial.

682
00:41:49,224 --> 00:41:52,845
Try and let your time in London
rub off on you a little, hm?

683
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:01,666
I'd love to know which estates
you're going to examine.

684
00:42:02,738 --> 00:42:03,703
I'm sure you would.

685
00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:06,275
You mustn't be too discreet.

686
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:08,505
After a while, it gets a little dull.

687
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,833
You seem to have brought
a traitor into our midst.

688
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:22,794
Not a traitor.
An enemy, then.

689
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:25,041
He's obviously not on our side.

690
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:28,749
It is a bit wild...
jazz at Downton Abbey.

691
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,425
I think it's lovely.

692
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,141
You see, Tom...

693
00:42:32,545 --> 00:42:34,353
things can happen at Downton

694
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:37,390
that no-one imagined
even a few years ago.

695
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,813
Take heart from that.

696
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:42,252
Before you throw in the towel.

697
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,221
Is this your first experience
of jazz, Lady Grantham?

698
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:49,219
Oh, is that what it is?

699
00:42:50,614 --> 00:42:53,501
Do you think any of them know
what the others are playing?

700
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:55,461
Hm?

701
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:04,233
♪ He's just wild about me ♪

702
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:12,271
Did you ask me to come down?
I did.

703
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:14,590
We've made some sandwiches for you
and the others,

704
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:17,075
as I doubt you'll be off duty
before midnight.

705
00:43:17,076 --> 00:43:21,148
We'll set a little table inside the green
baize door. They sound good from down here.

706
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:25,004
If you like that sort of thing.
I thought Mr Ross was very nice.

707
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:27,143
So did I, strange to relate.

708
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,288
Though, it's still an odd sort of
thing to be happening at Downton.

709
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,483
Makes you want to jig about,
dun't it? Certainly not!

710
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:46,343
I think...
I think we've done enough now.

711
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:49,475
You know - to show that we're
good sports. Of course, of course.

712
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:51,554
I do think it was a brilliant idea.

713
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:55,460
But it must be costing Rose
a fortune.

714
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:56,742
Shall we chip in?

715
00:43:57,386 --> 00:44:00,564
Or pay it. Get the bandleader
to send me the bill.

716
00:44:01,412 --> 00:44:04,280
I'll go down at the end of the night
and catch him before he leaves.

717
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,483
I'm afraid I don't
share your enthusiasm for her.

718
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:10,808
Why not? She's the type
who demands all this as a right.

719
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:12,719
But she wants it on a plate.

720
00:44:13,561 --> 00:44:15,889
She won' work for it
and she won't fight for it.

721
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,890
And that type
doesn't deserve to survive.

722
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:19,664
I don't want to make trouble...

723
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:22,727
but she feels
much the same about you.

724
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,911
Oh, Edith!

725
00:44:28,923 --> 00:44:31,006
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong.

726
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:32,982
How do you know something's wrong?

727
00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:37,467
Because I'm your mother.
Is it Michael? Is there any news?

728
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:38,891
Not really.

729
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:42,611
He went to Munich a few weeks ago.
That's all they know.

730
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:44,689
Well, of course you're worried.

731
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:56,425
Well, it's not often that a birthday
surprise really is a surprise.

732
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,679
I just hope we haven't
shocked the servants too much.

733
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,534
Carson was ready to faint.

734
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:03,207
Although, amazingly,
he told me that the bandleader...

735
00:45:03,692 --> 00:45:05,507
'..was a very decent fellow,
My Lord.'

736
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:08,677
So perhaps we'll make a modern of
him after all.I doubt it.

737
00:45:09,193 --> 00:45:12,663
Oh. And there's no news on Mr Gregson.
He's still missing.

738
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:14,106
Edith told me.

739
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:16,561
But I'm sure he'll be fine.

740
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:20,598
By the way. Did you ever read
that letter from Harold? I did.

741
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,638
And I've had one from Mother.
I didn't wanna bother you.

742
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,523
But I think he's in a deep hole.

743
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:28,493
Have you ever met this Senator Fall?
Not that I remember.

744
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:32,630
I suppose he may be innocent.
Nothing's been proved.

745
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,255
The one thing that has been proved
is that Harold was a fool to get involved.

746
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:38,132
Don't get riled about it now.

747
00:45:38,657 --> 00:45:40,357
Come to bed and dream of ragtime.

748
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:01,494
Is anyone still awake?

749
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:04,948
Mary?

750
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:07,910
What are you doing down here?

751
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,898
I was looking for Mr Ross.

752
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:17,225
Mr Ross, I wanted to thank you
for a marvellous evening.

753
00:46:17,226 --> 00:46:21,114
And also to ask you if you would be kind
enough to send the bill to His Lordship.

754
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:23,337
But that's not necessary.
He wants to.

755
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:27,264
He says... your present
was arranging the whole thing.

756
00:46:28,104 --> 00:46:29,128
Of course.

757
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,360
And now it's my turn to thank you.

758
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,592
I've been so well looked after here.

759
00:46:35,116 --> 00:46:36,198
I'm glad to hear it.

760
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:40,391
Well... goodnight.

761
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:53,576
His Lordship is going to America?

762
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,988
'Robert must be there.' Why?
My being there won't make any difference.

763
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:01,231
I'm feeling rather ill. I wanted him
away before I... keel over.

764
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:04,885
How can two brainless dullards like
us ever hope to entertain Mr Blake?

765
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:07,356
Mary!
That sounded a little rude.

766
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:09,659
How long have you been like this?

767
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,704
I really don't feel well at all.

768
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:16,055
Darling, please tell me what's the matter.
You've seemed so... preoccupied lately.

769
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:18,812
I think this is the right place.
Well, it is Mr Gillingham!

770
00:47:18,813 --> 00:47:20,642
I suppose you could
to shake us up again.

771
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,998
