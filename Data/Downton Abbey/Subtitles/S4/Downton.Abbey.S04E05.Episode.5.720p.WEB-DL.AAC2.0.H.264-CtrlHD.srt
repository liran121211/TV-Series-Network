1
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,164
I don't know why you always
wait for me. There's no need.

2
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,291
I want to be the first
to greet you every morning.

3
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:28,419
Well, as I said... there's no need.

4
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,504
There's -

5
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:32,588
There's every need.

6
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,634
And I will keep it up until you explain to me
what has gone wrong between us. Explain what?

7
00:01:37,676 --> 00:01:39,725
My life is perfect.

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,054
And then, in the space of one day,
it is nothing.

9
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:46,057
To me, that requires an explanation.

10
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,268
Oh, good morning, Miss Baxter.
Hello, Mr Bates, Mrs Bates.

11
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:53,402
I wondered if you'd help me.
We will, if we can.

12
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:56,440
It's my sewing machine.
I have no sockets in my room.

13
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,531
And, as the sewing room
is in the laundry wing,

14
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:01,694
I wondered if Mrs Hughes might let
me use it in the servants' hall.

15
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,904
I should ask her, if I were you.
Yes, of course.

16
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,871
I'll do that.

17
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:09,032
What do you make of her?

18
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:14,328
I think she's nice. Which prompts me to
wonder what she sees in our friend Thomas.

19
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,413
You know the old saying.

20
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:19,373
'There's nowt so queer as folk. '

21
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:23,668
We'll miss breakfast,
if we're not careful.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,924
Are you happy for us to be
teaching Alfred to cook?

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,099
It's Mr Carson you should ask.

24
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:36,136
Ask me what?
About the kitchen staff

25
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:38,269
helping Alfred to train for his test.

26
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:41,397
He's been accepted for it, then?
Not yet, no.

27
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:44,517
But he'd like to be ready if he is.
I suppose it's all right.

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,770
Alfred is a hard worker.
I'll give him that.

29
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,779
And if cooking's his chosen path...

30
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:55,067
Good. I was just checking
I wasn't inciting a revolution.

31
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,452
There we are... My Lady.

32
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:11,746
I think I've remembered everything.
But...

33
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:13,831
I'll just stay here while you check.

34
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:16,923
It seems perfect, but...
What's this?

35
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:21,045
Well, I know Americans often
drink orange juice with breakfast.

36
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,647
So I thought you might like it.

37
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,215
That is so considerate, Baxter.

38
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,348
Thank you.

39
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:31,344
Good morning, My Lord.
Good morning.

40
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,394
You look very jovial.

41
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,515
It's just Baxter reminding me
of times gone by.

42
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,850
You're pleased with her.
I am, thank heaven.

43
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:44,938
What's your day looking like? Tom and
Mary have summoned me to the library.

44
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:48,190
They have an idea. I hope it's not
something you're going to fight about.

45
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:51,234
How can I answer that
when I don't know what it is.

46
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:58,531
So if we find a job for the boy,
it'll make a difference to his mother.

47
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,217
Oh, a big difference. If you really
want to help Mrs Pegg,

48
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,868
this will be of more use than
a world of tea and sympathy.

49
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,919
Well, I don't need anyone else here.
I know.

50
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:10,005
But would you talk to
the head gardener up at the abbey?

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,292
Or maybe even talk to Lady Grantham.
She takes her garden seriously.

52
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:15,874
You don't have to tell me that.

53
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,421
I'm sorry. When's the funeral?

54
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:20,464
Tomorrow. Will you go?

55
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:24,592
I will. His forebears have been
tenants since the reign of George III.

56
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,594
Be that as it may,
the rent's not been paid for ages.

57
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,846
We've served all the papers.
It's time to get on with it.

58
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:32,932
You mean, foreclose the lease
and farm the land ourselves?

59
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:35,058
That's what we discussed.

60
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,143
It's sad, though.

61
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:40,146
After such a long time
in the hands of one family.

62
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,481
The world moves on, and we must
move with it. So you keep telling me.

63
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:47,693
Talking of the world moving on,
I suppose you've seen this.

64
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,907
'The engagement is announced between
the Viscount Gillingham

65
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,956
and the Honourable Mabel Lane Fox,

66
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:59,952
only child of the late
Lord Osweston. '

67
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:04,205
Well, I must...
write and congratulate him.

68
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,292
Now... let me get on.

69
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:18,925
But it's electric. Aren't you
worried it'll run away with itself

70
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,926
and sew your fingers to the table?

71
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,887
I certainly hope not.
How do you operate it? With a pedal

72
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:28,140
- under my foot.
Well, I don't think it has any business in a servants' hall.

73
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:32,351
But there's no socket in her room.
She could take it to the laundry.

74
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:35,479
Or, better still,
chuck it out altogether!

75
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,689
Mrs Patmore is not
what you'd call a futurist.

76
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,649
I think I'd got there already.

77
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,986
Anna.
I've forgotten something.

78
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:53,242
You must forgive me, Mr Bates.
I'm afraid I'm keeping Anna too busy.

79
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:58,371
Would you like to have a try?

80
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,835
Anna?

81
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:20,387
I don't know why you must be
so hard on Mr Bates.

82
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:23,556
At least you know now there'll be...
no baby.

83
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,606
No.

84
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,727
Then, can't you start
to get past it and...

85
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,728
and tell him something?

86
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,855
He'd know if it wasn't the truth.

87
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:38,109
He sees through me.
He can read me like a book.

88
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:40,194
I wish he could read you.

89
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:43,363
And take you out of this...
veil of shadows.

90
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,366
Don't you want to be honest with him?

91
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,451
Of course I do.

92
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,744
But I know him. I know what he'd do.

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,872
And I can't risk his future.

94
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,917
Well... it's your secret and not mine.

95
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,002
But I think it's a mistake.

96
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:16,478
And you're sure
you have a feel for gardening?

97
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:19,723
I am, Your Ladyship. I'm not
a ladyship. Just Mrs Crawley.

98
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,892
I... I don't know much now.
But I'm a grafter.

99
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,977
And a quick learner.

100
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:27,229
I cannot make promises, but I will
try and find something for you.

101
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,064
Thank you very much, Your Ladyship.

102
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:37,612
Will you show him out?

103
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:45,826
He's going to be so disappointed when
he finds out how ordinary I really am.

104
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:48,912
You're part of the family.
That's how the village sees you.

105
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,039
It's not how the family see me.

106
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,124
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

107
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,216
Lord and Lady Grantham have always
been as kind as they can be.

108
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:01,338
And I appreciate it. But I am not one
of them. And that's the end of it.

109
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,423
Lord Grantham admires you very much.

110
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:06,717
But if it serves you to think yourself
unloved, nothing I say will change that.

111
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,803
I think that's rather harsh.

112
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:39,033
Lord Grantham. It was a very good
service. Your father would've been pleased.

113
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:41,118
Thank you.

114
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,203
Do you have far to go?
I'm staying at Yew Tree Farm.

115
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:46,288
Of course.

116
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,332
Let us know when you're
ready to leave. There's no hurry.

117
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:51,626
The thing is, My Lord,
I... don't want to move out.

118
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,461
I want to take on the tenancy.

119
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:57,595
What?
If it's still possible.

120
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,882
I'm sorry to be the one to say it,
but I don't believe it is.

121
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,092
The notices have been served.
The case is closed.

122
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:08,180
You mean,
you want to farm the land yourself.

123
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,313
Then it's all settled.

124
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:13,434
Mr Drewe, it's no good
painting me as Simon Legree.

125
00:09:14,476 --> 00:09:17,061
We gave your father a long time
to get straight.

126
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,647
And left him in peace
at the end of his life.

127
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:21,773
He never told me about the debt.

128
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:24,900
Or I'd've tried to help him.

129
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:30,071
Because my ancestors have farmed at
Yew Tree since the Napoleonic Wars.

130
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:33,157
Surely, that's got to mean something.

131
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,242
It means a great deal to me.

132
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,369
Then, can we talk about it, My Lord?

133
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,664
Please?

134
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:45,791
Come tomorrow morning, if you wish.

135
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,876
But I can't see
what good it will do.

136
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,131
Don't take it off too soon. Let it
bubble a bit, or you'll taste the flour.

137
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,140
So... is this enough?
I'd say so, yeah.

138
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:01,309
Now put it to one side
while you check your casings.

139
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:06,432
My, my. Something smells good. Alfred's making
tarts with an egg and cheese filling. Oh.

140
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,725
Bouchees de fromage.
They could be tonight's savoury.

141
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,770
Do you think? I don't see why not.
I'll fetch the eggs.

142
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,898
Well done, Daisy.
It's very hard, Mrs Patmore.

143
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:20,234
I feel like I'm helping him
to leave us. And so you are.

144
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:23,117
Which is as it should be,
now he's decided to go.

145
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:27,489
So, what's next? We'll add egg and cheese to
the white sauce, if Mrs Patmore doesn't mind.

146
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:31,617
I don't mind at all, Daisy. You can
help him enrich the bechamel.

147
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,790
Your Ladyship. My Lady.

148
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:43,960
Is that the afternoon post?
Is there anything for me?

149
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:46,253
There's just a couple
for His Lordship, My Lady.

150
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:49,380
Were you expecting something?

151
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,465
Not particularly.

152
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:54,426
I haven't heard from Michael
in a bit, that's all.

153
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:56,552
I expect he's busy.

154
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,932
What have you been up to?

155
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:05,893
I was writing to Tony Gillingham.

156
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,019
Give him my regards.

157
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,238
Say we look forward to knowing
Miss Lane Fox.

158
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:16,282
I am surprised.
I thought he was rather keen on you.

159
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:19,570
Not for the first time, you've
got the wrong end of the stick.

160
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,704
Oh. I thought you were Robert.

161
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:25,803
Is he back from his funeral?
Not yet, I don't think.

162
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:28,868
While he's not here,
shall we discuss his birthday?

163
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:32,079
Oh, does he have a birthday soon?
Fairly soon.

164
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:35,040
Do you have any plans?

165
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:37,166
Nothing beyond his favourite food.

166
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,460
It's not a special one.
Why don't we have a party?

167
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:43,588
To cheer ourselves up. A small one.
That'll be fun.

168
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:51,886
But Maley may have a candidate of his
own that he wants to bring forward.

169
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,970
So, you do need extra help.

170
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,055
I suppose so.

171
00:11:57,098 --> 00:12:00,308
The last boy went off
to a frightfully grand rectory.

172
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:02,393
Then, will you take young Pegg?

173
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:05,319
He impressed me so favourably.

174
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:07,481
You know, I wonder your halo
doesn't grow heavy.

175
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,657
It must be like wearing a tiara
round the clock.

176
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:15,743
Will you help him?
His mother would be very grateful.

177
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,906
And so would I. Yes, but
your gratitude never seems to last.

178
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:24,076
I've no sooner said yes than
you come back with another request.

179
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,286
Will you?

180
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,455
Very well. Very well.

181
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:33,583
But he'd better turn out
to be all the things you say he is.

182
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,714
Thought I'd get an extra
10 minutes in before the gong goes.

183
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:42,847
You can help me with this.

184
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:45,175
Sybbie says there's going to be
a hurricane any moment now.

185
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:49,102
A hurricane? Really? In Yorkshire?

186
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:52,229
So we're getting all the animals
under shelter.

187
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:56,476
I'm sure you are. Where's Nanny?
Collecting some clothes from laundry.

188
00:12:56,517 --> 00:13:00,687
I said I'd stay with them. She's so much
more relaxed than our nanny ever was.

189
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,856
My childhood wasn't
anything like Sybbie's.

190
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:07,942
Nor mine, God knows. Do you think
she's having a good childhood?

191
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:14,155
That we're doing well? I think you're doing
your best for her... if that's what you mean.

192
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:16,240
It isn't quite.

193
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:19,493
Oh. I think it's time
for the hurricane.

194
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:24,747
Whoo!
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

195
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,924
This came for you in the last post.

196
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,962
Is that the letter that says if
they'll see you? I think it must be.

197
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:37,214
Well, open it, then. Oh, go on.
Don't keep us in suspense.

198
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,384
I want it so much. I can't bear
to find out I've not got it.

199
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,470
Give it to me, then.

200
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:53,685
Well, they are going to test you.
Oh, they are.

201
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:55,853
But, by 'eck.
It's the day after tomorrow.

202
00:13:56,896 --> 00:14:01,274
They don't give you much time. Oh, this
was posted 10 days ago. It must've got lost.

203
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,359
He'll be fine.
He knows his stuff.

204
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:07,362
Course he does. Doesn't he, Daisy?
He does, yeah.

205
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:13,575
What's this?
Alfred's got his test. At The Ritz.

206
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,702
I'm happy for you, Alfred.
Anna...

207
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:18,787
That's the gong.

208
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:26,209
I shouldn't worry, Mr Bates.
She's got ever so much on her plate.

209
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:28,336
Haven't we all?

210
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,215
Oh, bravo!
Very good!

211
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:37,259
She's right.
I couldn't have done better myself.

212
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,862
Now. Take them up
and say you cooked 'em.

213
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:42,395
I couldn't.
Well, Mr Carson can say it.

214
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,640
And what are they supposed to do?
Hang out the flags?

215
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,691
Oh, don't grudge him his success.
I don't.

216
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:50,978
I just can't see the fun
in a life chained to a stove.

217
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:53,897
Are the savouries ready to go up?

218
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,023
They certainly are.

219
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,370
I say. Well done.
We'll be sorry to lose you, Alfred.

220
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,574
But I think you'll pass your test.
Fingers crossed, My Lady.

221
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,828
When is it? The day after tomorrow.
I'm going up in the morning.

222
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:16,831
Our best wishes go with you.

223
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,916
I'm going up myself tomorrow.
Oh?

224
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:21,167
Just for the day.
To visit Michael's office.

225
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,252
I'll be back for dinner.

226
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:31,508
All alone?
I seem to be.

227
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,635
I don't know why.

228
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,720
How are you getting on with
Her Ladyship?

229
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:38,854
Pretty well... I think.

230
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,893
You've done America and
praised Lady Sybil? Have I not

231
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:47,145
You name it, I've said it.

232
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:51,440
She'll be eating out of your hand.
That's the intention.

233
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:54,359
No enemies downstairs neither.

234
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,485
That was Miss O'Brien's mistake.

235
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,654
Nobody liked her,
so nobody told her anything.

236
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:01,739
They don't like you much.
That's why you're here.

237
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:04,867
To rectify that failing on my part.

238
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:11,080
Is it true you've moved
into the house again?

239
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,418
Mrs Hughes said so. It seemed easier when I
was looking after Her Ladyship as well as you.

240
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,628
But she has her own maid now.

241
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,506
Why not go back to the cottage?

242
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:27,967
I haven't got round to it.

243
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:32,137
Anna, if you're in difficulties,
I wish you'd tell me.

244
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:37,099
I'm not, My Lady. Honestly.

245
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,647
I've come to say goodbye.
Thank you for all your help.

246
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:49,692
Just keep calm. You know enough
to do well if you keep calm.

247
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,987
Very good luck, Alfred. Is there
anything I ought to know about London?

248
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:57,031
There's quite a lot you ought to
know about London, dear.

249
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,116
And no time to tell it now
or he'll miss his train.

250
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:07,337
This afternoon,
when Her Ladyship comes down,

251
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:11,500
I don't want any backchat
- she must see everything is in order, all neat and tidy.

252
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:12,751
What's happened to your apron?

253
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,877
Why? What should -

254
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,922
Oh, my God!
What's up?

255
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:21,924
Well... I must've
caught it on a nail.

256
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,135
My other's in the wash.
And Her Ladyship's due!

257
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:30,264
Oh, don't worry. Miss Baxter'll
sort that out. Give it here. Right.

258
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:35,560
I thought you wouldn't mind if
Alfred rode in the front, My Lady.

259
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:38,777
He's catching the same train.
Of course I don't mind.

260
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:41,898
We all wish you luck, Alfred.
I'm going to need it, My Lady.

261
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,983
It's his first trip to London.
How exciting.

262
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,986
Exciting's one word for it.

263
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,790
You want to reverse the foreclosure
and take the lease,

264
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,916
but you still can't pay
all the arrears.

265
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,001
It doesn't seem
a very enticing offer.

266
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:11,003
I'll pay. And it won't take long.

267
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:14,047
Even so...

268
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:17,216
I'm a Yorkshireman, My Lord.

269
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:20,343
This is where I belong.

270
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:24,596
We've worked this land
in partnership with the Crawleys

271
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,688
for more than a century.

272
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:29,683
In partnership with the Crawleys?

273
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,021
I don't mean to be impertinent.
I do not hear it as impertinence.

274
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:39,274
We have been in partnership.

275
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:42,360
We're in partnership with
all our tenants. Or, we should be.

276
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:45,362
Then, will you let me come home?

277
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,574
I'll see what I can do.

278
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,659
Thank you, My Lord.

279
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:55,828
I'll be at the farm.

280
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,956
Mr Drewe.

281
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,169
I would prefer to report that you are
prepared to repay the arrears in full.

282
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,505
I'll lend you the difference myself.

283
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:12,465
You'd do that for me?

284
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:18,637
It won't be less than £50. I'll send
a cheque when I'm sure of the outcome.

285
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:20,972
You won't regret it.
No.

286
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,017
I don't think I will.

287
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:33,398
Do you think Alfred has a chance
with his cooking?

288
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,483
I think he's got more than a chance,

289
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,575
judging by what Mrs Patmore
has to say on the subject.

290
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,738
Because I've got an idea that might
kill two birds with one stone.

291
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:48,034
We'll be short of a footman any day
and Mr Molesley will be short of a job.

292
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:51,119
What say we deal with
the two problems together?

293
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:53,169
And solve both.
Exactly.

294
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:56,255
- But would he do it?
- Would he do it.

295
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,417
When he's been mending roads
and delivering groceries,

296
00:19:59,452 --> 00:20:01,586
and lucky to get even that?
I'll say he'll do it.

297
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:04,713
I hope you're right.
I know I am.

298
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,925
You might've talked it over with us
before you made up your mind.

299
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:13,011
But I haven't. I told him
we'd think about it. That's all.

300
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:15,096
Sounds to me as if
you've come to a decision.

301
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:18,265
If we don't respect the past,
it'll be harder to build our future.

302
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,392
Where did you read that?
I made it up.

303
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:25,437
I thought it was rather good.
It's too good.

304
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:27,688
One thing we don't want
is a poet in the family.

305
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,773
Would it be so bad?

306
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:35,820
The only poet peer
I am familiar with is Lord Byron.

307
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:38,113
And I presume you all know
how that ended.

308
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:43,638
So, you'd let Mr Drewe stay on. Since he
wants to repay the debt, I think it only fair.

309
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:48,371
Besides, he talks of the partnership between
the farmers and the family, and I like that.

310
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:51,588
Well, I think it's splendid.
Says the queen of the rebels.

311
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:56,752
Thank you. And you agree, even though
he has no right to renew the lease?

312
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:59,879
No right legally, no.
But we think he has a moral right.

313
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,215
It's a pity it should be Yew Tree. It
would've filled a hole in the land we farm.

314
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:07,135
You've managed without it till now.
You haven't said what you think.

315
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,351
Which side are you on?
The farmer's, of course.

316
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:13,473
I've not abandoned all my socialism.
Even though it feels like it sometimes.

317
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:16,617
In this one and only instance,
I am glad to hear it.

318
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,727
When will you tell him?
There's no tearing rush.

319
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,980
We've a day or two to talk it over.
And then you can tell him.

320
00:21:39,576 --> 00:21:43,620
It's strange... standing here
next to you in silence.

321
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:49,083
Because I love you.

322
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,043
I want to find out
why you don't love me any more.

323
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:55,296
You'd think we could talk about it.
But apparently not.

324
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,381
But I don't...

325
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:05,553
I'm going into Ripon this afternoon
to get some things for Lady Mary.

326
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,639
If they miss me,
I'll be back before the gong.

327
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,731
Well...

328
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,935
At least I know you'll be back
before the gong

329
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:22,233
Ooh! I can't get over
the speed of it.

330
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:24,317
I feel quite dizzy watching.

331
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,403
I don't think it'll show.

332
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:30,572
Show? It's better than it was
before I bought it.

333
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:33,783
Aw! Thanks very much.

334
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:36,827
Her Ladyship's on her way down.

335
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:44,291
Another one roped to the chariot.

336
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:49,218
I'm grateful for this job, Thomas.

337
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:52,422
And we both know why.
But what's it all about?

338
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:56,633
Well, there's going to be changes
at Downton. There's bound to be.

339
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,850
I'm sure.

340
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,887
So I want to know about
any plans upstairs.

341
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:06,224
Any detail, no matter how small.
Understand?

342
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:09,309
Did the other lady's maids
keep you informed?

343
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:14,334
Miss O'Brien, yes. But we fell out.

344
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:17,482
What about Mrs Bates?
Is she an enemy?

345
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:19,567
She knows what's going on.

346
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:22,694
No, she's not an enemy.
But she's incorruptible.

347
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,779
So we have nothing in common.

348
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:29,074
She's also silent. Shouldn't think I've
had four words out of her since I arrived.

349
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,245
Just get them all to trust you...
and tell you everything.

350
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,371
Your Ladyship. How can I help?

351
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:42,584
I've come down to persuade you. I just
don't see why it's better than an ice box.

352
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,794
Well, a refrigerator
is more efficient.

353
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:49,763
It keeps food fresh longer.

354
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,007
We won't need ice to be delivered.

355
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:56,053
But the papers will still be delivered,
and the groceries, and all sorts.

356
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,138
Or are we to stop that too?

357
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:00,223
Mrs Patmore.

358
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:04,392
Is there any aspect of the present day
that you can accept without resistance?

359
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:06,477
Well, My Lady.

360
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,729
I wouldn't mind
getting rid of my corset.

361
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:14,949
You must do everything
Maley tells you.

362
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:18,528
I will, Your Ladyship.
John is keen to learn. Aren't you?

363
00:24:18,563 --> 00:24:22,072
I am, ma'am. Because there's
always work for a good gardener.

364
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:26,409
You owe your place to Mrs Crawley. She
would not let me go until I'd promised.

365
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:28,970
She would not relax her grip.

366
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,461
You make me sound very fervent.

367
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:33,664
Wars have been waged with
less fervour.

368
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,917
Well, let's hope we win this one.
Good day, John.

369
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:44,130
Say what you like, but I know you care
about these things as much as I do.

370
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:48,175
Nobody cares about
anything as much as you do.

371
00:24:56,556 --> 00:24:58,641
This is it.

372
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:32,583
My name is Arsene Avignon.
I am the sous chef of The Ritz.

373
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:36,718
Today... you are going to make
four dishes.

374
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:40,881
Is that clear? Then, if you have
no questions, we will begin.

375
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:43,890
In 1917,
at our sister hotel in New York,

376
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:49,263
the chef, Monsieur Diat, altered a soup
made popular by Monsieur Gouffe and...

377
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,347
the great Monsieur Escoffier.

378
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:55,434
What did he do?

379
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:59,687
He served it cold.
Very good. Yes, it was eaten cold.

380
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:02,773
Previously,
the name had been a simple one.

381
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:05,858
Leek and potato soup. But...

382
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,027
what was it called now?

383
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,197
Vichyssoise.
It was Vichyssoise.

384
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,451
So... you all have
the instructions before you.

385
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:24,789
Please begin.

386
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:28,792
Mr Napier.

387
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:31,885
What?

388
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,004
Hello, Mary.

389
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:36,089
I can still call you Mary?

390
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:38,258
Of course you can. How lovely.

391
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,225
What brings you here?

392
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,596
I'm working on a government thing and
we've got some research to do in Yorkshire.

393
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:47,681
I'm on a sort of...
reconnoitring expedition.

394
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:51,809
Lucky me. I was in Thirsk, and I
suddenly thought, why not take a chance?

395
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:54,770
Well, I'm so glad you did.

396
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:56,903
Let me give you some tea.

397
00:26:56,938 --> 00:27:00,107
I'll get them to tell Mama and Papa
that you're here.

398
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:02,157
While I've got you alone...

399
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:04,319
You've been in my thoughts
a great deal...

400
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:07,279
since the whole... ghastly business.

401
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:12,533
That's nice to know. Which is why
it's lovely to see you looking so um...

402
00:27:13,743 --> 00:27:16,703
.. lovely.

403
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:20,998
Hello. Lady Mary wants tea for four.

404
00:27:25,168 --> 00:27:30,297
I'll... start again? Hello? Lady Mary
wants tea for four in the library?

405
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:33,507
It's not right, you know,
when you speak against Alfred.

406
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,551
Sorry. But imagine having
never been to London.

407
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:39,741
Dearie me.
I've not been to London.

408
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:41,854
And, for me, it just goes to show.

409
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:46,058
He may be nervous, it may be a daunting
prospect, but he's got ambition.

410
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:49,227
It drives him. And I admire that.

411
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,229
Good.

412
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:55,232
Because I've got plenty of ambition
where you're concerned.

413
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:59,527
Don't be so soft.

414
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,704
So... what is this thing
you're working on?

415
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,866
It's all to do with
the rural economy. Very hush-hush.

416
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:10,035
Well, don't tell us if it's
meant to be a secret.

417
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,120
Well, it's... not like that.

418
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:15,170
A lot of landed estates
are in difficulty.

419
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:18,333
The department wants to assess
the damage of the war years.

420
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:21,460
Are they likely to survive,
and so on. And are they?

421
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:24,504
Some of them.
It sounds rather interesting.

422
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:28,652
It is. Interesting
and incredibly depressing.

423
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:31,724
Which places are you studying
in Yorkshire?

424
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,948
That I cannot say.
It wouldn't be fair on the owners.

425
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:36,582
But we have earmarked the ones
in serious trouble.

426
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:39,146
And you'll be glad to know
Downton's not among them.

427
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:44,269
Still, we'd love your opinion on whether or not
we're doing the right things. Wouldn't we, Papa?

428
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,478
We don't want to add to his labours.

429
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:50,613
Where are you staying
while you're up here?

430
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:53,775
We haven't decided.
There's quite a good hotel in Ripon.

431
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,903
Nonsense. You must stay with us.
I couldn't possibly.

432
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,071
Why not?

433
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,991
Well, to start with, I'll have
my boss with me. Who's that?

434
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,326
Charles Blake.
Have you ever come across him?

435
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,203
I don't think so.
You must both stay here.

436
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:12,498
That way, we'll get the benefit of all your
knowledge for the price of a couple of dinners.

437
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:15,751
What could be better than that?

438
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:23,054
Well, Mr Nugent.
You've done... quite well.

439
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:26,633
I know I can do better, sir,
if you give me a chance. I know it.

440
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:30,178
You haven't chosen to make your
living in the kitchen before now.

441
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:32,263
No. You see, my mother was keen -

442
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:36,474
You have worked instead as a footman
for the Earl of Grantham.

443
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:40,769
I have, yes.
And this has made you... unhappy?

444
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:42,854
I'll not say that.

445
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,939
But I want to do more with my life.

446
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:48,942
I see. Well,
we have difficult decisions ahead.

447
00:29:48,984 --> 00:29:51,152
But don't worry.
We won't keep you waiting.

448
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:00,576
It's good of you... to let me
disturb your afternoon.

449
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,790
You see...

450
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,086
I have to get to the bottom
of what's troubling me.

451
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:17,011
And I believe you can help.

452
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:21,216
I doubt that.
The thing is... I know you can.

453
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,511
I heard you questioning Anna about
why she was being so hard on me.

454
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:28,680
But that doesn't mean -
Yes. It does.

455
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:32,648
You know what this is about.

456
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:34,810
And you believe...
she should have told me.

457
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:36,895
Well, I admit...

458
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,063
I think she should have.

459
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,155
But it is not for me to.

460
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,276
Then I can't stay here.
What?

461
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:47,444
I have been happy in this house.

462
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:50,446
Happier than I had any right to be.

463
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:53,741
But that only makes my present
situation all the harder to bear.

464
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,784
I can imagine.
Can you?

465
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:59,870
Can you, Mrs Hughes?
Because if you can...

466
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:03,081
.. you will know why
I have to leave here.

467
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:07,251
My wife no longer loves me.

468
00:31:08,377 --> 00:31:11,462
The sight of me is torture for her,
which is torture for me.

469
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,724
If you will not let me
hear the truth...

470
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,720
I will hand in my resignation now
and be gone before she gets back.

471
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,144
So be it.

472
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:37,447
Wait!

473
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:41,610
Where is Anna?
She... had an errand in Ripon.

474
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,830
It's not true.
Anna loves you very, very much.

475
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,952
And I think the pain of coming home
to find you gone would finish her.

476
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,247
So I will tell you what happened...
to make you stay.

477
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:03,585
And if I'm doing the wrong thing,
then I ask for the mercy of God.

478
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:16,970
I'm sorry, My Lady. They said you
wouldn't be in here before seven.

479
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,054
No. Nor would I be.

480
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:21,264
But I left a... letter on my desk.

481
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,859
Has anybody else -
Oh.

482
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,986
Has anybody else been in here?

483
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:41,071
I don't know, Your Ladyship.

484
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:43,198
No.

485
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,324
No, why would you?

486
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:53,504
That's all of it.

487
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,708
You haven't said when... it happened.

488
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,758
Haven't I?

489
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:02,837
Was it the last night
of the houseparty?

490
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:08,015
When she told me...

491
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,260
she fainted... and hit her head.

492
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:16,472
Is that when it happened?

493
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:20,559
Yes.
Then I know who it really was.

494
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:22,727
I've told you who it was.

495
00:33:22,762 --> 00:33:24,819
But I don't believe you!

496
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:28,064
I think it was Lord Gillingham's
valet, who teased her

497
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,983
and flirted with her
from the moment he arrived.

498
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,193
It was not Lord Gillingham's valet.

499
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:38,322
I don't believe he ever
left the concert. It was not him.

500
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:41,415
Do you swear that?
Why should I swear?

501
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,577
You must swear it -
on everything you hold dear!

502
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,710
Will you?
I've said...

503
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:50,832
It was an outsider. It was no-one
who was staying in the house.

504
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:55,043
A man broke in and waited down here.
How many times must I repeat it?

505
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:57,128
Do you swear?

506
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,714
Very well. If it makes you
feel better, I swear.

507
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:03,258
On your mother's life?
She is dead. On her grave.

508
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,301
I've said I swear!

509
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,469
Because I will find out who he is.

510
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:10,596
You're welcome to try.

511
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:12,890
But I don't know
what you've got to go on.

512
00:34:54,337 --> 00:34:56,464
Ah, there you are.
How did you get on?

513
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:58,597
Oh, fine.

514
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:01,843
I hear Evelyn Napier was here
earlier. I'm sorry to have missed him.

515
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:05,888
Yes, he just dropped in.
It was a spur of the moment thing.

516
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:07,973
Is he still in pursuit of Mary?

517
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:11,232
I didn't ask him.

518
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:15,311
So, will you be giving
a birthday party? For Robert?

519
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,355
Why? Do you really want me to?

520
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:19,565
I'd had rather a good idea for it.
That's all.

521
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:23,609
If I did, would you give me a hand?
Absolutely. Shh!

522
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:28,780
So. Have we come to
a final decision about Drewe?

523
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,997
I suppose so.
If it means that much to you.

524
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:35,118
And Tom's socialism will ensure
his approval of the plan.

525
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,413
You laugh. But, as a matter of fact, I've
been thinking about it quite a lot lately.

526
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:44,333
About what? My beliefs, I suppose. I'm
not too sure what they are any more.

527
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,676
Since the houseparty - I won't hear
another word about the houseparty.

528
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:52,840
Somebody said something to upset you. That's
all it is. What was this? Who was rude?

529
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,442
No-one. He's got that wrong.

530
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:57,975
I just... felt like an intruder.

531
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,200
It made me face the fact that I'm living
where I don't belong. Welcome to the club.

532
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:06,391
Oh, stop moaning. But, if you went back
to Ireland, Tom, would you belong there?

533
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:10,519
No. I don't think I would.
You've changed me too much.

534
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:13,563
I'm a man without a home.
I am stateless.

535
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,690
Well, then...
There is America.

536
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:17,865
I have family there
and they're doing quite well.

537
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,903
It would be a new start.
But you've made a new start here.

538
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,238
But I'm talking about
the world Sybbie will grow up in.

539
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,158
Wouldn't it be easier for her
to begin with a clean slate,

540
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,451
rather than being the daughter of
an uppity chauffeur?

541
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:32,578
Well, don't do anything in a hurry.

542
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:34,663
We don't want to lose you, Tom.

543
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:39,708
What do you mean,
you'll have to think about it?

544
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,440
What I say. I didn't mind helping
you out when you were short-staffed.

545
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:47,130
How good of you. But to accept a
permanent position as a footman...

546
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,259
I'm a trained valet, Mr Car-
I'm a trained butler!

547
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:59,515
To accept... my fall by taking
a permanent, inferior place...

548
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:01,689
You keep telling me it's permanent.

549
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:05,936
But from where I'm sitting, it's
looking less permanent by the minute!

550
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:10,898
I shall give it every consideration.

551
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,025
Very generous, I must say.

552
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,153
I'll let you know my answer
when I have one.

553
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:19,238
I shall wait with bated breath.

554
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,340
Aren't you ever
going to finish that?

555
00:37:45,382 --> 00:37:47,432
It's nearly midnight.

556
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:50,553
Someone has to do it. But it
doesn't always have to be you.

557
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,231
I know.

558
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,653
I know what happened.

559
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:17,788
Mrs Hughes told me. I forced her to.

560
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:20,867
Then, she was very wrong.
It wasn't her secret to tell.

561
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:22,994
I gave her no choice, Anna.

562
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,123
What did she say?

563
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,459
How...

564
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:36,545
How it happened.

565
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,715
When it happened.

566
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,926
I asked if it was Green.

567
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,053
Who?
Mr Green.

568
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:51,140
Lord Gillingham's valet.
She swore it wasn't.

569
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:54,184
No, it wasn't him.
She said a man...

570
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:58,312
.. broke in and was waiting
down here for you, a stranger.

571
00:38:58,353 --> 00:38:59,521
That's right.

572
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:01,648
Because, if it was the valet...

573
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:05,776
.. he is a dead man.

574
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:08,861
It wasn't him! You only say that
because you didn't like him.

575
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:10,905
No, I did not.

576
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:14,039
There's no excuse to accuse him
when he did nothing.

577
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:17,284
Would I have sat at breakfast with
him next morning if it'd been him?

578
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:20,870
We can't know who the man was.

579
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:23,414
We have no way of tracing him.

580
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,667
Why wouldn't you tell me?

581
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:32,796
Because I knew the suffering
it would bring you.

582
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,091
Well, it's in the open.

583
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:41,184
No more secrets.

584
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:43,346
I'm glad of that, at least.

585
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:47,474
No more fear of being found out.
Because I am found out.

586
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,601
My shame has nowhere to hide.

587
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:53,687
Why do you talk of shame?

588
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:56,814
I don't accept that
there is any shame in this.

589
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,984
But I am spoiled for you.

590
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,071
And I can never be unspoiled.

591
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:08,281
You are not spoiled.

592
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,452
You are made...

593
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:16,544
higher to me...

594
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:19,706
and holier because of the suffering
you have been put through.

595
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:24,967
You are my wife.

596
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:27,087
And I have never been prouder...

597
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:31,340
.. nor loved you more
than I love you now at this moment.

598
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:36,885
Truly?

599
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,429
Truly.

600
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,615
Morning.

601
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:14,962
Alfred.

602
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:17,124
Is that the result?

603
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:22,253
I think so, yes.
Do you want me to open it?

604
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:25,464
No, I'll do it myself.
Good luck.

605
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:34,721
Well?

606
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:36,896
I've not got it.
What?

607
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:41,184
Oh, I am sorry. It says I did well and I
was nearly in the top four, but not quite.

608
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:44,234
I expect they say that to everyone.
That's enough, James.

609
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:49,482
And Alfred
- to fail at the first attempt does not mean that you won't succeed later.

610
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:53,568
Quite right.
Might I have a word, Mr Carson?

611
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,695
Certainly.

612
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:06,036
I've given it a lot of thought.

613
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:08,329
Have you, indeed.
First,

614
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,248
I needed to deal with
my father's disappointment,

615
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:13,333
when he learned of my downward path.

616
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:17,586
But I weighed it against the power
to do good that all employment brings.

617
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:21,554
Did you, now?
And you thought all that.

618
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:24,848
I feel I could contain my skills
and guide them

619
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:29,929
into a... more modest channel
without loss of dignity.

620
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,187
Just fancy.
So, all in all...

621
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:37,267
and after mature deliberation, you'll be
pleased to hear that I can accept your offer.

622
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:40,478
What offer?
To replace Alfred as footman.

623
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,690
Oh, dear, Mr Molesley. I'm afraid
that Alfred's not leaving now.

624
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:48,734
It's a pity you didn't
accept the job when we last talked.

625
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,861
And then I'd have been
stuck with you.

626
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:53,905
As it is, you've missed your chance.

627
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,199
As I generally do.

628
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,411
Mature deliberation.

629
00:43:03,495 --> 00:43:06,456
Cheer up, lad.

630
00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:08,506
You read the letter.

631
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,751
You were a very near miss. So,
next time, you'll hit the target.

632
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:14,962
I reckon Jimmy's right.
They say that to everyone who fails.

633
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:20,008
Well, I reckon you work hard
and you deserve to succeed.

634
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:23,093
You just have to stick at it...
and you will.

635
00:43:25,387 --> 00:43:27,472
I'm not saying he took it.

636
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:31,433
But I don't see
who else could've done.

637
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,560
In other words,
you're saying he took it.

638
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:35,853
I know he was in this room.

639
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:40,857
Legitimately. Really, Dr Clarkson.
I'm not a witness for the prosecution.

640
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,193
Aren't you? Well, let us review the
facts. I have lost a valuable paper knife.

641
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:50,239
Given to the late Lord Grantham
by the King of Sweden.

642
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:51,490
Which makes all the difference.

643
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:55,493
It makes the loss greater, yes.

644
00:43:55,528 --> 00:43:57,619
I quite agree.

645
00:43:57,661 --> 00:44:01,706
But I can't accept there's any
real proof against erm... young Pegg.

646
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:03,957
Well, if you insist,
I won't sack him. Yet.

647
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:07,925
But I will not allow him
back in the house.

648
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,170
And I will have to speak
to my head gardener about it.

649
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:13,256
That will do him a lot of harm.
Well, what would you prefer?

650
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:18,385
That I invite the local criminals
to drop in and strip the house bare?

651
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,512
Why not ask to be told
when a gardener is coming inside?

652
00:44:21,554 --> 00:44:24,598
So that you or a servant
can keep watch.

653
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,899
Then we'll have time to investigate
the loss of the knife.

654
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:32,145
Or have you already scented blood? As
a matter of interest, do you ever doubt?

655
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:35,189
I don't doubt the honesty
of young Pegg.

656
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,234
That is not at all what I asked.

657
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:45,579
I'm very grateful, My Lady.

658
00:44:45,614 --> 00:44:49,867
You didn't have to do this, but it determines
me to prove I'm worthy of your faith.

659
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:52,876
I can't pretend to take the credit,
Mr Drewe.

660
00:44:52,911 --> 00:44:55,955
It was His Lordship
who was determined you should stay.

661
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,040
You owe your thanks to him.

662
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:00,124
He'll have my thanks, My Lady.

663
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:03,210
And he'll have the rest of
the payment before he's missed it.

664
00:45:03,252 --> 00:45:05,378
What payment?
Remainder of the debt.

665
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:11,681
I thought you'd know about it.
And so we do.

666
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:15,719
Of course we do. I'm sorry.
I was being absent-minded.

667
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,804
How much is it? I've forgotten.

668
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,854
It's only the last £50.

669
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:23,142
He sent a cheque so I can pay off the
full amount and wipe the slate clean.

670
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:29,313
Well, thank you, Mr Drewe. I'm sure we
have many fruitful years ahead of us.

671
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:37,743
Are you going to challenge him?

672
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:41,822
No. If Papa believes enough in Drewe
to lend him the money,

673
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:44,116
and to hide it from us,
then that tells me something.

674
00:45:46,117 --> 00:45:50,329
What, exactly? That you and I are in
partnership with a very decent man.

675
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,501
Mrs Hughes, can I have a word?

676
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,966
I know you told Mr Bates about me
while I was out yesterday.

677
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,927
He put me in a very... difficult...

678
00:46:12,053 --> 00:46:14,180
I'm afraid he guessed who it was.

679
00:46:14,222 --> 00:46:17,231
But you denied it.
Denied it?

680
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:20,518
I swore on my mother's grave
it wasn't him... God help me.

681
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,520
He seems to have accepted your word.

682
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:28,691
In fact...
I'm moving back into the cottage.

683
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:31,901
Oh! Oh, I'm... I'm so pleased.

684
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:37,114
At least if I'm damned for all
eternity, it was to some purpose.

685
00:46:37,155 --> 00:46:39,199
You won't be damned.

686
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,284
Mr Bates has shown
great generosity of spirit.

687
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,537
As I knew he would. Eventually.

688
00:46:47,496 --> 00:46:50,666
So... we're going to try and put
the whole thing behind us.

689
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,794
I hate to think of that evil man
getting away scot free.

690
00:46:55,836 --> 00:46:58,088
But maybe it's for the best.

691
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:02,174
I thought you'd like to know.

692
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:11,473
What are you grinning about?
What do you think? He's not going.

693
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:21,939
Mr Bates. I'm so glad to see you.

694
00:47:23,982 --> 00:47:26,108
Anna's told me
what's gone on between you.

695
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,235
And it's made me
happier than I can say.

696
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:31,363
To think it's all
over and done with.

697
00:47:31,404 --> 00:47:34,448
Nothing's over and done with,
Mrs Hughes.

698
00:47:35,658 --> 00:47:39,786
But Anna said
- Do you think I would add to her burden, after all she's been through?

699
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:44,831
I don't know his name,
so I can't tell it to you.

700
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:48,959
Not if you were to threaten me
with a knife, Mr Bates.

701
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:51,044
I understand. And I won't press you.

702
00:47:51,086 --> 00:47:53,129
But be aware.

703
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,256
Nothing is over.

704
00:47:56,298 --> 00:47:58,383
And nothing is done with.
