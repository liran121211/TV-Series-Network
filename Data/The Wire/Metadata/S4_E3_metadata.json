At Bodie's corner, Michael proves adept as a runner, with Bodie and Marlo taking notice. A re-up bodega is put under surveillance by Omar and Greggs.", "Omar begins to realise he may have become a victim to his own reputation and decides he needs to re-assert his dominance on the street. Marlo visits Bodie's corner, giving him the option to either leave, or sell the Stanfield package, and becomes increasingly interested in Michael when he sees him working for Bodie. Still smarting over the debate with Carcetti, Royce employs petty tactics, but angers Watkins over his refusal to fund witness protection until after the election. When Bunk visits McNulty and Beadie for dinner, he is shocked to find McNulty sober, faithful and enjoying domestic life. Meanwhile, the New Day face the problem of New York dealers muscling in on the Eastside, and in an effort to show a united Baltimore front, Prop Joe asks Marlo to stand with them. Following up on their promise to Royce to put a stop to the MCU's political investigation, Burrell and Rawls send the ruthless Lt. Charles Marimow (Boris McGiver) in to replace Asher and prevent the unit from pursuing any more wire investigations. Elsewhere, Colvin is far from happy in his new job as head of security at a hotel, whilst Prez is disturbed by his experiences during his first few days in the classroom.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0763096", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 4523, "number_of_episodes": 60}
