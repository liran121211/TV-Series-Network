Avon Barksdale puts a contract out on Omar and others who robbed him. He wants to make sure everyone on the street knows he's not to be messed with. Judge Phelan keeps the pressure on and Daniels recommends to the Deputy that they need a wire. McNulty suggests they get a warrant to clone the pagers the drug runners use. Det. Fremon is one step ahead of everyone having already found D'Angelo Barksdale's pager number.\u2014garykmcd", "McNulty and Greggs try to get some of the hoppers arrested during the pit raid to flip on their superiors. After punching Det. Patrick Mahone (Tom Quinn), Bodie receives a stern beating from the police. Waking up in a Washington, D.C. juvenile detention facility, he manages to escape just as Herc and Carver arrive to interrogate him. Back in Baltimore, Avon discusses the loss of the pit's re-up stash, and marks Omar and his crew for death, doubling the bounty when he learns Omar is homosexual, and fellow stick-up man Brandon Wright (Michael Kevin Darnall) is his lover. As Stringer becomes concerned there may be a snitch in the pit, Burrell tries to appease Phelan, but the judge is unimpressed with the progress made thus far. Meanwhile, Freamon has a break-through regarding the crew's use of pagers, and, acting on a tip from Sgt. Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams), McNulty and Bunk investigate an old murder in which D'Angelo may have been involved.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749437", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 6555, "number_of_episodes": 60}
