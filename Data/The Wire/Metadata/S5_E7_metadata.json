Bunk bucks at Landsman when ordered to help with the force's most recent red ball.", "McNulty abducts and photographs a homeless man, then fakes a call from the serial killer to Templeton, forwarding him the pictures in order to acquire PC for picture intercepts, and sending both the entire police department and The Sun into meltdown. As a result, Carcetti authorises more resources for the investigation, with McNulty finally getting the funds he had initially hoped for. However, with the city in uproar, the situation soon sprawls far beyond anything he envisioned, as everyone in the homicide unit begins to turn to him for help in their own cases. Matters are made even worse when Freamon proves unable to crack the code Marlo is using in his picture messages. When reporter Mike Fletcher (Brandon Young) visits a soup kitchen to interview the homeless about the serial killer, he makes a connection with Bubbles, who is serving food. Meanwhile, Carcetti begins to gear up for his gubernatorial run, Bunk continues to do leg work on the vacant murders, and Omar begins to strike out at Marlo's people and reputation. In court, Bond tries the Davis case himself, and at The Sun, Haynes finally acts on his suspicions about Templeton's integrity.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0977184", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 4206, "number_of_episodes": 60}
