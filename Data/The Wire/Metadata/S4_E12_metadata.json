Carcetti finds his promises of prosperity undermined by the school debt, forcing him to contemplate groveling before the Governor in Annapolis.\u2014Anonymous", "Carcetti faces a crippling budgetary problem when he learns there is a $54m education debt. His new chief of staff, Michael Steintorf, recommends a reduction in spending, including the proposed increase in police pay, but Campbell suggests he instead ask the governor of Maryland for assistance. The governor, however, presents him with a difficult choice. Prez and Dukie are both disappointed by Dukie's social promotion to high school, having become close in class. As the pilot program is threatened with closure, Deacon recommends Colvin take the issue to Watkins. Freamon's discovery of Chris and Snoop's dumping ground for bodies damages the homicide unit's annual clearance rate, and Landsman orders him not to search any more vacants. Meanwhile, Namond is ripped off by one of his own hoppers, but his reluctance to act leads to him seeing both his mother and Michael in a new light, and instead he turns to Carver and Cutty for help. Omar calls in the help of an old friend for his plan to steal the New Day's drug shipment from the Greeks. Dukie's family abandons him, and he moves in with Michael, who has begun training as an enforcer for Marlo. Randy is kept home from school for his own protection. Learning of Freamon's discovery, Daniels points out the stats can be blamed on Royce if the bodies are all found before the end of the month. Meanwhile, Bubbles prepares a tainted vial of drugs for his attacker, with unforeseen consequences.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0796551", "rating": 9.3, "votes": 5520, "number_of_episodes": 60}
