McNulty's case gets increased attention from the newspaper, in large part thanks to the addition of Templeton to the reporting team.", "McNulty's life with Beadie begins to fall apart. Having killed Joe with Cheese's help, Marlo takes over as the Greeks' Baltimore distributor. When they give him a mobile phone with which to contact them, he gives the number to Levy, but Herc steals it and passes it on to Carver. McNulty leaks details of the serial killer to the press as the story begins to gain traction, prompting Daniels to meet with Carcetti about the case. With money still an issue, however, Carcetti authorises Daniels to assign two detectives only, much to McNulty's chagrin. As such, he and Freamon come up with a scheme to try to get a wire approved. Elsewhere, Dukie struggles with bullying, turning to an old friend for help, Bubbles gets some important news, and Bond holds a press conference regarding the Davis corruption case. When Davis tells Campbell that if he goes down, he is bringing others with him, she is able to persuade him to play things a different way.
