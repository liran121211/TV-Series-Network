Cutty seeks out the Barksdale gang after he loses his taste for the straight life. Bunk feels the pressure to find Dozerman's gun. Daniels worries that Avon Barksdale, having cut a prison deal, will be paroled. Stringer Bell tries to make amends with Donette.\u2014Anonymous", "Despite being urged to fire Burrell by State Delegate Odell Watkins (Frederick Strother), Royce refuses, pointing out Burrell's loyalty in taking the hit from the press regarding the cadet funding. Burrell, however, is furious with Carcetti for placing him in that position in the first place. An unapologetic Carcetti points out that not only does Royce now owe Burrell a favour, but Burrell got the cadets he needed. Despite being lectured by Freamon, McNulty and Greggs continue to ignore the MCU's new target and pursue Stringer. After Bubbles alerts them to the presence of Marlo, they mistakenly assume Marlo is working for Avon. Meanwhile, Bodie is confused when Stringer orders no retaliation against Marlo's dealer Fruit (Brandon Fobbs), who led an attack on Bodie's crew. As Bunk continues to try to find the department's missing gun, Colvin unveils a radical new strategy - three abandoned areas in the Western District have been designated \"drug tolerant zones.\" However, he has little success convincing the hoppers to relocate. Elsewhere, Cutty begins to question his decision to go straight, Pearlman attempts to prevent Avon's parole, and Stringer's investments in property intensify.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749420", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 4687, "number_of_episodes": 60}
