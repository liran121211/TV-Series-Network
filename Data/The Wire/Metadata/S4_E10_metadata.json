The mandate does not sit well with McNulty, who sets his sights instead on cracking a string of church robberies.\u2014Anonymous", "Not trusting anyone in the system, Michael takes his problem with Devar to Marlo. Carcetti's restructuring of the police hierarchy does not meet with universal approval. Burrell takes advice from Davis, who then goes behind Burrell's back and promises to help Carcetti get rid of him. Meanwhile, Burrell is ordered to run everything through Rawls, but ignores the order and demands quality-of-life arrests to double in the next month, leading to civil unrest, and dissent amongst the uniforms. Daniels uses the situation to test Carcetti's sincerity about fixing the department. Despite his recent success in class with his own curriculum, Prez is pressured to teach test material, as are Colvin and Peranti, who are summoned to speak with area superintendent Sheperdson (Sheila Cutchlow) about the pilot program. When she sits in on a class, she's unimpressed with what she sees. After failing to protect Bubbles, Herc tries to make amends, but angers Bubbles by asking him for another favour. Marlo has a member of Bodie's crew killed for speaking to the police, and puts the word out that Randy has been doing the same. Carver arrests Namond, who reaches out to Colvin for help.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0763094", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 4603, "number_of_episodes": 60}
