After a sparsely attended waterfront ceremony, Carcetti fires away at a larger press event--and recasts himself as a champion for the homeless.\u2014Anonymous", "When Templeton fakes a phone call from the serial killer, McNulty uses it as PC for a wire. Having failed to convince Daniels to reopen the MCU to work the Marlo case, Freamon illegally sets the wire up on Marlo's phone, with the intention of attributing any information they get from it to a CI. As Chris continues to hunt for Omar, Bunk decides to resort to old-fashioned police work to try to make some headway on the still open vacant murders investigation. However, he discovers an error has been made with the lab work, making the case virtually unsolvable. When Carcetti delivers a well-received press conference about the serial killer, he decides to spin homelessness into a core campaign issue when he runs for governor. A search of Prop Joe's house turns up sealed court documents, leading Daniels and Pearlman to conclude there is a leak in the city court. Meanwhile, Marlo takes control of the New Day, promoting Cheese, raising the price of narcotics, doubling the bounty on Omar, and suspending all further meetings. Elsewhere, Templeton's star continues to rise at The Sun, with Whiting placing him front and center in their coverage of the murders, and when Freamon figures out Marlo is communicating by sending multimedia messages, it forces him and McNulty to go to extremes even they never dreamt of.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0977183", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 4112, "number_of_episodes": 60}
