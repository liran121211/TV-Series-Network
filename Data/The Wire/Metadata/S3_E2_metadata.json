McNulty launches his own investigation into last year's prison suicide of D'Angelo Barksdale. On the streets the bloodbath continues, prompting Burrell and Rawls to jack up the heat on their district commanders. The street violence also presents Daniels with a tough decision. A beleaguered Cutty tries to get his life back on track.\u2014Anonymous", "Omar and his crew resume their raids on the Barksdale supply, much to Stringer's chagrin. McNulty is shocked to learn of D'Angelo's death in prison and is immediately suspicious of the suicide report. As Avon's parole hearing approaches, he and Stringer discuss how best to conduct business now the towers are gone, deciding that rather than starting a war, they will send people to negotiate sharing corners owned by other crews, in return for a cut from the profits from Prop Joe's product. However, when Bodie attempts to take a Westside corner owned by ambitious independent dealer Marlo 'Black' Stanfield (Jamie Hector), things don't go to plan. Meanwhile, Cheese participates in an underground dogfight, leading to the MCU making a catastrophic error, and in front of the media, Carcetti pressures Burrell over the high homicide rates in the city. Elsewhere, having realised how out of touch he is with things, Cutty finds legitimate work with a landscaping crew, and Greggs finds herself increasingly alienated from her girlfriend Cheryl (Melanie Nicholls-King) and their baby.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749418", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 4741, "number_of_episodes": 60}
