Colvin sees the benefits of his plan working. Carcetti confronts a hurdle he must clear if he wants to run for higher office, while Marlo appears to take the bait set by the Barksdale crew.\u2014Anonymous", "The MCU are stunned to learn Avon is free. Freamon and Prez get working on hacking Bodie's burner, and discover a traceable network. However, they are unsure how to get a wire onto it, as the phones are only used for two weeks before being discarded. As such, they attempt to track who has been buying the burners. Carver approaches Colvin with some concerns about the problems of Hamsterdam, including the ease with which stick-up crews are ripping off dealers, and the ex-hoppers who are no longer needed, but who are hanging around anyway, and Colvin suggests they use the hoppers as a de facto police force. Later, he shows his mentor Deacon (Melvin Williams) around, but is surprised by his reaction. Carcetti continues to press for witness protection money, before getting an education in how to be a likeable politician. As Cutty turns to Deacon for advice about his future, Brianna and McNulty have an emotional discussion about D'Angelo. Meanwhile, Stringer continues to make in-roads in legitimate circles, whilst Avon hatches a plan to snare Omar, and vows revenge against Marlo for the drive-by at Poot's corner.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749436", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 5128, "number_of_episodes": 60}
