Daniels reassigns his detail after the wire on Stringer Bell goes dead.\u2014Anonymous", "Burrell and Deputy Ops. Rawls demonstrate how serious they are about their new directives to reduce crime by making an example of the Eastern District commander. Colvin pioneers an unorthodox solution to the Western District's escalating culture of drugs, and then proceeds to ruffle Rawls and Burrell's feathers at the weekly ComStat by refusing to manipulate his district's crime stats. Carcetti leaks information to the press about Royce holding back money to train new police cadets, and Burrell is placed in an awkward position when Royce proves determined to spin the situation to his own advantage. Omar and his crew decide to attack a Barksdale stash house, but get more than they bargained for. With the wires dead, the MCU is instructed to pursue a new target, much to McNulty and Greggs' chagrin. Meanwhile, as the Homicide Unit bid farewell to one of their own, Bodie's crew clash with Marlo's, and Bunk is given a seemingly impossible task.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749426", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 4729, "number_of_episodes": 60}
