Having been turned down by the FBI, Freamon reveals to Davis the evidence he is sitting on, and bluffs that he is prepared to take the case federal, leading to Davis offering him some advice on where to follow the money. With Omar dead, Marlo breathes a sigh of relief. However, with the extra manpower from Carver's people on the case, Sydnor is able to break Marlo's code, and the police intercept a major re-supply. As Marlo, Chris and Cheese discuss who could have informed on them, suspicions fall on Michael. When Marlo learns Chris kept it from him that Omar was belittling his reputation and calling for a street confrontation, he is livid. Despite his ruse getting him exactly what he wanted, McNulty is far from happy. Meanwhile, Haynes launches a more thorough investigation into Templeton's fabrications, Whiting and Klebanow consider the paper's coverage of the serial killer story as a possible submission for a Pulitzer Prize, Fletcher begins to interview Bubbles, and when Carcetti attends a school debate, he encounters a former friend.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0977186", "rating": 9.3, "votes": 5366, "number_of_episodes": 60}
