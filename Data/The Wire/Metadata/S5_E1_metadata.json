Having turned down the offer of money from the Governor of Maryland, worried about the ramifications for his own gubernatorial run, Carcetti must try to make up the $54m education deficit via cutbacks. This leads him to delay the promised increase in police pay, with newly promoted SIC Carver trying to placate the Western District troops as they reach breaking point. Meanwhile, Burrell and Rawls explain to Carcetti that without budgetary assistance from City Hall, they cannot deliver the reductions in crime on which he campaigned. The FBI offer to help work the vacant murders investigation, but on the condition that Bond take the Davis corruption case federal. When he and Carcetti refuse, the FBI withdraw their proffered support. As such, the MCU is shut down. Similar cutbacks at The Baltimore Sun make it increasingly difficult for city desk editor Gus Haynes (Clark Johnson) to maintain the paper, finding staff cutbacks have made efficient reporting virtually impossible. Elsewhere, Bubbles moves into his sister Rae's (Eisa Davis) basement in a concerted effort to get clean, and at a meeting of the New Day, Marlo's behaviour gives Slim Charles cause for concern.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0977178", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 4351, "number_of_episodes": 60}
