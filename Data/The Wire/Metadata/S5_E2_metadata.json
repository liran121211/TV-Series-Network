With the closure of the MCU, McNulty and Greggs return to homicide, Sydnor and Freamon are transferred to the impending grand jury investigation of Davis, and Dozerman is moved to tactical. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the police, Herc has taken a job as a private investigator for Levy, and is using his contacts inside the department to feed Levy information. The closure of the MCU emboldens Marlo, who orders several murders and attempts to subvert Prop Joe and contact Vondas directly. However, in doing so, he runs into an unexpected face from the past. At The Sun, when Haynes pitches a series of articles examining the social ills of the poor in Baltimore, he is overruled by executive editor James Whiting, III (Sam Freed), who wants to focus the series on the schooling system instead, placing ambitious reporter Scott Templeton (Tom McCarthy) in charge. However, Haynes soon becomes suspicious of Templeton's integrity when details of a story he turns in don't ring true. Elsewhere, Walon tries to convince Bubbles he must deal with his feelings of guilt about Sherrod, Chris continues to mentor Michael, and as McNulty becomes increasingly frustrated with the underfunded homicide unit, he makes a seemingly insane decision\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0985516", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4180, "number_of_episodes": 60}
