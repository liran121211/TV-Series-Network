Nick's deceit is in the open, as Sobotka is overwhelmed by bad news. The Greeks confidently ease out of a brief encounter with the detail and Omar's suspicions are validated. The detail hopes to find Vonda's boss. Nick hopes to repair relations with the Greeks and Sobotka is forced to make a difficult choice.\u2014Anonymous", "The detail and the FBI carry out a series of raids, finding the Greeks' properties abandoned, but turning up cash and heroin in Nick's. They leave Vondas on the street, hoping he will lead them to the head-man. Sobotka is later arrested when the FBI storm the union offices, with Valchek ensuring the press is there to capture it all. The detail tries to get Malatov and the rest of the Greek crew to flip, but have little success, with Sobotka more interested in getting to see Ziggy, in jail for murdering Double G, than in talking with either the police or his own lawyers. With the union compromised, the FBI has fulfilled its part of the deal with Valchek and is uninterested in pursuing any of the Greeks, as they have no known connections with terrorism. Out on bail, Sobotka is stunned to learn Nick has been selling heroin. Meanwhile, Vondas hatches a plan to help Ziggy, so as to ensure Sobotka doesn't cut a deal with the police, and Stringer manipulates Omar into going after Mouzone.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749423", "rating": 9.2, "votes": 6193, "number_of_episodes": 60}
