Facing a new political challenge, Carcetti is forced to make dangerous political deals.", "After a grandstanding court performance, Clay Davis is sensationally acquitted of all corruption charges, destroying Bond's chances at becoming mayor. When Carcetti gives the police carte blanche in the serial killer investigation, McNulty asks Carver to provide a surveillance team for Freamon. Unable to stand by and allow Greggs to waste her time working a fake case at the expense of her real ones, McNulty tells her of his and Freamon's ruse. Much to Michael's surprise, Chris and Snoop decide not to tell Marlo that Omar is damaging his reputation and word is spreading that Marlo is ducking a confrontation. At The Sun, when the Iraq veteran whom Templeton wrote a seemingly solid story about comes forward to complain that certain details are inaccurate, Haynes' suspicions regarding Templeton intensify. When the DNA from the murder of Michael's stepfather comes back from the lab, Bunk is finally able to get a murder warrant for Chris, but McNulty persuades him to sit on it for a few days until Freamon can acquire more evidence against Marlo. Meanwhile, Freamon tries to entice the FBI to go after Davis, Dukie attempts to find honest work, Carcetti faces a challenge for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination from Prince George's County, and Omar has an unexpected encounter with the most unlikely of adversaries.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0977185", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 4824, "number_of_episodes": 60}
