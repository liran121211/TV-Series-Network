Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell discover that real estate development has its own pitfalls. McNulty and Greggs ask Daniels to let them renew the Bell and Barksdale investigation. On Barksdale's orders, Cutty plans to take back corners from Marlo's crew.\u2014Anonymous", "Marlo rejects Stringer's offer to join the New Day, instead making plans to go to war. Believing that Marlo is the new Barksdale enforcer, McNulty and Greggs try to pressure Daniels into switching the MCU target back to Stringer. McNulty's attempts to open an official investigation into D'Angelo's death hit a brick wall. As the drug- tolerant zones begin to take off, Colvin unleashes his troops on the dealers still occupying corners, giving his men free rein to use whatever force is necessary to get them to relocate. Bunk decides he's no longer wasting time looking for the missing gun, and switches his attention to a shooting involving Omar's crew. Avon is uninterested in Stringer's movement into real estate and is far more concerned with what's happening on the street. When he learns Marlo's crew ran Bodie's off a corner, he's furious that Stringer didn't retaliate, and orders Slim Charles and Cutty to hit back at Marlo. As Stringer is forced to pay more money to Davis to speed up the necessary permits for his condos, Carcetti manipulates Gray into thinking about entering the next mayoral race, so as to divide the city's black vote.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749431", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 4705, "number_of_episodes": 60}
