With two sets of evidence, the detail goes to Pearlman who tells them neither crime merits a wiretap, but a drug connection could give the case legs.

Though discord grows in Barksdale's empire, Bell tries to hold it together.\u2014Anonymous", "Nick crosses the line into drug dealing, with the Greeks paying him in heroin for his smuggling operation. As Prez and Greggs continue to look into the human trafficking angle, and Herc and Carver remain on the street, Freamon and Russell begin to study the docks' live traffic using a cloned computer, soon finding a pattern of missing containers handled by Thomas 'Horseface' Pakusa (Charley Scalies). By now, the detail knows they are into something much bigger than they originally believed, and have set up Dialled Number Recallers (DNRs) on Sobotka and Horseface's phones, but without hard evidence of drug dealing, they can't get a wire approved. Sobotka muses on staying on for another year as union secretary, despite having already agreed to step down at the end of his term in favor of Ott (Bus Howard). Meanwhile, Prop Joe makes an offer to Stringer, who forwards it to Avon, but he is unwilling to discuss it, too distracted by D'Angelo's apparent suicide to think about business.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749422", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 4919, "number_of_episodes": 60}
