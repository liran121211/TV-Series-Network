Marlo turns to Proposition Joe to help with an enviable problem. Whiting and Klebanow drop a bombshell on the newspaper staff.", "As Michael questions Chris and Snoop's morals, Pearlman and Sydnor begin to move in on Davis, who is furious with Burrell for not protecting him. McNulty starts to put the pieces together for his fake serial killer plan. Marlo continues to try to circumvent Joe and get a direct line to the Greeks. In an effort to force Omar out of retirement, Cheese suggests Chris and Snoop target his friend and mentor, Butchie (S. Robert Morgan). Meanwhile, Valchek leaks raw police data to Carcetti to show him how badly things are going. However, when Rawls and Burrell present a more palpable set of stats, Carcetti realises they are juking the numbers, and thus is given the ammunition he needs to remove Burrell. To counter any accusations of racism, he has Norman leak a story to The Sun heralding Daniels as Burrell's most likely replacement. However, when Templeton invents a quote implying Daniels was involved in Burrell's demise, Daniels becomes worried Burrell will reveal his questionable past from his days in the Eastern District. At The Sun, Whiting and managing editor Thomas Klebanow (David Costabile) make an unpleasant announcement.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0977180", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 4268, "number_of_episodes": 60}
