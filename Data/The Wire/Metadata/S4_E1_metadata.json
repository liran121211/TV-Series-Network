Meanwhile, Marlo has solved the problem that baffled Stringer Bell: how to maintain discipline--read: murders--without getting police attention.\u2014Anonymous", "With Daniels replacing Colvin in command of the Western District, the MCU is now led by Lt. James Asher (Gene Terinoni), who is more interested in his upcoming retirement and is effectively letting Freamon run the unit. Although they have wires on several of Marlo's people, they are surprised by the lack of bodies. What they don't know is when Marlo orders a hit, he does so in person, and enforcers Chris Partlow (Gbenga Akinnagbe) and Felicia 'Snoop' Pearson (Felicia Pearson), take the victim to a vacant rowhouse, kill them, cover them with quicklime and seal the vacant up. Following the Barksdale money trail, Freamon presses a reluctant Pearlman to issue subpoenas for the financial records of several prominent political figures - the very same territory that got the original detail shut down four years previously. As Prez prepares for his new career as a schoolteacher, four friends, Michael Lee (Tristan Mack Wilds), Namond Brice (Julito McCullum), Randy Wagstaff (Maestro Harrell) and Duquan 'Dukie' Weems (Jermaine Crawford) enjoy the last few days of summer. Meanwhile, Bodie is operating as an independent dealer on a corner with little to no business. As the mayoral election campaign between city councils Carcetti and Gray and incumbent Mayor Royce enters its final stages, and despite encouragement from his campaign manager, Norman Wilson (Reg E. Cathey), Carcetti grows increasingly disillusioned about his chances of winning.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0763093", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 4712, "number_of_episodes": 60}
