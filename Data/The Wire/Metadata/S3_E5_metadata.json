With Stringer moving into legitimate real estate and aligning himself with Davis and developer Andrew Krawczyk (Michael Willis), the MCU conclude he is now so far from street level dealing as to be virtually untouchable as a drug target. Frustrated that his drug tolerant zones aren't catching on, Colvin approaches the MCU for information on mid-level dealers, with the aim to persuade them to order the hoppers to relocate.
