He's also worried his phone is being tapped. He also thinks there's a snitch in D'Angelo's crew and he's told not to pay anyone until it's sorted. D'Angelo isn't too pleased when he hears Avon has given Stinkum a new territory. Judge Phelan visits the squad to sign the warrants to clone D'Angelo Barksdale's pager. The numbers they're collecting are coded and don't make much sense. Det. Prez Pryzbylewski figures it out however. McNulty and Greggs try to get information from Omar.\u2014garykmcd", "As Avon becomes concerned about his security, Omar moves his operation to the Eastside. Bubbles visits Johnny, but is disturbed by what he finds. Phelan and ASA Ronda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) approve the detail's affidavit for cloning D'Angelo's pager, plus pen-registers on the pit pay-phones, but the team are puzzled at the nonsensical results. However, Prez begins to redeem himself in the eyes of his colleagues by decrypting the code used in the messages. Stringer warns D'Angelo there may be a snitch in his crew, and outlines a plan to snare them, as he and Avon prepare to take over new territory. Meanwhile, Landsman's instincts on the old murder case prove correct, as the coroner connects the murder to two previous Westside drug executions. Following up on this new information, the detail learns Avon is using a strip club as a front. Later, when McNulty and Greggs tail Omar, they are surprised where he leads them.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749450", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 6269, "number_of_episodes": 60}
