At school, Prez's reward/punishment program meets with mixed results, and Colvin looks to restore order by separating disruptive \"corner\" kids from more attentive \"stoop\" ones. Chris tries to enlist Michael into Marlo's ranks, spooking Randy along the way. Dukie debunks Randy's \"special dead\" theory.\u2014WyattJones", "Valchek tells Carcetti that Greggs has been assigned the witness case, but Carcetti is reluctant to go public with the information, until Wilson suggests they feed it to Gray, letting him use it against Royce so as to further split the black vote, whilst also keeping Carcetti insulated from any negative fallout. When Royce learns what Burrell has done, he is furious and decides to fire him after the election and replace him with Rawls. Over the protests of Daniels and Pearlman, Marimow co-ordinates a series of street sweeps, hoping to catch Marlo with \"dope on the table,\" as Bunk and Freamon continue to try to figure out where the bodies are. Chris advises Marlo not to go after Omar in any way he expects, and together they come up with a plan to remove him permanently. Bubbles is attacked by another addict, Panama (Armando Cadogan Jr.), and grows increasingly frustrated with Sherrod for skipping school. Chris and Snoop try to recruit Michael as a soldier. At Tilghman Middle School, Prez struggles to control his students, but unexpectedly makes a connection with several of them, whilst Bunny comes up with an idea for how to single out the most at-risk children for Peranti's study.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0763098", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 4371, "number_of_episodes": 60}
