McNulty and the detail look to make a case against Stringer Bell with a wiretap on a drug ring run by his ally, Proposition Joe. Daniels' promotion is derailed by City Hall due to his estranged wife's political ambitions.\u2014Anonymous", "When the towers are demolished by Mayor Clarence Royce (Glynn Turman) as part of Baltimore's inner-city urban reform, Bodie, Poot and new Barksdale enforcer Slim Charles (Anwan Glover) suggest new territory should be taken, by force if necessary. However, Stringer maintains it doesn't matter where they operate as long as they have good product. Meanwhile, the MCU, supplemented with Sydnor and Ofc. Caroline Massey (Joilet Harris), is up and running. However, having spent six months with wires on several of Prop Joe's people, they have nothing with which to make a case, and, as such, Daniels and Pearlman are considering dropping the wires and trying to get some of the street crew to roll on their higher-ups. In the Western District, Colvin is growing increasingly disillusioned with both the street scene and his own people, including Carver and Herc. Elsewhere, legendary Barksdale enforcer Dennis 'Cutty' Wise (Chad L. Coleman) is released from prison after fourteen years, finding himself out of touch with the contemporary drug game, whilst ambitious city councilman Thomas Carcetti (Aidan Gillen) attempts to ingratiate himself with Acting Commissioner Burrell.\u2014Bertaut"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0749453", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 4858, "number_of_episodes": 60}
