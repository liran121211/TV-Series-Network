1
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:23,476
Fuck is he doing?

2
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:25,819
Cops still parked
right up the block.

3
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:27,925
What are we, invisible?

4
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,408
Stupid fucking yos.

5
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:33,462
Think just fucking with him, man.

6
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,250
You want to wait for him
to serve somebody?

7
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,377
Fuck it.

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,878
They're dirty either way.

9
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:53,872
Hands on the wall, fuckers.

10
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:56,941
We ain't done nothing!

11
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:59,683
Seriously. I was just sitting
in my chair reading a magazine, is all.

12
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:02,577
Watching your crew
work a ground stash, you mean?

13
00:01:04,777 --> 00:01:05,806
What the fuck?

14
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:10,782
Asshole!

15
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,917
Y'all still taking a charge
for this, you know that?

16
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:15,704
- You're a truant.
- Today's Saturday.

17
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:16,788
Try Wednesday.

18
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:19,541
Why you don't page truancy?
Why y'all locking me up?

19
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,144
Hey, Colicio.

20
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,940
Officer Colicchio, shitbird.

21
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,378
We need to block
every lane here?

22
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,481
Hey, shut it down.
It's a police operation.

23
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,686
Let's get back to your post.
Back these vehicles up.

24
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:33,513
- Officer.
- I'm not telling you again.

25
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:34,973
Tony, calm down.

26
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:39,018
Officer, if you could just move
your car forward Just a little bit,

27
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:40,693
I'm gonna get right down the road.

28
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:56,928
We're the police!

29
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,669
What are you doing?
Let me go!

30
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:49,663
Fuck!

31
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:51,965
- Problem?
- I spent all day

32
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,238
trying to trace this $80,000 withdrawal
from Clay's personal account...

33
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:56,691
Figuring it was dirty.

34
00:03:56,851 --> 00:04:00,022
Turns out he's repaying a loan
from his mother-in-law.

35
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:01,077
A loan?

36
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:04,205
Has to be. I mean, she gives him
the same amount in 2002.

37
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:08,074
He uses it as a down payment on
a property that he buys the same week.

38
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,314
See?

39
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:16,034
He bought a weekend house down
in Calvert county 6 years ago.

40
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:18,855
You pulled the loan application
on the property, right?

41
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,545
Just a second.

42
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:24,756
Here you go.

43
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,127
Got him.

44
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,231
The head shot.

45
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:33,895
What?

46
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:38,957
And if anyone is suggesting
that I've broken chain of command,

47
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,582
That I've gone behind your back,

48
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:43,661
that I've lobbied against you
in any way, they're lying.

49
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,314
I don't know who told
the newspaper that,

50
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:49,465
but they were lying
when they said it.

51
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:52,636
Yeah.

52
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,625
Respectfully, sir,

53
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,802
I don't know where this shit
is coming from.

54
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:21,563
Sir...

55
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,077
no one has spoken to me--

56
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:26,064
Not Carcetti, not anyone.

57
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,059
But if I'm approached,

58
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:30,541
My answer will be
to decline the position

59
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:33,493
And say I serve
at your pleasure.

60
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:41,015
Sir?

61
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:44,166
Sir?

62
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,453
Go with the preakness piece
Or this one about the firefighter death?

63
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,026
- What are you interviewing for?
- Metro position, Virginia bureau.

64
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:09,834
Firefighter, I think. Got to show
something I wrote on deadline.

65
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,414
Burrell might get the axe today.

66
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,504
- Who told you that?
- Picked it up on my calls.

67
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,606
Desk Sergeant in the eastern
says it's all over the department.

68
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:18,294
Wish me luck.

69
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:19,429
Good luck.

70
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,661
Got a rumor that Burrell is gonna
get fired today if not tomorrow.

71
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:27,789
Yeah?

72
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,211
- Work it.
- What about Twigg?

73
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,854
With his sources, you know?

74
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:35,064
I can't throw one at a guy
on his last day, can I?

75
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,358
You work it as best you can.

76
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:40,051
You are now
my new Senior cop reporter.

77
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,308
Unclaimed.

78
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,370
So far this year... 11.

79
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:53,207
13 if we add the two in the freezer
I ain't I.D.'ed yet.

80
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,152
Run it for no fixed address.

81
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:59,644
Jimmy, it'd help if I knew
what the fuck you were looking for.

82
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:02,577
Body wise, I just want to know where
we're pulling most of the homeless from.

83
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:04,135
With or without O.D.'s?

84
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,629
Numbers are way up
since Fentanyl showed up.

85
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,446
Throw them in.
The more, the merrier.

86
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:09,522
All right.

87
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,552
Damn!

88
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:15,730
They're all dead
and no fixed address?

89
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:19,314
Dropping like flies
in the southern lately.

90
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,862
Hey, Lester, it's me.

91
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:22,529
Yeah, in the morgue.

92
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:25,530
Some 4:00 to 12:00
with a lot of midnight,

93
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:27,825
And a lot of them
in south Baltimore.

94
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,746
So who do we know working
12:00 to 8:00 in the southern?

95
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,123
2300 in the district.
That'll work.

96
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:36,395
Jimmy, am I missing something here?

97
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,127
How does this help you?

98
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,197
Don't want none
of that phony gangster shit.

99
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,056
He was old-school.

100
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,132
Funny, I feel like
I should know Butchie,

101
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:51,857
But I can't place him.

102
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:53,813
Came up under teensy.

103
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:57,355
Caught him a slug early.
Took his sight.

104
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,567
Dabbled now and then, but kept it quiet
as a puppy walking on cotton.

105
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:05,179
This here do just fine.

106
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,570
Have it say,

107
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:18,672
"Butchie. Woe to them that
call evil good and good evil."

108
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,673
Sign it, "your true and loyal friend,

109
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,633
"Proposition Joe."

110
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:33,307
You ain't thinking no kindly note
gonna slow Omar coming at us.

111
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,694
It's how I feel.
He was a good man.

112
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,480
- And Marlo?
- Marlo is Marlo, man.

113
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,342
He weren't the one
that put me in this trick bag.

114
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:46,233
The motherfucker who snuggled up
and whispered in Marlo's ear did that.

115
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,860
I know what you thinking,

116
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,453
And I ain't making a move
against no kin,

117
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,966
Not till I got more to go on than words.

118
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,433
And knowing my sister's son
the way I do,

119
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:58,025
If the boy got 50 grand
in his pocket,

120
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,990
It ain't gonna be long
before it jump out and find itself

121
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,559
in some salesman hand.

122
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,162
And that kind of goody, we know.

123
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,093
In the meantime, if Omar coming
for any of us, He coming for me,

124
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,393
And out of respect
for that man's skill set,

125
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:14,861
I'm gonna take myself out
of the lineup after the meet tomorrow.

126
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,217
Till this shit sort itself out,

127
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,822
Cheese gonna watch the shop.

128
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,939
You gonna watch cheese.

129
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,117
Very clean. Very nice.

130
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,601
But this is unnecessary.

131
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:39,582
It was not our intent
to mislead.

132
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:42,843
When I spoke before
about the condition of your money,

133
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,588
I was lking... in symbols.

134
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:49,759
The money, it came from the street,
And so I thought

135
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,929
you came... from the street.

136
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:54,585
I did.

137
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,061
I do.

138
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,976
It was not the money
that concerned me.

139
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:01,568
You have been
more than generous,

140
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,888
and this is a gift
of an honorable man, clearly.

141
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,335
But, in accepting such a gift,

142
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,069
we would give you
the wrong impression.

143
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:20,686
You come from the street, hmm?

144
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:24,908
The street... doesn't concern us.

145
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:27,747
We know him down here,
and we trust him.

146
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,843
But... to know more people,

147
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,960
to learn more names,

148
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,833
to have them learn our names...

149
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:38,015
I'm not here to badmouth Prop Joe.

150
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:40,268
But people depend on me.

151
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:43,099
Now, last year,
there was a robbery.

152
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,067
I'm saying, you know, what?
What if this happens again?

153
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:49,563
Where do that put my people?

154
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,320
That's for you to discuss with Joe.

155
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,237
All I'm asking for
is an insurance policy.

156
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:56,075
You know, something covers me

157
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:58,160
- and covers you.
- And covers Joe.

158
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:09,503
The young man makes a point.

159
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,052
You're right.

160
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,097
These are volatile times.

161
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:16,512
It is not unreasonable
to carry insurance.

162
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:20,498
Who can say
what tomorrow will show us?

163
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:22,970
You go.

164
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:25,428
Be safe.

165
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:30,693
Your case.

166
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:35,519
Oh, y'all came a ways.
Put it to expenses.

167
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:43,247
If we were to tell him no,

168
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,188
he will still come back.

169
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:48,124
This he shows us.

170
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,674
But he is not Joe.

171
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,980
He is not Joe.

172
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:00,938
If I follow this,

173
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,332
the senator's mother-in-law
gave him $80,000

174
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:06,272
that he used as a down payment
on some property.

175
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:09,005
Later, he paid the money back,
which makes it a loan.

176
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,312
Which falsifies the loan application.

177
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,905
The moment he signs the application,
he's exposed.

178
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:18,206
Title XVIII of the U.S. Code,
chapter 47, section 10-14,

179
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:20,951
Loan and credit applications.
30 years

180
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:22,967
and not to exceed $1 million.

181
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,550
Over at the U.S. Attorney's office,
they call it "the head shot."

182
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,070
30 years for something

183
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,999
that every kid two years out of college
does with a starter home.

184
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,547
daddy loans you money to qualify;
a couple years later, you pay him back.

185
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:35,630
30 years.

186
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,832
With leverage like that,

187
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,144
this case needs to go federal.

188
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:50,407
Outstanding work, detective.

189
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:52,816
Let me have some time
to digest this.

190
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:55,947
Counselor,

191
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,327
a moment?

192
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,452
Is there another way to go at this?

193
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:06,747
- How strong are our theft counts?
- Straightforward document cases,

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,868
4 counts. They're a lock.
He stole from his own charities.

195
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,281
We convict,
that's 10 years per count.

196
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:15,968
Nothing to sneeze at,
even without the bank charge.

197
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:43,802
You think it might be,
OK for me to sit in

198
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:46,620
- on one of your budget meetings?
- On our good days.

199
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,832
Ed? This is Scott Templeton.

200
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:54,443
Good to meet you.
Have a seat.

201
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:56,253
Give me a second.

202
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:03,855
Next mouth needs fed
is the right reverend Isaac Cason.

203
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,119
You'd think I was putting
Ray Lewis out to pasture.

204
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,838
All I'm trying to do is dump Burrell.

205
00:14:07,998 --> 00:14:11,081
You want my community to swallow Rawls,
you'd better grease that morsel up good.

206
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,051
It's Rawls for 6 months,
then it's Daniels.

207
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,109
What, you're gonna tell me Daniels
isn't black enough for you guys?

208
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,644
They don't know him.

209
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:20,537
They know Burrell, qnd they could
get him on the phone when--

210
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:23,527
Burrell came in here with bad stats.
He lied to my face.

211
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:26,070
Rawls lied, too, but you're bumping him
to acting commissioner.

212
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,111
Only till Daniels
gets groomed as deputy ops.

213
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:30,077
We can't fire everyone
all at once, can we?

214
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,645
This isn't getting us anywhere.

215
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,384
Only two more left.

216
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:36,239
Fine. How can I be of assistance
to the good reverend Cason?

217
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,959
He has property up in Park Heights.

218
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,852
He wants to convert it
to Senior housing.

219
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,842
- Can we accommodate him?
- We're broke, but,

220
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:44,512
We could steer
some of the hud money his way.

221
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,154
That leaves reverend Myrtle Smith.

222
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:50,643
She wants to extend parking
to a vacant lot next to her church.

223
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:52,421
- It's city property.
- That's it?

224
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,722
Last is the least.

225
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:56,304
We'll get the reverend
a long-Term lease, dollar a year.

226
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:01,614
Then there's the matter
of McCulloh homes.

227
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:06,290
That would be the same McCulloh homes
that's adjacent to Andy Krawczyk's

228
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,104
$300 million expansion
of the state office complex.

229
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,055
- It's over 500 units.
- Public housing.

230
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,392
Narrese, you're gonna need
that hope VI money for that.

231
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:16,124
- Is there any hope VI money to be had?
- It doesn't matter, gentlemen.

232
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:18,846
All madame president wants
from us is the green light.

233
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,373
You want him gone, right?

234
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,136
It's good stuff.

235
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:29,125
Some of your feature work
a little wrought

236
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:31,308
for what we do here
at the "Post" language-wise,

237
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:34,453
- But it all shows initiative.
- That's the style they want from me,

238
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,246
but to tell you the truth,

239
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:37,884
I prefer to write it dry.

240
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,693
- You've been in Baltimore long?
- Two years.

241
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,505
Before that, I was at
the "Kansas City Star" for 3 years,

242
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,323
"Wichita Eagle" before that.

243
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:47,741
The "Sun's" a fine paper.

244
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:50,232
Before the cutbacks, maybe.

245
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,514
Well, they still beat us
often enough in annapolis

246
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,219
for my Maryland desk
to take them seriously.

247
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:59,300
You have anything to do with
those ground red stories last year?

248
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:02,094
It's good stuff,
real good stuff.

249
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,080
You wanted to go
to the page one meeting, right?

250
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,691
Another time, maybe.

251
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,047
Anyway, as he says,
we'll keep the resume on file.

252
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,050
A few more clips,
a little more seasoning,

253
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,863
We'll take another look, OK?

254
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,492
You can just toss that.

255
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:42,648
That's the plan: to let him
cut his teeth as deputy for operations,

256
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:45,276
qnd in 6 months, make him.

257
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,975
He's not the spic-and-span boy
they think he is.

258
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:56,998
He came up in the eastern district,
part of a bad drug unit

259
00:16:57,158 --> 00:16:58,809
that was skimming seized drug money.

260
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:00,059
I actually had to--

261
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,515
This isn't about Daniels.
You came in with bad stats,

262
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,742
And for the mayor,
that was the last straw.

263
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:07,282
My numbers were clean.

264
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,739
They had gone through staff review.
You tell Carcetti--

265
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:11,575
Ervin, it doesn't matter now.

266
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:12,959
You're done.

267
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,411
Carcetti has moved on you.

268
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,638
You tell him
if he does me like this,

269
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,216
I'll do Daniels.

270
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:21,483
You kill Daniels,

271
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,921
and we end up with Bill Rawls
as police commissioner.

272
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,466
The ministers, the caucus,
the council-- They'll live with Daniels.

273
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:28,490
Why?

274
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,216
Because Carcetti gave away
the store just to push you out.

275
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:34,197
30 pieces of silver each, huh?

276
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:35,766
We'll have your back.

277
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,458
I promise you.

278
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:38,819
Full pension

279
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:40,143
and a transitional job

280
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,435
on the mayor's criminal justice
coordinating council,

281
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,083
And from there,
something down in Washington

282
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:46,882
with one of the police associations--

283
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,737
6 figures guaranteed.

284
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:52,866
You go the right way,
and attention will be paid, Ervin.

285
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,493
But you go kicking and screaming,

286
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:57,242
and no one--
Not the caucus, not the ministers,

287
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,304
not me--

288
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,417
will be there for you.

289
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:07,423
Your choice.

290
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:14,889
Press conference tomorrow.
You play out the string.

291
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:16,881
Carcetti will do the same.

292
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:36,185
<i>Attention: all unauthorized
vehicles parked on the loading dock</i>

293
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:37,884
<i>are now being towed.</i>

294
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:40,618
<i>Attention: all unauthorized...</i>

295
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:42,038
No one's saying anything?

296
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:44,413
- I thought you might help me.
- Not even off the record?

297
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,363
- I just need to confirm.
- ...he told you.

298
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,966
E-Dot deadline's creeping up.
Where the hell are we at?

299
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,035
A source at the courthouse
says it's true

300
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,825
he heard it from Steintorf at the hall.

301
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:56,012
Nothing from the mayor's office,
but they've schedded a press conference.

302
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:58,891
- What's coming out of headquarters?
- Nothing. Daniels had no comment,

303
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,513
and Rawls won't return my calls.

304
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,163
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

305
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,919
And where the hell is Templeton all day?
He could be throwing calls, too.

306
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,852
My last gift to you, Gus.

307
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,912
It's twigg, and I'm on a deadline,
so cut the bullshit.

308
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,822
Don't tell me they're firing
the police commissioner tonight

309
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,450
and you don't know all about it.

310
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,119
Don't be fucking telling me that.

311
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:21,028
Lucky I signed off on your ass,

312
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:23,120
or you'd be
on your way out to boys' village.

313
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,656
And look how you do me.

314
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:26,920
Not ming around,
not letting me see Bug.

315
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,687
- Is that how you pay back a mother?
- How should I pay you back?

316
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,381
Start by showing a little respect.

317
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,829
That all?

318
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,720
Truth is, things have been
rough around the way.

319
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,146
What you're doing's so good,
thought maybe

320
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,654
you'd throw some ends my way.

321
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:42,949
Seeing as how I was here for you
and all.

322
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:45,213
I ain't paying you to be my mother.

323
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,421
The pros from downtown are here.

324
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:02,359
- What can I do for you gents?
- You got a copy of the shift roster?

325
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:13,484
- Didn't Oscar get a realtor's license?
- That would be his day job.

326
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,787
My favorite side partner
from my salad days in patrol.

327
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:17,803
Thank you.

328
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,789
Hard to imagine you in patrol.

329
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:23,326
Damn if I can find it.

330
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,438
That's why they call it a hole.

331
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:29,744
That there is the sickest idea yet.
You know that, right?

332
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,836
I'm just gilding your lily, son.

333
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,227
There.
Right there.

334
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:47,857
- Go away! I'm on my lunch break.
- Excuse me, officer.

335
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,710
Is this the on-Ramp to 95?

336
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:55,927
Socks.

337
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:58,427
I'll be fucked.

338
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,257
This is my partner,
Jimmy McNulty.

339
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,490
You look like a man
in the market for a new house.

340
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:07,986
Think abouit.
It's a buyer's market.

341
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:10,717
Nice garden.

342
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:12,912
Ah, you have an eye
for quality, socks.

343
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,732
Call me if you decide to make a move.

344
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,250
So this isn't a social call?

345
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,722
I wish it were.

346
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,725
Well, get on with it.

347
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,624
I got a busy day tomorrow.
I need my rest.

348
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,491
Oscar, we're in need of a body--

349
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:31,293
Male, homeless,
little or no decomp.

350
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:32,715
Unattended death?

351
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,340
That shouldn't be no problem, Socks,
seeing as you homicide.

352
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,092
We need to get to it before anybody else
gets a look-- see.

353
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,347
You want to open an H-file?

354
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,763
Well, that's got to be a first.

355
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,179
How do I reach you?

356
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,030
- All right.
- All right.

357
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,836
You want to know why?

358
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:08,485
Is that it?

359
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:12,051
If he backs up on us--

360
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,169
Mcquayle was in homicide.
He caught one--

361
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:15,563
A botched kidnapping.

362
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:18,966
He gets there, finds the area
Chief sightseeing through his scene,

363
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:20,770
asks him to back off,

364
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,784
- cites the G.O.
- G-3:

365
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:26,390
authority and responsibility to
coordinate the investigation shall rest

366
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,109
with the homicide detective.

367
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:30,959
Area Chief takes umbrage.

368
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,438
Oscar stands his ground,
and there's quite a dust-up.

369
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:35,899
The next morning,
he's told he's insubordinate.

370
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:39,987
He's got to work two weeks extra duty
pounding pavement up Omonument street.

371
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:44,046
He told them to go fuck themselves,
you know, he'll take the trial board.

372
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,460
Well, he eats two weeks,

373
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,495
and they shitcan him out the unit.

374
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:50,518
Area Chief?

375
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:53,083
Name of Rawls,
as I remember it.

376
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:23,771
How you still alive, yo?

377
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,368
They needed to send a message.
Tell him.

378
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:32,207
Said, "tell Omar he put
his hand in the wrong pocket."

379
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,332
And you need to know,
Marlo dogs,

380
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:35,995
they didn't let Butchie go easy.

381
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:39,781
I'm gonna work them.
Sweet Jesus, I'm gonna work them.

382
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:42,966
- I want in.
- Nah, this one on me, yo.

383
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,096
But you don't know them people.

384
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:55,129
As expected, it's Rawls,

385
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:57,064
with Daniels waiting in the wings.

386
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:00,609
Did they not know that
I had made myself a candidate?

387
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:02,571
- I feel dissed.
- So the great white Rawls

388
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:05,563
- Filly has his day.
- Not much more than a day it shall be.

389
00:24:05,723 --> 00:24:06,907
Daniels by year's end.

390
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,921
Look at this.

391
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:15,457
You're not even gonna read it?

392
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,696
All you do is change the date.

393
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:19,129
I'm covering my ass, Jay.

394
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:20,627
Consider it covered.

395
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:22,609
Motherfucker,

396
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,631
I am the primary
on 22 bodies more than a year old,

397
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,116
and I still haven't got
trace analysis on 14 scenes.

398
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:30,497
The lab can't keep up
with this year's cases.

399
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,916
You want action,
show me some traction.

400
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:35,620
Or buy yourself a chemistry set.

401
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:47,280
Just doing background on my vics,

402
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,698
Looking for a coon thread.

403
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:50,357
Motherfucker, don't even--

404
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,438
Fuck you, too, motherfucker.

405
00:24:55,763 --> 00:24:57,874
- What's wrong with Bunk?
- Hard to say.

406
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,877
Beneath that gruff veneer,
he's actually very emotional.

407
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:05,230
Looking for the theme
in your homeless case, are you?

408
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:07,542
Well, wish me luck.

409
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:10,465
I'm gonna try for an interview
with my only wit.

410
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,106
The home invasion?

411
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:29,092
Fuck him, Tony. The guy was an asshole.
He saw what you've been doing.

412
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:31,299
You know who you were
beating on yesterday?

413
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:32,822
You fucking know?

414
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:36,204
A teacher,
from stuart hill elementary,

415
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:39,199
trying to get around our bullshit
to make it to an after-school program.

416
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,908
- He should have said so.
- He never got a chance.

417
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,726
Boy, I seen some stupid shit in my day,

418
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:50,032
but even by western standards,
this rates a whole new category.

419
00:25:50,253 --> 00:25:52,282
I.I.D. Is down the hall
talking to the Major.

420
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:55,409
They're gonna be down here
looking for statements in 10 minutes.

421
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,599
Tony, you got to write this smart.

422
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,381
The excessive horn blowing
distracted you

423
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,592
from securing juvenile prisoners who...

424
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:05,525
became volatile due to the noise,

425
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:08,126
And you warned the driver
several times--

426
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,722
Fuck that motherfucker.

427
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:12,077
- Say what?
- I said, fuck him.

428
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,421
Shitbird lays on his horn,
he should be locked up.

429
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,145
Fuck his ignorant ass.

430
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,206
<i>Admin Lieutenant to the Major's office.</i>

431
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,644
<i>Admin lieutenant to the major's office.</i>

432
00:26:26,027 --> 00:26:27,759
Tony, I'm writing you up.

433
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:33,067
- You ain't gonna back me?
- I'm charging you.

434
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:36,097
Then charge me.
You're a fucking rat.

435
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:39,795
Then I'm a rat.

436
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:50,779
No way. After what I've been through
to toss him out of the plane,

437
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,989
Now you want me to pretty up
the man's parachute?

438
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:55,168
The commissioner
has served this city for 34 years.

439
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:57,435
Any 5 of which would be enough
to have him indicted.

440
00:26:57,595 --> 00:27:00,202
You should have thought about this
before you put a gun to my head

441
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,586
and snatched up the McCulloh homes
for whatever developer

442
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,793
- you're hiding in your skirt.
- This isn't about me,

443
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,835
and it isn't even about Burrell.

444
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:10,173
It's about Daniels or whoever you're
trying to empower in that department.

445
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,592
- How so?
- 34 years is a long time.

446
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:15,679
Anyone who hangs around that long
can put his hands on a lot of dirt.

447
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:17,681
- If he'd talk out of turn--
- Daniels?

448
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:19,828
I'm not being specific here.

449
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:22,061
I'm just making it clear
for everyone's sake

450
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:24,312
It would be better
if Burrell went quietly.

451
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:32,042
We've scheduled a press
conference for this afternoon.

452
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:35,503
I think Ervin is ready
for a little grip and grin.

453
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,450
With you, with Rawls...

454
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:41,163
for considerations, he might
even put his arm around Daniels.

455
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:46,965
Money from a donor
to west side hoops.

456
00:27:47,663 --> 00:27:48,954
Deposit date.

457
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:51,673
Withdrawal from that account

458
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,431
to his personal account.

459
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:54,984
Again...

460
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:57,053
money from a donor.

461
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,964
Thank you for coming, Senator.

462
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:04,686
We've asked you in to answer

463
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:06,521
questions regarding certain

464
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:08,237
financial irregularities.

465
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:11,484
We can go to my office and talk first
or get right to it.

466
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:13,472
Lead on.

467
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,528
If you'll follow me, then.

468
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:29,401
He's pretty cool about it.

469
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:32,470
The coming out tells the tale.

470
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:33,980
Devon?

471
00:28:34,665 --> 00:28:36,187
<i>Do you know this story?</i>

472
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:40,632
<i>Or would you like me
to read it to you?</i>

473
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:43,446
<i>Devon?</i>

474
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:58,543
Now, then, I show you a canceled check
dated 22 january, 2007,

475
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,876
from Sterner, Ernst,
and Bauer development group

476
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:03,730
made payable to west Baltimore
hoops, incorporated

477
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,872
in the amount of $11,000.

478
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:10,794
And this dated 23 january, 2007,

479
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:14,573
a check drawn on the west Baltimore
hoops, incorporated account

480
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,550
In the amount of $11,000.
And a deposit slip

481
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:20,813
dated 23 january, same year,

482
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:22,555
to your personal account

483
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,641
in the amount of $11,000.

484
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:32,732
I come here to help,
but y'all out for blood.

485
00:29:34,144 --> 00:29:36,319
I'm not answering no more questions.

486
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:39,572
You are invoking your right
against self-Incrimination,

487
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:41,116
- sir?
- Damn right.

488
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:43,736
Then we'll conclude this testimony.

489
00:30:05,835 --> 00:30:06,661
Damn.

490
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:09,008
And that was just a love tap.

491
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:13,139
Think what'd have happened if we hit
the good Senator with the whole shebang.

492
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,376
Work on the fifth, huh?

493
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,835
Why did we even grand jury, then?

494
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:23,283
The answer to at, detective,
is out on Calvert street.

495
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:25,535
Senator. Senator,
we'd like to talk to you.

496
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:26,744
Please, over here.

497
00:30:26,904 --> 00:30:28,709
Senator, would you care
to make a statement?

498
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:33,442
Is it true that you appeared
before the grand jury?

499
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,597
Jane, I insisted that I be called.

500
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:38,661
It's our understanding that
you're the target of an investigation

501
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:41,047
- into theft and fraud.
- Nooo. Pardon. Nooo.

502
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:44,095
Some people are confused
about some things.

503
00:30:44,402 --> 00:30:46,848
But that's why I came down here today,
to set them straight.

504
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:50,302
Happy to do it, too.
Happy to avail myself...

505
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,859
Grand jury's supposed to be secret.

506
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,232
- Who called the reporters?
- Mr. Bond, our state's attorney--

507
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:58,985
Laying claim to the Senator
before anybody else can.

508
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:01,916
There just seemed to be
a little bit of a misunderstanding

509
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:04,176
about some of my dealings
here in the community.

510
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:07,069
As soon as this newspaper
stink get off my ass,

511
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,809
I'm gonna unload my club
and clear a mil.

512
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:12,543
And I'm gonna snatch up every vacant
I can get my fat-ass fingers on.

513
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,417
There you go.
Like a real player.

514
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:17,003
It's a whole new world out there.
Buy you some property.

515
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:19,043
Hold onto it till
the white people show up,

516
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:21,043
- You make a killing.
- Milton's into that,

517
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:24,610
Except he got some kind of deal with
that bullshit prisoner entry program.

518
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,847
- Got convicts fixing up his house.
- Motherfuckers...

519
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,766
shut the fuck up.

520
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,044
I'm sick of listening to your shit.

521
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:36,231
Have we got business?
If we ain't, we gonna bounce.

522
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,211
Marlo here seems pressed for time.

523
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,478
So y'all can pick back up
on this after the meeting.

524
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:43,696
Last up.

525
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,366
- We got hungry man.
- Junior here

526
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:48,868
took it upon himself
to make unlawful incursions

527
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:51,177
into county territory
that was marked for my people.

528
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,873
Incursions?
Ain't you the articulate motherfucker?

529
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:55,875
Keep on talking, boy.
You gonna get spanked.

530
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:58,504
Like you got the heart.
Motherfucker piss like a bitch.

531
00:31:58,664 --> 00:32:00,155
All right, shut it down.

532
00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:04,467
Last I look,
you wasn't no charter member.

533
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,041
I apologize.

534
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:12,141
My nephew gonna heed
the boundaries, I assure you.

535
00:32:12,823 --> 00:32:15,144
A'ight.
Meeting's adjourned.

536
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:23,608
What the fuck up in here?

537
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,244
Just like I told you, right?

538
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,080
I pulled some of it out,
brought it back home.

539
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:35,536
I was, uh--

540
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,099
I was thinking.

541
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:39,995
What next with this?

542
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:44,250
You clear some time tomorrow,

543
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,510
I'll open the door for you.
That work?

544
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:49,554
Son...

545
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:55,382
you need to focus a bit more on what
can be gained by working with people.

546
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:57,498
That's just a thought, now.

547
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,272
Yeah. Thanks.

548
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:19,042
Come to see a dead man walking?

549
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,598
I hear Carcetti's gonna do right by you.

550
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:27,981
Salary with the coordinating council,
then a D.C. job.

551
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,846
- You deserve it.
- Sure, I deserve it,

552
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:33,703
but not for doing the job.

553
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,725
What I got,

554
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:38,993
they gave me for carrying
their water all these years.

555
00:33:39,514 --> 00:33:41,069
To Carcetti, I'm a hack.

556
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:42,987
Royce was no different.

557
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:45,526
Maybe I am.

558
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,548
But every day, they send over
a new priority.

559
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:51,514
Go after the bad guys.
No, change that.

560
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,304
Make quality-of-life cases.

561
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:55,848
Get on top of the murders.

562
00:33:56,008 --> 00:34:00,297
On second thought,
run thewhores out of Patterson park.

563
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:04,828
You think the mayor
tells the schools how to teach kids,

564
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:07,016
or the health department
how to do its job,

565
00:34:07,176 --> 00:34:08,896
or sanitation how to pick up trash?

566
00:34:09,056 --> 00:34:13,580
But get elected, and suddenly,
they know police work.

567
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:17,058
You might think it'll be different

568
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:19,755
when you sit here,

569
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:21,854
but it won't.

570
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,505
You will eat their shit.

571
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,867
Daniels, too, when he gets here.

572
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,130
<i>I wonder how you get
the ladder to go up.</i>

573
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,927
<i>How do you do that?</i>

574
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:53,923
<i>This is a wonderful fire truck.</i>

575
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,269
<i>I wonder where all the firemen are.</i>

576
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:00,754
<i>Think they could fit in here?</i>

577
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:04,584
<i>I wonder what kind of siren
sound this makes.</i>

578
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:06,780
Cheryl, hey.

579
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:12,655
I was thinking I might want
to swing by and see Elijah, you know?

580
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:17,356
Yeah, I know it's been a while.
But...

581
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:20,535
No, no, no. I can get off.

582
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:22,711
Yeah, tomorrow'd be fine.

583
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,089
Yeah. Sure.

584
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:28,961
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

585
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:34,669
- I'm sorry. I just don't think--
- No, no. It's OK.

586
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,138
Right now, he's too withdrawn
to revisit the event.

587
00:35:39,712 --> 00:35:42,280
How do you come back
from something like that?

588
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:54,157
You look nervous, deputy.

589
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:58,329
I swear I didn't ask for this.

590
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,448
Relax.

591
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:03,706
You once told me that if I was gonna do
you, you'd be done already. Remember?

592
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,794
Shit, I don't even remember
what was in that file.

593
00:36:07,954 --> 00:36:10,395
Something about the eastern district.

594
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,895
So long ago, who can remember?

595
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:26,395
I wanted to say a few words
about public service

596
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,714
And about Ervin h. Burrell.

597
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,379
During my time on the city council,

598
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:34,237
Erv was no stranger to me.

599
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:36,325
<i>I chaired the public safety
subcommittee,</i>

600
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,114
<i>and I called upon him many times.</i>

601
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:40,728
<i>We worked closely together then,
and when I became Mayor,</i>

602
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,452
<i>we formed a strong relationship...</i>

603
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:45,248
he feared and hated me,
and I merely wanted him dead.

604
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:48,054
<i>... making Baltimore a safer city.</i>

605
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:50,296
Don't stray from the inner harbor.

606
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:56,137
<i>I know that the criminal justice
coordinating council need a new...</i>

607
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,345
it took a while, but I finally
put his ass out to pasture.

608
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:01,722
<i>If you would.</i>

609
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:04,589
<i>Thank you.
I have a plaque for you.</i>

610
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,102
Plaques for hacks.

611
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:08,055
Prerogative of any big-city Mayor.

612
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:12,626
How much of that insight and analysis
can we get in tomorrow's story?

613
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:14,553
Little to none.

614
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,248
Twigg was the man who could work
the department sources,

615
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:21,151
and they're the ones that would shit
all over a dog-and-pony show like that.

616
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:22,660
What about Price at the hall?

617
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,388
They set up the press conference.

618
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:26,673
They're not gonna tell the
truth, even on background.

619
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:30,083
A veteran in the cop shop is what
gets us over on a story like this,

620
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:32,482
and fuck if we didn't buy ours out.

621
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:35,850
Gus, I understand that you're
disappointed with the cutbacks,

622
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,508
But civility is important.

623
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:40,216
I've been meaning to talk to you
about your profanity.

624
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:41,637
My profanity?

625
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:44,140
A collegial atmosphere is essential.

626
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,012
Collegial?

627
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:55,318
I failed out of journalism school.
What the fuck do "collegial" mean?

628
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,654
Jesus Christ.
We don't have this?

629
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:01,523
<i>Prosecutors would not comment on
a possible grand jury investigation,</i>

630
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:03,291
but sources familiar with the case

631
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,424
<i>say the Senator
has been under investigation</i>

632
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,079
-<i> for more than a year</i>.
- Sorze.

633
00:38:10,094 --> 00:38:11,792
Clay Davis was grand-juried today.

634
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:14,185
He's been under investigation
for almost a year.

635
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:15,985
I'm a federal court reporter, remember?

636
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:18,330
We haven't had daily city court covere
since Doug Strock

637
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,843
- took the buyout before last.
- This isn't a federal probe?

638
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:23,387
If it was, I would have had it
months ago. This is city.

639
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:25,473
You want one reporter
covering two courthouses,

640
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,763
fine. Why don't you
shove the broom up my ass,

641
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:29,307
and I'll sweep the floor.

642
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,024
All right. Just get caught up, OK?

643
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,272
Meanwhile, see if you can
get a quote from Davis.

644
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:35,608
You're chasing
a courthouse story with Sorze.

645
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:38,110
- No problem. What do you need?
- Find the state's attorney.

646
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:41,225
He set up a perp walk for Clay Davis
outside the grand jury today.

647
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,824
We get a hold of bond,
he'll catch us up on all this shit.

648
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:46,425
Jesus.

649
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,537
You remember in the good old days
when nobody

650
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:50,548
in their right mind
would stage a perp walk

651
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,721
without calling a daily newspaper?

652
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,484
Nowadays, all they care about
is a goddamn video.

653
00:38:58,951 --> 00:39:00,285
They've forgotten.

654
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:02,118
I don't even know
why we're doing this.

655
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:04,519
I can knock out an office report
like this in my sleep.

656
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,391
There's no way Jay gets off his fat ass,
comes up to check what I'm doing.

657
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:09,959
A lot rides on this.

658
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,760
Work it like a real case,
it'll feel like a real case,

659
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,459
And more importantly,
it'll read like a real case.

660
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,719
You should have seen me
in the squad room today.

661
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:20,585
All the case work laid out
like I'm lost in a career case.

662
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:23,008
- Landsman barely noticed.
- We crank this up,

663
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:25,825
Landsman's not the only one who's
gonna be thumbing through this H-file.

664
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:29,245
We get sloppy, we get cuffed.

665
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,293
What do you want me to do?

666
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:35,978
What detectives do, detective.

667
00:39:54,574 --> 00:39:56,514
Can I talk to you for a second?

668
00:39:57,114 --> 00:40:00,167
Maybe later.
I got to get readyor work.

669
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:17,300
Does your dog bite?

670
00:40:17,653 --> 00:40:19,030
Got teeth, don't he?

671
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,154
Chip change, get your ass in here.
That's it.

672
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:25,328
I'm detective McNulty,
Homicide.

673
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,182
May I ask you a few questions?

674
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,111
Got a card?

675
00:40:33,488 --> 00:40:34,706
You got a card?

676
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:38,293
- Card?
- Business card, yeah.

677
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:41,320
I can't make no money like that...

678
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,168
This-- That.

679
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,580
That is a card.

680
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:17,644
We having fun yet?

681
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:22,045
I need a drink.

682
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,720
I'm gonna ask you once,
where Joe?

683
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:45,926
Skip past the talking.

684
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,074
Do what you feel.

685
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,803
Joe ain't had nothing to do with--

686
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,197
Now, Slim, you gonna make me
hurt you, yo.

687
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:56,818
Ask yourself, dog,

688
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,837
why would Joe give Butchie up?

689
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:03,657
If Marlo could make him talk,

690
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:06,402
he puts Joe inside your big score.

691
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,988
If Joe turned Butchie,
I'd tell you.

692
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,664
Shit, I help you, even.

693
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:14,869
But it just ain't like that.

694
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:17,991
Come on, yo.

695
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:22,466
Finish it.

696
00:42:49,855 --> 00:42:51,714
Take a look at the fifth graph.

697
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:56,233
"The Mayor, comma, incensed by
the commissioner's performance..."

698
00:42:56,537 --> 00:42:58,579
- "Incensed" seems over the top.
- I don't know.

699
00:42:58,818 --> 00:43:01,972
Drug legalization fiasco,
the bodies in the vacants,

700
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:04,627
The bullshit stats.
I'd be incensed.

701
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:09,723
Take a look at Arnold's fifth graph.

702
00:43:10,127 --> 00:43:10,855
OK.

703
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:14,634
"Incensed" is to inflame with wrath.

704
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:18,349
It speaks to obsession.
Is this the Mayor's state of mind?

705
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,434
Something more nuanced, perhaps.

706
00:43:20,636 --> 00:43:22,394
Galled, vexed, annoyed...

707
00:43:22,554 --> 00:43:24,647
safer still--Displeased.

708
00:43:25,223 --> 00:43:26,920
You'd take the crab
out of crab soup.

709
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,167
Hey, Scott,

710
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:34,768
That was good work by you
and sorze catching us up.

711
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:37,701
- Great effort.
- There's an "attaboy" for you.

712
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:40,957
How'd it go in washington?

713
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:44,053
Eh, buyer's market out there.

714
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:45,508
Metro desk.

715
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:49,928
"Baltimore Sun" ain't so bad.

716
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,715
<i>9-Adam-4-3.</i>

717
00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:54,247
<i>43.</i>

718
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:58,553
<i>Reported D.O.A. alley
in the rear of the old plant.</i>

719
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:00,239
<i>Copy d.O.A.</i>

720
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:03,135
9-46.
K-G-A,

721
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:05,735
Advise 43 I'm close by.
I'll handle it.

722
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:07,609
<i>Copy, 9-Adam-46.</i>

723
00:44:08,794 --> 00:44:10,789
Bunk, are you feeling all right?

724
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:13,622
She said "D.O.A.," not "doughnut."

725
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:37,671
I know y'all into keeping
things on the hush-hush tip,

726
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:38,971
But, damn, Chris,

727
00:44:39,297 --> 00:44:41,455
This C.I.A. shit off the hook.

728
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,046
I, uh...

729
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:47,968
I ain't done nothing lately
to piss you off, right?

730
00:44:49,664 --> 00:44:50,557
Right?

731
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,870
Man already shit hisself,

732
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,195
And we ain't even get started t.

733
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:04,204
He's funky, yo.

734
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:06,165
It's a gift from Marlo.

735
00:45:06,482 --> 00:45:07,971
But you know how that go.

736
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:10,204
Give a gift, get a gift.

737
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:16,652
Yo, hungry man, what's up?

738
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:29,804
Lester, you can turn around.

739
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:32,153
Yeah, false alarm.

740
00:45:34,586 --> 00:45:37,004
- Won't work. He's too far gone.
- I find them, detective.

741
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:39,239
What you do after that
is your business.

742
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:41,060
Thanks. Maybe next time.

743
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:44,205
Seeing as how I'm doing you
a favor, detective,

744
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:47,227
You can write the first
officer's report for me.

745
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:53,093
My sequence is a-1-15.

746
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,813
I know him.
Avon's lawyer.

747
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:09,329
Yeah, mine, too.

748
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,006
Brick uses him.

749
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,128
So does Phil boy for most of his stuff,
not just the criminal side.

750
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,243
Yeah, Levy excels in putting
our limp-dick money to work.

751
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:22,315
You want to know what to do
with them bank checks?

752
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:24,200
This where you need to be.

753
00:46:25,988 --> 00:46:28,306
Joseph, you're looking prosperous.

754
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:29,482
I get by.

755
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,417
Mr. Stanfield.

756
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,877
Joseph tells me
good things about you.

757
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,172
You ever find that camera?

758
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:39,636
Cost me the job.

759
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:44,847
So let's, go into the conference room
where we can spread out.

760
00:46:49,034 --> 00:46:51,781
This between you
and your attorney.

761
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:14,714
Carcetti finally dumps Burrell.

762
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:18,464
Ervin was a year before me at dunbar.

763
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:20,793
No shit.

764
00:47:22,446 --> 00:47:24,044
He was in the glee club.

765
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,974
You're killing me.
I got to ask.

766
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:30,184
Stone stupid.

767
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:39,443
Say hi to aunt Kima.

768
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:47,803
Anyways, you were
right on time with this.

769
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,943
I got a dozen things
I got to get done,

770
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:52,748
and I got to do them while
working overtime at the station.

771
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:54,175
Been busy, huh?

772
00:47:54,534 --> 00:47:56,877
Your boss got fired,
and we've been running ever since.

773
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,925
Bye, Lij.

774
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:02,758
Go on. We'll be fine.

775
00:48:12,003 --> 00:48:13,432
Wow, that's good.

776
00:48:14,068 --> 00:48:15,812
You staying inside the lines.

777
00:48:21,003 --> 00:48:22,194
Want to do something?

778
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:25,198
Go to the park?

779
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,035
Get some ice cream?

780
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,291
What did you say?

781
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:40,077
You don't have a house?

782
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:42,312
What's up with that?

783
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:43,924
A hero needs a house.

784
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:51,557
Been a long time
since I built a house.

785
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,434
Hope I remember how.

786
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,190
Deputy ops.

787
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:31,299
Nothis is Daniels.
Cedric Daniels.

788
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:35,517
He's now in the commiioner's office.

789
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,379
Yes.

790
00:49:55,707 --> 00:49:58,218
He knows he fucked up.
He knows this.

791
00:49:59,406 --> 00:50:01,930
He's proud, you know?
He doesn't want to beg.

792
00:50:03,173 --> 00:50:04,598
It's not about that.

793
00:50:05,226 --> 00:50:06,383
Come on, Carv.

794
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,051
You cannot do one of your own guys.

795
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,281
I know you got rank now.
You're damn near lieutenant.

796
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:13,497
But still...

797
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:17,400
It ain't about the rank.

798
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:23,388
I never told you, Herc.

799
00:50:25,514 --> 00:50:27,178
Never said a fucking word.

800
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:30,581
But when I gave you that kid
to debrief last year,

801
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:32,114
what's-his-face?

802
00:50:32,274 --> 00:50:35,672
You were supposed to get him
to Bunk Moreland. You remember that?

803
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:39,172
Yeah. I fucked up.
So what?

804
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:42,042
So it mattered.

805
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,253
So what the fuck does this
have to do with Colicchio?

806
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,862
It all matters.

807
00:50:47,953 --> 00:50:50,047
I know we thought it didn't, but...

808
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:53,333
it does.

809
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,345
So you got to do Colicchio, huh?

810
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:02,836
Guess you think they had to do me.

811
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:07,973
Yeah, probably.

812
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:14,750
These guys are gonna talk shit
about you for a while.

813
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,249
But fuck 'em, Carv.

814
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:18,078
You do what needs done.

815
00:52:02,104 --> 00:52:04,905
- I was out all morning.
- You worked 8:00 to 4:00.

816
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:08,651
I'm working a serial killer.
They call me on any suspicious death.

817
00:52:08,914 --> 00:52:10,754
Yeah? Where'd they reach you?

818
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:14,414
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

819
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:16,579
I stopped, had a couple,
then I got the call.

820
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,235
I know. I can smell
the Jameson's from here.

821
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:22,290
- Jamie and listerine-- Your scent.
- Beadie...

822
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,445
- I'm just--
- We had something, Jimmy.

823
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:28,072
You and me,
we had something.

824
00:52:30,149 --> 00:52:31,925
You know, when people told me

825
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:35,614
stories about you, about how you were,
I couldn't believe it.

826
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:37,736
I couldn't see it.

827
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:58,857
Yeah. 10 minutes.

828
00:53:00,106 --> 00:53:02,277
I got another one.
South Baltimore.

829
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:10,524
- Beadie, I'm chasing a serial killer.
- Yeah. That's not all you're chasing.

830
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:15,487
Look. If you don't want to be here...

831
00:53:17,214 --> 00:53:18,581
I got to go.

832
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,569
He changed up.

833
00:53:25,814 --> 00:53:29,125
Marlo's no fool.
He know you be coming at him.

834
00:53:29,362 --> 00:53:31,421
Word is, him and Chris
went to the mattresses,

835
00:53:31,581 --> 00:53:33,380
on the move almost every night.

836
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,054
Fool enough to kick a sleeping dog.

837
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:38,120
- That should tell you something, no?
- While I got the boy waiting on me,

838
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,953
I ain't go at him straight up.

839
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,064
I go after his people, you feel me?

840
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:45,604
You hurt enough of them, that snake
gonna stick his head above that hole.

841
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:47,897
That one there?

842
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:51,588
He's a lieutenant.
We gonna go after him first.

843
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:54,609
Mark that ride, yo.

844
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:56,949
Oscar.

845
00:53:58,315 --> 00:53:59,248
Lester.

846
00:53:59,415 --> 00:54:01,402
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah. Anytime, man.

847
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:10,458
He's perfect.

848
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:12,553
Can't be dead
more than a couple of hours.

849
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:14,194
Better lose these.

850
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:25,022
You're a twisted fuck, McNulty.

851
00:54:25,282 --> 00:54:27,089
Defense wounds.
Help sell it.

852
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:30,061
You got a lot of nerve
calling me twisted.

853
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:32,556
You're the fella
that came up with the teeth.

854
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:35,197
You know how these psycho
serial motherfuckers are.

855
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:36,635
They mature.

856
00:54:37,455 --> 00:54:39,487
They start simple and crude

857
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:42,657
And become more and more ornate.

858
00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:43,743
There you are.

859
00:54:43,903 --> 00:54:46,119
Don't ever tell my mother
or my priest you saw me do this.

860
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:47,621
Take it to my grave.

861
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,759
- Want me to take that?
- Nah, I got it.

862
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:05,990
What you see in this hole, man?

863
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:07,688
All the money you got?

864
00:55:09,817 --> 00:55:11,102
Your great-grandfather,

865
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:15,315
First colored man to own
his own house in Johnson square.

866
00:55:16,184 --> 00:55:17,672
That means something,

867
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,195
Something you young'uns lost.

868
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,657
Well, we outside when you ready.

869
00:55:23,997 --> 00:55:25,857
Hey, keep sharp while I'm gone, boy.

870
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:27,425
Charles say Omar back,

871
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:29,177
and while he left Charles standing,

872
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:32,499
the man might feel less inclined
if he get the drop on you or yours.

873
00:55:33,215 --> 00:55:35,318
Ain't got to fret none about Omar.

874
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,885
No need for that.

875
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:56,689
You ain't come to see me off.

876
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:02,445
My nephew.

877
00:56:07,052 --> 00:56:08,958
Boy was always a disappointment.

878
00:56:11,607 --> 00:56:13,039
But I treated you like a son.

879
00:56:13,886 --> 00:56:15,627
I wasn't made to play the son.

880
00:56:15,787 --> 00:56:17,647
But my supply--
The good dope?

881
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,971
The Greeks, they cool with it.

882
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,838
Proposition, then:

883
00:56:28,787 --> 00:56:30,447
I just step out the way.

884
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:34,660
You never hear from me again.
I just disappear.

885
00:56:35,722 --> 00:56:37,731
You'd be up into mischief in no time.

886
00:56:38,773 --> 00:56:41,526
Truth is, you wouldn't be able
to change up any more than me.

887
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:46,114
Close your eyes.

888
00:56:49,087 --> 00:56:50,438
It won't hurt none.

889
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,433
There. There, now.

890
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,270
Joe, relax.

891
00:57:00,882 --> 00:57:02,138
Breathe easy.
