1
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,234
2316.

2
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:33,400
Yeah, lester.

3
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,667
- Where are you at?
- On monk in east baltimore.

4
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,300
- Who's on marlo?
- No one right now.

5
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:38,567
- Marlo's been the
hardest to follow.

6
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,334
Too paranoid.
Too much counter-surveillance.

7
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,467
Well, peel off monk

8
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:45,868
and head out broening highway

9
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:47,834
to the marine terminals.

10
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,334
Map forty-four,

11
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,567
grid g-as-in-george-ten.

12
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,467
- Forty-four.
- Affirmative.

13
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,067
This is a fresh one.

14
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:57,400
- If they're going all
the way out there,

15
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,901
then it might just be...
- Damn right.

16
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,901
On it.

17
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,467
Twenty-three-oh-six to
all units on this detail.

18
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:04,634
New twenty is map forty-four,

19
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:06,267
grid g-george-ten.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,067
That's forty-four g-george-ten.

21
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,200
Flood that grid and look
for suspect vehicles.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,767
- Twenty-three-twelve.
Ten-four.

23
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,033
Take me a while.

24
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,701
I'm up northeast. You want
me to stay on cheese?

25
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,634
- Negative. New twenty
is a priority.

26
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:18,934
Think we're on the main stem.

27
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,868
- Yeah?
- Mcnulty? It's on.

28
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:55,133
- Yeah?
- Oh, hell yeah.

29
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:56,267
Alright...

30
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,200
[telephone

31
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,201
"Deserve got nuthin' to do with it."
- Snoop.

32
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,033
okay, whatchya got?

33
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,400
- Well, we rolled around until
bobby spotted chris partlow

34
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,434
pulled up on a lot two
blocks from here.

35
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:23,534
So we sat on him until
marlo posted.

36
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,567
They talked for a minute,
then marlo bounced.

37
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,200
And chris goes to the
warehouse gate alone

38
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,033
and a cola white boys
open up.

39
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,234
He's inside now?

40
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,200
- Entrance is around front
from what I can tell,

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,267
it's the only working gate.
Everything else is rusted up.

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,767
- Who's watching the front?
- Two units.

43
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,501
They're out on foot,
a block away,

44
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,100
with a clear view of what
comes in or out.

45
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,801
- So what do we do
if chris rolls out?

46
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,767
- Let him go.
Partlow is muscle.

47
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,234
He's here to make sure
it looks right.

48
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,033
And if it does, monk or
someone else'll come on down.

49
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,033
Cheese, too, maybe.

50
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,067
So this is a re-up.

51
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,300
Fuck a re-up, son.

52
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
This, here, in the
middle of nowhere...

53
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,934
Miles from anywhere
these mopes meet...

54
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,801
This is re-supply.

55
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:00,000
Other than chris, anybody
else that goes in there...

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,234
If it's a stanfield lieutenant
he's coming out dirty.

57
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,133
You follow them back to town.
If he doesn't know you're

58
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:07,033
on 'em, see where
he takes you.

59
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,234
If he catches a scent, fuck it.

60
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,801
Pull 'em over, jack
'em up and get the dope.

61
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,167
And leander, you want to
snatch the man's cell

62
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:17,033
before he has a chance to erase
anything that might be on it.

63
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,467
The case is in t phones...

64
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,801
Though we're
gonna need a title three

65
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,300
to take
a look at them.

66
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,801
Where are you going?

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,067
Time to 'fess up.

68
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,234
We straight?

69
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:33,701
I said we straight, right?

70
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,133
Them guns was mine.

71
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,000
- Which guns specifically,
mr. Hill?

72
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:40,634
- Whatever guns them cops took
out the truck last year.

73
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:41,801
They mine.

74
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,868
Even though I ain't
touched that iron.

75
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,434
Ain't you got
to do the bit.

76
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,667
- With your limited priors, mr.
Hill, you're exposed to two,

77
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,901
maybe three years, tops.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,968
You'll be well compensated
for the time, I'm sure.

79
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,734
No good to us no how.

80
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,868
You on three legs.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,901
- Familiarize yourself
with the make and model

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,968
of the weapons you
left in the truck, Mr. Hill.

83
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,000
The details matter.

84
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,901
- I get shot up
an' then this shit.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,234
Y'all ask a lot, dontcha?

86
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,234
- You can't hack, go down
walmart or someshit.

87
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,801
And see if they take care you
while you laid up for a while.

88
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,267
C'mon, nigga.

89
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:21,000
- Jeez. In the department,
you take one in the line

90
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,167
they give you light duty
for as long as you need,

91
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,234
then you get to name
your next assignment.

92
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,801
Marlo runs a tighter ship.

93
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,367
Open it.

94
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,400
Six icebox, twenty each.

95
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:06,801
You count, we wait.

96
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:07,834
You no count,

97
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,934
we go to lunch early.

98
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,701
- Twenty-three fourteen
to twenty-three-oh-six.

99
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,934
Suspect number three is in.

100
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,000
You sure it was him?

101
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,934
- Been following the
damn truck for a week.

102
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:57,934
Shouldnow by now.

103
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:58,934
Copy that.

104
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:06,734
- Truck. Ticks
have six legs or eight?

105
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,601
- Must have
been a readjustment.

106
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:12,434
- London was a sweet posting.
I can't lie.

107
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,601
My only regret is I didn't
get the full three-year tour.

108
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:16,634
Thanks.

109
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,434
- It's no reflection
on you, man.

110
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:21,334
- Shit, gus, they even sold
the building in kensington.

111
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,133
I mean we bought that sucker
for nothing fifty years ago,

112
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:27,734
and now chicago sells it off
for a couple million pounds.

113
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,200
- Capitalization they
call it.

114
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:31,701
- These newspaper-chain
guys

115
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,234
just don't give a fuck,
do they?

116
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,567
- Any idea where they're
gonna drop you now that

117
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:37,634
you're back in charm city?

118
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,767
No, I got no idea yet.

119
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:41,501
Klebanow wants to
have lunch, so I guess it'll

120
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,400
come at me, soon enough.

121
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:45,501
Up for something now?

122
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:46,901
Depends.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,434
- I gotta problem.
I need someone...

124
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:54,267
A veteran reporter, quiet,
subtle, discreet.

125
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,400
Good with details,

126
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,868
careful to cover his tracks...

127
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,601
- I don't care
how far we go back, gus,

128
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:02,934
no way I'm gonna
kill your wife for you.

129
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,334
- You know scott templeton?
City g.a.

130
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,601
- The guy talking to the
homeless killer?

131
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:08,701
Not really.

132
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,701
He got hired
after I went to london.

133
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,367
- It's better
you don't know him.

134
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,200
No opinions,
one way or the other.

135
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,167
No, no,
i'm not saying anything.

136
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:19,534
I'm not. I just need
fresh eyes on the fella.

137
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,634
Just a careful look.

138
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,667
- One of whiting's pets,
isn't he?

139
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,167
I said discreet, huh?

140
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,467
I hope you're wrong.

141
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,601
'course you do.

142
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,167
It sticks. Dag.

143
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,934
- Course it sticks.
It's barb wire.

144
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:41,067
Sticking's what
it's s'posed to do.

145
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,167
Come on.

146
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,501
I ain't got all day.

147
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:48,367
Hurry up now.

148
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:58,550
Grab the aluminum
strips there first off.

149
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:08,634
Grab the aluminum
strips there first off.

150
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,133
- How am I supposed
to get back over?

151
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,501
Climb the damn fence.

152
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,734
Do a better job of
it second time, I expect.

153
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,100
Grab them steel pipes quick,

154
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,501
before we get spotted.

155
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:33,033
Robert ruby.

156
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,000
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

157
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,901
I need you to give me
a global printout

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,367
on everything under scott
templeton's byline.

159
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,000
All of it, every edition.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Hey, I'm a fan.

161
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,434
Twenty-three-fourteen.

162
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:07,868
Monk is westbound
onto o'donnell.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,834
Cheese wagstaff
is on the way in.

164
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,067
Also, there's
a truck leaving.

165
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,667
The one we saw
back on the loading dock.

166
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,000
That'd be empty.

167
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,300
They've offloaded,
it's all in the warehouse now.

168
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,667
Bobby and me
will stay on monk.

169
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:19,968
Karen'll follow cheese out,

170
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,968
you guys stay
on the gate.

171
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:28,534
Forgetting for a moment

172
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,567
our little problem
of the serial killer,

173
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,200
we came in promising
a double-digit drop

174
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,601
in violent crime.

175
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,334
Right up on the
gubernatorial primary,

176
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,400
and we're looking
at another record high.

177
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,367
- Michael, this department
has been crippled

178
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,701
by the budget cuts.

179
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,801
For a year now,

180
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,701
we haven't had
the manpower or the tools.

181
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:44,734
You have them now.

182
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,701
- Now. But this
thing is a ship,

183
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:47,701
a super-tanker.

184
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:48,701
We can't just
turn it around...

185
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:49,934
Like that.

186
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,434
More foot patrols.

187
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:52,501
More cars on the street.

188
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,234
Get a handle on it, dammit.

189
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,267
See that's

190
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,400
what doesn't work.

191
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,501
More cops where
people can see them.

192
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,634
More cops on the pavement,

193
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,400
more cops riding past,

194
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:02,801
more cops showing the flag

195
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:05,234
so that you guys can say
you're being tough on crime.

196
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:06,968
Respectfully, sir,
what works

197
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,000
is committing to building
a real deterrent.

198
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,767
We take the time to retool,

199
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:13,667
to teach our people
not to chase stats,

200
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:14,801
but to do actual
police work.

201
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,934
- Who pulled your string,
deputy?

202
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,767
I was told by our mayor

203
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:21,267
at the outset that there
would be no more band-aids,

204
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,734
no more stat games...

205
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,400
- And then we got hit
with the school budget.

206
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,400
And we lost some of the time
we needed to address

207
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,434
the systemic things
you're talking about.

208
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:30,200
Understood. We will
work back on those,

209
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,601
and we will

210
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:34,267
support that kinof reform,
if not from city hall

211
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,934
then from annapolis,
if need be.

212
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,601
But now, deputy, right now,

213
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:40,300
my boss needs the crime
to go down.

214
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,934
Not three years from now.
Not even a year from now.

215
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:47,200
He needs a ten-percent drop
in the next quarter...

216
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,467
Or no one

217
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,300
is gonna be in a position
to reform anything.

218
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:01,367
Be creative, gentlemen.

219
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:11,567
Deputy.

220
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,901
A detective's outside
for you,

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,267
says it's urgent.

222
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,634
- Sydnor and I developed
a source

223
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,667
and ran fressurveillances
on marlo stanfield.

224
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,133
And we believe we're
about to catch

225
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:28,167
his people very dirty.

226
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,167
What?

227
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,334
- We wrapped on that
clay davis

228
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,167
thing and instead of
shutting major crimes down,

229
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,801
we took a couple weeks and
got back up on marlo.

230
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,200
With the right warrants,
he's about to fall.

231
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,667
How the fuck...

232
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,300
- There's no time, cedric.
In an hour or so,

233
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
i'm gonna need...

234
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,200
Yeah?

235
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,000
- Lester...
- What's up?

236
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,834
- We pulled up monk.
Dirty as a motherfucker.

237
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:51,601
Eight keys of the raw.

238
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:54,200
No, he jersey-rolled a stop and
when we tried to pull him over,

239
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,801
he went rabbit on us.

240
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,834
We ran him down on lafayette,
by the overpass.

241
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:58,901
You got the phone, right?

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,901
Yeah, man. I got it.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,234
Good work.

244
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,033
It's down.

245
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,901
I need teams to arrest
marlo stanfield,

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,767
chris partlow,
and cheese wagstaff.

247
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,767
I also need someone
from our s.a.o.

248
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:12,968
To get on the horn to baltimore
county for an s-and-s

249
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,033
warrant on a middle
river warehouse.

250
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,267
And, oh yeah...

251
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,000
Bunk meland

252
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,901
has a warrant on partlow

253
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,434
for a separate homicide.

254
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,667
He held that back so we could
do this business here.

255
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,934
- Anything else you've neglected
to tell me, detective freamon?

256
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,367
No sir.

257
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,434
I think you're caught up.

258
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,801
- Hello?
- Ronnie, dear.

259
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,033
Hey...

260
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:49,300
- Are you sitting down?
- Why?

261
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,133
- He was trying to erase
shit when we tackled him.

262
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,033
Secure this location

263
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,400
until we have written
search-and-seizure.

264
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:55,567
Shit's on t.v, yo.

265
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,467
- With a street value
of almost sixteen

266
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,000
million dollars in heroin,

267
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,334
and charges against high-level
traffickers who were

268
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:08,567
going to put this poison on
the streets of this city...

269
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,934
- Do this mean I still gotta
take that charge for y'all?

270
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:15,934
...and perseverance by our
police department.

271
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,634
And while I am told that this
investigation is continuing,

272
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:22,067
it is my understanding that
there is at least one murder

273
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,033
warrant associated with this
drug organization,

274
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,567
which is believed to have
been responsible for

275
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,901
many of those bodies found
in vacant rowhouses

276
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
more than a year ago.

277
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,200
We did not give up on that
investigation

278
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,133
just as we do not give up
trying every day to

279
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:38,367
address ourselves to the
task of making this city safe

280
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:39,467
and vibrant again.

281
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,133
And let me just say to all
others responsible

282
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:44,567
for the drug trade's assault
on the welfare of this city,

283
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,100
a day like this is
coming for you.

284
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,634
Oh, you are so butch.

285
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,601
- I have seen what drugs have
done to baltimore.

286
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:53,200
Drug dealers do not just
destroy individuals.

287
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,534
They destroy families.

288
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,033
- Don't forget about the
communities.

289
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,801
- They destroy entire
communities.

290
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,067
Today the mayor of baltimore,
our state's attorney,

291
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,667
our police department, and
our communities are saying:

292
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,501
we... Have had... Enough.
Thank you.

293
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,300
Deputy.

294
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,234
Alma gutierrez, "sun" papers.

295
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:16,868
Care to comment?

296
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:18,734
- It's a good day
for the good guys.

297
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,667
- Could you be a bit
more substantive?

298
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,467
Last time the "sun"
had me in its pages,

299
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,634
you had me doing
things I didn't do.

300
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:27,801
Regarding?

301
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:30,300
- Something about me stabbing
someone in the back.

302
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,734
Look it up.

303
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,634
"a source of information

304
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:45,567
"identified the transmission
of photographs

305
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,067
via cellphone."

306
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,534
Fuck do that mean?

307
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:49,901
"source of information."

308
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,501
They sayin' somebody talkin'?

309
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,901
Who the fuck even know?

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,234
I wanna talk to the lawyer.

311
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,234
And you caught a murder,
too.

312
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:03,501
says the same shit
on yours, huh?

313
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:05,601
"from information received,

314
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:08,667
investigation led to d.n.a.
Analysis of the victim."

315
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,467
They got you on d.n.a.?

316
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,033
My hair, I expect.

317
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,534
- "From information received."
More of that snitchin' shit.

318
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,601
- I'm sayin',
where the information come from?

319
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,133
Onliest people knew 'bout
the deed is us right here.

320
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:20,133
Snoop knew.

321
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:21,300
Shit.

322
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,634
- What about your
youngun michael?

323
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,100
Maybe it was him ran his mouth.

324
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:26,200
He got picked up, right?

325
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,667
I did that thing for him.

326
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,033
Why would he talk about it an'
put hisself in?

327
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,567
- He been tested
on the streets.

328
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,734
Maybe he act different
in the rooms downtown.

329
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,634
- Boy been throwin' up all
kinda backtalk 'bout shit.

330
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:35,634
Buck' wild about this 'n that.

331
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:37,167

00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,300
- Cryin' about how june bug
and his people got lit up.

333
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,234
Cryin' about how omar in the
street runnin' his mouth,

00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,767

00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:49,167
Omar tried callin'

338
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:50,167
But, shit, it wadn't nothin'...

He use my name?

342
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,667
In the street?

343
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:59,367
Talk, motherfucker.

344
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:01,634
He just, ya know...

345
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,734
Say that you need to

00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,734
I dunno, he just runnin'

00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,100
He call me a punk?

348
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,167
It was bullshit, man.

349
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:12,200
You ain't need
that on your mind.

350
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,567
- What the fuck you
know about

351
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,234
what I need on my mind,
motherfucker.

352
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,968
My name was on the street.

353
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,200
When we bounce from
this shit here,

354
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:22,200
y'all gonna go down
to them corners,

355
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,434
let them people know.

356
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:25,934
Word did not
get back to me.

357
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:29,901
Let 'em know marlo
step to any motherfucker.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,934
Omar, barksdale...
Whoever.

359
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,767
My name is my name.

360
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,968
Don't see the boy snitchin'.

361
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,634
Neither do i.

362
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,133
But you ready to bet
your future on that?

363
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:02,701
- Ya see that, mcnulty?
Ya see it?

364
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,567
One detective,
working the file,

365
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,133
running a few things
down and bang...

366
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:07,567
He's got an arrest.

367
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,467
Shit, now that chris partlow's
locked up

368
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,234
we might have some
witnesses coming forward

369
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,234
on those cases in
the vacants.

370
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:13,400
Clear 'em all on paper.

371
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:15,067
- We got the one
is all, boss.

372
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,968
- One today, more tomorrow.
And from what?

373
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,167
- From the bunk
just workin' a file.

374
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,868
Business as usual.
But you...

375
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,968
With your
overtime and your cars

376
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,200
and your
surveillance detail

377
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,601
and your bullshit,

378
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:27,701
where the fuck are
you on your redball?

379
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,133
Nowhere.

380
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,567
Killer stopped calling.
Stopped killing, too.

381
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,200
I admit it.
I'm nowhere.

382
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:36,267
- From everything
we've given you,

383
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:37,767
fire should be
shooting out your ass,

384
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:41,801
but no, there you sit
like a genital wart.

385
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:53,100
C'mon, mcnulty.
Show me something.

386
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:54,734
- So what are you
gonna do now?

387
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,601
Keep half a district worth
of manpower on the street,

388
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,934
chasing bullshit?

389
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,634
It'll wind down.

390
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,601
No more killing,
no more disappearances,

391
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:03,968
no more calls.

392
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,868
Marlo is in cuffs.

393
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:10,534
Fuck marlo.

394
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:11,868
Fuck you.

395
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,567
- What's going on in
klebanow's office?

396
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,033
Planning meeting.

397
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,067
Pulitzer submissions.

398
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,267
This early?

399
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:31,334
- The important thing is
that we build on this

400
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,200
through the end of the year,
with no falloff of coverage.

401
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,400
Exactly.

402
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,067
And scott,
we need to start looking

403
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,200
for the points where the
response to the problem

404
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,200
can be criticized.

405
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:39,634
The "gotcha." I know.

406
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,300
- At this point,
we can't tell what category

407
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:42,400
we'll enter with this,

408
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,667
but in public service
especially,

409
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:45,667
greater weight is given
to stories

410
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,200
that result in
changes to policy,

411
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,501
or new legislation.

412
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,567
- So covering the reactions
to our stories

413
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,167
is as important as
the stories themselves.

414
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,667
- Between now and new year's,
we want to a hammer

415
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,501
at whatever changes
or discussions

416
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,767
or actions result from your
coverage of the homeless.

417
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:02,100
- And graphics matter.
Our presentation must be

418
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:04,567
clean and professional when it
goes to the committee.

419
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,934
- You guys really think this
has a shot at a pulitzer?

420
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,200
I do and it does.

421
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,167
Being on the pulitzer board
for a coup of terms,

422
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,667
I've seen the process up close.

423
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,167
There's a way of
doing these things.

424
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,267
Time honored.

425
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:19,200
Knowing how is why they
pay me the big bucks.

426
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,667
- Alright. What do we
want to say exactly?

427
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,868
With our coverage.

428
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,067
What do we want to say
about homelessness?

429
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,367
I mean, it's bad.

430
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,334
It's very bad, granted.
Buisn't it actually

431
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:30,767
symptomatic of a much
greater dynamic...

432
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,601
- We want to rediscover
a world

433
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:34,300
that for too long
has been ignored.

434
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,133
Examine the tragedy
underlying these murders,

435
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:37,300
the neglect...

436
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,334
The dickensian aspect.

437
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,801
Exactly.

438
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,267
Alma, dearest.

439
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:50,367
This quote from daniels:

440
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,968
"it's a good day for
the good guys."

441
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,367
He couldn't come up with
anything better than that?

442
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:54,601
He wouldn't play.

443
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,400
Says we took his name in vain
last time we used it.

444
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,834
When was that?

445
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:01,334
- When we had him back-stabbing
burrell at city hall, remember?

446
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,367
Do you want me to call
daniels at home?

447
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:05,367
Try him again?

448
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,667
We're past deadline, gus.

449
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,434
I'll cut the quote.

450
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,767
Alright.

451
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,133
Drink with me, jimmy.

452
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,267
This is what you wanted, man.

453
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,767
- Then why do I feel
like shit?

454
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,133
Postpartum depression, son.

455
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:39,167
It's the journey,
not the destination...

456
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:42,334
We got marlo stanfield.

457
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:43,567
What about the serial killer?

458
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,701
Marlo is he.

459
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:52,067
Daniels wanted me up there
at that press conference.

460
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,567
Up there with all the rest of
those preening motherfuckers,

461
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:58,200
congratulating themselves
on a job well done.

462
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:03,234
Part of the problem,
all of them.

463
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:07,133
Yet when the bracelets come out
and the dope is on the table...

464
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:08,501
- We've still got
the surveillance teams.

465
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,667
The districts still have guys
watching the homeless,

466
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:12,767
undercovers dressed
as homeless...

467
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:14,534
That shit'll end.

468
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,467
It always does.

469
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,367
Well...

470
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,100
If you ain't gonna
celebrate with me,

471
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,767
you're gonna at least
chauffeur my drunken ass home.

472
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:36,133
Shardene better be awake, too.

473
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,400
'cause I do believe
lester freamon's

474
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,667
in the mood for love...

475
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,701
- Yo, I'm tellin' you,
it was kenard.

476
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,334
To catch up with him.

477
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:48,834
Bullshit.

478
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:50,901
Omar got kilt by them
pimlico boys.

479
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,968
They ran up on him with three
a.k.s an' jus' blazed away.

480
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:02,667
What up, soldier?

481
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:03,667
- I don't know.
You tell me.

482
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:05,567
I mean, everybody locked up,
right?

483
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,567
I mean, damn...

484
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,033
Yeah. 'cause-a that shit,

485
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,634
i'm 'a need you for some
serious business tomorrow, man.

486
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,133
- Anyone I know?
- Big walter.

487
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:13,501
Big-nose big walter?

488
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,767
- Nah, skinny big walter,
the one be right there

489
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,634
in front of the
cut-rate on calhoun

490
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:18,634
and riggs all the time.

491
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:19,701
He witnessin'?

492
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:21,534
- Marlo say he need
to get got.

493
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,968
So it is, what it is.

494
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:26,100
You got a problem with that?

495
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
We straight.

496
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,767
No need to bring your iron.

497
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:31,334
I got a clean nine for you
with shaved numbers.

498
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:33,667
I'll pick you up tomorrow night.

499
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:34,701
You a-ight?

500
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,667
Yeah, yeah.

501
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:37,968
A-ight.

502
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,200
- And in the last five years,
the united states has

503
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,334
given fifteen billion dollars
to fight h.i.v. And aids

504
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,367
around the world.

505
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:56,734
But only part of it goes
to africa,

506
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,767
where there's a huge epidemic
of h.i.v. And aids.

507
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,367
I mean, ten percent of the
population of the world

508
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,834
lives in sub-saharan africa,
but seventy percent of

509
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:06,534
the new aids cases are there.

510
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,501
In ken,
one in seven people

511
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,701
have h.i.v. And aids,
and in zimbabwe,

512
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,267
one in four people have it,
according to the article in

513
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,234
the "new york human rights
law review."

514
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,234
Plus, the u.s. Surgeon
general has said that

515
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,334
there are twenty-two million
people with h.i.v. And aids

516
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:21,634
in those african countries.

517
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:24,267
In the next ten years,
more people will die from aids

518
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:27,133
in these countries than all the
wars in the twentieth century,

519
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,501
including world war two,
the deadliest war...

520
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,400
How's it feelin', bunny?

521
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:33,868
- I tell ya,
if I had that boy's

522
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,868
gift for talk,
i'd a really caused a stir.

523
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:36,934
Look at him go...

524
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:38,467
Don't sell yourself short.

525
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,334
He's got your way of makin'
an argument.

526
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:44,767
Lucky for him, though,
he looks like his stepmama.

527
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:46,334
- And aids in africa
said u.s. Money

528
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:50,167
can make a huge difference
in africa where even very small

529
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:51,968
amounts can go a long way.

530
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,067
There seems to be an agreement
that the money should be spent

531
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,534
in two ways: medical treatment
and for education and

532
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,901
prevention.

533
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,634
However, there is not an
agreement on how much money

534
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,934
will be needed and what
programs...

535
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,667
When do we bounce?

536
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm working on bail reviews.

537
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,667
Cheese maybe...

538
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,968
On a high surety bond,
if he wants to put up

539
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,467
his mama's house.
Monk, the same.

540
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:15,801
But with the murder warrant,
there is no bail for chris,

541
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:19,200
and most likely,
there's no bail for you,

542
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:21,367
as the charging papers portray
you at the top

543
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,634
of the conspiracy.

544
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,334
- How can they say that when I
ain't go near no drugs at all?

545
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:26,834
- The full affidavit says
they developed

546
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:28,133
a source of information...

547
00:28:28,234 --> 00:28:29,367
Bullshit.

548
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,067
- A source of information
who told them that

549
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,067
you communicated with
each other

550
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,968
using photographic transmissions
on cellphones.

551
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,367
Coded transmissions.

552
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,133
- Ain't nobody know
about the code 'cept me,

553
00:28:40,234 --> 00:28:44,067
chris, monk an' cheese...

554
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,801
An' we all locked
up behind this.

555
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,167
No one else even have a phone.
Not even snoop.

556
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:49,734
No one 'cept the supply.

557
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,234
You trust the supplier?

558
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,968
Well, someone knew
and someone told.

559
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,467
And now they've got
your cellphones,

560
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,968
and they're going for
a title three.

561
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,167
- So they was on our
cell phones then...

562
00:28:58,267 --> 00:29:00,300
- No, the affidavit says
the source told them

563
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,467
the date of your re-supply,
that they followed monk

564
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,067
and others to the warehouse,
followed him out,

565
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,701
and found the drugs.

566
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,300
They're going to get
their title three

567
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
and they're saying that by
examining monk's phone,

568
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:11,968
your phone, and the others,

569
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:13,133
they're going to prove
the conspiracy.

570
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:14,567
You see?

571
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,400
They weren't on a wiretap,
but now they're using

572
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:18,767
the phones and photographs
to link you all together.

573
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:21,400
So who knew that there
was a re-supply?

574
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:23,968
Who knew what you all were
up to yesterday?

575
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,033
Snoop.

576
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,567
D you trust her.

577
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,868
Who else?

578
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,634
- Known sex offenders,
southern district.

579
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:34,634
Three possibles.

580
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,634
- You want us to sit
on them?

581
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,133
A day or two. Yeah.

582
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,234
If nothing shows,
then we'll move on...

583
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:39,567
Okay.

584
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,968
Dead and homeless.

585
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,667
Jack street in brooklyn.
Christeson's down there.

586
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,667
Strangle?

587
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:48,667
- Sounds like a beating,
actually.

588
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:49,968
- Red-ribbon tied
around the wrist?

589
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,667
- Actually, it was more of
a burnt sienna and it

590
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:52,968
was lashed around his dick.

591
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,567
Fuck do I know?
Get down there.

592
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,901
- Jay, this doesn't
sound like...

593
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,934
Waste of your time, huh?

594
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:09,133
- That what you have seen
here today is indicative

595
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:11,701
of the progress that city
schools are making under

596
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:13,234
this current administration.

597
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,434
Now I know the governor has
had some harsh things to

598
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:18,567
say about baltimore schools,
but I find that to be cynical

599
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:19,834
and disappointing.

600
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:22,234
The fifteen-point jump in
third-grade test scores

601
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:23,968
is a trend that
can't be ignored.

602
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:26,634
- But we've seen third grade
scores rise before, Mr. Mayor.

603
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:29,767
And it doesn't seem as if any
gains in that grade can be

604
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:32,968
sustained into fifth and
seventh-grade scores.

605
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,868
- Kathy, you know,
we are committed to

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,834
substantive change in baltimore.

607
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:41,300
The kids that you saw today in
this citywide debate...

608
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,667
They are achieving at
a high school level and

609
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:47,667
disproving any negative
stereotypes about the city

610
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:48,801
school system.

611
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:52,300
Could you excuse me for
a moment, please?

612
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:53,834
Major colvin.

613
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,434
Just colvin.

614
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:01,267
- You know,
I always wanted to say

615
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:04,100
how sorry I am
how things turned out.

616
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,100
There wasn't anything that
I could have done

617
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:07,901
with your experiment
in the western district.

618
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,067
There wasn't anything
that anyone could have

619
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,200
done with that.

620
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:26,567
- Yeah, well, I guess,
mr. Mayor, um...

621
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,534
There's nothing to be done.

622
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:48,067
- Mr. C, you know
the mayor, too? Dag.

623
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,434
- I can't even believe
i'm talking to you, gus.

624
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,634
After that shit you pulled.

625
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:58,133
See that's how you all do.

626
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,033
Slam somebody an' then
come back the next day

627
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,000
like it never happened.

628
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,334
It's jus' bidness, nerese.

629
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:07,901
It was your turn to read
about yourself.

630
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,934
Now, if carcetti's governor
and you become mayor...

631
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,734
Is bond gonna run against ya?
Or is he done?

632
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,067
What do you think?

633
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,067
- After the clay
davis farce...

634
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:20,167
He smells like he's done to me.

635
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,100
There's rumor that keiffer
want the job, too.

636
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,834
- I'll deal with that
as it comes.

637
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,167
- What about this
daniels fella?

638
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:30,901
You think he's ready
to run the copshop?

639
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,534
It's kinda ugly the way
he kept puttin' a knife

640
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:33,934
to burrell like that.
I mean...

641
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,200
- You know I read that and
wondered where the hell

642
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,334
you people got it from.

643
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:37,868
What do you mean?

644
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:40,334
- I was behind burrell
until the moment I wasn't.

645
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:41,901
And if he had someone
backstabbing him

646
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,167
at city hall...

647
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,367
I'd've heard about it.

648
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:48,300
Daniels wasn't even
on my radar.

649
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,567
- Daniels didn't
undercut burrell?

650
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,534
- Shit, at the end,
after his name was floated,

651
00:32:51,634 --> 00:33:00,100
daniels went around saying
he didn't want the job.

652
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:01,934
Talk about it.

653
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,167
- Well, he's been beat
pretty good,

654
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,801
but I've got neck bruising too,
so it could be

655
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:09,667
an attempted strangle.

656
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,834
- No ribbon?
- Nope.

657
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:18,100
- Bite marks?
- Not that I can see.

658
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,000
This fuckin' guy stinks.

659
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,300
He probably evacuated.

660
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,234
- What?
He left and he came back?

661
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,968
No, he shit himself.

662
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,133
It's not my guy.
Sorry, rook.

663
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:31,567
He's all yours.

664
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,167
- And does the governor
think that's a problem,

665
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,968
that it's something that
needs to be addressed?

666
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:38,701
Hold on a sec...

667
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,167
- You got the military records
back from the marine corps?

668
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:44,934
- Three weeks at least,
they said.

669
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:46,400
Sorry about that.

670
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,701
- Hey steven,
I gotta little problem.

671
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:52,567
- Well, it's common
in men your age.

672
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,868
- I need to get into
walter reed.

673
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,901
I gotta talk to
a vet down there.

674
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,501
The fella that was with
our homeless vet

675
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,734
when he saw that firefight.

676
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:03,367
The one templeton was
writing about.

677
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,534
- Why do we want to
go back on that?

678
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:06,033
- I just want to talk
to a guy.

679
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:07,901
Homeless fella gave me the name
said he's in-patient down there.

680
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:11,167
- Afr the "post" series
blew up walter reed's shit?

681
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,501
If you tell them you're
a journalist,

682
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:14,501
you're dead to them.

683
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:15,501
Yeah, I know.

684
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:16,934
You know somebody
down there, right?

685
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:18,133
Not at the hospital.

686
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:19,167
A neighbor of mine
is with a-w-two.

687
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,234
What?

688
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,434
- The army's wounded
warrior program.

689
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:23,434
She could get you in,
if you're not actually

690
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:24,434
writing a piece.

691
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:25,434
I'm not.

692
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,968
What are you doing, gus?

693
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,100
Scratching an itch.

694
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,667
- I do Miss the
shift-change parties.

695
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,100
No you don't.

696
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,834
You never missed a
fucking one of them.

697
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,334
- That was one sweet bust you
people put on marlo stanfield.

698
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:40,601
My number right?

699
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:42,367
I mean, it definitely
smells like a lester

700
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,634
freamon wiretap.

701
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,934
I watched the news,
all that dope on the table.

702
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,901
I swear, carv,
I was fully erect.

703
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,767
- Your dick got hard?
How could you tell?

704
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:52,367
- 'Cause the head was
poppin' out of the back

705
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:53,734
of your neck.

706
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:56,667
Seriously, it was a
wiretap, right?

707
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:59,367
- Seriously, I couldn't fuckin'
tell you if I knew, herc.

708
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,300
- So what're you saying?
My phone number wasn't shit?

709
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,501
- Ah, what do you want me
to fuckin' say, herc?

710
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,801
You're the tits.

711
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,467
Without your little
contribution,

712
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:09,934
the whole fucking city
slips into the chesapeake bay.

713
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:11,601
Better?

714
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:14,200
So you grew up there?

715
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,367
Well, when did your family
move to baltimore?

716
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,167
- Reginald.
You down there?

717
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,234
yes.

718
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,567
Come to the steps.

719
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:28,200
Got a coupla things for you.

720
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,067
Soap, deodorant and the like.

721
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,834
- 'Preciate that.
Usin' the washer basin

722
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,067
to clean up.

723
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,834
And to pee in.

724
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,667
- Don't worry,
I rinse it out.

725
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,000
I was wonderin'...

726
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,434
I got this anniversary comin up,
at the meetin' place.

727
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:43,334
Sometimes kin folk
come along

728
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,801
to show support.

729
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:47,000
I was wonderin',
maybe you could...

730
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,534
- It's hard for me to make
plans with my schedule

731
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:50,133
at the hospital.

732
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,534
- We got a little
celebration after.

733
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,300
Thinkin' I could cook us
some dinner.

734
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,534
I mean wouldn't be
a fancy thing,

735
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,634
mac and cheese, like that,
but I guarantee it'll

736
00:35:58,767 --> 00:35:59,701
be good to you.

737
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,100
We'll see.

738
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,100
Okay.

739
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,467
My sister.

740
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:14,100
She good people.

741
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Been through a lot though,
you know?

742
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,133
Levy.

743
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:25,200
'scuse me?

744
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,033
Levy. The lawyer.

745
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,000
I know who he is.

746
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:30,667
I'm not looking for
any lawyers.

747
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,167
I'm following the money.

748
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,467
Follow the lawyers.

749
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,000
Levy, bronfman,

750
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:36,868
silverstein, cray...

751
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:39,334
All those guys who take
the high-end drug work.

752
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:41,701
They don't just make money
off the criminal fees.

753
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,367
- How's he...
- The lawyers?

754
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,801
They the ones who make
a path for all this

755
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:46,300
street-corner money.

756
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,267
They showin' all these
kingpin motherfuckers

757
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,634
how to sd it overseas,
bring it back,

758
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,234
invest the shit.

759
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,934
They the ones who
these ignorant ghetto

760
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,434
motherfuckers always
listen to when

761
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:56,934
it comes to cash money.

762
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:59,267
And levy, man,
he got the most grease.

763
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,067
- So levy routes
it through who?

764
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:05,200
- Anyone who got a project
or a game in need of cash.

765
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,033
Developers, people lookin'
to capitalize,

766
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,100
elected folk like myself.

767
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,133
Shit, there's a lotta people
out here need a dollar

768
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,367
now an' then...

769
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,767
- And the lawyers
take their cut.

770
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,667
- On both ends,
though I got to say,

771
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:20,234
he gonna let you rob one
of his clients only so much.

772
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:22,534
I mean once you get
a barksdale or

773
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:23,834
a joe stewart on the hook,

774
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:25,701
you want to go deep
on they ass.

775
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:29,000
Levy'll let you get a taste,
but he won't let you run wild.

776
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,767
'cause once you get past these
motherfuckin' lawyers,

777
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:32,934
yocan really play the pimp.

778
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:35,400
This one time,
I had this fella named bell

779
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:37,901
hooked up on this howard
street condo thing,

780
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,501
got him so that he
wasn't runnin' his shit

781
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:40,667
past the lawyer...

782
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:44,667
Boy, I tell u,
we bled that mother fucker...

783
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:47,033
Lawyers, huh?

784
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:49,534
- Oh, most definitely,
detective.

785
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,767
me?

786
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,934
Shit, I'm just small potatoes.

787
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:56,133
Just a workin' politician
from walbrook junction,

788
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,067
tryin' to make his way
from this world into the next.

789
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,968
- What else can you
give me on levy?

790
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,367
- Nothin' other than
what I have.

791
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:10,934
I ain't up in his
business or nuthin'.

792
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,200
I just takin' what he throws.

793
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Bullshit.

794
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,434
You got something
solid or I'm on my way

795
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:16,701
to the u.s. Attorney.

796
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:20,734
- You ain't nuthin'
but a shakedown artist.

797
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,767
How's this...

798
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:30,467
Levy got someoneat the courthous

799
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:31,801
oh, hell yeah.

800
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:33,901
Levy been buyin'
papers now for years

801
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,868
and sellin' 'em to
whoever needs an early look.

802
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:40,100
And don't think there ain't
no real money in that.

803
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:41,534
A prosecutor?

804
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,267
- I don't have a name.
Truly I don't,

805
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,534
but it seems to me,
you start lookin' at

806
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:47,567
the people hangin'
around the grand jury,

807
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,267
you'll find I'm right.

808
00:38:50,968 --> 00:39:00,501
Now I know I've said
enough to buy my case back.

809
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:13,067
You know, you could
buy a round, too.

810
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:25,534
You know, you could
buy a round, too.

811
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:27,300
I get you?

812
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,334
Nah, feels good, hubert.

813
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:36,467
You dig in there,
you got a mind to.

814
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,400
You admiring my hand, si

815
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,200
oh, call me gus.

816
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:44,467
- It's hard to
get out the habit.

817
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:45,834
- That's pretty
damn lifelike.

818
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:47,467
Yeah.

819
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,667
Prosthetic digits.
Five of 'em,

820
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:50,968
individually controlled.

821
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:52,934
I got my key grip...

822
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,934
And my power grip...

823
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,534
My precision grip...

824
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,701
And my index point.

825
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,000
These new models got a
thumb that rotates,

826
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,701
which makes
all the difference.

827
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:13,767
Used to be you just had
this one grip,

828
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,300
right here for everything.

829
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:19,501
- You got your...
- Not yet.

830
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:23,801
- Brave new world.
- Yeah.

831
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,267
Do you mind if I...?

832
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:33,934
- The a-w-two lady says
you weren't writin' no story.

833
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:37,334
- No, I'm just verifying
details of one we already

834
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:38,434
printed in my newspaper.

835
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:39,534
Profile of your buddy.

836
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:42,734
- Terry.
- Hmm-hmm.

837
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:45,601
- Yeah, he come down
visit me every coupla weeks.

838
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,300
He takes that peter pan bus
down from baltimore.

839
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,100
Walks a couple of miles
down georgia avenue

840
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:53,634
from the silver
spring terminal.

841
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,000
He's having some
trouble as you know.

842
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,701
Did you read the article?

843
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,033
Yeah.

844
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,634
Man who wrote it got
some stuff right.

845
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:08,801
Terry was pissed,
I tried to play it off,

846
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,934
make him good with it.

847
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:13,000
- What did the story
get wrong?

848
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,601
- Well, that day wadn't
no black hawk down thing.

849
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,601
You know, when shit
went bad...

850
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,501
After I lost my hands,

851
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:21,934
them habudabi
motherfuckers weren't

852
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,634
even around after
the shit went off.

853
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,567
That's how they do.

854
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,934
How you doin', marino?

855
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:29,634
Outstanding.

856
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:31,868
Let me ask you this.

857
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Could terry have exaggerated?

858
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:38,334
Why not?
If he got wound up say...

859
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:39,767
nah.

860
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:42,868
You lie about combat
because you weren't there.

861
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,400
And terry was.
Two tours.

862
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:47,334
He's got stories
if he wants 'em.

863
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:50,267
Just not on that day.

864
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,100
He ain't lie,
y'all did,

865
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,734
sorry t'say.

866
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,267
- Kima, what the fuck
are you taking about?

867
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:11,434
- I'm sayin' you made a
mistake letting mcnulty

868
00:42:11,534 --> 00:42:14,100
run your people from one case
to the other like you did.

869
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:15,200
Why? What's the big deal?

870
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,234
- Their run sheets,
office reports.

871
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,567
Mcnulty covered them, right?

872
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:21,167
- So fuckin' what?
They did police work.

873
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:23,300
They did good fuckin'
police work, in fact.

874
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,767
Your guys...

875
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:31,734
You coach 'em good, ellis.

876
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:33,234
You let them know when
i.i.d. Comes callin'

877
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:34,834
that their answer is
that they didn't know

878
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,801
anything about it,
that they did what

879
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:39,300
they were told and they
turned in clean run sheets,

880
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:40,901
and they don't know
what anyone else sent

881
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,200
upstairs for staff review.

882
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,767
Know about what?

883
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,167
- When you spoke up
on colicchio...

884
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,133
How did that feel?
- Like shit.

885
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:56,133
You okay with it?

886
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:57,367
It was a forced move.

887
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:58,868
Tony lost it.
He was around the bend.

888
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,133
But are you okay with it?

889
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:09,868
Ninety-two q jams.

890
00:43:09,968 --> 00:43:12,434
The most hip-hop and r & b.
It's your girl neke here...

891
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:13,934
We got our peoples
in the street.

892
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:16,200
They big, they fat,
and they gorgeous.

893
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,501
What up, porkchop?

894
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:19,567
- What's up, neke,
it's your boy porkchop...

895
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:20,901
We just gonna sit,

896
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,334
I should cut it.
With what they be chargin'

897
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:27,100
at the pump,
don't make sense to idle.

898
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:28,167
You can go.

899
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:29,868
Where to?

900
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,501
- Sayin' you can leave
the car with me.

901
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,868
You rent by the night, right?

902
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:40,968
- I ain't seen no
medium of exchange.

903
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:44,267
Look, when you done,
leave my short on the street

904
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,367
where I pick you up at.

905
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:47,200
Hmm-hmm.

906
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:05,434
- Oh, my god.
Look at this.

907
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:07,934
Bubs.

908
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:09,367
Walon, man...

909
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:11,133
This here's
my boy fletcher.

910
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:12,601
Newspaper writer
been followin' me 'round.

911
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:14,501
- Well, you're welcome
to sit in.

912
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:16,901
But I have to ask that
you respect the privacy.

913
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,667
No notetaking,
no recorders,

914
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,000
what you hear today
stays in the room.

915
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,033
- Not a problem.
I'm just here with reginald.

916
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:26,667
Reginald?

917
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,434
Reginald?

918
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:29,901
- I'm his fuckin' sponsor
and I don't believe

919
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,167
I ever got a christian
name out of him.

920
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,267
Reginald.
Hot shit.

921
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:34,567
See what you done?

922
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:35,801
What, man?

923
00:44:35,868 --> 00:44:37,100
Come on.

924
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:42,400
My name is...

925
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:47,000
My name is...

926
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,300
Reginald.

927
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,434
Round the way
they call me bubbles.

928
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:52,133
Hey, bubbles.

929
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,734
I'm a drug addict.

930
00:44:55,868 --> 00:44:57,467
Celebratin' my anniversary.

931
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,133
My people couldn't
make it here tonight.

932
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:16,167
I left a trail
of fire behind me.

933
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:18,601
Time gonna make it right
with them, I guess.

934
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:19,734
That's right, it will.

935
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:21,968
- Same thing get me
right with myself.

936
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:24,834
Couple a days ago,

937
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,634
I took a walk down
in druid hill park,

938
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:28,400
right wh the sun
was goin' down.

939
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,133
You know how that
time be like,

940
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:32,934
with the sun throwin'
shadows an' all.

941
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:35,367
Got me thinkin'
'bout when I was a young man,

942
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:37,267
sittin' in that park.

943
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,634
You know, watchin' the girls,
smokin' on a little herb,

944
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:42,200
drinkin' a cold beer.

945
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,567
You know where this is goin'.

946
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:49,334
I had this moment where,
you know,

947
00:45:49,434 --> 00:45:52,234
I was wantin' to
feel that way again.

948
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:53,367
I remembered,
what y'all said,

949
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,601
if the urge was to come,

950
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:56,868
call a group member
up and talk.

951
00:45:56,968 --> 00:46:00,033
First thing I called walon up,
him bein' my sponsor an' all,

952
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:03,100
turns out he's on a ride
with his motorcycle club.

953
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:08,467
So I pulled out that sheet
that got passed out...

954
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:11,868
Dialed a few numbers,
couldn't get an answer.

955
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:14,667
I left a coupla messages,
but nobody called me back.

956
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,234
You didn't call me.

957
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:18,734
'cause I would have got up
with you, reginald.

958
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:20,467
You can believe that.

959
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:26,968
Well, anyway...

960
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:30,267
I didn't get high.

961
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:37,634
See, I knew if I did
I wouldn't get that

962
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:39,334
good feelin' back that
I was daydreamin on.

963
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:41,501
- That's right.
That's right.

964
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:43,767
- It got me thinkin'
about a friend of mine...

965
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:49,167
Boy named sherrod.

966
00:46:50,901 --> 00:46:55,767
I been carryin' his passin'
for a long while.

967
00:46:55,934 --> 00:46:57,601
Like that memory I had
about those summer days

968
00:46:57,701 --> 00:46:59,534
in the park.

969
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:02,734
Thinkin' on that make me smile.

970
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:09,968
With sherrod,
it's more of a hurt.

971
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:21,000
But not as...
Not so bad like it was.

972
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,567
Ain't no shame in holdin'
on to grief.

973
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,968
As long as you make room
for other things, too.

974
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:35,400
It's alright.

975
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:40,501
So thank you for listening.

976
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:44,434
Thank you for
lettin' me share.

977
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:45,501
Thanks for sharing.

978
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:11,968
Where my gun?

979
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:20,200
- In the trap.
You get it when we set up.

980
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,234
- A detective is here
to see you.

981
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:26,868
Greggs, I think she said.

982
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:36,934
What? What's the matter?

983
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:46,200
- How you all even know
if Walter behind everybody

984
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:48,434
gettin' jacked?

985
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:51,367
I mean, ain't you
all ever wonder

986
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:53,000
if he even deserve
any of this shit?

987
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,200
- Deserve got nuthin'
to do with it.

988
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,934
It's his time that's all.

989
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,234
- Yo, pull over in that
alley right there.

990
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:09,734
I gotta piss sumpin' fierce.

991
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,200
- You better piss in that
cup right there on the floor.

992
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,300
- Man, I'm gonna
need ten cups.

993
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,100
Yo, pull over, Snoop.

994
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:34,067
- What now, motherfucker?
You shy?

995
00:49:34,267 --> 00:49:38,033
Smart nigga.
You always was.

996
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:39,267
How you know?

997
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:42,534
- Y'all taught me.
Get there early.

998
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:45,400
Why? What I do wrong?

999
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:48,200
- Chris locked up behind
somethin' he done for you.

1000
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,901
You downtown with the police.

1001
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I ain't say a word.

1002
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,400
Yeah, that's what you say.

1003
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:53,901
But it's how
you carry yourself.

1004
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,501
Always apart.

1005
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,767
Always askin' "why"
when you should be doin'

1006
00:49:57,868 --> 00:49:59,267
what you told.

1007
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:04,567
You was never one of us.
You never could be.

1008
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:15,734
How my hair look, Mike?

1009
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,300
You look good, girl.

1010
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:45,100
- They're sayin' the
only o.t. That anyone

1011
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,000
has been sing has been
through getting

1012
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,868
detailed on the
homeless killings.

1013
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:49,868
They say that's the case.

1014
00:50:49,968 --> 00:50:51,234
And no wiretaps up?

1015
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:52,501
I asked about that.

1016
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:54,000
And I'm hearing,
off-the-record kinda,

1017
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,667
that it was a wire.

1018
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:57,567
And it makes sense,
'cause that's how Lester works.

1019
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,834
He gets hold of a number
and works it to death.

1020
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:01,567
Ere he would get the
number I have no idea...

1021
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:03,601
- But a wiretap is hours,
and you say no one

1022
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:05,067
is making any money...

1023
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:06,667
- Fuckin' department's
more fucked up than even

1024
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:07,934
I remember it.

1025
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,501
Where you been at, Mike?

1026
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:16,067
You gotta see this.
There's a serial killer,

1027
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:18,834
but he only be killin'
other serial killers...

1028
00:51:18,968 --> 00:51:20,000
- Yo, yo.
We about take a ride.

1029
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,267
You ain't got no whip.

1030
00:51:21,367 --> 00:51:22,501
- Just gather your stuff,
both of y'all.

1031
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:24,200
Come on, we gotta move quick.

1032
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:27,934
Come on. Let's go!

1033
00:51:28,033 --> 00:51:29,200
Okay.

1034
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:32,267
- But that means...
All the calls to

1035
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:33,300
the newspaper.

1036
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,968
The photographs
of the missing man.

1037
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:38,267
We have a wiretap...
McNulty has a...

1038
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,167
On a cellphone.

1039
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,634
Jesus Christ.

1040
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,467
He wouldn't dare.

1041
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:46,701
What's the number?

1042
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,334
It's on the paperwork...

1043
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:01,100
Come on.

1044
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,234
Where...

1045
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,367
Evidence control.

1046
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:36,734
- I always thought you
were bullshittin'

1047
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:38,901
'bout havin'
an aunt out here.

1048
00:52:38,968 --> 00:52:40,634
She expectin' him.

1049
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:45,033
An' what's in this box.

1050
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:55,100
It's nice here, huh?

1051
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:02,300
Let's go, bug.

Tell her there's more behind
it when she finds the need.

Y'know, I took a beatdown
