1
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,367
Gotta be somewhere.
You wanna keep goin'?

2
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:05,134
Officer Smith, ma'am.

3
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,800
We're looking for a man
went after a woman last night

4
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,167
at esplanda apartments,
the ones right behind you.

5
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:14,700
Heard anything unusual?
- No, sorry.

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,700
Oh my God,
that's terrible.

7
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,134
Is the woman alright?
- Huh?

8
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,434
- The woman,
is she alright?

9
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:20,334
Yeah. Yeah, she good.

10
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,668
- Excuse me, my brother,
Omar little,

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,201
came here last night.
He fell out the damn window.

12
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:32,833
- We don't have
anyone by that name.

13
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,634
- He was kinda,
ya know, high.

14
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,934
Probably messed up his name.

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,534
Real dark,
got himself a scar.

16
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:40,267
Legs should
be busted up real bad.

17
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,800
- No one with that type
of injury came in last night.

18
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,201
- Not a goddamn thing. Been
in every trashcan, dumpster,

19
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,534
vacant for three blocks
'round. Nothin'.

20
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:58,267
We even checked
down the sewers.

21
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,867
Marlo wanna meet.

22
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,568
- So what you
want us to do?

23
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:19,934
Which one?

24
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,867
Don't seem possible.

25
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,034
It don't.

26
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:39,401
- That some
Spiderman shit there.

27
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:41,134
We missed our shot.

28
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,934
Now he gonna be at us.

29
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,401
- Usually, my staff
tries to keep sharp objects

30
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,134
out of my hands.

31
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,501
You know, it all
started with Charles center and

32
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:51,800
Tommy d'alesandro and
it continued with William Donald

33
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:54,867
schaefer and harborplace.
And following that,

34
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:58,501
there were mayors schmoke and
o'malley with inner harbor east.

35
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,867
Well, today it is my
administration's turn to

36
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,867
lay claim to the middle
branch of the patapsco and

37
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,700
what will soon become
known as new westport,

38
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:08,134
revitalizing another
waterfront area of

39
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,334
our great city.
Thank you.

40
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:17,668
- Say g'bye to locust
point south.

41
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,234
Fuck you, Krawczyk.

42
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:22,634
Yeah, fuck you,
greedhead motherfucker.

43
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,167
Fuck you for tearing down
the port of Baltimore and

44
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:27,800
selling it to some yuppie
assholes from washington.

45
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,167
- C'mon buddy.
- This is bullshit.

46
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,000
Who the hell's that?

47
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:37,501
- Oh that's nobody,
Mr. Mayor. It's nobody at all.

48
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:20,134
- Ya happy now, bitch?
- I am content, yes.

49
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:23,501
- You called the
reporter, huh? - no, actually.

50
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:26,767
That asshole's making up
his own shit.

51
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:30,201
Brass called a press
conference for this afternoon.

52
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,900
They're gonna be shoveling
so much money at

53
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,167
my bullshit it'll make
your head spin.

54
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,000
- What's with all the casework?
- Bodies from the vacants.

55
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,967
- And some of them have
been worked pretty good.

56
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,634
You know what, Jimmy?

57
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,067
I'm gonna go
back to the beginning and work

58
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,967
every one of them again.
Back to square one.

59
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,634
You know why?
Because I'm a murder police.

60
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,800
I work murders.
I don't fuck with

61
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,034
no make-believe,
I don't jerk shit around.

62
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,534
I catch a murder
and I work it.

63
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,401
Working this shit
like I'm supposed to.

64
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:04,800
- Well, lemme know
if you need anything, alright?

65
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,634
Cars, some o.t.,
some lab work...

66
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,267
Anything you need.

67
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,634
Because in... Three or
four hours the money's

68
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,201
gonna flow on my case.
Whatever you need, Bunk,

69
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,201
I'm probably
gonna have more of

70
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:22,700
it than
even Lester could use.

71
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,067
- To be that
close to a serial killer.

72
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,634
It must be weird.

73
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,467
Kinda. Yeah.

74
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:30,334
Wonderful story, Scott.

75
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,634
- Yeah, well, it kinda
wrote itself.

76
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:33,900
I mean, it's a lucky thing
to have the guy call m

77
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,700
like he did...
- Well it comes

78
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,167
from you pounding the
pavement, right?

79
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,467
That's more than luck.
That's putting yourself in

80
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,034
the place where the story
comes to you.

81
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:41,934
What do you have for tomorrow?
- For tomorrow?

82
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:46,201
- This is not the kind of thing
we let go of after a day or two.

83
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,867
- I, um, you know,
I was thinking that if I spent

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,668
a night with the homeless,
you know.

85
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,301
Did what they did. Saw what
they saw. That kind of thing.

86
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,900
I mean, if it's
an overnight thing,

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,634
I couldn't get it for tomorrow,
but the next day, sure...

88
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,000
That's great.

89
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,668
That could be the perfect
follow. I'll speak to Gus.

90
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,100
- Also, Scott,
we've been taking calls

91
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,134
from some of the national
networks and cable outlets.

92
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:06,401
They're looking
for you to go on-camera.

93
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,568
- Me? On television?
- I'd avoid the locals,

94
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,467
but if you can do the nationalstuff in a

95
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,067
- sure, yeah. I mean I'm
just not all that comfortable

96
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:17,067
having myself in the
center of the story like this.

97
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,601
- Of course not. But there is
a way of handling

98
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,867
this responsibly, I think.

99
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,434
Just remember you're an
ambassador for the paper.

100
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,134
Star time.

101
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,067
Yeah.

102
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:31,601
How 'bout that?

103
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,867
- Homelessness.
- Our coverage should reflect

104
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,401
the diensian aspect
of the homeless.

105
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:37,668
The human element.

106
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,334
Scott will lead it off,
spending a night on the streets

107
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:42,100
and
writing from that perspective.

108
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:44,134
- Scott? He's the
lead on your education project.

109
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:45,668
I think we need
to get him back on the...

110
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,334
- I don't see the...
The school project as yielding

111
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,167
the same kind of
impact as our attention

112
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,000
to homelessness can.

113
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,800
These murders, the phone
call to our reporter.

114
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,067
It really opens up the
issue, don't you think?

115
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,000
- Yeah, but...
- From now til the end of the year,

116
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,700
let's focus not only
on covering the murders,

117
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,767
but on the... The nature
of homelessness itself.

118
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,601
- The dickensian
aspect of it. Yeah.

119
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,601
- I've reached
a point, detective Sydnor,

120
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,367
where I no longer have
the time or patience left

121
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,833
to address myself to the
needs of the system

122
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,534
within which we work.

123
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:28,067
I'm tired.
- You're gonna quit?

124
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,800
Not yet. Not just yet.

125
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,634
- So what are you
talking about?

126
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,634
- When they took us
off Marlo this last time,

127
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,733
when they
said they couldn't

128
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,034
pay for
further investigation...

129
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,833
I regarded that decision
as illegitimate.

130
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,634
- Illegitimate?
- And so...

131
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,167
I'm responding in kind.
I'm going to press a case

132
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:50,100
against Marlo Stanfield without
regard to the usual rules.

133
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,833
I'm running an illegal wiretap
on Marlo Stanfield's cellphone.

134
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:07,934
Fuck, Lester.

135
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,501
- If you have a problem
with this,

136
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,767
I understand completely

137
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,100
and urge you
to get as far fucking

138
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:15,833
away from me as you can.

139
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,201
- You remember
this one here?

140
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,867
Backed away from jackin'
the boy up

141
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:47,401
outta respect for that goofy
motherfucker pryzbylewski.

142
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,767
Wonder what the young man might
tell me a year later, though...

143
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,234
Bunk.

144
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:54,967
- What the fuck is this?
- Vernon here did a search

145
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:56,668
warrant on
his dead guy's appliance store,

146
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,601
pulled all of that
out of the desk drawer.

147
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,534
- Grand jury shit?
- Transcris,

148
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,334
sealed indictments...
- Who's your murder?

149
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,900
- Eastside dealer by
the name of Joe Stewart.

150
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,634
Caught one in the back of
his head the other night.

151
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,634
- Somebody finally
touched prop Joe, huh?

152
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,167
Hmm-hmm.||

153
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,800
- you remember when narcotics
indicted Charlie burman last year?

154
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,234
Motherfucker ran a couple
days before the raids,

155
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,267
still on the wing.

156
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,267
- The sealed indictments
are all in there.

157
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,067
Every one of 'em.

158
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,167
- Who don't we trust
at the courthouse?

159
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:26,601
They put cheese on them fries?

160
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,134
They can. Chili too.

161
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,167
- Alright then.
- You want a drink with that?

162
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,800
- Strawberry lemonade.
- Alright, I'm on it.

163
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,733
- They're back on cellphones.
After more than a year?

164
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,733
That they are.

165
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,568
- Tell me they're
talking in code, Lester.

166
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,634
I wanna go to jail
for snatchin' something better

167
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
than Marlo Stanfield's
fucking lunch order.

168
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,967
- There's no code that
I can tell.

169
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,267
I've got a half dozen calls,

170
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:49,833
all routine. No drug talk,
no numbers, no times...

171
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,534
Nothing but what they seem.

172
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,467
- So he ain't doing
business with the phone then.

173
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:55,833
So take this mess down.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

174
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,733
I also have five calls,

175
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,467
thirty to forty
seconds duration,

176
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:01,800
each one picked up
on the first ring,

177
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,100
each one with
nothing whatsoever

178
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:08,034
said between parties.
You see? When they talk,

179
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,267
it's bullshit.

180
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:12,134
But there are calls where
no one says a thing.

181
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,034
Thirty seconds,
without conversation.

182
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:21,767
Is he...

183
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:24,467
We talked it through,

184
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:25,568
he knows the risks.

185
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,668
- I'm in.
If it makes the fucking case,

186
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm in all the way.

187
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,034
So, what's up now?

188
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,100
They talking dirt?

189
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,100
no.

190
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,201
Lester. Fuck.

191
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,201
Marlo's not gonna
talk dirt on the phone,

192
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,201
but there's
something to this.

193
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,668
I just haven't
figured it out.

194
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,434
We could use some more manpower.

195
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:44,700
We need a couple of
surveillance teams

196
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,967
to get on these guys to see how
they using the phones.

197
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,934
- You see the
newspaper today?

198
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,601
Headline like that,
the bosses are gonna start

199
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,700
throwing money at
the homeless murders.

200
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,034
When they do, I'll peel
off a couple detectives,

201
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:59,334
throw them your way.

202
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,601
The homeless murders?

203
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:09,234
How does that case
tangle in with this?

204
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,967
Hard to explain.

205
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:18,401
- Remember what the d.n.c.
Folks told me two years ago?

206
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,534
What I needed to do to
take the statehouse?

207
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:23,067
- Build something downtown
and stick your name on it,

208
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,267
get the crime to go down,
and stay away from schools.

209
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,900
- And keep my
boyish good looks.

210
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,900
- One out of
four ain't bad.

211
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,034
Jesus.

212
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:33,267
Did we have to schedule
this the same

213
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,967
day as new westport?

214
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,134
My good news isn't even
going to make

215
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:37,601
the front of the local section.

216
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,800
- The ribbon-cutting
was scheduled two weeks ago.

217
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,767
This homeless thing
no one saw coming.

218
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,634
- First of all, I'm surprised
to see so much media here.

219
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:53,467
A press event
held earlier today

220
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:55,267
to announce the
revitalization of yet

221
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,800
another part of our city
was not so well attended.

222
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,201
It would appear that media
attention is always focusing

223
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,833
on the negatives
when it comes to Baltimore,

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
but you
guys aren't around

225
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,833
when we're making
real progress.

226
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,967
Nevertheless, I'm glad
to see so many of you here.

227
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,267
Some of you representing
not just our local mia,

228
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,367
but national attention
to this problem.

229
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,100
Thank you for caring
enough about

230
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:14,900
our most vulnerable
citizens to address

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
yourselves to this tragedy.

232
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,167
Our homeless citizens,
those who have fallen

233
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,267
through the
cracks of our society,

234
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,833
those who command the least
of our attentions and efforts,

235
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:28,267
they seemingly have little to
endear themselves to politicians.

236
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,733
They don't vote,
by and large.

237
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,634
They don't contribute
to campaigns.

238
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,467
They offer little
to a city's tax base,

239
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,568
and to the extent that our
government is made aware

240
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,934
of their existence, it responds
by trying to mitigate

241
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:40,301
the damage
done by their presence.

242
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:43,100
We open a food bank here,
a shelter there.

243
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,167
We try to move them away
from downtown,

244
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,034
away from our communal
areas, away from our schools,

245
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:49,467
away from our homes.

246
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:51,668
If you were to judge our
society by the manner

247
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,134
in which we treat
those lost on our streets,

248
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,767
we would have
cause to be shamed.

249
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,034
Well, I am, God forgive me,
a politician.

250
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,601
But I am also someone who
ran for public office because

251
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,134
I believe that there is a
different way of governing.

252
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:06,601
And I believe that
in the end we will be judged

253
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,234
not by the efforts
we make on behalf

254
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,501
of those who vote
for us,

255
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,967
or those who contribute
to our campaigns,

256
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:13,034
or those who provide
for our tax base.

257
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:15,034
I believe that we will be
judged by what we provide

258
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:16,867
to the weakest and
most vulnerable.

259
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:18,301
That is the test.

260
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:19,767
That is my test.

261
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:22,833
Somebody is killing
homeless men

262
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,833
in this city.

263
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,668
They are taking the lives
of fellow citizens

264
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,700
who do not have the means
or the strength

265
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,434
to properly protect themselves.

266
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:31,800
They will be stopped.

267
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,334
We will do everything in
our power to stop them.

268
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:35,800
You have my word on this.

269
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,234
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

270
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,700
What got into you?

271
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,700
What?

272
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,900
- ...I want to
assure the public

273
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,401
that we are doing
everything possible in our power

274
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,434
to apprehend this subject.

275
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,601
Homicide detectives are
working around the clock.

276
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,234
District officers are in
contact with the agencies

277
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,067
that work with the homeless.

278
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,067
I cannot go into specifics
of the investigation,

279
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,700
but with that caveat,
I will take questions.

280
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,201
- Commissioner,
is there any connection

281
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,201
between these murders and those
in the vacant homes last year?

282
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:09,267
No conneion.

283
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,900
Commissioner.

284
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,534
Are you asking the F.B.I.
To join in the investigation?

285
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,733
- I think deputy commissioner
Daniels is in a position

286
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,167
to elaborate on that.

287
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,267
- We'll take whatever help
is offered.

288
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,000
Certainly, our detectives
will work closely with

289
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,267
the behavioral analysis
unit at Quantico...

290
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:36,501
- Deputy, even with all
the resources at your disposal,

291
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:39,668
isn't it extremely difficult
to catch a serial killer?

292
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,267
- Our ability to
secure genetic material

293
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,467
and the growing
d.N.A. Data bank

294
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:46,100
are assets unavailable
to us even a few years a.

295
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,934
And our ability to
effectively use resources

296
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,733
has been increased with
the aid of sophisticated

297
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,301
computer software.

298
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:52,668
And, of course, we have
some of the best criminal

299
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,401
investigators in the nation
working 24/7.

300
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:58,100
As the mayor made very clear
a moment ago,

301
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,034
this is now a priority
for the department.

302
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,634
- Has a note been found
at any of the scenes?

303
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,301
- I'm not at liberty
to go into any details

304
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,833
of the investigation
at this time.

305
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:17,467
You want me to hang?

306
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,967
He told you who I am, right?

307
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,800
Son, the thing about murder

308
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,067
is it never goes
off the books.

309
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,700
I mean, we work
on 'em for weeks,

310
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,167
months, years.

311
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:49,534
We keep on with
it until finally

312
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,334
someone decides
they've had enough,

313
00:18:52,434 --> 00:18:54,601
until we get the right word

314
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,267
from the right person.

315
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,967
And you know what happens then?

316
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,800
When a case does go down...

317
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,434
All those people who kept
quiet about it,

318
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,100
who lied about it,

319
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:17,634
all of them who thought
it wasn't coming back on 'em,

320
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:21,634
they end up catchin' a charge.
And they get time behind that.

321
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,000
Time, huh?

322
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,733
You gonna give me time?

323
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:38,467
- If you know something
about that boy Lex getting shot,

324
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,534
now is your last
chance to speak to that.

325
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:43,800
You gave a statement
last year...

326
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,100
- Why don't you promise
to get me outta here?

327
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,201
That's what
y'all do, ain't it?

328
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:55,833
Lie to
dumbass niggers?

329
00:19:55,934 --> 00:20:03,867
Yo, y'all need to get this police
out my face before I bank his ass.

330
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:11,800
Yo, y'all need to get this police
out my face before I bank his ass.

331
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:13,467
You're a natural, kiddo.

332
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,267
You had them eating
out of your hand.

333
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,934
Shit, I was justfollowing the mayo

334
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,568
he wants a full-court
press, right?

335
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,234
- We can add a detective
or two.

336
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,334
And you can ask patrol toconcentrate

337
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:28,833
where vagrants congregate.

338
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,601
But other than that, deputy,
the cupboard is bare.

339
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,967
But Carcetti said...

340
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:32,967
Make no mistake.

341
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:35,833
He wants us
to solve the murders.

342
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,501
He just doesn't
want it to cost.

343
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,234
Don't look so shocked.

344
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,934
You're runnin' with
the big dogs now.

345
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,034
Isn't it enough that we're
up on the killer's cellphone?

346
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:48,401
I would think that you
could track him

347
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:49,867
on the g.p.s. Chip alone...

348
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:52,601
- He's using a burner and
we suspect he's taking

349
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,267
out the battery
between calls.

350
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,800
- And there's nothing to
stop him from changing phones,

351
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,867
calling the reporter from
a new number.

352
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,267
- So you want to tap
the reporter's phone as well.

353
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,700
- It stands to reason
that we should monitor

354
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,867
this thing from both ends.

355
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:06,900
It's what we would normally do.

356
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,867
Nothing about this is normal.

357
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,700
A Baltimore sun reporter's
phone is problematic.

358
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,800
We need to strike a
bance between your needs

359
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,867
as investigators and the
first amendment rights

360
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,668
of the sun and its sources.

361
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,301
- The first amendment does not
guarantee privacy, your honor.

362
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:23,167
Legal
precedent clearly indicates...

363
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:24,668
- Look, look, I'm
not saying that we can't, but...

364
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:25,934
But what?

365
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:30,800
Until we get the sense

366
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,434
that your suspect
is changing phones,

367
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm not inclined to look
with favor on tapping

368
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,700
the Baltimore
sun's telecommunications.

369
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,733
- We're afraid
to piss them off.

370
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,234
- Never pick a fight
with anyone who buys ink

371
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,067
by the barrel-full.

372
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,100
Christ.

373
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,334
Very well, judge.

374
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,267
How many enemies do you need?

375
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,100
Deputy.

376
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:22,367
Where did you get all this?

377
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,467
- Darling, you do not
want to know.

378
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:32,568
What's up with you?

379
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,867
- Got all twenty-two out of
the drawer, huh?

380
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:36,467
Workin' the whole mess at once.

381
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:37,833
I'm tryi to see 'em fresh.

382
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:41,301
- Twenty-five.
My triple.

383
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,234
It comes back to
Marlo and his people.

384
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:44,501
For sure?

385
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:46,601
A good informant tells me so.

386
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,467
Says one of my vics
was talking bad

387
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,833
about Mr. Stanfield,
who took it personal.

388
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,867
Killed him,
his girl, his muscle.

389
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,767
Left the
little kids alive,

390
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:55,967
so I guess he ain't all bad.

391
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,934
People out there
so scared of this motherfucker.

392
00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:00,601
I can't get close to an
eyewitness on any of it.

393
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:04,934
- Where you at with
the rest of these cases?

394
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,301
- You know we don't
even have lab work

395
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,067
on fourteen of these bodies?

396
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,501
A year later
and I'm still walking in written

397
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,067
requests into Landsman,
watching him just file

398
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,434
them away in his drawer.

399
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,434
- McNulty would've called
a news reporter on that shit.

400
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,668
I am not him.

401
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:20,900
- Well, what would the Bunk do?
Take no for a fucking answer?

402
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,434
- We had cutbacks,
you know that.

403
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:28,800
We lost three of four
trace examiners.

404
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,334
Lost half our clerical.

405
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:31,800
The freezer went bad,
we lost four months

406
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:32,934
of blood samples.

407
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:34,167
Did you know that?

408
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:35,800
Four months of evidence
and they still haven't

409
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,800
replaced my damn icebox.

410
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:40,167
- My heart pumps
purple piss for you.

411
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:43,201
Now, I got the worst mass
murder in b-more history

412
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,367
and you can't get the
tracework back to me

413
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:47,167
inside of a year?
C'mon, Ron...

414
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,434
Look...

415
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:51,234
You can't go to the press.

416
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:54,334
I mean, heads will
roll if this gets out.

417
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,467
It isn't anyone's fault.

418
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,634
In fact, it's a little
bit on you, in a way.

419
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,000
The fuck you say?

420
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,800
- After annette took
retirement, the casework

421
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,000
got backed up
worse than ever, right?

422
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Well, we put in to fill
the lab assistant slot,

423
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:09,634
but with all these cutbacks,
the best they could

424
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,733
give us was a temp.

425
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,934
- A temp?
- Yeah. No medical. No pension.

426
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:17,534
A temp hire to get
us over for a while.

427
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,668
Look, I'll show
you mething...

428
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,534
She was assigned to sort

429
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:24,367
and file the individual
trace elements...

430
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:26,034
Hair, fiber mostly...

431
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,934
You know, from each
of the fourteen scenes.

432
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,833
So what's the problem?

433
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,668
- Well, in the
initial paperwork,

434
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,267
you guys wrote out all
twenty-two c.c. Numbers, right?

435
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,267
Right.

436
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,467
- But
in the supplemental requests,

437
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:43,301
you put all the incidents
under the initial c.c.

438
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:45,733
And then you wrote,
"et Al," remember?

439
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:46,934
so?

440
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,401
- She didn't know what
"et Al" meant.

441
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,467
And she sorted everything under
the single complaint number.

442
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:54,334
- You don't fuckin' mean...
- Yeah.

443
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:56,401
We have no idea which one
of your scenes

444
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,134
any of this shit came from.

445
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:00,234
We don't have a clue.

446
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:08,234
Actually, except for this...

447
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:14,984
shs
Been a pretty good employee.

448
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:21,668
She's
been a pretty good employee.

449
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,067
Surveillance teams.

450
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:24,234
- Two each on
twelveour shifts.

451
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:25,900
I need them to set
up on certain locations

452
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:26,967
common to our cases.

453
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,700
C'mon, Jay.

454
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:30,967
You heard the mayor.
This case is a red ball.

455
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:31,967
That it is.

456
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:34,534
You can have Greggs,
if you want.

457
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:35,568
The last
time I offered her up,

458
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,334
you kicked her
back to her own casework.

459
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:38,434
Other than a second
detective,

460
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:39,867
you are on your own.

461
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:44,601
- So it's all bullshit.
- I dunno.

462
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I thought the mayor
gave a very nice speech.

463
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,067
I, for one, was moved.

464
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,967
Much like the bull to
which you just referred.

465
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:03,900
- Tell you one thing...
- What's that?

466
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
- Motherfucker whose
got the connect,

467
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,267
he the one that did Joe.

468
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,634
Oh, no doubt.

469
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,201
- Y'all know the
co-op took some hits.

470
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:29,634
Joe. Hungry man.

471
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,201
Good people, especially Joe.

472
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,534
Their passin' was for
real, cold blooded.

473
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:37,167
I ow what you thinkin',
so I'ma put it out there...

474
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,367
I'm reonsible.

475
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,800
A week or so back,
I made a move on Omar,

476
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:46,034
with Joe's approval.

477
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,900
The faggot ain't
had heart enough to come at me,

478
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,668
so he come at
those close to me.

479
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,301
Now I'm doublin'
the bounty...

480
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:55,467
Hundred large for
a whiff of that dicksuck.

481
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:57,833
Two hundred fifty
for his head.

482
00:26:57,934 --> 00:26:59,568
What about the connect?

483
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,234
I got that covered.

484
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,401
And in light of that fact,
I'm a take it upon

485
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:04,934
myself to conduct this meet.

486
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:09,668
Slim, I want you take over
hungry man's slice of the cake.

487
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:12,767
Meanin' no disrespect,

488
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,034
but I ain't cut
out to be no c.E.o.

489
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:20,668
Cheese, then.

490
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:23,034
- No problem, man.
Got you covered.

491
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:24,733
Until we settle up with Omar,

492
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,668
I think it's
best we suspend these meets.

493
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:30,100
In fact, I ain't really
one for meets no how.

494
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:31,867
Anybody got a
problem from here on out,

495
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:34,167
bring it to me,
or sit on that shit.

496
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,167
Those of you on the westside
who need to re-up,

497
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:38,900
holla' at my man monk.

498
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,700
He gonna handle
supply over there.

499
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,867
On the eastside, cheese.

500
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,767
One more thing.

501
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:47,067
Price of the brick going up.

502
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,301
Thirty more.

503
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:52,700
Alright.
Enough of this shit.

504
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,733
What?

505
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,467
- Next year for the schools.
From now until december,

506
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,367
we're all about the
plight of the homeless.

507
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:15,733
The great whiting has spoken.

508
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,334
I appealed to klebanow
half hour ago but he gave me

509
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:19,900
the thumbs down.
I'm sorry.

510
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,900
- Check it out, people.
Our metro desk

511
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,067
has some national profile.

512
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,000
- Uh, we're being
careful to cooperate

513
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,900
with the investigators
in every way.

514
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,167
My newspaper has no desire
to get between

515
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:36,000
the police and the suspect.

516
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,634
- But still, wouldn't you
agree it's an incredible

517
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,334
moment for any journalist

518
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,467
to come face to face
with that type of pure

519
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,668
evil like the son of Sam.

520
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:46,934
That makes you the
Jimmy breslin of Baltimore.

521
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:49,367
- Well, no, I wouldn't
say that. I mean...

522
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:52,668
- But knowing you have been
in contact with a killer,

523
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,668
are you at all concerned
about continuing to report

524
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,467
from the street?

525
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,900
- No, not at all.
I mean, this is what we do.

526
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,467
As a reporter,
you expect to be

527
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,167
in harm's way
at some points.

528
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,167
It's what we do.

529
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:05,568
- Agreed.
It's what we do.

530
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:07,833
But very rarely does a
reporter end up being

531
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:11,934
in the middle of a story--
An ongoing story--

532
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,100
About a murderer who
is still at large

533
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:18,601
and posing a severe and
deadly risk to the...

534
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,501
- You shoulda heard
Phelan this morning.

535
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:23,601
Too scared to tap
the newspaper phones

536
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,301
they might shit
on him for it.

537
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:28,234
Fuckin' hack judge.

538
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:29,867
- What would you want with
more wires?

539
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:30,934
We got all we need.

540
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
I don't want another wire.

541
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:33,867
It's
the principle of the thing...

542
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:35,668
It just pissed me off
listening to him.

543
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:40,733
- Oh yeah,
no surveillance cars.

544
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:43,833
They won't go beyond
me and Greggs.

545
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:45,601
You and Sydnor will
have to work

546
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:48,234
it as best
you can for right now.

547
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:49,867
Assholes.

548
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,501
They need another body,
don't they?

549
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:01,401
- I'll call our
man in the southern.

550
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,568
- I can take it from here.
Y'all can bounce.

551
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:12,833
Alright, boss.

552
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:24,267
What up, Rick?

553
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,067
Just like ol'
times for me and you, huh?

554
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,800
- Whatever you
want it's yours, alright?

555
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,000
- Tonight, I'm just
gonna take yo' jump...

556
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,267
And leave you with
a little something.

557
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:35,267
What's that?

558
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,867
My word in your ear.

559
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:40,534
I'm callin'
Marlo a straight bitch.

560
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:43,900
I'm sayin' it don't take much
to shoot down a blind man.

561
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,601
And as for him
steppin' to me,

562
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,167
you tell that dude
he ain't got the heart.

563
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,367
Alright.

564
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,501
- You tell that man I'm
in the street, waiting.

565
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,668
Anjust like a little bitch,
he ain't nowhere to be found.

566
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,833
- I'll tell him.
I will.

567
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,800
- Pick up your keys
and go on inside, yo.

568
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,733
You kill Joe?

569
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,800
Hungry?

570
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:16,301
Didn't think so.

571
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,334
What now?

572
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,401
- There's more than
one way to skin a case.

573
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,568
- Already ran
them for priors, right?

574
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:47,201
Priors, yeah.

575
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:48,867
But I'm gonna run every name
you guys developed through

576
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,367
the entire database.

577
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:52,100
Not just for priors,
but for anything at all

578
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:53,733
in the miles system.

579
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,733
Court appearances,
parole, probation,

580
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,401
gun permits,
d.o.c., open bails.

581
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,067
- You're playing longshots,
huh?

582
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:04,967
- Darlin', I'm playin'
the hand I've been dealt.

583
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:06,434
An h-file?

584
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Who caught the case?
- Worden. Other shift.

585
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,434
- Stepfather.
Beaten to death.

586
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:21,134
They interviewed the mother,
but no one else

587
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:22,867
in the household.

588
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,167
- Doesn't exactly fit
with the others, does it?

589
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:27,434
I mean, a straight
up ass-whoopin'

590
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,700
in an alley doesn't seem
like Marlo staield.

591
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,700
No it doesn't.

592
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:34,934
- But you're
gonna work it anyway.

593
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,234
- In the pentecostal church
where I was given religion,

594
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:38,967
it would have been
said that the spirit

595
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,601
was on you yesterday.

596
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,534
- It got good to me.
- Let praises be.

597
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:43,733
- I don't know.
It just pissed me off

598
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,167
that on top of everything
else I gotta deal with,

599
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:47,067
some nutjob starts
killing homeless guys.

600
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:49,534
I mean, fuck already,
how many shitbowls are there?

601
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,100
- He's right though.
You were great.

602
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:53,267
That passion
was just the thing.

603
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,900
You think, uh...

604
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,167
- We step out on this issue,
it could provide

605
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,601
some national presence...

606
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
- Didn't the governor
scrap the emergency medical

607
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,000
and housing program last year?

608
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,201
What was it, temha?

609
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:07,167
- He did, replaced it
with t-dap, which cuts funding

610
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:08,934
to anyone who doesn't
qualify for federal support.

611
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,568
It's worse than that,
actually: he froze eligibility

612
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:13,833
by disallowing new applications,
which put all kinda folks

613
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,167
out on the street.

614
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:17,301
- So we slam the republican
for sticking it to the poor.

615
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:18,733
It plays.

616
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,000
Nationally, you're ting up
the cause of the forgotten...

617
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,733
And no one is ever in favor
of homelessness...

618
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,167
- Statewide, you're going
up against the fella who tore

619
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:28,100
up the safety net.

620
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:29,833
Homelessness.

621
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:35,067
I'll be damned.

622
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:47,034
- Base to twenty-three-oh-six.
- Go ahead, Lester.

623
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:49,201
- You see anybody using
a cellphone?

624
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:50,401
Wait one.

625
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:53,100
Negative.

626
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,501
Hold on.

627
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:56,867
Somebody's here.

628
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,134
Lester...

629
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:10,134
Can't get used to how empty
this place feels nowadays.

630
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:12,401
- True, but you'd be
surprised what you can get done

631
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:14,668
when no one's looking
over your shoulder.

632
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,067
- You'll need to serve
these. Running out of time.

633
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,434
- I'll get right on it.
- There's a couple of loose ends

634
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:21,668
I think we should
cover as well.

635
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,601
- Now?
- If not now, when?

636
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,800
The trial date is
coming up on us fast.

637
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,668
- Right.
But it's uh...

638
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,434
- Is it something I said?
- No...

639
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:38,967
It's, Sydnor is bringing
in a C.I. And if you're here...

640
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,067
Oh, shit.

641
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:42,601
I'm sorry. Um...

642
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,234
I'll leave you
my list, okay?

643
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,634
- No problem.
We'll get right on it.

644
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,434
I'm sorry, Lester,

645
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:52,967
if I was intruding.

646
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,100
You couldn't know.

647
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,900
So why you here?

648
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,634
If this about Michael
an' what he into,

649
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:07,634
y'all should know he don't
live here no more.

650
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,267
- Actually, I'm following
up on your man's case.

651
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:13,167
You spoke to detective
worden when it happened.

652
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,634
Hmm?

653
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,534
He was your boyfriend,
right?

654
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,034
When he weren't in jail...

655
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:23,467
Father to my youngest.

656
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,568
But you know how he died.

657
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,367
Beaten bad.

658
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:33,100
Crime of passion, as we say.

659
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:35,833
Didn't seem like
he was home long enough

660
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,733
to get somebody
that riled at him.

661
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,833
Unless, of course,
it was over you.

662
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:42,900
- What, you sayin'
I know somethin' about that?

663
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:44,733
- Lady, let's put our cards
on the table.

664
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,201
I been in this game
longer than a little bit,

665
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,833
and there's one
thing I know from jump.

666
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,201
You get a murder like this,

667
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:52,467
there's bound to be a woman
at the center of it.

668
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,000
I don't know nothin'.

669
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,134
- You know my gut
tells me that you do.

670
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:00,668
And I'll tell you what...

671
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,234
We're gonna
take a ride downtown,

672
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:04,833
let you talk
to the grand jury.

673
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:06,100
You're n
straight with them,

674
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:07,934
they'll slap you with
a material witness warrant.

675
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,301
And you sit
over at woman's

676
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,767
detention for
a couple of weeks.

677
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:15,067
It's amazing what it does
for the grieving process.

678
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,167
Get your things.
- I ain't goin' no damn where.

679
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,733
It's me or the wagon.

680
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:23,234
- Detective, I swear,
I ain't in this.

681
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:26,234
It ain't me you wanna talk to.

682
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:30,900
It's the boy,
he know.

683
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,434
He runnin' with
them who did it.

684
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:34,000
- You just tryin' to put me
off the scent here.

685
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,000
No, you gotta believe me.

686
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,167
He told me devar
wasn't comin' home,

687
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,967
'fore we even
knowed he was dead.

688
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,501
- U said he's runnin'
with them?

689
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:48,867
Runnin' with who?

690
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,568
- Chris, Snoop,
all them gangsters.

691
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:58,568
Who else doin'
all the killin' around here?

692
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,301
Let me see your camera.

693
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,434
- Add a minute-six
to your times.

694
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:08,767
Got it.

695
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:10,134
Here it is. Look at this.

696
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:15,401
Single ring.
Connection. Silence.

697
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,234
What do you have?

698
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:19,800
- I took these three.
They're just hangin' around.

699
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,800
What time did monk leave?

700
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:32,601
One twenty-four.
Two minutes later.

701
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,534
- It's not what Marlo's
sayin', it's what he's sendin'.

702
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:43,800
Look at monk.

703
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,467
- Yeah.
Text message.

704
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:47,967
- Text?
Need I remind you, detective,

705
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:51,700
these young men are products
of Baltimore city schools.

706
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,867
Besides, look how far away
he's holding his phone.

707
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,900
Too far away to
be reading a text.

708
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,501
Naw, son. Pictures.

709
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:02,534
Pictures...

710
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,301
- What the fuck
you lookin' at?

711
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,934
- You know what
they do, right? They tease you.

712
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:46,501
They let you get close and
just when you're about to

713
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,668
pull the case, they rip the
fuckin' rug out from under you.

714
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:53,034
I'm not lying.
We got a fuckin' serial

715
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:55,201
killer on the loose.

716
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,301
You didn't know that?

717
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,867
It's in the goddamn paper.

718
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:10,668
What support do I get?
One fuckin' detective.

719
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:14,568
They wanna play their
simple-ass games, fine.

720
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,067
But I gotta do what I gotta do.

721
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,334
'scuse me.

722
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:22,134
McNulty.

723
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,334
Yeah, Oscar.

724
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:25,767
Beautiful.

725
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,167
Absolutely. Where?
On my way.

726
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:04,267
- Man, you can't let it get
to you like this.

727
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,967
Why don't we go
buy up a bunch of

728
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:08,234
toys and take
'em to your kids?

729
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:09,434
You ain't hearin' me.

730
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,700
How can I go near my people
with Omar on us?

731
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,634
- How he gonna find
out about them?

732
00:40:13,733 --> 00:40:16,067
- How we find out
about the blind man?

733
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:49,100
Omar, yo, Omar!

734
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,733
Hey yo, Omar!

735
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:51,733
Get.

736
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:52,833
Omar!

737
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,301
It's Omar!

738
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:02,733
You too, shorty.

739
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,934
- Omar!
It's Omar!

740
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,401
Money a little late today.

741
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,367
That buckshot in your leg
should help you some you

742
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:27,800
explain' yourself to Marlo.

743
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,034
As for them other two

744
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,700
they gonna wish
that I'd peppered them a bit.

745
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:38,867
Now you make sure you tell
old Marlo I burned the money.

746
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:40,668
'cause it ain't
about that paper.

747
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,867
It's about me hurtin' his
people, messin' with his world.

748
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:46,501
Tell that boy he ain't man
enough to come down

749
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,167
to the street with Omar.

750
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:50,700
You tell him that!

751
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,301
- My sergeant and two side
partners got here before me.

752
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:02,534
Then the
shift commander showed.

753
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Now the duty
officer is on his way.

754
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:06,000
For a d.o.a.?

755
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,434
- Yeah, well, you and Lester
started some shit here, son.

756
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:23,568
Now a d.o.a. Call
brings everyone in a heartbeat.

757
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,467
God bless.

758
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,501
Pictures?

759
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:18,501
Photographs on cellphones.

760
00:43:18,568 --> 00:43:21,833
Now that means new p.c.
To capture the photos,

761
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,668
and new equipment
that could do it.

762
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:29,234
- How do I write that into my
bullshit homeless killer's m.o.?

763
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:32,733
When we started this,

764
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,733
you said all we
needed were some bugs,

765
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,367
a camera or two,
and in a couple of weeks,

766
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:38,934
we'd have them.
That's what you said.

767
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,334
So I cranked up my
bullshit to pay for that,

768
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,934
but no, then you
needed a wiretap.

769
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:46,867
So I went along with that,
I got you the wiretap.

770
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:49,167
Then you ask for
surveillance teams,

771
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:51,434
but before I can get to
that, you came to me with this.

772
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:53,668
I mean, what the fuck?

773
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,800
I gotta tell you, Lester,

774
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:00,134
I don't
want to hurt your feelings,

775
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:02,867
but I can see why Daniels
cringed every time you opened

776
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:05,934
your fucking mouth.
You're a supervisor's nightmare.

777
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,867
I'm just following the thread.

778
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:24,634
- Okay, say we get you
the intercept on your pictures,

779
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,367
will that give us Marlo?

780
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:29,267
- It'll be coded,
probably,

781
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,733
but I'm sure
we can break it.

782
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,634
That'll tell us how they
do business,

783
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:37,067
and usually, that's
enough. Or not.

784
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:40,267
But the truth is, I'm running
Sydnor ragged just staying

785
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:41,501
on a couple of mopes and
monitoring calls.

786
00:44:41,634 --> 00:44:44,000
Now, when
we're up on their code,

787
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,334
we're going
to need more manpower

788
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:47,000
to run down
a stash or a re-up.

789
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,267
We can't do it all.

790
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:51,000
- I can't juke
this thing any more than I have.

791
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,534
Last night, half the police
department turned up

792
00:44:53,668 --> 00:44:56,301
at Oscar's crime scene
before I could get there.

793
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:00,167
We can't make another murder.

794
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,568
Thanks for the milk.

795
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,201
What's a donut without milk?

796
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:19,900
- So you were
talking about

797
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,467
your second tour...

798
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:24,601
The bad one, yeah.

799
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:26,401
Second tour fucked me up good.

800
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:29,234
But they don't wanna hear it.
- Who doesn't?

801
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:32,501
- Mostly, it's command and
the Senior E.m.s.

802
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:35,000
Put it down that marines
don't get p.t.s.d.

803
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,401
But they do.

804
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,634
Can you tell me what happened?

805
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:46,100
Terry, can you talk about it?

806
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:49,401
- We had a month
left on the tour,

807
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:52,634
working an s-and-a mission
outside fallujah.

808
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:55,434
I was assistant team leader.

809
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:58,501
Our m-niner, niner, eights were
retritted with up-armor kits.

810
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:00,434
M-niner-niner-eight?

811
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:03,234
A humvee, sorry.

812
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:04,700
They're big on nomenclature.

813
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,501
Anyway we finished our
sweep, headed back in, right?

814
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:12,700
It was all good.
Then, bam...

815
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,067
Our lead vehicle was hit
with an elevated I.E.d.

816
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,434
The blast
tore the m-fifty gunner in half.

817
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,867
Flipped the humvee
like a matchbox car.

818
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,401
Driver lost both his hands.

819
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:25,034
Blood shooting out
all over. He's fuckin' laughin',

820
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:28,501
saying over and over,
"look, ma, no hands."

821
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,534
It's the laughing
I can't shake.

822
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:40,267
Weird.

823
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,700
'cause he's okay, you know?
I mean, he's better than me.

824
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,534
Got himself a couple
of prosthetic mitts,

825
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,067
eighty thousand apiece.

826
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,501
Wow.

827
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:02,568
What happened next?
- Nothing really.

828
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:04,833
We pushed out,
secured the perimeter.

829
00:47:04,934 --> 00:47:07,201
Corpsman did what he could,
an' we waited for the cas-evac.

830
00:47:57,568 --> 00:48:00,000
- Look, I'm not looking
to shit on another guy's copy,

831
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,668
I just wanted to
let you know this was out there.

832
00:48:01,767 --> 00:48:04,134
I'm at a community meeting
in bel air-edison to hear about

833
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:07,668
school zoning and this woman
talked my ear off about this.

834
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:09,134
She said the kids
never saw a dime.

835
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:10,534
Hmm.

836
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:14,601
- I mean, I'm hoping
this is all bullshit.

837
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:16,967
- Hey, Scott.
How's it coming?

838
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:18,067
- Prettyood.
You seen the art?

839
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,434
- Yeah, yeah.
Good stuff, good stuff.

840
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,601
Listen, we got a complaint
about a story you wrote

841
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,967
a couple weeks ago.

842
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,134
The one about the woman

843
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,934
who died from an
allergic reaction to seafood,

844
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,301
you remember?
- What about it?

845
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:28,568
- Neighborhood ladknows
the dead woman's sister says

846
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,201
our story made a lot of
money for those kids,

847
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:32,201
a scholarship
fund we wrote up.

848
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:33,501
- Yeah?
So...

849
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:36,201
- Well, she says the
sister has a history of fraud,

850
00:48:36,301 --> 00:48:37,767
convictions on it.

851
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,501
She says all the money went
to atlantic city casinos

852
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:41,668
and kids never saw a dime.

853
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,900
- Christ, who the fuck...
- I know, I know.

854
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,267
It's probably some old biddy
talkin' about stuff

855
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:46,601
she don't know,

856
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,000
but maybe you should go
back and check with the family,

857
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:56,234
see if we don't get took
on this, huh?

858
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,601
- No, no. Not now.
After you file.

859
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,067
Just make a couple calls, huh?

860
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,067
This is kidnapping.

861
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:12,334
- Actually, I'm not sure.
I asked him if he wanted

862
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,301
and talk and
he walked to my car.

863
00:49:16,434 --> 00:49:17,634
You give him the hundred?

864
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,434
Stuffed it in his jacket.

865
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:24,634
He's fine, Lester.
He's great.

866
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,201
- Think he'll find his way
back home?

867
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:29,201
Eventually.

868
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:30,934
By then, we'll be done with
Marlo, we'll have shut

869
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,733
this thing down.
And as far as what happened

870
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:35,201
to this guy...

871
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:38,568
They'll write
it off as some fraternity prank.

872
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,833
- Does he know we're cops?
- No.

873
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:43,800
- And even if he figures it out,
who's gonna believe him?

874
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,367
He's nuts.
- How do you know he's nuts?

875
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:47,267
- First of all,
just look at him.

876
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:49,301
He's fucking bouncing
off the walls.

877
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:51,301
Second of all...
I got his scrip.

878
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:54,568
I called the university E.r.
It's an anti-psychotic.

879
00:49:54,668 --> 00:49:56,668
So...

880
00:49:56,767 --> 00:49:58,733
I took his I.D., I'll

881
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,367
scratch his
name off the scrip

882
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,634
and leave him with this...

883
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:06,900
I got that one from E first
homeless death Oscar gave us.

884
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,134
The one that was too rigored.
Donald somebody or other.

885
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:12,833
It had him in a cleveland,
ohio shelter.

886
00:50:12,934 --> 00:50:16,568
- McNulty, you are deserving
of serious psychological study.

887
00:50:16,668 --> 00:50:19,134
- You need p.c.
To intercept cellphone photos.

888
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,568
Well here it is, right here.

889
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:23,167
We send photos of this guy

890
00:50:23,301 --> 00:50:25,234
all ribboned up
from a dry cellphone

891
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:27,800
to that goofy reporter,
along with a message

892
00:50:27,934 --> 00:50:30,234
bitching about his stories.
"I ain't no pervert,"

893
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:32,234
or whatever.
Now, the killer says,

894
00:50:32,334 --> 00:50:33,800
you ain't gonna find
no more bodies.

895
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,967
Only photos of the victims...

896
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:37,434
Before they disappear.

897
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:44,201
Look at this poor sucker.
I don't believe we're

898
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:45,700
gonna do this.

899
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,967
- He disappears,
the city goes batshit.

900
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:49,401
You get your photo intercepts,

901
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:51,201
d by the time we need to
run down one of Marlo's re-ups,

902
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:53,601
you got all the
manpower you need.

903
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,733
- And Marlo falls.
- Falls hard.

904
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:22,167
- Don't fucking tell me
you mislabeled ts too.

905
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:25,634
I want comparisons between
known suspects

906
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,534
and the d.N.A. From this scene.
By the looks of it,

907
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:30,367
we got a whole
lot of d.N.A. Outta this mess.

908
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,634
Now, motherfucker. Right now.

909
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:35,934
- Top of my list.
As soon as we work through

910
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:37,934
all the trace from the
homeless killings.

911
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,100
That's the priority, Bunk.

912
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:45,267
- The homeless killings.
- Everything is backed up

913
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:47,634
behind that, sorry.

914
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,434
Your boy McNulty has
everyone's attention right now.

915
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:08,601
So it's Larry, huh?

916
00:52:11,134 --> 00:52:13,067
Okay, Larry.
You're witgood people here.

917
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:14,668
It's all gonna be great.

918
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,401
You're gonna like this place.
It's warm, they got nice beds.

919
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:25,234
And best of all, I gave you
cash money just for

920
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:27,067
walking in the door.

921
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:33,700
Come on, Larry.

922
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:38,134
It's goin' to be fine.
I promise.

923
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,634
- You feel up for trying
Clay yourself?

924
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,434
I mean, it's been
a while since

925
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:54,767
you tried
a criminal case personally.

926
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:56,601
It sends a statement, I think.

927
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,634
We should start with our
witness list.

928
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:00,634
See if we can pare that down
any, out of respect for

929
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:02,934
the distracted nature
of a Baltimore jury.

930
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:06,934
- First, there's something
else I need to bring up.

931
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,367
- Old grand jury stuff?
- Sealed indictments.

932
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:18,733
Sealed transcripts.
Dozens of them.

933
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,733
Pulled from the desk
of a shot-to-death drug

934
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:22,434
dealer in east Baltimore.

935
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,634
The deputy ops
brought me those.

936
00:53:25,733 --> 00:53:27,334
We have a leak.

937
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:53,201
- And he showed up,
outside where I work.

938
00:53:53,301 --> 00:53:56,934
He was confused. Lost
I think. So I brought him here.

939
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,100
Donald, where you fr?

940
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,833
Tell the lady, Donald.

941
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,434
Baltimore.

942
00:54:11,568 --> 00:54:15,967
- But he told me he came
from cleveland.

943
00:54:16,134 --> 00:54:28,550
- Donald,
do you have identification?

944
00:54:28,585 --> 00:54:40,967
- Donald,
do you have identification?

945
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:42,501
This does say cleveland.

946
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:51,767
Donald, why don't
we get you something to eat?

947
00:54:51,867 --> 00:54:53,167
It's okay. Come on.

948
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,634
We're good to go?

949
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,700
It's great, Gus.

950
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,134
It sings.

951
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:04,900
- Hey, scottie boy.
- Hey.

952
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:07,534
- Hey. Great piece.
I mean this one really feels

953
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:09,501
like the real deal.
- It's great work.

954
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:10,967
Thanks.

955
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:13,568
- What I like most about it
is that you didn't overwrite it.

956
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:15,467
No extra color.
No puffy adjectives.

957
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:18,100
Just
tight, declarative sentences.

958
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:20,367
And you really let this
ex-marine just tell his story.

959
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:23,467
- Thanks, Gus.
- Hey, Mr. Slot man,

960
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:27,534
read it and weep.
And I mean that literally.

961
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,100
Oh, hey, Scott.

962
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,467
Did you get
a chance to, uh,

963
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:31,900
drop a
couple calls on that complaint?

964
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,900
Yeah, it's bullshit.

965
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,534
I talked to people
in the neighborhood.

966
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,700
Sister's good people, but
there's another woman,

967
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,100
up there, unrelated,
keeps getting arrested

968
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:42,800
for kiting checks
and stuff, and she...

969
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,733
She uses the sister's name
every time she gets locked up.

970
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,367
She's done it like
three or four times now.

971
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:49,034
- No shit.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

972
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,034
But sister's clean.
Everyone says so.

973
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,201
Okay.

974
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:33,501
- Is there anything else
I can do for him?

975
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:36,334
- No, we've got it.
But thanks for bringing him in.

976
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:48,501
Most people, they just
ignore them.

977
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:50,668
I just want to get all of
your paperwork taken care of...
