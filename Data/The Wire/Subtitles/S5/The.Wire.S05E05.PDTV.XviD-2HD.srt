1
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:03,567
Joe will be missed.

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,341
Very much missed.

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:06,615
We liked Joe.

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,944
A hard man not to like.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,243
Tomorrow ain't
promised to no one.

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,450
Meanwhile, we go on.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,388
In business-- in life--

8
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:26,321
What you learn to appreciate
the most is a dependable man.

9
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,823
One day, same as the next.

10
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:31,117
Yeah, I learned a lot
from watching Joe.

11
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:33,859
We deal with you
or your second.

12
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,674
No one else.

13
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,468
No one else knows our names.

14
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:40,183
No one else contacts us.

15
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:42,446
Understand?

16
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,811
To contact us, use this...
only.

17
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,972
I don't talk on no cellphones.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,139
Here.
To call for lunch, you can talk.

19
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:56,207
To call your girl,
you can talk.

20
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,492
To call your lawyer even,
you can talk--

21
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,342
The law says
that is between you and the laer.

22
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:02,933
All right?

23
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:05,507
To find out what movie is
playing down the street,

24
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,781
You can talk.

25
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,235
All of that is good because
all of that tells them there

26
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:11,991
there is nothing good to hear.

27
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,705
But for business,

28
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,598
we do not talk on the phone.

29
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:19,273
Never.

30
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:20,473
Right.

31
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:22,460
I mean,
Joe taught me that.

32
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,395
But what about--
What is...

33
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,549
How that play?

34
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,521
Man overcame his grief.

35
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,844
Do it feel like a crown
on your head right now?

36
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,162
Do it?

37
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,381
'Cause that's what
I'm wearin' on my head.

38
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,681
We should celebrate.

39
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:54,033
Yeah?

40
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,478
Atlantic city.

41
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:57,974
Can't play like that now.

42
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:00,456
Omar gonna make a move.
We know this.

43
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:05,694
Yo, I need to go past home.
You mind a ride?

44
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:07,437
Naw. You know I like your peoples.

45
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:10,773
Fact is, I gotta tell 'em I'm not
gonna be comin' round for a time.

46
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:13,011
You stepped up and made your play.

47
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,307
Now I gotta make mine.

48
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,178
- At least 4.
- <i>Got it</i>.

49
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:02,556
We're going back through the old cases,
so we could find more than that.

50
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:03,882
<i>What else?</i>

51
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:05,807
And the motive now seems sexual.

52
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,586
What do you mean sexual?

53
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:10,874
Is someone
sodomizing homeless men?

54
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,540
<i>I can't get that specific.</i>

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,257
How can I not get specific?

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,807
I'm just saying the killer is acting
from sexual compulsions.

57
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,807
Anything more detailed than that
we need to keep in the case file.

58
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:24,174
<i>I don't know, detective. Last time,
I couldn't get it out front on metro.</i>

59
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,633
But let me run it by my desk
and call you back. All right?

60
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:27,814
All right.

61
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:31,807
Anything late from copshop?

62
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:34,185
Follow-ups on the recent murders.

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,074
An arrest on one, which was
the domestic cutting from Hampden.

64
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,992
No arrests in a couple of drug-relateds
from east Baltimore.

65
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,800
Give me a bit for the budget line.

66
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,540
Domestic was a Patricia boggus,
found in her car.

67
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,992
Drug-Relateds were one Joseph Stewart,
found in his dining room,

68
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:52,081
and one Nathaniel Manns,
found in an alley garage.

69
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:56,041
A couple grafs on each.
Write it as a single short.

70
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:59,038
Also, I got word
on another homeless murder.

71
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:01,496
The detective on it says it's related.

72
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:03,181
He says it's sexual.

73
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:05,411
Sexual?

74
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,186
- They being raped?
- He wouldn't confirm that.

75
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:11,213
He just says that the killings
are sexual in nature.

76
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,786
Write what you got.

77
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,634
I'll run it by the 4:00,
see if it takes.

78
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:23,660
This indictment is the result
of an 18-month investigation

79
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,874
by the state's attorney's office

80
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,872
and the Baltimore police department.

81
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:30,396
And it shines a light
on a cornerstone issue

82
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,243
for any representative government--

83
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:33,667
Public trust

84
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,644
of public servants.

85
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:38,869
Senator Davis
abused that trust.

86
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,720
He traded on his power and
influence so that he could use

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,172
local businesses

88
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,868
and campaign donors
as his personal A.T.M. machine.

89
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,699
He created a network of charitable

90
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,929
and non-profit organizations

91
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,796
whose purpose was to accumulate cash
for his private use,

92
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,112
- betraying the goodwill...
- Ronnie Pearlman?

93
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,341
Bill Zorzi, covering
federal court for the "Sun."

94
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,824
Right.
How do you do?

95
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:05,507
Not to be all petulant
on your special day here,

96
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,689
But since when
does a prosecutor of this town

97
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,289
stage a perp walk
and not call the daily newspaper?

98
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,584
We called Gail Gibson.
Left a message on her voice mail.

99
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,962
Gail left for a freelance gig
4 months ago.

100
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:19,058
Well, her voice mail still works.

101
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,493
Who's replacing her on city courts?

102
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:23,815
From now on,

103
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,473
just don't jam me like that again.

104
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,125
...he must be he accountable

105
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:32,274
for his fraudulent actions.

106
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,740
Senator Davis has opened
our legislative body

107
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,585
<i>to monetary persuasions.</i>

108
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:42,103
<i>He has done this knowingly
and with complete disregard</i>

109
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,866
<i>for the office that he represents.</i>

110
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,911
- It is this kind of impropriety...
- How's it feel, Clay?

111
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,957
Not much fun on the ass end, is it?

112
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,520
You said it, Norman.

113
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,668
There's the short Con
and the long Con.

114
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,341
You're gonna need a statement.

115
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,907
Nothing too joyful.

116
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:03,874
You don't dance on Clay's grave until
you're sure the motherfucker's dead.

117
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,041
Clay ain't getting up from this.

118
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,348
Also you don't want
to piss off his base,

119
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:10,041
being too gleeful about it.

120
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:11,875
That guy still has a base?

121
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:14,267
After all this shit he's pulled?

122
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:18,649
I'll tell you one thing.
That fella right there

123
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,740
is looking pretty damn mayoral.

124
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,281
More than Nerese, definitely.

125
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:28,132
With the profile he gets from this,
I'd say it's Mr. Bond's race to lose.

126
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,620
<i>...and remain under common court.</i>

127
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:35,381
<i>Senator Davis
will have to account for that money.</i>

128
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,983
- What'd you tell your girl?
- That I'm goin' away on business.

129
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,180
I won't be around for a couple weeks.

130
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,231
- Shouldn't be more than that.
- Better not.

131
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,773
... and miss Trainor say
we gonna learn a problem like that

132
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,737
once every day for
this year and the next.

133
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:05,085
You mean memorize 'em?

134
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,317
Learn it by heart.
Learn the question.

135
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:08,796
Learn the answer, too.

136
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,828
'Cause them questions gonna all been
the M.S.A. test you all take next year.

137
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,121
She tell you all that?

138
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:16,521
Miss Trainor say if the scores
don't go up before the selection

139
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:18,540
all the teachers gonna get fired.

140
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,169
Selection?
What she mean?

141
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,319
When the people vote for whoever.

142
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,293
You mean the election.

143
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:26,515
Nigga think you all that.

144
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,119
Why you gonna go and do that?

145
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,356
- Dukie about to cry.
- Fuck is wrong with you?

146
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:42,817
Ain't nothin' wrong with me!
I'm out here gettin' stuff done.

147
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:45,611
You up in some house somewhere
playin' Mike's lil' bitch.

148
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:50,938
Smacked his little ass.

149
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:02,422
... and finally, we've got
that 40-inch thumbsucker on Bud Selig

150
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:05,007
and baseball's halfhearted response

151
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,374
to the latest recommendations
on steroid use.

152
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,473
Bottom line is
the owners think bud is swell,

153
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,051
The players union is staying mum,
Bondsashe home run record, and

154
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:14,085
everyone's pretending
the issue will go away.

155
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:15,532
And there's news in there?

156
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,764
What do you like for the front?

157
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:21,359
Clay Davis indictment, obviously.
The congressional hearings on Iraq.

158
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,567
Price's piece on how much Carcetti raise
for his gubernatorial run is solid.

159
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:26,194
And the feature on John Waters

160
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:28,754
filming again in Baltimore
could go out front if the art is good.

161
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:31,373
We have him on the film set,
posing with a couple of child actors.

162
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:32,636
Is that allowed?

163
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,770
Now. Let's not confuse
the auteur with his art.

164
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,986
- Anyone like anything else?
- This came in late, but

165
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:40,084
this business at the bottom
of the metro budget

166
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:42,835
about another homeless man being
murdered-- That might have some play.

167
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:44,674
There were other homeless men murdered?

168
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,074
We ran a short piece a week ago
about possible connections in 3 cases.

169
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,374
- Inside metro.
- The motive's said to be sexual,

170
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:54,180
but the cops are being cryptic
about what exactly That means.

171
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,566
Well, we could run it inside, but
you might want to Report it some more,

172
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:01,107
see where it goes.
Right now, it's a little vague for A-1.

173
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,940
OK, then, we'll see where
we are in a couple hours.

174
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:06,965
I told you, duke.

175
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,870
I fuck 'em up good.
Just say the word, man.

176
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,384
Naw, man. I can't have you steppin' up
for me anymore, you know?

177
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,799
Yeah, well.
Talk to the man.

178
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:19,754
He'll set you straight.

179
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,542
- Yo, Mr. Dennis.
- Hey.

180
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:30,669
I need to train with you some.

181
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:35,574
See that.

182
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,407
What happened?

183
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,935
It ain't no thing. I'm just
kinda gettin' a little tired of it.

184
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:42,342
All right, son.

185
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,972
Go get some gloves on
and let's see where you at.

186
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:49,107
It's all pretty straightforward.
I'm surprised the lawyers

187
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,523
you were paying went to the trouble
of getting it postponed.

188
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,739
Maybe 'cause we was payin' by the hour.

189
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:58,426
In any event,
you got a lot going for you here.

190
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:01,070
Car registered to a front,
guns in a secreted compartment.

191
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,944
The woman we registered it to,
She can't do no time.

192
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,293
Just a name we used.

193
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,285
Then get someone who can.

194
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:11,088
Preferably someone without priors,
someone you trust to Stand the charge.

195
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:19,134
Also came past with this here.

196
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,019
More money made clean.

197
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,773
When you figure out
what we gonna do with that there,

198
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,055
- Holler at me.
- How do I do that?

199
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:34,780
410

200
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,085
915

201
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:38,888
0909.

202
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:41,974
Anything else?

203
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,251
Naw,
take me off your clock.

204
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,441
Fuckin' mope pisses me off.

205
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,353
Be generous.

206
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,901
I have a feeling this firm is
going to have quite a payday

207
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,050
from Mr. Stanfield and his people.

208
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,181
He just gave me his phone number.

209
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,152
If Marlo Stanfield
is using a cellphone,

210
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:18,574
it's just a matter of time before we're
up to our asses in pre-trial motions,

211
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,243
litigating a wiretap case.

212
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,581
Joe gave him to us just in time.

213
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:52,525
What now?

214
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,076
You need to attribute that?

215
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:00,168
- What?
- Fifth graf, the dependent clause.

216
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,677
The one about a "pattern

217
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:05,913
of widespread influence
peddling over a period of years."

218
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:08,124
Either the indictment
shows that or it doesn't.

219
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:11,460
Besides which, you begin 3 grafs
in a row with a gerund. Look.

220
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,588
How do you expect me to write this thing
with your Fucking fingers in my eyes?

221
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:17,258
At least let me turn my copy
in before you stomp on it.

222
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,760
Atta boy, Zorz.

223
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:28,201
They want more reporting on this, but
I don't see where it Can go from here.

224
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,749
The cops are selling a sexual motive,

225
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:33,183
but they won't explain it
any more than that.

226
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,791
Who are you dealing with?

227
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,667
Detective who has the case.

228
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,741
And he wants publicity?

229
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,155
Didn't know if you'd come back.

230
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,574
Took a lot of money with you.

231
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,996
It wasn't about the money, bro.

232
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,454
Wasn't never about that.

233
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:05,631
Is that him?

234
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,624
Old Monk prefer the condo life, I see.

235
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,590
Too good for a rowhouse.

236
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,318
Movin' with muscle, too.

237
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,423
Most likely they expectin' you
to make a move.

238
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,995
An' here I am.

239
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:21,933
How 'bout that?

240
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,757
Thanks for meeting me again.

241
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,831
This is Scott Templeton.
He'll be working the story with me.

242
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,077
It's not like I want everyone
at your newspaper knowing my name.

243
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:39,471
Look, you want these homeless cases
to get attention, right?

244
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:42,022
And that's what
you're trying to do here.

245
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,191
Guy's a predator.

246
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:44,884
- People need to know.
- Agreed.

247
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:47,335
And I understand there's things
you need to keep secret

248
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,557
so that you can solve the murders.
I get that.

249
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,390
We can't do much with this story
unless we give it enough juice.

250
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,443
Juice?

251
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:55,815
We need to tell people
what this is about,

252
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,124
why he's doing it.

253
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:59,077
We need to make
this thing come alive

254
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,857
or they're gonna bury the story
like they did the last time.

255
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,184
I told you it's sexual.

256
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:05,312
Compulsion. Obsession,
that kinda thing.

257
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,124
But what the fuck does that mean?

258
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:09,669
It's not like he's carving up housewives

259
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,657
or strangling coeds, here.

260
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:14,006
Your guy's killing homeless men.

261
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,363
Why exactly?
What's in his head?

262
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,662
Is he raping them?
Sodomizing them?

263
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:21,857
I don't have any semen
in any of the cases. I don't have that.

264
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:23,857
But he's doing something, right?

265
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:26,524
He ties a red ribbon
around their arms.

266
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:29,072
- A red ribbon?
- Yeah, a bow.

267
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:32,524
He gift-wraps the motherfuckers.
That enough juice for you?

268
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:33,852
Yeah, kinky.

269
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,891
But no one kills people
to tie ribbons around their arms.

270
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,158
Can we say they were molested?

271
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:40,981
Is it fair to say that?

272
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:46,001
- We'll go with molested then.
- You didn't get that from me.

273
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:48,397
- Another round?
- What else?

274
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:51,158
You want this story to fly
you got to give us Something different.

275
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,968
Keep what you need for the file,
but give us something with a twist.

276
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,860
A sexual serial killer isn't enough?

277
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:57,737
Cold world, I know.

278
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,724
He started biting them.

279
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:08,689
What?

280
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,925
He's biting his victims.

281
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:15,060
Inside thigh,
right ass cheek, left nipple.

282
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,103
- He's a biter.
- Fuck. Shit.

283
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:21,155
That twisted enough for ya?

284
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:23,791
Are we talkin' cannibalism here?

285
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:25,342
Just biting for now.

286
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,524
We'll see where it goes.

287
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:29,241
And did he bite all of them?

288
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:30,516
Not all.

289
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,409
Just the latest ones.
He's maturing.

290
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,657
Maturing?

291
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:37,249
It's a technical term.
It's when a serial killer's

292
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,557
becoming more obsessive.

293
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:41,659
He starts to develop
an intricate pattern

294
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:43,457
in what he does with the bodies.

295
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:44,798
It's weird stuff.

296
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,963
A biter. That's great.

297
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:49,678
My name's nowhere on this.

298
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,210
For your tab.
We'd stay and have one with you,

299
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,476
but we still have time
to make the second edition.

300
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,602
Thanks.

301
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,911
So you thinkin'
if you learn to fight some,

302
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:28,953
people 'round
the way gonna leave you be.

303
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:33,162
Thing is, even if you learn to fight,

304
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,684
people gonna come at you just the same.

305
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,744
It ain't like the movies
where you beat up one bully

306
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:42,795
and the rest just
back the hell up.

307
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,931
Lemme ask,

308
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:49,905
why you think the even bothering
to come at you the way they did?

309
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:51,780
I mean, why you?

310
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,734
See, all I know

311
00:17:57,856 --> 00:17:59,270
is that right there.

312
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,675
I ain't never had
no use for other things.

313
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,478
I could fight.

314
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:10,162
For a time there,
I could run them corners.

315
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:13,175
Not much life

316
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:15,982
outside that, really.

317
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:19,423
I was on a corner for a while.

318
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,686
How that go?

319
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,917
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is...not

320
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:33,715
Everything comes down to
how you carry it in the street.

321
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:38,292
I mean, it do come down to that
if you gonna be in the street.

322
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:42,594
But that ain't the only way to be.

323
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,353
- 'Round here it is.
- Yeah.

324
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,937
'Round here it is.

325
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:53,285
World is bigger than that.

326
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:55,562
At least, that's what they tell me.

327
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:03,187
Like... how do you get from here
to the rest of the world?

328
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:07,176
I wish I knew.

329
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,024
Michael grew up fast.

330
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,093
Yeah, he did.

331
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,577
Anyway, for a kid like that,
my onliest plan might be fine, you know?

332
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,741
Might could work for
a boy like that.

333
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:33,234
But a kid come to me
with other skills,

334
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,777
other ways of being,

335
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:39,114
all I got is hope and wishes.

336
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,469
That's something, I guess.

337
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:44,827
Wish it was more, son.

338
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:46,892
I do.

339
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:55,947
Thanks.

340
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,290
Atta girl.

341
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:09,904
Alma, you've got the investigation{itself}.

342
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,932
Anything that breaks from headquarters.{, that's you.}

343
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:15,425
I thought I'd work back on the victims.
A profile of who these guys were.

344
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:19,354
That's a nice idea, but I already sent
Fletcher out on that about an hour ago.

345
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:20,957
What's left for me to do?

346
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:23,809
You can go and...
talk to the homeless.

347
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,694
React quotes from the homeless?

348
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:29,731
Just 'cause they're in the streets
doesn't mean that they lack opinions.

349
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,318
Where am I gonna find homeless people?

350
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,620
Not at home, I imagine.

351
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,895
Go, go, my children.

352
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:44,512
Read it and weep.

353
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:47,162
I already did.

354
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:49,759
So did the Major.

355
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,625
So did the Colonel.

356
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,957
So did our newly
christened deputy ops.

357
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,080
Deputy's over at city hall right now.

358
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,522
That was quick.

359
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:00,457
Just 'cause you got
some fuckin' reporter

360
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,774
to buy your weak shit does not mean
everyone else buys it.

361
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,861
5 gets you 10,

362
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,390
deputy's over there right now,
talking them back down to earth.

363
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,181
Is this nut raping them?

364
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:16,470
Well, I haven't debriefed
The investigators in detail,

365
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,457
but the office reports don't indicate
penetration or ejaculation.

366
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,694
What can we do?
What can we say we're doing already?

367
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:23,351
We've got good people working it.

368
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:26,046
{Obviously, }It would be better if I could
keep them on it around the clock.

369
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:28,302
- You're talking overtime.
- If you could lift the cap

370
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:30,267
- for this particular Investigation.
- Done.

371
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:32,445
Unlimited overtime for two detectives.

372
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:35,130
- Anything they need.
- Sir, a case like this,

373
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,597
where we're proactively trying
to prevent additional murders,

374
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,579
is going to require more
than two detectives.

375
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,504
I got the school
board chairman telling me

376
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:44,819
he's a short hair away from
laying off 50 middlechool teachers

377
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:47,819
and shutting down special education
in every elementary school in the city

378
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:50,531
in violation of a
federal consent decree.

379
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:53,193
To the extent that I've got more
than an extra couple of dollars,

380
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,450
you aren't getting it.
Embracing the hard choice.

381
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,030
It's one of the--
One of the burdens of command.

382
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,382
Is there anything you can do
to further protect the homeless?

383
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,768
We can have trol units
spread the warning,

384
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,460
try to convince anyone on the street to
move into the city shelters after dark.

385
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,162
Can you have police sit on locations
where the homeless gather?

386
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,757
- Monitor them like that?
- And still answer the calls?

387
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,624
Not without doubling up post units,
which means overtime.

388
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,124
Overtime, again.

389
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:18,840
Blood in our veins, Mr. Mayor.

390
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,086
Every day, you look more like a boss.

391
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:36,446
- Fuck you.
- I didn't mean it like a bad thing.

392
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,650
Yeah, you did.

393
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,727
Yeah, I did.

394
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:41,822
What's that?

395
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:45,090
A gift from your one true partner
Cellphone number-- Marlo Stanfield.

396
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,217
- How the fuck did you--
- Don't ask, don't tell.

397
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:50,019
It's like one of tho guys
sucking dick in the army.

398
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:52,740
Whatever else
I ever did to piss you off,

399
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:54,710
remember I also did this.

400
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:56,824
And, Carv?

401
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:58,714
When you put the bracelets
on that bitch,

402
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:01,716
remind him again of my fuckin' camera.

403
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:05,520
You can tell all of 'em--
Royce, the caucus,

404
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,690
all them Graspin' bitches who we put
in every city department--

405
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,429
You tell every last one
that I do not fall alone.

406
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,924
You think I'm gonna be the scapegoat
for the whole damn machine?

407
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,028
Shheeeeeet.

408
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:21,861
Clarence is going to stand with you.
He told me so. He'll be out there.

409
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:24,991
Easy for him.
He ain't runnin' for nuthin' no more.

410
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,357
I don't see you and
your kind with me on this.

411
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:30,037
A whole mess o' people think
they belong on the fence, don't they?

412
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:32,414
- It is what it is.
- Y'all better hope not.

413
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:34,191
Or it ain't gonna
end with Clay Davis.

414
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,615
Just take a moment and think
about what you're saying here.

415
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:40,390
You can have yourself a pity party,
talk all kinda shit to some prosecutor.

416
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:43,508
You know where you'll be then?
Out in the damn cold.

417
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:46,205
No connections, no allies,

418
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,840
nowhere to hang your hat
in this damn town.

419
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:51,636
Or you carry this for all of us,

420
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,091
carry it as far as you can.

421
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,957
And if the worst happens,
if they take your seat,

422
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:59,818
if you go away for a year or so
to some minimum-security summer camp,

423
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:02,444
then so what?
You come home to a town

424
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:04,701
that still knows your name.

425
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:09,024
Look at Burrell.

426
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,078
He goes quietly and now he's making

427
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:13,737
12 a year more
than when he was commissioner

428
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:15,657
and working half the hours.

429
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:18,850
You think that happens
if he does the piss-and-moan?

430
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:22,681
Prosecutors come
and prosecutors go.

431
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:28,354
But win or lose, you still gonna be
back around before we know it.

432
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,392
Am I right, Senator Davis?

433
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,819
You want me to find another carry-out?
Someplace closer?

434
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:45,745
- You don't like this food?
- I'm sayin',

435
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:48,450
I don't like the way them
chinky muhfuckas be acting sometimes.

436
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,456
The way they be lookin' at me.

437
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,335
Don't worry about it.

438
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,668
Chris with you?

439
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:01,810
Behind me.

440
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,991
What you got on?

441
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:07,096
What?

442
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,224
You want that faggot
to know we waitin' on his ass?

443
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:13,765
Just bein' careful is all.

444
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:16,855
If I can see the vest, you don't think
that he could see the vest?

445
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,517
I'm the one{ that's} baitin' him, {	hough, }right?

446
00:25:18,677 --> 00:25:20,487
{It seems }I'm the only one
who's not hidin' out.

447
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:21,648
Ain't no thing.

448
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,417
'Cause when Omar comin' at you,

449
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:25,338
he gon' be gunnin' at your head.

450
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,612
I know I would be.

451
00:25:29,284 --> 00:25:32,657
Stayed outside of Monk's all night.
They left before morning though.

452
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:34,598
They'll be back. No doubt.

453
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:38,657
Do you hear a lot of concern
regarding these murders?

454
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,239
- Haven't heard anybody mention it.
- No?

455
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:44,448
Most of the folks we serve
aren't actually homeless.

456
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,912
Most are working poor.

457
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:50,343
So most of the people
I interviewed here weren't--

458
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:52,893
Homeless? No.
Some, maybe.

459
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,741
- Why didn't you--
- You seemed to be getting along OK.

460
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,660
I didn't want to ruin it for you.

461
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:01,146
Where would you suggest I go then?

462
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,436
Streets maybe.

463
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,492
The reporter
the "Sun" papers sent over?

464
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,577
Not exactly Bob Woodward.

465
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:19,906
Hell of a job, Bubs.

466
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:23,011
But you know we need help tomorrow

467
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:25,120
waiting tables in the back room.

468
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,617
If you don't like it,
then I won't ask again.

469
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,384
Gotta hold it
with both hands, you know?

470
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,690
Tryin' to hit
what you aimin' at, a-ight?

471
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,231
It's not like they do in the movies.
Not goin' to work.

472
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,977
A-Ight, so come on,
spread your legs.

473
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:59,690
What's the first thing you gotta do?
Jack a round in the chamber.

474
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:01,343
Like this, watch.

475
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:03,388
Go ahead.

476
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:11,540
It's hard to do.

477
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,650
A-Ight.

478
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:15,430
So then...

479
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:17,260
try this.

480
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:22,624
It's a tool, just like a monkey wrench,
that's all it is, a-ight?

481
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:34,091
I ain't know it was gon' be so loud.

482
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:36,091
Why you even want to do this?

483
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,102
What is you thinkin', duke?

484
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:41,643
You think if you start carryin'
ain't nobody gonna try you?

485
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:44,562
Nah.
Somebody's always gonna try you.

486
00:27:45,184 --> 00:27:48,448
An' if they know that you carryin' they
gonna make you Come out with it.

487
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:52,148
An' once you come out with it,
you gotta be ready to go all the way.

488
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,428
You can't bring it out
unless you willin' to use it.

489
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,542
Can't be no doubt.

490
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:03,503
Man, can't shoot,

491
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:07,314
can't fight.
Can't even stand on the damn corner.

492
00:28:07,617 --> 00:28:10,444
You got other skills, man.
You smart like that.

493
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,984
I don't know, Bunk.

494
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:15,947
You can't believe
everything you read nowadays.

495
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,453
Well, my little shit-stirrer.

496
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,791
As per your request
for additional manpower and manhours,

497
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:29,351
unlimited overtime has been approved

498
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:32,091
for the investigation into
the killings of homeless men...

499
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,750
for you and one
other detective only.

500
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:36,879
What about surveillance teams?

501
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,017
We need to be watching some of
these places, watching the smokehounds.

502
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,457
Two detectives only.

503
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:44,857
You and the stalwart detective Greggs
here are what has Been authorized.

504
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,423
Nothing beyond that.

505
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,356
What the fuck, Jay? I'm working
a serial killer here. It's a red ball.

506
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:52,609
- Hence the overtime.
- But two detectives working a red ball?

507
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:54,684
What{ the fuck's} wrong with this city?

508
00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:58,583
We need hours for a dozen men.
We need surveillance vehicles, cameras.

509
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:06,581
What do you want from me?

510
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:09,106
Ain't you still working that triple
from two weeks ago?

511
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:11,057
I got stuff
I could run down on that, yeah.

512
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,004
But Jay put me on this here.

513
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:16,460
Come here.

514
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,984
Do you even see how fucking wrong
you are? Do you even see it?

515
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,826
They're gonna pay for this case, Bunk.

516
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:29,813
- This is just the beginning.
- {Pay for }What case?

517
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:32,471
You just took a real detective
off a real case behind your bullshit.

518
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:33,692
I'll fix that.

519
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:35,791
But eventually, these motherfuckers
are gonna pay

520
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:37,889
out enough for us
to do Marlo Stanfield.

521
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:39,418
Just watch and learn.

522
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,908
You've lost your fucking mind.
Look at you.

523
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:45,057
Half-lit every third night,
dead drunk every second.

524
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,041
Nut deep in random pussy.

525
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,919
And what little time you do
spend sober and limp-dicked,

526
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,178
you're working murders
that don't even exist.

527
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:04,264
Take the O.T. and work
the hell out of your triple.

528
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:06,850
Don't worry about your office reports.
I cover you for the bosses.

529
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,129
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just work your triple.

530
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:11,396
I'll cover every hour
of it from my case file.

531
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:18,258
Excuse me, sir. Sir.

532
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,283
I'm with the "Baltimore Sun."
Can I talk with you a minute?

533
00:30:23,674 --> 00:30:25,353
You make an appointment?

534
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:29,414
Sorry.
I'm booked up all afternoon.

535
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,690
I'm doing a story on the homeless men
who've Been killed.

536
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,352
You heard about that?

537
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:38,124
You got two dollars on you, right?

538
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:41,601
I was wondering if the murders
had changed things

539
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:43,845
for you and the other
fellas out here.

540
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:01,757
You wanna know about them murders?

541
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:04,411
- That's why I'm out here.
- Wanna know who's doing it?

542
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,801
- Do you know who's doing it?
- I do.

543
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,790
Can you handle hearing it?

544
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,983
What's your name?

545
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:12,833
Nathan Levi Boston.

546
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,026
And you know who the killer is?

547
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:18,427
Do you believe Satan
walks the earth in a fleshly form?

548
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,585
That satan can occupy
the souls of men?

549
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:24,037
And he's just getting started.

550
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,540
There's gonna be
a lot more dead before it's over.

551
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,411
Hundreds.

552
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:31,935
Maybe thousands.

553
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:56,631
They told me they still had you
working outta this shithole,

554
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,002
but I didn't believe it.

555
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:01,214
It ain't much, but it's been months
since a boss has been able to find me.

556
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:04,409
You still have some interest
in Marlo Stanfield, right?

557
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,188
That's his cell.

558
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,557
He stopped using cellphones.

559
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:11,554
Ellis.

560
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:12,814
How?

561
00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:15,981
Police work, detective.
Police work.

562
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:31,369
Yo, this the high hat?

563
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,849
<i>Say what?</i>

564
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,022
Y'all still open for carryout?

565
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:38,532
- I want some of that pepper steak.
- <i>Wrong number, fool.</i>

566
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,215
I wish I could tell you
it's a shock.

567
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,421
But it seems to happen
in every city where we get us

568
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:51,848
a place inside the power structure
and we become targets.

569
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:53,364
I know you're right.

570
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:55,355
I'm not saying
it's a black-white thing.

571
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,896
The state's attorney,
Mr. Bond, he's black.

572
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:01,883
But if it serves his purpose--
Gets his name in the news,

573
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:03,204
ups his profile--

574
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:05,912
He'll do whatever the folks
pulling the strings want him to do.

575
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:10,861
Whether it be character assassination,
tie the noose in the rope, whatever.

576
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,200
But they picked
the wrong man this time.

577
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,144
They must not 'a heard
about you, Senator.

578
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:17,070
- I don't run from a fight.
- I know that.

579
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,957
'Cause the people know--
Now I'm talkin' 'bout the people now--

580
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:22,224
The people know
what I've done for west Baltimore

581
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:23,630
and this city as a whole.

582
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,965
They know the battles I fight
in Annapolis every day.

583
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,635
They know these charges
ain't nothing but B.S.

584
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,428
Hey, hold it now.
It's radio.

585
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:32,263
I gotta hold my tongue, I know.

586
00:33:32,423 --> 00:33:35,102
I don't want nobody pullin'
y'all's broadcasting license,

587
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:36,976
So I can't say it like I feel it.

588
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:39,771
But I wanted to come here
on your show tonight--

589
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:42,833
And thank you so much
for the opportunity, my brother--

590
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:47,070
But I wanted your listeners to be
the first to hear it from my mouth.

591
00:33:47,315 --> 00:33:49,313
I have committed no crime,

592
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:52,706
And I am gonna keep on doing the
people's work without breaking stride.

593
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,496
I want to thank you for that, senator.

594
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:57,357
And also I want everybody to know,
lighty dine, everybody to know

595
00:33:57,517 --> 00:34:00,246
there's going to be a gathering
at the Mitchell courthouse

596
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,732
tomorrow at 2:00

597
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:03,904
So that people can be heard on this.

598
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:05,838
And I hope they come out
in good numbers.

599
00:34:05,998 --> 00:34:07,698
2:00 on Calvert street.

600
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:10,635
- It's time to lift every voice.
- I heard that.

601
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:14,443
3 detectives for a 24-hour wiretap.

602
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:17,805
4 more for a couple
2-man surveillance teams.

603
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:19,600
A pair of unmarked cars.

604
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:21,887
I'm not asking the world here, Cedric.

605
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:24,315
Lester, if I had it, you'd have it.

606
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:26,609
That's the cell number
of the motherfucker

607
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,946
who put 22 bodies on us.

608
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,392
- Go to the fucking mayor!
- I've been to the mayor.

609
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,452
I've been to him
on my knees twice already.

610
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:35,001
Once for your case, remember?

611
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:38,210
And all I could bring back was
2 men to work Clay Davis.

612
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,258
And yesterday, for the serial
killer that homicide was working?

613
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:42,371
2 men only.

614
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,273
I've done my job.
I've gone up the ladder every time.

615
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:48,961
But if a{ fucking} serial killer can't bring back
more than a couple detectives,

616
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:52,484
What the hell does it matter
that you have a fresh phone number?

617
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:02,966
More manpower's been assigned,
according to the P.I.O.

618
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:06,619
And?

619
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:08,776
I led with the first victim.

620
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:11,404
Ex-Marine.
Bronze-Star in Vietnam.

621
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:14,567
His family begged him to come home,
which he would do now and then,

622
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:17,643
but they hadn't seen him
in a month before the murder.

623
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:18,814
Good shit.

624
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,371
Real good shit.

625
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:22,115
Late, but you got the goods, right?

626
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:24,237
Half of these guys in the streets
are whack jobs,

627
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,002
the other half
just want to borrow *.

628
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:29,455
But yeah, I got good stuff.

629
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:32,990
Got a family of 4
under the Hanover street bridge.

630
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:36,012
Father broke down and cried
when I talked to him,

631
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:39,724
Talking about how he couldn't protect
himself, couldn't protect his kids.

632
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:42,560
Mother just kept stroking
the youngest one's blonde hair.

633
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,130
We got names on this, right?

634
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,105
Guy's name is, um...

635
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:50,354
Boston.
Nathan Levi Boston.

636
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:53,029
OK, you got 30 inches,
if you need them.

637
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:56,246
You're going off the front
in a package with Alma and Fletch.

638
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:59,577
Olesker wrote a pretty damn good
column, too, for Metro front.

639
00:35:59,832 --> 00:36:01,191
Go, go. Write, write.

640
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:05,260
This serial killer is making
one Baltimorean very, very happy.

641
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:07,724
Clay Davis.

642
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:11,089
One news cycle, and his indictment's
gonna be off the front page.

643
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,413
Well, if it bleeds, it leads.

644
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:15,660
A fucking serial killer.

645
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,656
I give them a sex-crazed madman
who's enough of a freakshow

646
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,564
to get the whole city hot and bothered
and what comes back?

647
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:23,241
One fucking detective.

648
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:26,922
And who is it? Kima Greggs,
who should be working her triple.

649
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:30,685
So now I can't give you her hours
without fucking up honest casework.

650
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:33,345
Well, now it's easier, Jimmy.
We don't need as much.

651
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:35,069
Now we need a wiretap.

652
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,156
I can monitor that myself.

653
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:40,315
Shit, anything we get up
is gonna be illegal anyway.

654
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:43,454
So we don't want anyone
getting near it. Sydnor, maybe.

655
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:44,904
I can trust him.

656
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:47,450
You start pulling information
off that phone,

657
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,219
You're gonna need at least a couple
of surveillance cars in the street.

658
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:52,930
We'll worry that when we get there.

659
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,217
The important thing is that
he's making it easy for us.

660
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,997
Before, with all that face-to-face,
we were gonna need what?

661
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:01,764
Remote cameras, microphones,

662
00:37:01,924 --> 00:37:04,517
half-a-dozen guys
working surveillance 24 hours.

663
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:07,825
But now he's talking on a phone,
and I got him.

664
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:12,028
So how do we squeeze a wiretap
out of my serial killer?

665
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,417
He's gotta call someone.

666
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:17,936
Who?

667
00:37:18,952 --> 00:37:20,013
The Mayor.

668
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,645
Cardinal Keeler.

669
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,113
Cal fucking Ripken.
Who gives a fuck?

670
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:29,542
A bullshit number on the paperwork
to the courthouse,

671
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:32,239
Marlo's cell number on the tap itself.

672
00:37:33,432 --> 00:37:35,067
This is fucking genius...

673
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:37,614
or not.

674
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:45,623
If that's about your case,
you need to answer it.

675
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,723
Remember you're working a serial killer.

676
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:49,513
Nah, it's my ex-wife.

677
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:53,613
I called her all night.
Like I got time for a fucking bullshit.

678
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:55,796
Thing is, they got to believe

679
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:58,487
it's your killer calling
before they'll pay for a wiretap.

680
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:00,158
Well, fine. Fuck it.

681
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:02,574
Call your buddy Oscar.
Tell him we need another body.

682
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:05,158
This time the sick motherfucker
is gonna call Mr. Ripken

683
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,728
with something
only the killer could know.

684
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:11,000
That should shake 'em up enough
for a couple of wiretaps.

685
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,228
Monk sure do like to retire early.

686
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:35,191
3 go in and 1 come out.

687
00:38:35,503 --> 00:38:36,758
Better odds.

688
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:42,679
We're gonna wait on it though.
They'll get better still.

689
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,576
If not tonight, then the next.

690
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,172
You're a patient man.

691
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,552
You, too.

692
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,768
I tried to reach you
on your cell all day long.

693
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:13,695
- I called Beadie, {she said }she had no idea...
- I know, I know. It's my fault.

694
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:14,772
They still up?

695
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:16,101
Yes.

696
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:21,782
Hey, guys.

697
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:23,086
Hey, dad.

698
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:25,490
Listen, Sean.

699
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,635
I wanted you to know I did everything
I could to get to your play tonight.

700
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:31,914
Hey, Mike.

701
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:39,479
It's cool.
No worries.

702
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:44,010
Your mom said you were great.
Why don't you it now?

703
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,791
- Let me hear it.
- I dunno.

704
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:48,877
It's lame like that.
You gotta see the whole play.

705
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,276
- What band is that?
- Dead Meadow.

706
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,277
Dead metal?

707
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:02,695
Meadow.
Dead Meadow.

708
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,945
What the hell's wrong
with the Ramones?

709
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:14,057
I'll make it up to them next weekend.
Take 'em to the ballgame or something.

710
00:40:15,098 --> 00:40:16,584
This is life, Jimmy.

711
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:18,662
This is the stuff that actually matters.

712
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:19,767
I know.

713
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:21,213
I talked to Beadie.

714
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:24,842
She knows she's losing you.
Like I knew.

715
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:26,580
I'm not judging.

716
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:29,375
I'm not saying this hurt you.

717
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,265
But she knows.

718
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:34,517
And she's ready for it,
the way that I was ready for it.

719
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:36,109
You're drinking.

720
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:39,148
You're out all night.
She doesn't know where you are.

721
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:40,961
And she's no fool, Jimmy.

722
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:44,529
I'm sad that it wasn't with me,

723
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:48,629
but I'm glad for you.

724
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,973
I know, you can imagine that?

725
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,338
I was glad that you found her.

726
00:40:57,549 --> 00:40:59,405
I was glad for her, even.

727
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:04,343
For a while there, you were happier
than I'd ever seen you.

728
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,312
She's great.

729
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:08,845
She is.

730
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:12,515
Don't do this.

731
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,150
Hey.

732
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:35,067
You all right, Bubs?

733
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:37,918
I'm good, I'm good.

734
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:40,881
'Cept for somethin'
that's been on my mind.

735
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,560
- But I see you into somethin' though...
- I can take a minute.

736
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,999
Need to find somethin' out.

737
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:48,295
But at the same time,
I don't know if I really wanna know.

738
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:52,263
It's best to know, Bubs.
I'm living proof.

739
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:54,211
They got drugs an' shit now.

740
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,225
Why's it on your mind now?

741
00:41:56,821 --> 00:41:59,829
Been volunteering down Viva house,
doin' like you told me.

742
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:02,064
Man say he want me to serve food.

743
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:04,590
You can. It don't travel like that.

744
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,068
I know they say so,

745
00:42:06,228 --> 00:42:07,356
but I feel...

746
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:09,367
I dunno.

747
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,258
I went down to the clinic
on my own yesterday,

748
00:42:12,418 --> 00:42:14,108
Got as far as the door, but...

749
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:15,741
Tough to go alone.

750
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:17,549
Yeah.

751
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:20,333
Gimme 10 minutes.

752
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:25,288
So where do we take it today?

753
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,799
Unless the story develops,
I think we've covered the bases.

754
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:32,678
I'd say that Alma can check on things
and see where we're at by afternoon.

755
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:35,433
You owe me a govans story.
And you need to get with Shane and

756
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:37,590
figure out what's going on
with that school series.

757
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,668
I dunno, Gus.
I think this thing has legs.

758
00:42:39,828 --> 00:42:41,718
Maybe I go out with the cops
on their rounds.

759
00:42:41,878 --> 00:42:43,772
- Watch 'em warn the homeless.
- Good thought,

760
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:46,883
but Alma can work that
into whatever file she has.

761
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,237
Hey.

762
00:43:01,617 --> 00:43:02,467
Busy?

763
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:04,771
Naw, just, uh...

764
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,532
Jimmy's not in yet.

765
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:12,421
I know.
He's sleeping one off.

766
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:17,058
- Late night, huh?
- They're all like that now.

767
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:21,124
Relax.
I'm not looking for a snitch.

768
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,698
I know you're his partner
in crime. I don't care.

769
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,191
I just want to know from you
where this is going.

770
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:30,849
I mean, you know him. You know
what it is that he can and can't do.

771
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:32,794
Dunno if I can speak on that.

772
00:43:32,954 --> 00:43:35,043
Look, I'm ready to put him out. OK?

773
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:36,966
For me, for my kids...

774
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:40,066
I mean, if in the end,
if this is all there is to him.

775
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:43,207
If he can't be better than this,
I just want to know.

776
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:45,505
He's working this case right now.

777
00:43:47,382 --> 00:43:48,642
Serial killer, actually.

778
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:51,351
You are not gonna try
to tell me this is about a case.

779
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:53,676
- Try that shit on some civilian.
- Look,

780
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:56,382
he'll get his head in a certain place,
he'll take a drink.

781
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:58,248
I mean, a lot of us will.

782
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:00,812
It's more than just
a drink he's taking.

783
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,088
Beadie, I can't tell you what to do.

784
00:44:07,749 --> 00:44:09,252
I don't like giving up.

785
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,098
OK, I gotta go back to work.
Thanks for letting me vent.

786
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,233
Hey, you want to get started today?
Sooner we decide on a school--

787
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:29,757
After lunch, yeah.

788
00:45:18,603 --> 00:45:20,195
Finally found a line, huh?

789
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:23,182
Know that wasn't easy.
They been hidin' for years.

790
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:24,473
I'm a pro.

791
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:25,768
Me, too.

792
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:27,997
Lemme ask you...

793
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:30,939
When do results come back?

794
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,810
'Bout an hour from this test.

795
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:35,486
Here ya go.

796
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:40,532
And they want you to believe that
there's only one side to this story,

797
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:44,370
and that their so-called facts
cannot be denied.

798
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:48,165
But we have some facts
of our own, don't we?

799
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:51,376
We know who our leaders are.

800
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:55,457
And we don't want them
picking our leaders for us, do we?

801
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:56,623
No!

802
00:45:56,783 --> 00:46:01,087
And we will not stand idly by
as they singled out our leaders

803
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:05,554
and selectively prosecute--
Or should I say persecute them--

804
00:46:05,714 --> 00:46:10,409
just because they have the courage
and the fortitude to stand up for us.

805
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:14,233
Let them hear you.

806
00:46:14,393 --> 00:46:16,985
Let them hear you
loud and clear.

807
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,990
Clay Davis isn't going
anywhere, is he?

808
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,070
No!

809
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:24,537
We need him,

810
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:26,242
we're going to keep him,

811
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:29,707
and damn anyone who says otherwise.

812
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:31,210
Clay Davis!

813
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:41,056
What the fuck is this I hear
about you might not stand tall on this?

814
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,757
You got that wrong, old friend.

815
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:45,222
- I'm gonna carry this.
- You damn sure better.

816
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,654
Because if you don't you won't be able

817
00:46:47,814 --> 00:46:50,032
to squeeze another
greenback outta this town

818
00:46:50,192 --> 00:46:52,198
for the rest of your natural life.

819
00:46:52,662 --> 00:46:56,442
* We shall not be--
We shall not be moved *

820
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:03,890
Lookey here.

821
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:06,773
- The fuck is that?
- Change of pace.

822
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:10,684
They look kinda hot
with their clothes on.

823
00:47:13,903 --> 00:47:15,649
Hey, clarice.

824
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:19,173
Your serial killer
called the "Baltimore Sun".

825
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,960
Some goof claiming to be your guy
called a reporter over there.

826
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,761
- One of the guys writing this shit up.
- It's gotta be a crank call.

827
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,138
Probably so.

828
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:28,284
But seeing as
it's the fucking newspaper,

829
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:31,894
you go over there
and you set them straight.

830
00:47:49,627 --> 00:47:50,578
Go 'head.

831
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:00,837
Negative.

832
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:07,144
- Negative means...
- I know what it means.

833
00:48:09,257 --> 00:48:11,517
- Must be wrong.
- It ain't wrong.

834
00:48:11,677 --> 00:48:13,128
All the shit I done.

835
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:15,493
All the works I shared.

836
00:48:15,653 --> 00:48:16,896
My best boy years back?

837
00:48:17,056 --> 00:48:19,040
I fired off the same hype
as him dozens of times.

838
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,855
He had the bug for sure.

839
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:25,068
That shit ain't right nohow, man.

840
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:28,007
You're disappointed.

841
00:48:29,111 --> 00:48:31,042
Shit, this ain't
about the bug, is it?

842
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:34,957
This is you, tryin' to make the past
be everything, mean everything.

843
00:48:35,117 --> 00:48:37,977
You don't even wanna think
about the here and now.

844
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:39,656
Sorry, Bubs.

845
00:48:40,386 --> 00:48:42,676
Shame ain't worth
as much as you think.

846
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:45,217
Let it go.

847
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:53,183
He said he wanted people to know there'd
be 12 bodies before he's finished.

848
00:48:53,584 --> 00:48:55,993
He said, "I came to take 12."

849
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:59,314
I said, "what happens after 12?"
He said,

850
00:48:59,474 --> 00:49:01,164
"I go somewhere else."

851
00:49:01,783 --> 00:49:04,570
I asked him about the bite marks.
He said that they wanted him to bite,

852
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:06,390
that they asked for that.

853
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,714
He complained that the article
made him sound like a pervert.

854
00:49:09,874 --> 00:49:12,717
I asked him if he was
angry at the men.

855
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:14,204
He hung up.

856
00:49:14,508 --> 00:49:17,708
He called you on your cellphone?
Why didn't he call the paper?

857
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:21,920
I was all over the city yesterday
handing my cards out to homeless men.

858
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,474
He probably got the number from a card.

859
00:49:24,783 --> 00:49:26,425
Shit, I might'a handed him a card.

860
00:49:26,585 --> 00:49:29,484
I think this is the guy. I mean,{ detective,}
a chill ran down my back.

861
00:49:29,644 --> 00:49:30,929
There's no way to know.

862
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:34,558
If it's {one other}another nut, we're gonna look
like fools if we print any of this.{un any of this in print.}

863
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,893
Your cellphone caught the number?
He dialed you.

864
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:40,285
I dialed it back. Payphone
on south Hanover near West street.

865
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:47,423
- What did he sound like?
- What do you mean?

866
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,026
You talk to people for a living.

867
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,949
Did he sound black, white?
Younger, older?

868
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:52,524
High-pitched voice or low?

869
00:49:52,802 --> 00:49:54,968
He sounded, to me, like a white guy.

870
00:49:55,238 --> 00:49:58,707
Not a deep voice, but calm,
almost monotone.

871
00:49:59,549 --> 00:50:01,411
He sounded older,
I would say,

872
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:03,795
40s.
Not a real young guy.

873
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:06,465
- Can I have your notebook?
- You can't have his notes.

874
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,520
As this isn't a confidential source,
we won't invoke the Maryland shield law,

875
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,220
But he'll type up a copy
and give them to you.

876
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,098
But the actual document
is property of the "Baltimore Sun."

877
00:50:15,258 --> 00:50:17,809
So type it up, like now.

878
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:20,460
So, you're saying
this could be the killer.

879
00:50:20,924 --> 00:50:22,698
Can we talk off-the-record?

880
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:26,777
The homicide unit
received a phone call this morning

881
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:29,072
from a payphone
from the same neighborhood,

882
00:50:29,232 --> 00:50:33,057
and based on Scott's voice description,
and the use of the number 12,

883
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:38,121
Well, let's just say we need to find
whoever it was made both those calls.

884
00:50:38,354 --> 00:50:39,748
He made another call?

885
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:41,726
Detective, as a newsman,

886
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:44,529
I'm inclined to include
these details in our coverage

887
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:48,131
if there's a credible chance the killer
was really in contact with our reporter.

888
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,801
Would doing so have any negative
effect on your investigation?

889
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:54,239
Actually, these calls
are our best means of finding this guy.

890
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:57,918
Every call he makes, every word
he says-- To you and to us--

891
00:50:58,078 --> 00:50:59,685
Can only provide information.

892
00:51:00,468 --> 00:51:03,522
- If we do run a story--
- {But }You can't say he's contacting police.

893
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:06,274
You can't print that part of it
under any circumstances.

894
00:51:06,614 --> 00:51:08,348
OK, then how do we characterize

895
00:51:08,508 --> 00:51:10,487
what the police think
about this call to Scott?

896
00:51:10,718 --> 00:51:13,834
You can say that we're...
taking it seriously.

897
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,356
Going forward, is it possible that

898
00:51:16,516 --> 00:51:19,528
you would grant
a one-party consent for us to...

899
00:51:20,064 --> 00:51:22,224
monitor your reporter's
cellphone and office phones?

900
00:51:22,384 --> 00:51:24,441
- Absolutely not.
- I'm sorry, detective,

901
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:26,300
but our ability to report is dependent

902
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,813
upon our maintaining the confidentiality
of our conversations.

903
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:33,590
Now, we're perfect willing
to share with you the information

904
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,763
that this individual has as he's
definitely not a confidential source.

905
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:39,357
But we're not going to consent
to the Baltimore police department

906
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,018
monitoring our phones.

907
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:43,895
- You'll tap the payphone, I guess.
- Don't print that either.

908
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:46,836
Don't print anything about
where the killer calls from.

909
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:48,442
He'll change up.

910
00:51:50,698 --> 00:51:52,511
Well, I'll type up my notes quick.

911
00:51:54,036 --> 00:51:55,429
Big story for you guys, huh?

912
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:58,869
Well, 10 minutes ago I'd'a said
this whole thing was complete bullshit.

913
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,933
Shows what I know, I guess.

914
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,158
<i>... which is why
I'm going to fight this thing.</i>

915
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,135
<i>I am innocent and I have done
nothing except serve the people.</i>

916
00:52:20,295 --> 00:52:21,725
<i>Oh, I believe you, Senator.</i>

917
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:24,338
<i>I've seen all the good work
you've done for the community.</i>

918
00:52:24,498 --> 00:52:25,951
<i>You definitely have my sup...</i>

919
00:52:36,908 --> 00:52:38,632
That's Eddie Cantor, right?

920
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:39,980
No.

921
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:42,701
It's perfect.

922
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,757
McNulty, it's perfect.

923
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:48,053
I couldn't believe it.
I'm sitting there.

924
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:49,635
All this bullshit coming at me,

925
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:51,733
thinking,
Christ, this is a waste of time.

926
00:52:51,893 --> 00:52:54,142
Then I realized:
this is the wiretap.

927
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:55,891
Right here.
They're giving it to me.

928
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:57,885
Never mind me
making a crank call to someone.

929
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:00,884
This right here is Lester Freamon's
motherfucking wire.

930
00:53:10,276 --> 00:53:11,823
What if they check this?

931
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,029
How many guys in this unit
have ever hooked up a wiretap?

932
00:53:16,189 --> 00:53:19,540
They don't know
which wire goes where.

933
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:22,369
Explain it to me again,
because I tell ya,

934
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,788
I think I'm a smart guy,
but this shit makes my head hurt.

935
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:27,200
They think they're up
on your killer's cellphone,

936
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,417
but they'll never catch
a call because this...

937
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:30,943
...goes nowhere.

938
00:53:31,103 --> 00:53:34,365
And meanwhile, using the same
court authorization,

939
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:36,721
I'm up on the live wire
down at the detail office,

940
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,136
Listening to Marlo.
Every day,

941
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:41,326
you file office and court reports

942
00:53:41,486 --> 00:53:44,486
saying there's been no further
contacwith the serial killer.

943
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:46,169
I file exactly nothing,

944
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:51,348
but use what I hear
to rig the case on our real target.

945
00:53:51,766 --> 00:53:54,303
- And when it goes to court...
- there's no mention of a wiretap.

946
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:56,403
- It's all based on a C.I.
- There it is.

947
00:53:56,563 --> 00:53:58,874
4 copies signed by the judge.

948
00:53:59,383 --> 00:54:00,665
Emergency order

949
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:06,171
for telephonic intercept
of a cellphone, number 915-0909.

950
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:08,874
If the machine is rigged,
you're good to go.

951
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:11,185
- You're up.
- Good hunting.

952
00:54:11,345 --> 00:54:12,334
- Holley?
- Yo!

953
00:54:12,494 --> 00:54:14,054
You got midnight shift.

954
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:16,675
Worden'll be in
to relieve you at 6:00.

955
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,333
After Worden, my squad will pick
up monitoring on the dayshift.

956
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:26,375
Excuse me.

957
00:54:27,104 --> 00:54:28,496
Don't look so pissy.

958
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:30,962
We're actually
paying overtime for this.

959
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,875
O-Dog!

960
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:37,295
My leg!

961
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:39,221
Stay the fuck down!

962
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:25,652
What the...

963
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:32,211
Damn.

964
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:09,167
What the...
