1
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,700
- but if we...

2
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,497
but how can...

3
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:29,230
- jesus christ.

4
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,996
- so this means that,
uh...

5
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,196
- so no one killed
any homeless men.

6
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,028
- no serial killer.

7
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:43,761
some were random killings,
some were natural deaths

8
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,893
that were likely manipulated.

9
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,427
but they're not linked
in any way.

10
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:48,760
- but why?

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,460
- the detectives used
the money to fund a case

12
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,926
against the drug
traffickers responsible

13
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:53,826
for the slayings in
the vacants a year ago.

14
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,825
- last week's arrests and
seizures were a direct result.

15
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,891
- so let me just
understand this...

16
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,790
so i've been going out there
for weeks,

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,957
slamming the governor for
his neglect of the

18
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:08,558
homeless and declaring
how we will stop

19
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:09,656
at nothing to findhe
person responsible for

20
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:11,889
preying on the homeless
and all the while--

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,556
hey, norman,
this is my ass here.

22
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,522
- that's true, boss.

23
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,955
but it does have a
certain charm to it.

24
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,254
they manufactured
an issue to get paid,

25
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:23,987
we manufactured an
issue to get you

26
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,354
elected governor.

27
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:28,387
everybody's gettin'
what they need behind

28
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,287
some make-believe.

29
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,953
- the detectives involved
will be suspended and

30
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,486
ultimately fired,
at the least.

31
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,553
beyond that,
a criminal prosecution

32
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,752
on fraud and perjury
charges is probable.

33
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:39,951
- so, what, you're saying
we call a press conference

34
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,251
and we say,
"hey, by the way,

35
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,951
"all that stuff about homeless
people getting killed and

36
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,917
"the governor cutting
the safety net and us doing

37
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:49,184
"everything in our power
to catch the guy,

38
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,582
hey, guess what,
the joke's on us?"

39
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:53,383
- not to mention that
the evidence against

40
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:56,715
the traffickers arrested
last week is tainted.

41
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,981
that case could
collapse as well.

42
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:00,581
- i don't fucking
believe this.

43
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:03,215
you two are on point here.

44
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:04,680
word of this gets
down to annapolis,

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,181
the governor's
gonna wreck me with it.

46
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,548
and if it comes to that,
you guys drop on your swords,

47
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:09,548
so help me.

48
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:10,646
- how does word
not get out

49
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:14,280
once we suspend
the detectives?

50
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,045
never mind sending it
to the grand jury

51
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:20,245
- the cops that did this,
they gotta go.

52
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,244
you cannot be telling me
i have to live with this.

53
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,811
- deputy, counselor...

54
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,278
if you two will excuse us,
we are going to

55
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,743
discuss this first as
a matter of public policy.

56
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,643
until we can reason the
best way to address this,

57
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:34,009
do nothing and speak
to no one

58
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:35,443
about any of this.

59
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:38,242
- if this becomes
public in the wrong way,

60
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,108
a lot of people who
were legally responsible

61
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:41,908
for the situation,
good people

62
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:45,308
who were nonetheless in a
supervisory role here...

63
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:47,207
are going to suffer.

64
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:49,174
and that's not the
outcome that anyone wants.

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,839
- what mike is saying is
that we need to

66
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,339
be very careful
about how to proceed.

67
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,071
- i wish i was still
at the newspaper

68
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,737
so i could write
on this mess.

69
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,936
it's too fuckin' good.

77
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:07,583
we don't have anything
scheduled from you today,

78
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,451
i don't think...

79
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,183
- 40,000 from the showboat
on the boardwalk.

80
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:20,149
26 at the borgata.

81
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,082
80 over the last
year at the taj mahal...

82
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,148
and that's just the
atlantic city casinos.

83
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:29,014
- i like to play. so what?

84
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,347
- you lost three times
your salary over

85
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:32,746
the last two years.

86
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:35,780
i ran you through sentinel
title and came back

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,346
with seven pages of liens
and a third mortgage

88
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,545
you folded on two months ago.

89
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,278
gary, you're done.

90
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,512
- what do you mean?

91
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,711
- we found sealed grand
jury papers in the houses

92
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,210
of drug dealers.

93
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,210
and we've got people
naming you on it.

94
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:56,143
you have a problem, gary.

95
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,143
but you have friends
in this courthouse,

96
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:00,709
lifelong friends.

97
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:03,409
cop to the problem,
give up the names of those

98
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,275
that bought from you.

99
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,573
disbarred? yeah, no doubt.

100
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:10,707
but you play it clean
from this moment on,

101
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,273
and we both know
you'll probably walk.

102
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,706
- why did you look at me?

103
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:18,407
- i ran the finances
on everyone who worked

104
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:20,339
this unit over the
last couple years.

105
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:21,738
you were the only bogie.

106
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:23,439
if the s.a.o. weren't
so screwed up,

107
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,972
they'd have been
running background

108
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:26,204
checks as a routine.

109
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,804
but i guess you knew that.

110
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:32,404
- i always wondered if they'd
get their shit together.

111
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:34,504
but that's baltimore,
isn't it?

112
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:40,269
so what happens now?

113
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,102
- well, for starters...

114
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:48,534
you're gonna make
a phone call.

115
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,334
- mcnulty, freamon,

116
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:54,666
sydnor,

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,433
anyone who has the smell of
this on them should be gone.

118
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,366
before the close of business,
they should be suspended

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,099
and before the end
of the week, indicted.

120
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,298
- i know, but...
- but what?

121
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,831
we're gonna let this shit
stand because it'll

122
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,465
hurt carcetti to air it out?

123
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,064
instead of cleaning
house like we need to,

124
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,663
he's up there figuring
out how to hide the dirt.

125
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,131
i swear, i gotta mind
to call the governor myself

126
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,131
and just let it fly.

127
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,196
- cedric, you can't.
- why not?

128
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,996
if i let this thing stand,
i might as well just

129
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,996
roll over and play dead
for every police

130
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:20,195
who knows about this.

131
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,229
we cover this up...

132
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,727
- cedric, you can't
do anything.

133
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:28,727
those are your detectives.

134
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,395
they need someone to blame,
they will measure you for it...

135
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:32,993
- i don't give a fuck.

136
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:37,394
- and they'll fire me.

137
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,292
you heard steintorf...

138
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:48,524
i was in charge of this thing.

139
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,524
i was on that wiretap...

140
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,656
this is my career.

141
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:55,957
this is everything.

142
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:05,621
you go public,
and it hurts carcetti.

143
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,688
maybe he doesn't get
to be governor.

144
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:12,021
but he is still the mayor
and bond is still my boss

145
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,886
and you know the weight
will not fall on them.

146
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,186
it never does.

147
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,353
- christ.

148
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:20,819
- everything
i've worked for, all those years

149
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,618
in that courthouse...

150
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,084
please.

151
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:36,683
- 25 cents.
"baltimore sun."

152
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,383
sir, "baltimore sun."
one quarter.

153
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:48,647
- keep it.
- thank you, sir. thank you.

154
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:52,314
- people tip pretty good,
don't they?

155
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,447
- paining for what
he had done to us.

156
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,447
i'm sorry for him, man,
really, but i still

157
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,645
can't let him come up
from the basement.

158
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,778
you gonna put all
that in the paper?

159
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,711
- that's the plan.

160
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,544
- even the parts
about sherrod?

161
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:10,877
- yeah.

162
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,411
- what good is...

163
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,609
what good is a story
like that?

164
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,176
- like what?

165
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:20,709
- me, sherrod.
gettin' high. not gettin' high.

166
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,142
my sister,
all that shit in there.

167
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,142
what good do any of that
do to put it in the newspaper?

168
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,575
- people read it,
they think about it.

169
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:27,608
maybe see things different.

170
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,774
- i don't know, man.

171
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:30,907
- bubs, you don't
want me to do this,

172
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,041
i won't do it.

173
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,506
- i don't know.

174
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,973
"baltimore sun."
a little bit of sun.

175
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:41,406
sun paper.

176
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:42,705
- look, rupert,
you can go public with

177
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:43,772
this thing if you want,

178
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:46,006
but your shop is going
to come out looking

179
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:47,271
worse for letting it
happen in the first place.

180
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,504
- the better move is
to shut it down quietly

181
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:50,904
and then deal with
those responsible

182
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,437
through back channels.

183
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,170
we'll bury these guys softly,

184
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,870
and in a hole so deep
no one will ever get close

185
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,204
to digging them up.

186
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:03,535
- i can see that.

187
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,801
- commissioner,
do you agree?

188
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:10,035
- well, it is a
little more problematic for me.

189
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,633
the offenders are in my shop,
are they not?

190
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:19,433
- can i have a word with you
in private, bill?

191
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:22,733
- hey, if rawls isn't in,
i'm not either.

192
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,165
- oh, i wouldn't worry
about bill rawls.

193
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:27,531
i believe he's about to
have one of those road

194
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,931
to damascus moments....

195
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,264
- i can see what
you're thinking in there.

196
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,629
i can see the gears
grinding in that head

197
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,997
of yours.

198
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,996
you're thinking, hey,
i might have some wood

199
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,495
on carcetti here.

200
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:44,829
after all, there's no way
they can pin the blame

201
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,795
on me for this fiasco
without doing their

202
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,395
boy daniels, too, right?

203
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,828
you're thinking we'd have
to fire daniels

204
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,761
to fire you and
that wouldn't sit well

205
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,394
given how much we've
already sold daniels.

206
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,693
isn't that what you're thinking?

207
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:56,827
and so you're telling
yourself maybe there's

208
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:58,626
a way for you
to leverage this.

209
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,859
to get yourself a full
term as commissioner,

210
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,293
to delay daniels a
few more years in

211
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:04,026
exchange for you
shutting the fuck up

212
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,459
and doing what
you're told.

213
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:08,359
and you know what, bill?
you're not far off.

214
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,292
you do have a little
leverage here,

215
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,623
but just a little.

216
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:14,490
and i wouldn't overplay
your hand.

217
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,191
- how would you play it?

218
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,490
- i'd shut the fuck up
and wait your turn,

219
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:18,856
and when tommy gets
to the statehouse,

220
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:20,756
he brings you
with him to be state

221
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,990
police superintendent,

222
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,822
because while you may be
a shade too white

223
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:28,022
to run the baltimore
department,

224
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:35,388
you're just about right
for the m.s.p.

225
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,786
- i have your word?

226
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:38,486
- and i have yours.

227
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,784
- back channel is
the way to go.

228
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:51,918
- see?

229
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:54,783
the police commissioner
done fell off his ass.

230
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,016
- can i help you?

231
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:06,349
- um, i need to see
mr. prezbo.

232
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:08,848
- someone will come down.

233
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,345
- are you a student here?

234
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,978
- ms. donnelly, it's me,
duquan.

235
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,044
- well, it's good to see
you, duquan,

236
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:37,676
but you're not a student
here so i can't

237
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:39,643
let you inside.

238
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,010
- i just came past to see
mr. prezbo.

239
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,475
- well, he's teaching
right now.

240
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:46,909
- i know. i can wait.

241
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,775
- well, you're gonna
have to stay outside,

242
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:50,574
and after the bell,
i'll tell

243
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,408
mr. pryzbylewski you're out
here for him, okay?

244
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,839
- i'm going to surprise
you with something.

245
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,205
- you already have.

246
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:09,705
- i got a tip from
an informant about a

247
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,072
leak out of the grand
jury unit,

248
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,004
sad to say it's
checked out.

249
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,204
- we know about the leak.

250
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:17,171
- yeah, but do you
know who it is?

251
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,237
gary dipasquale.

252
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,337
decent enough guy,
but he's got a bear of

253
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:23,103
a gambling problem
and a bank of

254
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,669
drug lawyers who are
willing to pay for

255
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,035
their look-sees.

256
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,302
troy sanders, marvin bronfman,

257
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:31,500
dennis cray, sid silverstein.

258
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,801
and the pick
of the litter? maurice levy.

259
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:38,334
i kid you not.

260
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,833
- gary is their leak?

261
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,033
- he broke right away.

262
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,799
he was ready to give it up.
he needed to.

263
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,966
one-party consent
call implicating maury levy.

264
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,432
- where's gary now?

265
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,165
- he went up to the second
floor to hand

266
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,931
in his letter of
resignation, then he went home

267
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,231
to wait for the sword
to drop.

268
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:59,697
he's oy,
he's better than you'd think.

269
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,629
you know, if we can turn
levy and some of these

270
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:05,229
other drug lawyers,
we can route the drug

271
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,262
money all over town.

272
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,661
it's sad business,
i know, but at least

273
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:13,429
we know the truth now,
right?

274
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,428
- the truth, you say?

275
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,458
- hey.
- duquan, hello.

276
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:27,458
- snatch-pops.

277
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:30,326
- hey!- damien. you lost

278
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,391
- but i said snatch-pops.
- i don't care what you said.

279
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,857
you're gonna buy him
a new sandwich,

280
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,958
and past that, you're gonna
go inside and ask mr. williams

281
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:37,358
for a broom to clean that up,
you understand?

282
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,690
- but, mr. p...

283
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,057
- right now, damien,
orou're mine for another

284
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,190
week of detention.

285
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,790
i don't want to hear
another word.

286
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,922
- looks like you got
the hang of it.

287
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,088
- what's up with you, duquan?

288
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,088
- oh, ain't nothing.

289
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,422
- you still at southwestern?

290
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:58,720
- well, i'm, like, needing
a semester off,

291
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,987
you know?

292
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,054
i'm outdoors now.

293
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:05,619
and, um...

294
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:08,420
i was hoping maybe i
could get with you

295
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,952
and borrow some money,

296
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,651
so i could get a place
and some clean clothes

297
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:14,685
and get myself
settled so i can go back

298
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:16,951
to school.

299
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,450
- you're on the street?

300
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,884
- i mean, i got some people
ready to give me

301
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,350
a really, really good place
if i can come up

302
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:22,716
with some money for it.

303
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,416
- how much do you need?

304
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,282
- couple hundred.

305
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:32,416
but if you could go
one fifty more,

306
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,014
i could enroll
in the g.e.d. program

307
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,514
down b.c.c.c.

308
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,214
then i could get my
g.e.d. without having

309
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:39,513
to go back to southwestern,

310
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,113
then i could get
my work permit.

311
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,213
- i don't think
you're eligible for

312
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,812
a g.e.d. program if
you're still of age

313
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,912
to attend high school,
duquan.

314
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,679
- yeah, you are.

315
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,178
- i'll tell you what.

316
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,843
give me a couple minutes,
i'll drive you down there.

317
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:00,044
and if you are eligible,
i'll write a check

318
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:01,344
right to the bursar's
office down there.

319
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,510
- naw, mr. p., you ain't
got to through all that.

320
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,742
besides, i really ain't
got the time to

321
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,609
go down there today.

322
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,209
but, you know, i'm gonna.

323
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,608
- i can do it, duquan,
if that's what you want.

324
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,640
and i don't even care
about the money.

325
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,874
but understand i'm gonna
go down to b.c.c.c.

326
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:24,173
in a few days and find
out if you're enrolled.

327
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:26,572
if you are,
i'm gonna say, "great,

328
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:28,471
"duquan can come past
with his certificate

329
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,438
"when he gets it,
and we're still friends

330
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:33,939
and he can still
rely on me."

331
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:38,271
but if you aren't enrolled,
then...

332
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:41,103
well, i imagine i'm not
gonna see you again,

333
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:42,270
am i?

334
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,304
- no, mr. p.

335
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,070
i'm definitely gonna enroll.

336
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:47,735
you'll see.

337
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,068
- i'll get my stuff.

338
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,402
i'll meet you in the lot
and we'll go find

339
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:56,701
a bank machine.

340
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,034
- jay, all i'm saying
is we've run down

341
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:05,732
all the leads we had,
all the office reports

342
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:08,099
are in and at this point,
barring any new developments,

343
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,266
i don't need all
this fucking manpower.

344
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:11,765
- fuck me, jimmy.

345
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,365
last week you were crying
for every swinging

346
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:14,598
dick you could get
your hands on.

347
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:15,998
- well, the case
has gone quiet.

348
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,031
there's no red ribbons.
there's no bodies.

349
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,298
there's no disappearances.

350
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,398
there's not a fucking
word on the cell phone.

351
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,630
this thing's fucking
thing is useless.

352
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,896
- so what? you don't want
the wiretap either now?

353
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:25,763
- well, the judge gave
us 60 days,

354
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:27,096
once that runs out,
then...

355
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:28,330
- motherfucker,
you were the one who was

356
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:30,628
all semper fi for this
serial killer

357
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,929
and now you're fuckin'
the dog.

358
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:33,528
- jay, i'm ready
to work the case.

359
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:35,560
but short of any new
leads or developments,

360
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,361
what the fuck do you
want me to do?

361
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,927
i can't make shit up,
can i?

362
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,860
it is what it is.

363
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,526
- if i send the
surveillance teams back, jimmy,

364
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,792
don't come crying for
more manpower tomorrow.

365
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:48,926
you hear?

366
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,959
- shit is like a war,
ain't it?

367
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,358
easy to get in,
hell to geout.

368
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,855
- pearlman
knows everything. daniels, too.

369
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:18,021
they figured it out.

370
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,687
- how?
- i don't know.

371
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,954
- jesus.
what are they...

372
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:24,920
- i don't know.

373
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,120
she made it clear
in no uncertain terms

374
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,387
there are not to be any
further homeless killings.

375
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:30,518
nothing more on this
case whatsoever.

376
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,585
- does she know about marlo,
that our case--

377
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:33,785
- she knows everything.

378
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:36,285
daniels knows.

379
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,318
they went down to the
e.c.u., dialed up the wiretap

380
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,784
number and up pop's
marlo's cell phone.

381
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:43,950
- why aren't we fired?
why aren't we in fucking
bracelets?

382
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,250
- i don't know.

383
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:48,149
- oh shit, lester.

384
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:50,649
we gotta get outta here.

385
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,182
we gotta think this
thing through.

386
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:54,547
oh, jesus fucking christ.

387
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:56,348
- look, meet me down
at kavanaugh's in ten minutes,

388
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:57,714
all right?

389
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:09,679
- jimmy?

390
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,009
- how much?

391
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:41,674
- two hundred.

392
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:42,908
- damn, boy.

393
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,140
teacher must love
your black ass.

394
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,307
c'mon with it.

395
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,472
they gonna put out testers
up on poplar grove.

396
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,006
we gonna be late for it.

397
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,703
c'mon, boy. c'mon.

398
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:04,904
c'mon.

399
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,767
- deputy...

400
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,663
- to be continued.

401
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,363
- fuck fuck fucking fuck.

402
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,394
- ah, what's the matter?

403
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:58,461
cottage cheese for lunch
again there, carl?

404
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,426
- just because it happened
doesn't mean it's news.

405
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,960
there's always a
salmonella outbreak somewhere.

406
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,893
i don't see why we have to
cover this one...

407
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:12,093
- what's the first rule
of rewrite, spry?

408
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:13,525
- shoot it down.

409
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,892
- did you read this?

410
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:20,390
we are crediting our
own coverage with

411
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,291
changing the
governor's mind?

412
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,157
i'm already to the jump
and there's not a

413
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,589
quote from anyone
crediting us

414
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:28,789
with anything of the sort.

415
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,956
- yeah, the guv
is restoring funding, all right.

416
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,622
that's 'cause carcetti's
been beating the shit

417
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,289
out of him
on this issue.

418
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:35,755
we're just an afterthought.

419
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:38,289
- whiting can smell the
public service pulitzer, huh?

420
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,687
- seems so.

421
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:40,854
- you get a chance yet?

422
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:42,754
- yeah, yeah. i read it.

423
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:43,954
- and?

424
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,120
- beautiful.

425
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:49,887
no, no, no. i mean it.

426
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,652
you got some real joe mitchell
stuff on the page there.

427
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:55,585
really makes me feel like
i know this guy and his world.

428
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:57,851
you just pulled it all
through the keyhole.

429
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,051
- thanks, gus.

430
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,751
- we get some good art,
i'm gonna push for

431
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:01,885
the sunday front.

432
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:03,084
- well, the thing is,
i gotta make sure

433
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:04,284
the guy is good
with it.

434
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:05,583
- what do you mean?

435
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:07,217
- the part of the story about
the kid still bothers him,

436
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:09,250
and when he told me about it,
he was just talking...

437
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:10,782
- you told him you were
writing about him, right?

438
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:12,216
- i know, but...

439
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:13,415
i'm putting the guy's
life out there.

440
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:14,682
i just wanna feel
clean about it.

441
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:16,615
you know what i'm sayin'?

442
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,315
- i remember clean.

443
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,014
- obviously,
they're not in a hurry

444
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:24,513
to go public
'cause we ain't cuffed.

445
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:26,413
- they're pretending on this
case like we're pretending.

446
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,713
why?

447
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,579
- carcetti.
he's exposed on this.

448
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,945
- how? just blame it all on us,
on the department.

449
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:38,112
- to kill us, they'd
have to kill rawls, daniels,

450
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:39,744
and half the chain
of command.

451
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:42,444
and he made those guys.
it's his police department.

452
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,311
so he opens himself
up right when he's out

453
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,710
there running for governor.

454
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:48,310
- so they want us
to do what?

455
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,543
run this thing down quietly?

456
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:50,643
that's no problem.

457
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:52,209
- six months from now,
after the election,

458
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:55,042
they might decide to open up
and grand jury us.

459
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:58,275
we could still go to jail,
and if not,

460
00:22:58,374 --> 00:23:00,342
i'd expect to be back
in the pawn shop unit

461
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:01,507
and you, my brother,
are gonna ride the boat.

462
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:05,241
- so what?
it was worth it.

463
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:06,406
wasn't it?

464
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:08,840
- depends.

465
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,672
are they gonna let
the case against marlo

466
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:13,973
and his people stand,
knowing what they know?

467
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,106
- why wouldn't they?

468
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,671
it still works on the
seizures and cell phones.

469
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,005
it works without
the illegal tap.

470
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:19,571
- yeah, it does.

471
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:21,938
and they made a big deal
about dropping marlo.

472
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:23,503
they called that press
conference

473
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:25,004
and linked him to
all the bodies.

474
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,137
- for them to drop
the case now...

475
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:30,402
- you know, you think
about it...

476
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:35,302
we've got almost as much
on them as they do on us.

477
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,102
- that tom wolfe wannabe
thinks he's gonna

478
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:39,468
get a phrase like that
past me?

479
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:41,134
no fuckin' way,
motherfucker.

480
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:50,100
- it's like a sweater with
the threads hanging off.

481
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,599
pull any thread...

482
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,266
mostly exaggerations
and too-perfect quotes,

483
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,999
sometimes on-the-record.

484
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:59,464
i called some of them back,

485
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:02,798
asked if they really
said those things.

486
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:03,931
you know what the city
housing commissioner told me

487
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:05,563
about the quotes in
the flipping story?

488
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:06,563
- hmm?

489
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,563
- he wished he'd said
some of them,

490
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,963
but that he'd never been
that smart in his life.

491
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,696
somee takes
the time to...

492
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:16,495
re-report this stuff,
it'll get ugly.

493
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,828
what're you gonna do?

494
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:22,329
- i don't know, robert.
i don't know.

495
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,827
- keep my name out of it.

496
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:36,259
- no bail.

497
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:37,992
they're claiming a
propensity for violence and

498
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:40,092
witness intimidation at
the bail review,

499
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,924
trying to have you held
as the kingpin.

500
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:42,991
- they can do that?

501
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:44,058
- they can try.

502
00:24:44,158 --> 00:24:47,325
depends on which
judge they draw.

503
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:49,324
- so they ain't got no
bail for chris, right?

504
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,523
i mean, he got the
murder warrant.

505
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,023
- monk neither.

506
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,022
too much weight in his car
and he's on parole from

507
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:55,223
the '04 charge.

508
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:58,056
best i could do was spring
mr. wagstaff on 300,000.

509
00:24:58,189 --> 00:24:59,323
- he show that kind
of money?

510
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:00,554
- put up his uncle's house
on surety bond

511
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:01,654
for a third of it.

512
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:04,188
bondsman is fronting
the rest on a fake lien.

513
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,720
right now, the important
thing is not bail,

514
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,753
the important thing
is this...

515
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,919
i need you to tell me who
else knew your clock code.

516
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,552
- i told you.

517
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:20,918
me, cheese, monk, chris
and the supply. that's it.

518
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,085
- no one else.

519
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:23,351
- no one else even had
my cell number.

520
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,117
except you.

521
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:30,317
what?

522
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,482
- there's a lie
in here somewhere.

523
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,549
- i ain't lyin'.

524
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:34,783
- i don't mean you.

525
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:37,481
look, the police say
a source told them

526
00:25:37,615 --> 00:25:39,715
that you were re-upping
on the day,

527
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:41,115
and word of that
might have slipped out.

528
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,581
that's possible.

529
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,215
i mean, if you were
wholesaling all over town...

530
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:46,380
but they only grab your
cells when they arrest you

531
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:49,247
and then they have to
go get warrants

532
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:51,580
before they can look at
the photos on the phones.

533
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,913
and it's only when they
get to the photos

534
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,079
and break the code

535
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,846
that they have enough to
type a charging document

536
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,512
for you or chris, right?

537
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:01,744
i mean, you aren't
caught with drugs.

538
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,411
but they had the arrest
warrants on both of you

539
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:05,111
within a couple hours.

540
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:09,211
which means that they broke
the code almost instantly,

541
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:11,376
in no time at all.

542
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:13,709
- they wiretapped me.

543
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:16,442
- my investigator
thinks so.

544
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,843
but he says he doesn't
know for sure which

545
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,641
unit ran the tap,
or who manned it.

546
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:22,808
it doesn't add up.

547
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:31,706
- you gettin' out.

548
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,339
you ain't.

549
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,072
you hit the streets,
you round up as much

550
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:40,638
muscle as possible
and get that boy.

551
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,371
- he did snoop cuz
he knew we was on him.

552
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,971
- he knew we was on him cuz
he the one talked about

553
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,271
the damn re-up.

554
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,037
get your shit together,
man.

555
00:26:51,137 --> 00:26:53,204
the bondsman came in
with levy.

556
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,070
- a'ight. i'm on it.

557
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,267
- hey, man, you got a dollar?

558
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,800
c'mon.

559
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:38,095
- hey, pal.

560
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:39,628
hey.

561
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:42,129
hey.

562
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,862
pal, you all right?

563
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:47,961
- okay, here it comes...

564
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:50,793
the dreaded crab claw.

565
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:55,526
you know what happens
when crab claw goes...

566
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,859
it's all crab tonight...
- no crab claw!

567
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,026
- yes, crab claw!

568
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:02,825
yeah!
crab claw does it again.

569
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,091
six!

570
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:05,192
six and i'm out...

571
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,323
yeah?

572
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,390
where?

573
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:16,422
you're fucking kidding me.

574
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:18,556
it's more bull...

575
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,621
it's bogus, jay.
i'm telling you...

576
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:26,454
okay.

577
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,121
i gotta go.

578
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,986
i have to keep
running the string out.

579
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,220
i have no choice.

580
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,753
- you said
the bosses know.

581
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:38,220
- yeah.
some do, some don't.

582
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,052
the ones that do
want us to keep pretending.

583
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,785
we stop pretending,
then...

584
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,084
listen, we'll finish
this tomorrow night, okay?

585
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:51,650
i'll see you in a bit.

586
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:03,215
- what do you think?

587
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:08,314
i mean, puttin' my shit

588
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,247

that up against sherrod.

596
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:33,244
and he ain't lettin' you
off the hook for shit, but...

597
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:34,277
he's just puttin'

598
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:35,709

shit, i know the bad.

602
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:47,108
i ain't lyin' to no one

603
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,474
- scared of somebody
callin' you good?

604
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,274
- a lot of folks
volunteer places.

605
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:55,807
a lot of people
share at meetings.

606
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,040
plenty of motherfuckers
wake up every day

607
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,906

- read it, sucka.

611
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:19,170
- "you can hold back from
the suffering of the world,

612
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,302
"you have free
permission to do so,

613
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,568
"and it is in accordance
with your nature,

614
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,802
"but perhaps this very
holding back is the one

615
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:29,201
suffering you could
have avoided."

616
00:30:30,268 --> 00:30:32,867
fan-zee kafka.

617
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,034
who's he?

618
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,499
- some writer.

619
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,633
- you read his books?

620
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:39,033
- fuck no.

621
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,199
but you remember flubber?

622
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,999

the night that

623
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,931
he had me start leading
the saint martin meeting.

624
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:50,297
i kept it ever since.

625
00:30:51,764 --> 00:30:53,296
- what it mean to you?

626
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,529

00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:02,929
not to make any copies.

629
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,995
he sayin' he ain't
supposed to show it

630
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:07,928
to me before it goes
in the paper.

631
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:09,327
i mean, if i let him.

632
00:31:09,427 --> 00:31:10,828
- you gonna?

633
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,660
- thanks for the crabs.

634
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,859
- yep.

635
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,725
- gray van.

636
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:26,525
you get the tag?

637
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,491
- i couldn't see it
from where i was.

638
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:30,057
- describe the driver.

639
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,024
- white. six foot.

00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:35,124
not heavy,
not skinny either.

641
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:36,422
- clothes?

642
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:38,823
- nothing i noticed.
kinda non-descript.

643
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:40,422
- non-descript?

644
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,855
- i was surprised, i guess.

645
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:43,688
i ju thought, whoa,
what's he doing?

646
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,822
- funny it bein'
you to see this.

647
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,821
- it's weird. if an interview
doesn't run late,

648
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:50,654
i'm not even here tonight.

649
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:52,888

- yeah.

652
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,719
- that guy's an asshole.

653
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,317
this smokehound
can't remember a thing.

654
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:07,484
only motherfucker he
remembers messin'

655
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:09,284
with him is the fella
that found him.

656
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,785
whatever happened before
that is anyone's guess.

657
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,750
- hey.

658
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,750

00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:22,682
- who was trying to hurt you?
- my father.

00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,681
but he was a drunk.

663
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:26,548
- detective,

664
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,214

670
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:48,278
it's better for everyone
down here thinks i'm

671
00:32:48,377 --> 00:32:50,211
one of the regulars,
right?

672
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,344
anyway, what's the
ruckus with petey?

673
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:54,310
-the drunk?

674
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:57,543
sun reporter says he's
going into his building,

675
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:58,610
he sees a guy trying
to drag him into

676
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,575
a grey van.

677
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:01,976
it's bullshit, right?

678
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:03,509
- yeah. petey was layin'
there forty-five minutes

679
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,308

- what about the reporter?

684
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:22,639
you could charge
false statement, you know.

685
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,773
- you lock up every liar,
there's no room in b.d.c.

686
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:26,838
for anyone else, right?

687
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,172
more trouble than it's worth.

00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:22,629
i can't eat 'em all.

695
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,494
- we don't run this shit,
especially not off the front.

696
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:37,827
- i saw what i saw.

697
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:40,593
- alma is on the phone
with police p.i.o.

698
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:42,960

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,992
that they are
discounting any report of

700
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:46,658
a possible abduction.

701
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,492
- that may be.
but that doesn't mean
they're doing their job,

702
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:49,492
and it doesn't mean
we shouldn't be--

703
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:50,924
- our job is to report
the news,

704
00:34:51,024 --> 00:34:52,324
not to manufacture it.

705
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,556
- nice.

706
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:05,255
- i know that they're
jealous of how much play

707
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,255
his stories get,
but the truth is...

708
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,588
- we cannot run this shit.

709
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,755
- are you suggesting that
scott made any of this up?

710
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:19,386
- you ever notice that
the guys who do that...

711
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,452
the blairs, the glasses,
the kelleys.

712
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,419
they always start
with something small,

713
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,252
you know, just a little
quote that they clean up,

714
00:35:25,352 --> 00:35:27,284
and then, then it's
a whole anecdote,

715
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:30,485
and pretty soon they're seeing
some amazing shit.

716
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,284
they're the lucky ones
who just happen

717
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,784
to be standing on the
right street corner

718
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,184
in tel aviv when
the pizza joint blows up

719
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:38,684
and the human head rolls
down the street

720
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:39,716
with the eyes still blinking.

721
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:41,549
- those pictures were
sent to him.

722
00:35:41,649 --> 00:35:42,950
the police have confirmed...

723
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,248
- it always starts
with something true,

724
00:35:46,348 --> 00:35:48,381
something confirmed.

725
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,281
but then you've got a
son of a bitch who just

726
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,481
happens to be walking
in the guilford entrance

727
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,447
when the mysterious
gray van comes--

728
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:58,246
- gus, this has gotten
personal between you and scott

729
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,913
and it's affecting
your judgment.

730
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,379
i'm moving the story
through the state desk.

731
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,812
you should go home,
think this through.

732
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:08,079
we'll talk in the morning.

733
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,977
- maybe you win a
pulitzer with this stuff.

734
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,509
and maybe you gotta
give it back.

735
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:26,275
- it's in my notes, gus.
everything that happened.

736
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,875
everything that guy said
when i got to him.

737
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:31,575
every last word is
in my notes.

738
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:55,537
- home earlier than
i thought.

739
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:58,004
- yeah. home.

740
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:15,001
- he hit again.
- who did?

741
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:17,000
- serial killer.

742
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,500
- get a grip, motherfucker.

743
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:22,067
- you don't believe me?
check out his left wrist.

744
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:31,665
- you fuckin' with me again,
bunk?

745
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,099
- copycat.

746
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,530
call mcnulty.
get him down here.

747
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,996
- ronnie.

748
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,262
- maury.

749
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:47,962
- been going over the
charging documents on the

750
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,729
partlow-stanfield drug arrests.

751
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:52,029
problematic to say the least.

752
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:53,294
- how so?

753
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,061
- they grab the phones
and minutes later

754
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:56,961
they've cracked an
elaborate code that

755
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:58,461
implicates everyone.

756
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:00,127
no one's that brilliant.

757
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:03,259
not in the b.p.d.
anyway.

758
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,992
- you don't know
lester freamon.

759
00:38:05,093 --> 00:38:07,059
- i know what i know.

760
00:38:07,193 --> 00:38:10,392
and this feels to me
like an illegal wiretap.

761
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:12,324
your guys were up on those
phones and tracking

762
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:14,357
my clients long before
they went near any drugs.

763
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,991
- untrue.

764
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:18,824
- we get into discovery and
i'm going to have no problem

765
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:22,590
knocking down that bullshit
about a source of information.

766
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:25,056
and my sources around here
tell me that with all

767
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,723
the budget cutbacks,
the only wiretap

768
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:28,789
you all have
had up this year

769
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,922
has been on
the homeless killer thing.

770
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:33,822
whatever else you're
running is illegal.

771
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,787
- sources?

772
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:39,987
title threes are supposed
to be secret, maury.

773
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:41,986
are you saying you have
a source of information

774
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,920
inside the courthouse?

775
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,120
- it's a figure of speech.

776
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:48,351
what i'm saying is that
there's shit in the

777
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:49,652
blood of your case.

778
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,152
and if you wait until this
goes past indictments,

779
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:54,018
i'm gonna run wild with it.

780
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,551
we should talk.

781
00:38:57,651 --> 00:38:59,018
out of court.

782
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,850
- oh, fuck me.

783
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:08,549
- is it enough?
do you have enough?

784
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,183
- it has to be.

785
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:11,382
it should be.

786
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,981
i mean, you can't look
at everything that robert

787
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,247
found at the pattern,

788
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:16,314
and not see what this
fucking guy's about.

789
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:19,213
you know that.
i know that.

790
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:21,547
what you don't think so?

791
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,413
- i think that if you do this,

792
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,479
these son of a bitches
will do you.

793
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,646
- come.

794
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:30,945
- sorry. there's been another
homeless murder.

795
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:32,478
south baltimore.

796
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:37,078
- careful, gus.

797
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,544
i can't protect you.

798
00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:47,309
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

799
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:51,109
- no fucking way.

800
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,508
- dead for a while.

801
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:53,942
and i can assume, jimmy,

802
00:39:54,076 --> 00:39:55,874
from the fact that
the ribbon ain't red

803
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:57,274
and the simple fact
that you don't need

804
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,141
another body because
marlo is locked up...

805
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:00,441
- i got nothing
to do with this.

806
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:01,673
- wonderful.

807
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:03,440
we've eliminated
one suspect.

808
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,174
you see what you
started here?

809
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:06,939
- the bosses are gonna
toss it back to you,

810
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,073
no doubt.

811
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,106
- the bosses know
it's bullshit.

812
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,372
- what?

813
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:11,939
- daniels knows.
pearlman, too.

814
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,538
- how the fuck you...

815
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:18,705
how much longer does this...
- can you give us a minute?

816
00:40:18,805 --> 00:40:21,904
- you turning the world
upside down with your bullshit.

817
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,171
how are you not in jail?

818
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,403
- i don't know.

819
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:26,469
the lie's so big, people
can live with it, i guess.

820
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:28,569
- jesus fucking christ, jimmy.

821
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:29,869
i told you.

822
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,301
i fuckin' told you it was
going to come to this.

823
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:35,135
you played with fire,
didn't you?

824
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:36,735
and now we're all
getting burned...

825
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:39,467
- reporting live
from south baltimore

826
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,267
where police have found the body
of what appears to be

827
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:43,134
another homeless man.

828
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:45,167
this one killed and left
in a vacant lot...

829
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,766
...short while ago
have refused so far...

830
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,965
- did somebody not
get the message?

831
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:31,459
- you're not killing
them yourself, mcnulty.

832
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,792
at least assure me of that.

833
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:38,757
and the one you disappeared.

834
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,524
- he's okay, last i checked.

835
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:43,857
- good. that's a start...

836
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:46,356
i guess.

837
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:47,990
- i thought you got
a message.

838
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,655
- copycat.

839
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:52,221
i got nothing on this one.

840
00:41:53,422 --> 00:41:54,455
- jesus.

841
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:55,722
- how did you do it?

842
00:41:55,855 --> 00:41:58,220
how did you get 'em by
the medical examiner?

843
00:41:58,354 --> 00:41:59,688
- some were real and
i just linked 'em

844
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:00,954
with the ribbons.

845
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:02,987
some i juk as
strangle jobs.

846
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:07,520
if it matters, i know now...

847
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:09,053
- fuck what you know now.

848
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:10,719
this was all for money,
mcnulty?

849
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:12,153
you couldn't live
without the o.t.?

850
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:16,085
- the stanfield case.
it was that.

851
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:19,317
- i know where it went,
but you got paid, too.

852
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:21,717
you and freamon and
maybe a dozen other guys.

853
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:23,984
- it wasn't about the money.

854
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:35,149
- down the road,
when we settle on this--

855
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,515
and we will settle on this--

856
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:39,781
i don't expect any of you
will ever see another hour

857
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,881
of o.t. again.

858
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:43,380
i don't expect any of
you will be doing

859
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:45,413
police work ever again.

860
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:46,746
and the only reason
this isn't before a

861
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:50,179
grand jury right now
is because our mayor

862
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,445
can't live with that.

863
00:42:51,545 --> 00:42:53,345
oh, yeah.

864
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,912
the mayor knows your name.

865
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:57,878
- so this is your last case.

866
00:42:57,978 --> 00:42:59,377
work it.

867
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,177
- if you're half the
detective you think you are,

868
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:03,310
you'll put this one down
fast and take us all

869
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,643
off the hook.

870
00:43:04,743 --> 00:43:06,243
the longer this goes on,

871
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:19,775
the worse the payback's
gonna be.

872
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:26,874
the worse the payback's
gonna be.

873
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,706
- but what does he
really know?

874
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,406
- what he knows now isn't
half of what he'll learn

875
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:32,739
when we get to discovery.

876
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:34,405
they won't be able to
produce a credible source

877
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:35,738
of information...

878
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:37,805
- they don't have to if
it's not a registered c.i.

879
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:39,438
a source of information
is only--

880
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:41,071
- if he can raise doubts
in a judge's mind,

881
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,671
we could be compelled
to reveal our source.

882
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:45,871
at that point,
we're giving up the wiretap.

883
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,070
- and he gets the paperwork
from the phone company...

884
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:50,836
- which has stanfield's
number on it.

885
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,102
- god.

886
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:56,102
- the only thing we
can do is barter.

887
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,234
- then barter.
this can't go to court.

888
00:43:58,334 --> 00:43:59,768
- we do have some leverage.

889
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,001
- what?

890
00:44:03,668 --> 00:44:06,000
- let's just say mr. levy
has problems of his

891
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:08,400
own to deal with.

892
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,332
- make this go away...

893
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:13,799
and the mayor will not
forget that you did so.

894
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:16,464
nor will i.

895
00:44:19,398 --> 00:44:21,898
jimmy, ass up an'
help with this.

896
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:24,630
- shit is funky.

897
00:44:29,596 --> 00:44:32,629
- aw, man, we should take
this into the box.

898
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:33,696
- where's the
pocket contents?

899
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,261
- we have questions
about the report

900
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:37,062
of the kidnapping...

901
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:38,261
- those two bags there.

902
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:39,361
- yes, ma'am.

903
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:43,661
well, that would seem to
be the newspaper's problem.

904
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:47,726
i get another fucking
call about a gray van

905
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:49,359
and i'm burning that
fucking newspaper building

906
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:51,226
to the ground.

907
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,726
- huh.

908
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,059
- what?

909
00:44:57,325 --> 00:44:58,992
- your homeless guy
from days ago.

910
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,125
what was in his pockets?

911
00:45:00,224 --> 00:45:01,457
- bullshit.

912
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:03,324
- you got business cards?

913
00:45:03,457 --> 00:45:05,058
- yeah, but every card
has an alibi.

914
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:06,423
- let me see.

915
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:07,990
- i thought we
were done with this.

916
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:20,821
so, where you going with this?

917
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,320
- motherfucker,
you ain't that good.

918
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:33,185
- mcnulty,
what's up with this?

919
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:34,786
- you okay, gus?

920
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:36,085
- hmmm?

921
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:39,451
yeah, i'm great.

922
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:49,683
what?

923
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,882
alma, what's up?

924
00:45:56,415 --> 00:45:57,682
- it's empty.

925
00:45:57,815 --> 00:45:58,749
- what's empty?

926
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:00,481
- the pad he waved at you,

927
00:46:00,581 --> 00:46:03,180
saying it was all
filled with notes.

928
00:46:03,314 --> 00:46:05,814
it's empty. every page.

929
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:08,747
- thanks.

930
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,010
- what the fuck
is that about?

931
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:41,508
uh-oh.

932
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:43,907
alma, t.v. has police
on a sweep of the homeless

933
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:45,841
under hanover street.

934
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:55,405
- i'll get right
to the point.

935
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:57,072
- please do.

936
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:01,304
- maury, hey.
- yeah, hi.

937
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,237
- you have stanfield, right?
he's your client?

938
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:04,804
- yeah, him and his people.

939
00:47:04,904 --> 00:47:06,771
- well, i have some stuff,
straight from the grand jury

940
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:09,104
that you're gonna wanna
see sooner rather than later.

941
00:47:09,203 --> 00:47:10,670
- is this a title
three case?

942
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,203
- you're gonna
find it interesting, i promise.

943
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:13,369
- all right.
when can you meet?

944
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:15,569
- tomorrow, after work.
same money, right?

945
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:21,301
- yeah, the money's the same.
- good.

946
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:24,201
- we can grand jury
gary dipasquale tomorrow,

947
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:27,001
along with that
one-party consent call.

948
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:30,834
or...here's the deal.

949
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,666
no court trials.

950
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:36,566
partlow pleads to all of
the bodies in the vacants

951
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,598
and takes life,
no parole.

952
00:47:38,698 --> 00:47:40,264
we'd want the
second shooter too,

953
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:42,032
but pearson's
beyond that now.

954
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:45,464
metcalf and wagstaff plead
to possession with intent.

955
00:47:45,564 --> 00:47:47,797
stanfield takes ten years
on conspiracy.

956
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,262
- you're blackmailing
an officer of the court.

957
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:55,962
the moment you came in here
and offered that quid pro quo

958
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:58,228
you were guilty of
obstruction of justice.

959
00:47:58,328 --> 00:47:59,495
- you're right.

960
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:02,894
i could get six to
eight years.

961
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:07,160
and for bribery of a state's
attorney and the violation

962
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:10,960
of grand jury secrecy,
you could see ten to twelve.

963
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,692
i'll be out a couple
years before you, maury.

964
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,692
you come home,
first round's on me, i guess.

965
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,725
- so you'll let me walk
to keep this case out of

966
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:22,191
open court?

967
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:25,092
that file must be dirty
as hell. huh?

968
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:27,123
the conspiracy charge
on stanfield falls

969
00:48:27,223 --> 00:48:29,223
without the cell phones,
and you and i both know

970
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,057
that if someone does
some digging,

971
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:32,689
they're gonna find an
illegal wiretap and

972
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:34,422
you're gonna lose
the phones.

973
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:37,155
- everhart, two-seventy-four,

974
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:38,588
maryland four-fifty-nine.

975
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:40,555
or ceccolini,
four-thirty-five,

976
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:41,955
u.s. two-sixty-eight.

977
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,153
lying cops don't
automatically kill a case.

978
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:50,054
- but that's a lot of risk
on appeal...

979
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:52,419
and a lot of dirt for
your office to show.

980
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:55,252
no.

981
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,118
you're scared
of the light.

982
00:48:57,218 --> 00:49:01,485
partlow takes his chances
on the legit murder charge only.

983
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,951
the conspiracy count
goes and stanfield

984
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:05,517
and the rest walk.

985
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:07,085
- stanfield walks.

986
00:49:07,184 --> 00:49:10,116
but the case goes on
the stet docket,

987
00:49:10,216 --> 00:49:11,883
not dismissed outright.

988
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:14,350
and although i can tell
you there are people

989
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,716
in this city who can't
tolerate a scandal at

990
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:17,749
this particular moment,
that dynamic changes

991
00:49:17,882 --> 00:49:19,115
after november.

992
00:49:19,215 --> 00:49:20,282
- the elections...

993
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,615
- after november,
no one is going to care

994
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:25,348
as much about showing dirt.

995
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:27,580
if carcetti wins,
he's in annapolis.

996
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,347
if he loses,
he's an incumbent mayor

997
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,413
who can take a hit or two.

998
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:32,847
so you tell
mr. stanfield that this

999
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:35,746
is his only window.

1000
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:38,179
partlow pleads to all
the murders

1001
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,411
and both lieutenants
plead to the drugs.

1002
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,278
then stanfield retires.

1003
00:49:44,378 --> 00:49:45,844
he's done.

1004
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:48,544
we even get the scent of him
on the street ever again,

1005
00:49:48,644 --> 00:49:51,977
this case comes off stet
and goes to trial.

1006
00:49:52,077 --> 00:49:53,743
and if we have to put
a few cops in jail

1007
00:49:53,843 --> 00:49:55,676
right behind him, so be it.

1008
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,141
we'll bring the evidence
and take a hit.

1009
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,308
your client walks
away now...

1010
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:04,307
or the both of you
don't walk at all.

1011
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,971
- let's go. get up.

1012
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:48,567
- that's mine.

1013
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:51,233
- it's yours. i know.

1014
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:05,931
- do you have a card?

1015
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:17,829
that's not a card.

1016
00:51:19,862 --> 00:51:22,596
- we met before,
you remember?

1017
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:24,227
- liar.

1018
00:51:26,294 --> 00:51:28,628
black liar.

1019
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,493
- why'd you kill
your friend?

1020
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:36,492
- he drinks...

1021
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,693
he's always drinking.

1022
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:41,325
- but you put a
ribbon around his wrist.

1023
00:51:41,425 --> 00:51:42,592
like the others.

1024
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,091
- yeah.

1025
00:51:45,158 --> 00:51:46,558
- did you see that
on television?

1026
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:49,891
the ribbon on the wrist?

1027
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:52,791
did you hear about that
from other people?

1028
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:55,189
why'd you do the thing
with the ribbon?

1029
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:56,590
- nobody understands.

1030
00:51:59,057 --> 00:52:00,455
you don't understand.

1031
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:05,721
i always know what
i'm going to do...

1032
00:52:07,588 --> 00:52:10,588
before i do it. okay?

1033
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:13,320
i always know what
i'm going to do.

1034
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,153
- did you kill the others?
did you kill all of them?

1035
00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:17,519
- every one of them.

1036
00:52:21,953 --> 00:52:25,052
i did it because i knew
i was going to do it.

1037
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:33,450
i've killed millions.

1038
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:37,983
okay?
and they all killed me.

1039
00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:40,016
- so you did all
the murders, huh?

1040
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:46,114
- you're a coward.

1041
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:49,747
i can tell.

1042
00:52:53,048 --> 00:53:00,245
hey, do you have
a card?

1043
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:04,745
- jimmy, reporter's in there
waiting for a photo array.

1044
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,411
- what?

1045
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:08,444
jay, he's bullshit.

1046
00:53:08,544 --> 00:53:09,978
- i know he is.

1047
00:53:10,077 --> 00:53:11,744
but the newspaper made
such a fuss the major

1048
00:53:11,844 --> 00:53:13,944
wants us to jerk him off,
just to say we did.

1049
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,975
- hey, detective.

1050
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:36,540
um...

1051
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:44,805
- no gray van either.

1052
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:45,872
- w-what...

1053
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,405
- he doesn't have a grey van.

1054
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:57,970
no gray van.

1055
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,202
and he didn't call you
on the phone either, did he?

1056
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,068
he didn't call you
the first time

1057
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:03,435
and he didn't call
you the second.

1058
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:05,302
i did that.

1059
00:54:05,402 --> 00:54:08,434
yew mortify me
in fronta my fatha...

1060
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:10,200
and those pictures y got.

1061
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:11,734
i took those.

1062
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:14,366
and the missing guy?
he's my second cousin.

1063
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,233
we sent him up to atlantic city
with a roll of quarters.

1064
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:20,198
and you know why i can
tell you all this?

1065
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,632
because,
you lyin' motherfucker,

1066
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:24,799
you're as full
of shit as i am,

1067
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:26,298
and you've got to live
with it and play it out

1068
00:54:26,398 --> 00:54:29,898
for as long as it goes.
right?

1069
00:54:29,998 --> 00:54:31,630
trapped in the same lie.

1070
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:35,864
only difference is
i know why i did it...

1071
00:54:35,964 --> 00:54:37,263
and fuck if i can
figure out what it gets you

1072
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,062
in the end.

1073
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:41,863
but hey, i ain't part
of your tribe.

1074
00:54:41,963 --> 00:54:42,896
- you're not serious...
you can't...

1075
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:44,061
- no.

1076
00:54:45,328 --> 00:54:46,828
no, i'm a fucking joke...

1077
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:49,894
and so are you.

1078
00:54:54,193 --> 00:54:55,960
now get the fuck
out of here.

1079
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,120
- you walk.

1080
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,687
chris eats the murders,
every last one,

1081
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,085
takes life with no parole.

1082
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:40,786
- no parole?
- no shot.

1083
00:55:40,886 --> 00:55:43,020
but they've got him cold
on the one with the d.n.a.

1084
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,652
can you sell that?
is chris loyal?

1085
00:55:44,752 --> 00:55:46,118
- yeah.

1086
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:49,919
as long as i take care
ofis people.

1087
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,684
- cheese and monk are
looking at up to twenty

1088
00:55:51,784 --> 00:55:53,183
for the drugs.

1089
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:55,584
but there's gonna be no
assets investigation

1090
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:57,283
and you come home
with all your money.

1091
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:00,950
- why they letting me walk?

1092
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:03,448
- they don't want to,
but there's some shit

1093
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:04,715
in their case and
they'd rather not show

1094
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:06,415
it in court.

1095
00:56:06,515 --> 00:56:07,749
but here's the rub:

1096
00:56:07,882 --> 00:56:09,814
if you stay in the game,

1097
00:56:09,948 --> 00:56:12,015
they will.
they definitely will.

1098
00:56:12,114 --> 00:56:13,981
right now, with an
election going on,

1099
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,747
they're willing to
give you a buy.

1100
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:17,780
but after november,
if they even think

1101
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,713
you're still a player,
they can take this case

1102
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:22,679
down off the shelf and
the shit in the case

1103
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,512
might not be enough
to keep you free.

1104
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:27,978
do you understand?

1105
00:56:28,111 --> 00:56:29,344
- give up the crown.

1106
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:35,610
- well, that's the deal,
kiddo.

1107
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,243
there's not a lawyer who
could get better for you.

1108
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:53,941
- how'd that go, boss?

1109
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,740
- kiddo, you are a goldmine
to me. you know that?

1110
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,873
you've taken this law firm
to a whole new level.

1111
00:57:01,973 --> 00:57:03,206
- me?

1112
00:57:03,306 --> 00:57:04,805
- you don't tip me to
that bad wiretap,

1113
00:57:04,906 --> 00:57:05,972
i've got all kinds
of trouble.

1114
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:07,739
but now, if marlo
takes the deal,

1115
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,271
he's gonna get a walk
after being charged

1116
00:57:10,371 --> 00:57:12,237
in a multimillion
dollar drug seizure.

1117
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:14,371
that doesn't happen
very often,

1118
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:16,403
and when it does happen,
the name and number

1119
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:18,103
of the defense attorney
goes in the front

1120
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:20,203
pocket of every respectable
drug trafficker.

1121
00:57:21,537 --> 00:57:23,402
you're a genius for what
you brought me on this.

1122
00:57:23,536 --> 00:57:24,736
- i'm just doin'
what i do, right?

1123
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:27,536
you need to know something,
all you gotta do is ask.

1124
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:29,101
that's what a detective is,
right?

1125
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:30,401
- here.

1126
00:57:30,501 --> 00:57:32,701
you should come over
for dinner tonight.

1127
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,367
yvette's making brisket.

1128
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:35,667
- your house?

1129
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,166
- you're mishpucha now.

1130
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:46,932
- if you say so.

1131
00:57:58,163 --> 00:57:59,463
- it's down.

1132
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,796
- not that this thing
is ever going to trial.

1133
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:02,863
guy has n.c.r. written
all over him.

1134
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:04,263
- can't argue.

1135
00:58:04,363 --> 00:58:06,228
a padded room at clifton t.
perkins is definitely

1136
00:58:06,328 --> 00:58:07,829
called for.

1137
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:09,295
- he go for all of them?

1138
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:10,594
- no, sir.
just the last two.

1139
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:11,828
- he deny the others?

1140
00:58:11,928 --> 00:58:13,861
- he ain't exactly
denying anything in there.

1141
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:16,261
i mean, he'll cop to
anything we damn please...

1142
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:17,793
- then go back and get it.

1143
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,527
- excuse me?

1144
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:22,059
if he's n.c.,
what the fuck is

1145
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:24,158
the difference if he
cops to two or six?

1146
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:26,792
either way, they tie his
arms and feed him green jell-o.

1147
00:58:26,893 --> 00:58:28,259
- sir, he did the last two.

1148
00:58:29,992 --> 00:58:33,658
- motherfucker,
you are a cunt hair away

1149
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:36,090
fromndictment and you
see fit to argue with me?

1150
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,256
- i did what i did.
i know.

1151
00:58:41,356 --> 00:58:43,422
and now, i'm standing
responsible for two fresh
murders.

1152
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:45,122
i know what
i've done here.

1153
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,655
but i'm not doing this.

1154
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:59,153
- this is over.

1155
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,052
and all of our citizens
can rest soundly

1156
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:04,086
in the knowledge that
the man responsible

1157
00:59:04,186 --> 00:59:06,519
has been apprehended
by the diligent

1158
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,752
efforts of investigators.

1159
00:59:07,852 --> 00:59:09,752
- mr. mayor,
is he being charged with

1160
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:11,718
all of the murders,
or just two...

1161
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:16,684
- um, it is my
understanding that, uh...

1162
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:20,517
- uh, we are charging
the last two incidents,

1163
00:59:20,617 --> 00:59:22,083
but it is my
understanding that

1164
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,115
he is suspected in
all of the crimes.

1165
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,082
and we're waiting for
dna test results.

1166
00:59:26,215 --> 00:59:28,549
indications are that he
may be mentally incapacitated

1167
00:59:28,682 --> 00:59:32,348
and therefore
additional prosecutions would

1168
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:33,781
prove redundant.

1169
00:59:33,882 --> 00:59:35,214
- i'd also like to credit
deputy commissioner for

1170
00:59:35,314 --> 00:59:38,146
operations daniels
with not only bringing these

1171
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:39,847
cases to their
proper conclusion,

1172
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:42,713
but but also for solving
last year's slayings

1173
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:44,713
in the vacant rowhouses.

1174
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,946
he has given us such
excellent work that

1175
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:49,578
i think that now is as good
a time as any to announce

1176
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:52,411
that we will be sending
the deputy's name forward

1177
00:59:52,512 --> 00:59:54,711
to the city council
for confirmation as

1178
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:55,978
baltimore police commissioner.

1179
00:59:59,477 --> 01:00:00,877
acting commissioner rawls,
to whom i am also

1180
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:03,543
extremely grateful,
will serve in an

1181
01:00:03,676 --> 01:00:05,776
advisory capacity pending
new responsibilities

1182
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,275
at city hall.

1183
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,139
- scott, you should be
working the main bar

1184
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,439
on the arrest with alma.

1185
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:26,739
- i am...

1186
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,472
- we're going to want
your byline in this coverage.

1187
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,304
- yeah, i don't feel
so wel

1188
01:00:31,404 --> 01:00:32,638
my stomach...

1189
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:36,271
i think i gotta go home.

1190
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,704
sorry.

1191
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:26,863
- having ducked the bullet
on that homeless mess,

1192
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:29,295
i want you to know that
the mayor and i both

1193
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:31,728
appreciate your discretion.

1194
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:33,862
but right now we can't
take our eyes off

1195
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:36,695
the ball when it comes
to crime overall...

1196
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:39,660
looking at your weekly
u.c.r.s from the districts,

1197
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,460
i am not seeing the kind
of decline that's going

1198
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,459
to measure out to a ten
percent drop in the quarter.

1199
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:46,960
- they're clean.

1200
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:48,025
- excuse me.

1201
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,024
- the stats are clean.

1202
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,325
they're gonna stay clean.

1203
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:55,325
either we fix this
police department

1204
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:57,057
and the crime goes down,
or we don't

1205
01:01:57,157 --> 01:01:59,390
and the crime stays up.

1206
01:01:59,524 --> 01:02:03,122
- commissioner, we're
talking about a little help

1207
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:04,523
in the next couple quarters.

1208
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:05,690
that's all...

1209
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:09,021
- no. i can't.

1210
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:10,388
- you're quiet on
the homeless fiasco,

1211
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:11,789
but this makes
you squeal?

1212
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:12,889
what the--

1213
01:02:12,988 --> 01:02:15,321
- tell the mayor his
stats will be clean.

1214
01:02:15,421 --> 01:02:19,521
before the election,
after the election...

1215
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:24,854
- you're right.
they can't fire you.

1216
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:27,886
not without it bouncing
back on city hall.

1217
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:30,452
if you don't mind being
buried in some backroom unit,

1218
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:32,651
you can stay for as
long as you can stand it.

1219
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,818
or until you get the pension.

1220
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:41,417
but at the same time,
i can't let you do police work.

1221
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,650
not anything that's
going to find its way

1222
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,916
into a courtroom.

1223
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:47,816
i won't do that.

1224
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:51,315
for both of you,
that's over.

1225
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:00,814
- so marlo walks.

1226
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:03,012
- or you go to jail.

1227
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,580
- and you couldn't do
any better with levy, huh?

1228
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:08,613
i mean, giving up
the money...

1229
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:11,645
- i got what i could.

1230
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,811
you lost the money trail,
lester,

1231
01:03:17,945 --> 01:03:20,811
when you decided to start
coloring outside of the lines.

1232
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,476
this isn't on me.

1233
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:33,875
- what the fuck you mean
you selling?

1234
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:35,174
- i'm sellin' the connect.

1235
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:36,575
- how much, yo?

1236
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
- ten million.

1237
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,807
- goddamn.

1238
01:03:42,907 --> 01:03:44,607
- or a high bidder if
i hear ten from more

1239
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:46,172
than one of y'all.

1240
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:47,573
if you all think it
ain't worth that,

1241
01:03:47,706 --> 01:03:49,573
i stick that shit back
in my pocket and y'all

1242
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,505
can go back to runnin'
that stepped-on new york shit.

1243
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:57,305
- you don't mind me askin',
why you sellin'?

1244
01:03:57,405 --> 01:04:00,304
i mean, even from inside
here, you can take a slice

1245
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:02,003
for just layin'
in the cut, nigga.

1246
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:03,671
- i ain't gonna be
in here long.

1247
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,870
case they got against me
already fallin' apart.

1248
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:11,569
but the truth is,

1249
01:04:11,669 --> 01:04:14,268
i'm done with this
gangsta shit.

1250
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,234
i've been there,
done that.

1251
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:18,935
- you somethin' else
other than a gangsta?

1252
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:22,366
- businessman.

1253
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,133
yeah, tall man,
i can't get that shit wrapped

1254
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:25,467
around my head neither.

1255
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:31,132
anyway, y'all can't get
my price up,

1256
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:32,499
maybe y'all pool your money.

1257
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:38,097
but supply only gonna deal
with y'all after

1258
01:04:38,198 --> 01:04:39,665
i make the intro.

1259
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:43,931
then i'm out.

1260
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:45,831
- you've got a problem.

1261
01:04:47,196 --> 01:04:48,429
i thought daniels was
your boy.

1262
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:50,396
- we've both got a problem
if crime doesn't drop.

1263
01:04:50,496 --> 01:04:52,994
carcetti loses the
statehouse and you aren't mayor.

1264
01:04:53,094 --> 01:04:56,161
and even if he wins,
nerese, you're stuck with

1265
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:58,527
a police commissioner
that won't work with you.

1266
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,427
- oh, i'm not stuck
with anything.

1267
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:02,527
daniels either comes
around or he's done.

1268
01:05:02,661 --> 01:05:03,761
- we just anointed him.

1269
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:05,893
we can't go back
on that now. he knows it.

1270
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:10,259
- either he learns his place
or he'll be offering to resign.

1271
01:05:10,393 --> 01:05:12,659
oh, you ain't the only one
knows how to play this game.

1272
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:25,423
- what to say about
this piece of work?

1273
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,622
fuck if i don't find
myself without the right words.

1274
01:05:29,722 --> 01:05:33,322
me, as gifted a golden throat
as any of you cocksuckers,

1275
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:34,689
being loosed from religion,
are ever likely to hear.

1276
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:38,588
what can i say about
the dearly departed?

1277
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:40,521
i mean, really...

1278
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:42,520
- he died young. too young.

1279
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:43,687
- not even forty years old.

1280
01:05:43,787 --> 01:05:44,887
- though had it lived,
his dick woulda been

1281
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:46,020
a hundred and thirty-four...

1282
01:05:47,553 --> 01:05:48,586
- shut up.

1283
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,152
it's coming to me...

1284
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:57,318
he was the black sheep,
the permanent pariah.

1285
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:01,217
he asked no quarter of
the bosses and none was given.

1286
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:05,850
he learned no lessons,
he acknowledged no mistakes,

1287
01:06:05,982 --> 01:06:08,249
he was as stubborn a mic
as ever stumbled out of

1288
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:10,917
the northeast parishes to
take a patrolman's shield.

1289
01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:12,615
he brooked no authority.

1290
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:13,816
he did what he
wanted to do

1291
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,382
and he said what he
wanted to say

1292
01:06:16,482 --> 01:06:19,848
and in the end,
he gave you the clearances.

1293
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:24,146
he's natural police.
yes, he was.

1294
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,480
and i don't say that
about many people.

1295
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,814
even when they're here
on the felt,

1296
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:30,045
i don't give that one up
unless it happens to be true.

1297
01:06:31,712 --> 01:06:33,679
natural poh-leece.

1298
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,677
but christ,
what an asshole.

1299
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:50,543
and i'm talkin' about
the ordinary,

1300
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:53,276
gaping orifice that
all of us possess.

1301
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:57,275
i mean an all-encompassing,
all-consuming,

1302
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:59,208
out of proportion to every
other facet of his

1303
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:01,641
humanity chasm.

1304
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:04,007
from whose borne,
if i may quote shakespeare,

1305
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,140
no traveler has ever returned.

1306
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,373
- the fuck did i do?

1307
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:10,939
- shut the fuck up.
you're dead to us now.

1308
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,373
- hey, hey...

1309
01:07:12,472 --> 01:07:15,405
- ho, here's his
partner in crime.

1310
01:07:18,238 --> 01:07:20,104
- now, now. be gentle.

1311
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:21,271
be gentle.

1312
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,438
i'm a civilian now.
be gentle.

1313
01:07:23,538 --> 01:07:25,069
- your papers went in,
huh?

1314
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,069
- yeah, this afternoon.
thirty-two years..

1315
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,703
- and four months.

1316
01:07:29,936 --> 01:07:31,269
- mmm mmm.

1317
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,669
y'all did a
fine job with him, you did.

1318
01:07:33,769 --> 01:07:35,602
he look to be about ten
years younger than i remember.

1319
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:39,967
- c'mon, there's enough room
for both of you to be laid out.

1320
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:45,000
- one at a time.

1321
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,467
you don't crowd a man
at his own wake.

1322
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:49,699
- come on, lester?

1323
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,833
come and snuggle.

1324
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:53,566
- keep our secrets, jimmy.

1325
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:55,231
i got shardene with me tonight.

1326
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:58,131
- if you gentlemen
will spare us

1327
01:07:58,265 --> 01:07:59,964
this unfortunate
homoerotic lapse,

1328
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:02,297
i will conclude my
elegiac remarks...

1329
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,197
- then do it,
you gabby motherfucker...

1330
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:08,663
- to conclude...
to conclude, i say...

1331
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:11,929
he gave us thirteen
years on the line...

1332
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:13,762
not enough for a pension...

1333
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:15,529
but enough for us to
know that he was..

1334
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:17,228
- put the fucking
song on, hue...

1335
01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:19,861
- despite his negligible
irish ancestry...

1336
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,927
his defects of
personality...

1337
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:25,593
and his inconstant
sobriety and hygiene...

1338
01:08:27,693 --> 01:08:30,860
a true murder police.

1339
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:33,225
jimmy...

1340
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:36,125
i say this seriously.

1341
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:38,691
if i was laying there dead
on some baltimore street corner,

1342
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,425
i'd want it to be you
standing over me,

1343
01:08:40,525 --> 01:08:41,491
catching the case.

1344
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:42,625
- bullshit.

1345
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:48,223
- because, brother,
when you were good,

1346
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:50,556
you were the best we had.

1347
01:08:52,856 --> 01:08:54,856
- shit, if you was layin'
there dead on some corner,

1348
01:08:54,955 --> 01:08:56,655
it was probably jimmy
that done ya.

1349
01:08:58,655 --> 01:08:59,755
- fuck you!

1350
01:08:59,855 --> 01:09:01,221
if you caught the case,
you'd be standing there

1351
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:02,554
pissin' in my ear.

1352
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,174
- how did nerese campbell
get it?

1353
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,807
- you think i asked?

1354
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:30,540
do you think it even matters?

1355
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:33,572
she gave it to me because
she thought you'd listen to me.

1356
01:10:33,672 --> 01:10:36,372
- so now they want
me to go.

1357
01:10:36,472 --> 01:10:38,706
- the way she expressed it
is that she wanted you

1358
01:10:38,806 --> 01:10:41,071
to stay if you could come
to your senses.

1359
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:42,805
- come to my senses.

1360
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:47,570
she wants me to juke
the stats for carcetti.

1361
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,036
this quarter and the next...

1362
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:51,570
hide the crime,
get him elected as governor

1363
01:10:51,703 --> 01:10:53,436
and make her the mayor.

1364
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:54,870
- so do it.

1365
01:10:54,969 --> 01:10:56,503
burrell juked
them before you.

1366
01:10:56,603 --> 01:10:58,101
warren frasier
before him.

1367
01:10:58,201 --> 01:10:59,635
and after you're gone,
rawls or whoever

1368
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,835
will juke them. so what?

1369
01:11:01,968 --> 01:11:04,768
- i'll swallow a lie
when i have to.

1370
01:11:04,868 --> 01:11:07,234
i've swallowed a few
big ones lately.

1371
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:09,567
but the stat games...

1372
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:12,466
that lie, it's what ruined
this department.

1373
01:11:12,566 --> 01:11:15,066
shining up shit and
calling it gold,

1374
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,665
so majors become colonels
and mayors become governors.

1375
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:20,898
pretending to do police work
while one generation fucking

1376
01:11:20,998 --> 01:11:22,331
trains the next how not
to do the job.

1377
01:11:22,431 --> 01:11:23,731
and that...

1378
01:11:27,731 --> 01:11:30,463
i looked carcetti
in the eye.

1379
01:11:30,563 --> 01:11:31,730
i shook his hand.

1380
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,396
i asked him if
he was for real.

1381
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:37,763
this is the lie
i can't live with.

1382
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:40,095
if i do, then nerese has me
in her pocket whenever

1383
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:41,428
she wants me.

1384
01:11:41,528 --> 01:11:44,361
and i'm no good to
anyone like that.

1385
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:46,061
- then go.

1386
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:50,293
withdraw for personal reasons,
or health reasons.

1387
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:51,761
whatever.

1388
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:54,493
you've got your law degree.
you're not going to starve.

1389
01:11:56,226 --> 01:11:59,658
but if you don't go,
they'll wreck both of us.

1390
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:01,759
- there's not enough
in here to indict me.

1391
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,325
and the joke of it is,
i've seen enough

1392
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:07,391
the last few days to have
them indicted.

1393
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:09,357
- for what?

1394
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:11,623
then use it, cedric.

1395
01:12:11,757 --> 01:12:13,056
or at least threaten to.

1396
01:12:13,156 --> 01:12:14,656
- people will get hurt.

1397
01:12:16,022 --> 01:12:17,622
people i care about.

1398
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,756
- then you're done.

1399
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:23,621
there's enough in that file
that you'll never make

1400
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:25,087
it through
confirmation hearings.

1401
01:12:25,187 --> 01:12:27,621
and enough so that my
career is dead before it

1402
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:28,920
even gets started.

1403
01:12:33,053 --> 01:12:36,185
the tree that doesn't bend,
breaks, cedric.

1404
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,552
- bend too far,
you're already broken.

1405
01:12:41,185 --> 01:12:43,451
- marlo on a walk.

1406
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:46,184
and the money, jimmy.

1407
01:12:46,284 --> 01:12:47,784
she gave that away, too.

1408
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:50,916
- yeah.

1409
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,050
- we don't get to
follow the money.

1410
01:12:57,182 --> 01:12:58,383
hey...

1411
01:12:58,483 --> 01:12:59,682
wonderin' where you was...

1412
01:12:59,815 --> 01:13:01,348
- didn't know if i should
come out on this here...

1413
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:03,515
- why the fuck not?

1414
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:05,482
- was me who told daniels.

1415
01:13:07,547 --> 01:13:10,714
i didn't want to do
it behind your back,

1416
01:13:10,814 --> 01:13:12,780
but it had to be done.

1417
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:24,344
anyway, it was great bein'
on the job with y'all.

1418
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:28,944
i just wanted to say
that too, i guess.

1419
01:13:29,044 --> 01:13:30,943
- so what?

1420
01:13:31,043 --> 01:13:34,744
you ain't gonna drink
with me?

1421
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:37,042
- i am if you want...

1422
01:13:39,242 --> 01:13:42,808
- detective, if you think
it needed doin',

1423
01:13:42,907 --> 01:13:45,408
i guess it did.

1424
01:13:52,841 --> 01:13:54,073
- you comin'?

1425
01:14:14,403 --> 01:14:17,503
- milton came
with six hundred.

1426
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:19,435
an' little glen is
in for three.

1427
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,335
- i got five from me

1428
01:14:21,435 --> 01:14:24,001
an' i got five from
chinaman to cover.

1429
01:14:25,568 --> 01:14:26,835
- i can go that.
no thing.

1430
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:28,101
- what?

1431
01:14:28,201 --> 01:14:30,000
motherfucker, where you get
that kind of scratch?

1432
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:31,999
- you don't think cheese
know this here game?

1433
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,633
we sellin' dope an' coke
in baltimore, nigga,

1434
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,600
any of y'all ain't got
that kind of money

1435
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,932
need be ashamed.

1436
01:14:38,065 --> 01:14:41,132
- you still puttin' up more
than your share with that.

1437
01:14:41,232 --> 01:14:44,198
- the way i look at it,
we all gonna be more

1438
01:14:44,298 --> 01:14:46,565
than paid once we own
the connect, so...

1439
01:14:46,665 --> 01:14:47,864
- shit, nigga,
we was good when

1440
01:14:47,964 --> 01:14:49,464
your uncle had it.

1441
01:14:49,597 --> 01:14:52,230
you had to go ahead and
put up with marlo...

1442
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,863
- see that.

1443
01:14:53,963 --> 01:14:56,796
see now, that's just the
wrong way to look at it.

1444
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:00,629
'cause joe had his time
and omar put an end to that,

1445
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,961
then marlo had his time,
short as it was,

1446
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:05,061
an' the police put
an end to that.

1447
01:15:05,161 --> 01:15:07,661
and now, motherfucker,
it's our time.

1448
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,427
mines and yours.

1449
01:15:10,527 --> 01:15:12,860
but instead of just
shuttin' up and kickin' in,

1450
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,360
you gonna stand there cryin'
that back-in-the-day shit.

1451
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,560
- cheese...

1452
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,560
- there ain't no back
in the day, nigga.

1453
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,525
ain't no nostalgia
to this shit here.

1454
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:24,659
there's just the street
and the game

1455
01:15:24,759 --> 01:15:26,558
and what happen here today.

1456
01:15:26,691 --> 01:15:27,857
- you right.

1457
01:15:32,523 --> 01:15:35,690
- when it was my uncle,
i was with my uncle.

1458
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:38,322
when it was marlo,
i was with him.

1459
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:39,556
but now, nigga--

1460
01:15:46,221 --> 01:15:48,355
- what the fuck
did you do that for?

1461
01:15:48,455 --> 01:15:50,487
now we short the nine.

1462
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,320
- that was for joe.

1463
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:08,351
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1464
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:21,315
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1465
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:34,313
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1466
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:47,345
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1467
01:16:47,345 --> 01:17:00,343
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1468
01:17:00,343 --> 01:17:13,374
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1469
01:17:13,374 --> 01:17:26,372
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1470
01:17:26,372 --> 01:17:36,869
- this sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1471
01:17:37,003 --> 01:17:38,537
- hey, alma...

1472
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:48,435
i just heard.

1473
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:51,134
- the carroll
county bureau?

1474
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:52,734
that's how they
punish me?

1475
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:55,233
why not just send my ass
all the way to pennsylvania?

1476
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:56,701
- what'd they tell you?

1477
01:17:56,801 --> 01:17:59,132
- that i did an excellent job.

1478
01:17:59,232 --> 01:18:01,666
that this had nothing to do
with anything but trying

1479
01:18:01,766 --> 01:18:03,633
to make the county
bureaus stronger.

1480
01:18:05,964 --> 01:18:07,799
- alma, i didn't tell
them about the notepad.

1481
01:18:07,898 --> 01:18:09,864
i left that part out.

1482
01:18:09,964 --> 01:18:10,997
- i told them.

1483
01:18:11,097 --> 01:18:12,431
when i heard you were
in trouble,

1484
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:14,764
i went to whiting,
told him i thought you

1485
01:18:14,863 --> 01:18:16,030
were right about scott.

1486
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,962
i told him about the notepad.

1487
01:18:18,029 --> 01:18:19,630
did he make all of it up?

1488
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,862
the calls from the killer?
the pictures?

1489
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:25,362
- some, not all.

1490
01:18:25,462 --> 01:18:26,662
- why?

1491
01:18:26,796 --> 01:18:29,061
- look around.

1492
01:18:29,194 --> 01:18:33,461
the pond is shrinking.
the fish are nervous.

1493
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:35,660
get some profile,
win a prize...

1494
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,060
maybe find a bigger
pond somewhere.

1495
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,825
whiting, klebanow, templeton...

1496
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:44,159
they snatch a pulitzer or two,
and they are up

1497
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:46,625
and gone from this place.

1498
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:48,525
for them, that's what
this is all about.

1499
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:49,758
me?

1500
01:18:49,857 --> 01:18:53,023
i'm too fuckin'
simple-minded for that.

1501
01:18:53,157 --> 01:18:55,823
i just wanted to see
something new every day...

1502
01:18:57,557 --> 01:18:58,989
and write a
story with it.

1503
01:19:01,389 --> 01:19:04,222
alma, you'll write
your way outta carroll

1504
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,789
in no time, watch.

1505
01:19:05,888 --> 01:19:07,021
- about as fast
as you edit

1506
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:09,155
your way off the copy
desk, huh?

1507
01:19:26,951 --> 01:19:28,619
- congratulations,
sergeant goette.

1508
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,950
i know you'll do well
in the eastern.

1509
01:19:35,383 --> 01:19:38,050
glad i got to do
this at least.

1510
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,550
congratulations,
lieutenant carver.

1511
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,050
- thank you, sir.

1512
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,848
i'm just sorry it won't
be you i'm serving under.

1513
01:19:44,582 --> 01:19:46,049
- word gets around, huh?

1514
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:48,581
- it's on w.b.a.l. today.

1515
01:19:48,682 --> 01:19:51,448
they said you're leaving
for family reasons...

1516
01:19:51,581 --> 01:19:52,748
- i guess i got some kids
somewhere i don't

1517
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:55,080
even know about.

1518
01:19:55,213 --> 01:19:56,747
they say on b.a.l.
who they're sending up

1519
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:57,980
as acting commissioner?

1520
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,080
- say it ain't so.

1521
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:05,944
- ladies and gentlemen,

1522
01:20:06,045 --> 01:20:08,045
as what may be my
last official act

1523
01:20:08,145 --> 01:20:10,412
as a baltimore
police officer,

1524
01:20:10,512 --> 01:20:13,544
allow me to congratulate all
of the promoted officers,

1525
01:20:13,644 --> 01:20:15,910
their families,
their fellow officers,

1526
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,077
and their friends.

1527
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:27,275
- you ain't careful,
they may make you major.

1528
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:28,975
then you'll be truly fucked.

1529
01:20:30,174 --> 01:20:31,341
good job.
- thanks.

1530
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:32,874
- i'm proud of you.
- thanks.

1531
01:20:49,104 --> 01:20:51,204
- see now,
there you go

1532
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,837
givin' a fuck when it
ain't your turn

1533
01:20:52,937 --> 01:20:54,004
to give a fuck.

1534
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:55,003
lehman's squad was up.

1535
01:20:55,103 --> 01:20:56,370
- i needed the o.t.

1536
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,504
- yeah, an' now
you got a shooting with no wits,

1537
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,935
no suspect and no prayer
of it goin' to black.

1538
01:21:02,036 --> 01:21:04,036
pickin' up the phone like
a goddamn rookie.

1539
01:21:04,136 --> 01:21:05,036
shame on you.

1540
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,068
- stop squealin' like a bitch.

1541
01:21:07,168 --> 01:21:09,402
an' make sure you don't step
on that shell casing behind you.

1542
01:21:09,502 --> 01:21:10,801
- i ain't gonna kick no
shell casings behind me.

1543
01:21:10,901 --> 01:21:12,035
it's right there on the side.

1544
01:21:12,135 --> 01:21:13,134
i'm gonna step back and kick
no damn shell casing

1545
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:20,033
you don't mark with letters
and numbers.

1546
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:21,266
- i understand.

1547
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,133
and you gotta be in the system.

1548
01:21:23,266 --> 01:21:24,433
they sent you the form.

1549
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:26,198
- they told me that
wasn'tood enough.

1550
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,965
they said they wanted
the other paper work.

1551
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:30,032
- and you said you applied
for s.s.i., mr. belton?

1552
01:21:30,132 --> 01:21:31,364
- yes, ma'am.

1553
01:21:31,464 --> 01:21:32,464
- well, let's go
inside and look it up on

1554
01:21:32,564 --> 01:21:33,698
the computer.

1555
01:21:33,797 --> 01:21:35,930
- hey, you remember me?

1556
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:38,530
i brought this guy in
a few weeks back,

1557
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:40,130
i just wanted to see
how he was...

1558
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:44,629
- he wandered out after
a couple nights.

1559
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:45,928
sorry.

1560
01:21:46,995 --> 01:21:48,329
- where...

1561
01:21:49,728 --> 01:21:51,128
where do the homeless
go around here?

1562
01:21:51,228 --> 01:21:52,395
- different places.

1563
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:53,994
down by the river,
over in the

1564
01:21:54,094 --> 01:21:55,594
warehouse district...

1565
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,494
some of the places,
i don't really think

1566
01:21:58,594 --> 01:21:59,661
it would be safe
for you to go...

1567
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:02,126
- i'm police.
well, i used to be.

1568
01:22:02,226 --> 01:22:03,326
- wait here.

1569
01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:04,726
i'll see if i
can find you a map.

1570
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:07,092
- thanks.
- come on, mr. belton.

1571
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:12,725
- and if the major could find
his ass with his hand,

1572
01:22:12,824 --> 01:22:14,024
he'd know that this we have
more than enough for us

1573
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:15,724
to be up on a pen register.

1574
01:22:15,823 --> 01:22:18,457
lieutenant carver told him so,
but fuck if he isn't trying

1575
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:19,723
to shut this thing down.

1576
01:22:24,623 --> 01:22:26,489
all's i'm sayin' is a
phone call or two and

1577
01:22:26,589 --> 01:22:28,522
you're gonna find out
that they're gettin'

1578
01:22:28,622 --> 01:22:30,689
some kinda pressure from
somewhere to sit on this thing,

1579
01:22:30,788 --> 01:22:33,154
even though we've tied
three killings to this crew.

1580
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,321
- does the police
commissioner know?

1581
01:22:37,421 --> 01:22:38,919
- him?

1582
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,520
he wouldn't know police
work if it took down his

1583
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,120
front door on a warrant.

1584
01:22:46,286 --> 01:22:48,152
just...

1585
01:22:48,252 --> 01:22:50,184
keep my name out of it.

1586
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,351
- new westport is like
howard street ten years ago,

1587
01:22:55,451 --> 01:22:58,183
except the land's cheaper
and there's more potential

1588
01:22:58,284 --> 01:23:00,350
for mixed-use because of
the waterfront location.

1589
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,717
- there you are.

1590
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:03,616
- you can't put a price
on a waterview.

1591
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,949
- oh, yes, you can.

1592
01:23:05,049 --> 01:23:07,016
you definitely can.

1593
01:23:08,715 --> 01:23:10,848
- andy, he's gotta meet
tommy and they're leaving early,

1594
01:23:10,981 --> 01:23:12,248
so let me borrow him
for a moment.

1595
01:23:12,348 --> 01:23:13,482
- sure, no problem.

1596
01:23:13,582 --> 01:23:15,080
nice to meet you,
mr. stanfield.

1597
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:20,347
- you know who you
were talking to?

1598
01:23:20,447 --> 01:23:23,513
- nah.
- andy krawczyk.

1599
01:23:23,613 --> 01:23:25,013
very connected.

1600
01:23:25,113 --> 01:23:26,513
very big with development
around the harbor.

1601
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:29,512
he's someone you're
gonna wanna know well,

1602
01:23:29,646 --> 01:23:31,479
but kid, do not...

1603
01:23:33,711 --> 01:23:35,977
do not get in a room
with him alone.

1604
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,645
you want me in there with you,
believe me.

1605
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:39,343
otherwise, guys like that
will bleed you...

1606
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,577
i want you to meet tommy
flanagan before he leaves...

1607
01:23:41,677 --> 01:23:44,510
- yeah, gimme a minute.
i need to, um...

1608
01:23:44,644 --> 01:23:46,042
- bathroom?
- yeah.

1609
01:23:46,142 --> 01:23:47,376
- down the hall to the right.

1610
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,074
hey, watch that stuff.
you'll put on weight.

1611
01:24:12,904 --> 01:24:14,838
- but next time,
i want you to make sure

1612
01:24:14,938 --> 01:24:17,371
that you watch this money...

1613
01:24:19,404 --> 01:24:21,936
- uh-uh. don't...
umm-uh. don't do it.

1614
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:30,768
time to give that up.

1615
01:24:31,935 --> 01:24:33,402
- do you know who i am?

1616
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:35,001
- name's vinson.

1617
01:24:35,101 --> 01:24:38,034
used to be marlo's bank,
but marlo ain't 'round no more,

1618
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:43,233
and you still movin' money
for other players so...

1619
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:44,933
i'm thinkin' some of that
money need to be mine.

1620
01:24:45,066 --> 01:24:46,965
- shit...

1621
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:49,099
you just a boy.

1622
01:24:51,865 --> 01:24:53,665
that's just your knee.

1623
01:24:53,764 --> 01:24:55,864
- that motherfucker shot me.

1624
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:04,063
- nice doin' business,
gentlemen.

1625
01:25:10,428 --> 01:25:12,228
- no way, that's bullshit.

1626
01:25:12,328 --> 01:25:14,695
i heard it different.
the real story about omar

1627
01:25:14,794 --> 01:25:15,995
is that a bunch of cops
made it look like them

1628
01:25:16,095 --> 01:25:17,461
new york boys killed him.

1629
01:25:17,594 --> 01:25:18,694
but it was them.

1630
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:20,227
they're the ones that
really killed him.

1631
01:25:20,327 --> 01:25:21,461
- listen, motherfucker,

1632
01:25:21,561 --> 01:25:22,859
i know what happened to him.

1633
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:24,460
them police had nothing
to do with it.

1634
01:25:24,593 --> 01:25:26,159
no new york boys neither.

1635
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,393
so omar's got an a.k.,
right?

1636
01:25:28,492 --> 01:25:29,958
but he's surrounded.

1637
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:32,359
it's like eight,
nine motherfuckers up there

1638
01:25:32,492 --> 01:25:33,492
and they all got nines.

1639
01:25:33,592 --> 01:25:34,658
but he like,
"you all think you..."

1640
01:25:34,757 --> 01:25:36,057
- fuck you lookin' at?

1641
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:39,124
- you, nigga.

1642
01:25:39,224 --> 01:25:40,391
- you know who i am?

1643
01:25:40,491 --> 01:25:41,756
- nigga, you know
who i am?

1644
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,557
- oh, shit!

1645
01:26:11,318 --> 01:26:12,552
- yeah...

1646
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:45,136

01:28:19,698 --> 01:28:21,331
