1
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:05,795
- And, uh, as you can see
from the locations,

2
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:08,094
the killer is working
primarily in the southern,

3
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:10,461
central and southeastern,
which makes sense

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,161
given the concentrations
of homeless in those districts.

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,728
Vics one and three
were killed at night,

6
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:17,160
two and four
had daylight t.o.d.s.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,093
- Detective, what about
the missing man, Mr. Butler?

8
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:22,794
Is there any lead at all
on his whereabouts?

9
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:24,627
- No, sir.
We, uh--

10
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:27,959
We have teletypes with every
police agency in the mid-atlantic,

11
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,627
we're also running
daily morguehecks

12
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:31,226
in ten states
and the district,

13
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:33,959
but uh--
Nothing yet.

14
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:35,360
- Where are we
on a profile?

15
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:37,627
- I've arranged for our people
to travel to quantico today.

16
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:39,727
The bureau's been
very accommodating.

17
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:41,527
- I mean,
this is a strange one.

18
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,527
I've heard of people
going after street people,

19
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,559
but it's usually
adolescent sadism.

20
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,726
This sexual thing--

21
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:47,726
It is different.

22
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:49,025
We put it out on vicap,

23
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,925
and we have no hits anywhere
else in the country.

24
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,092
- I mean, I'm all for a little
kinky shit now and then,

25
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:57,292
but chewing
on a homeless fella?

26
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,793
- You seem to be well grounded
in the case file, detective.

27
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,159
What else do you need?

28
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,192
- Well, we've developed a rough
list of those adult males

29
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,559
who were briefly detained
by police near pier five

30
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,426
soon after the suspect
made his last call.

31
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,558
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance.

32
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:13,825
They're not suspects,

33
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:16,091
but we wld consider them
persons of interest.

34
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,324
We've also developed
a rough list

35
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:22,658
of known adult white homosexual sex
offenders in these three districts.

36
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:26,091
And, as we cull that list,
we would--

37
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:28,124
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance, too.

38
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:29,391
About a dozen men.

39
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,825
Less, actually.

40
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,725
We should be able to eliminate
many of our potentials

41
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,191
through retroactive
investigation.

42
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,658
Do you have your people?

43
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:38,591
- I've asked the chief of patrol
to detail sergeant ellis carver

44
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:39,923
from the western
homicide

45
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:42,557
for purposes of running
the surveillance element.

46
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:43,857
- Why not a man
from one of the districts

47
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:45,223
where the attacks
occurred?

48
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,557
- Well, I've worked
with carver

49
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:49,157
on prolonged investigations
in the past,

50
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:54,524
and his familiary with
surveillance tactics is relevant.

51
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,524
Also, I would be inclined to
trust his objective assessment

52
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,524
when choosing
surveillance teams.

53
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:00,757
Very good.

54
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:02,990
If that works for patrol,
it works for operations.

55
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,123
- What are we doing
to protect people?

56
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:06,955
- Patrol and tactical
are running extra cars

57
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:09,489
in all three districts
with special emphasis on posts

58
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:10,955
where the homeless
congregate.

59
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:12,922
We have ten undercovers,
dressed as vagrants,

60
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:14,156
working
staggered shifts.

61
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:17,322
- We're going to need
good undercover cars as well.

62
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,856
And I'm told that motor pool
expects nothing back

63
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:22,256
from dickman street
until--

64
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:23,623
- Whatever you need,
detective.

65
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,955
- Yes, Mr. Mayor, but we're
being told by public works--

66
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:27,222
- Go to avis
if you have to, hertz.

67
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:29,156
I don't give a shit.
People are disappearing.

68
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:30,689
Theye dying,
for crissake.

69
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,522
Just do what
you need to do.

70
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:40,255
The bad news, gentlemen,

71
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:42,522
is we're actually going to have
to catch this motherfucker.

72
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:46,522
The good news is that our mayor
finally needs a police department

73
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:48,255
more than he needs
a school system.

74
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:29,252
"A lie ain't a side of a story. It's just a lie."
- Terry Hanning.

75
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:55,884
Yo, can I help you?

76
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,483
I'm looking to work.

77
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,784
Here?

78
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,717
Yeah, you need anyone?

79
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,884
How old are you?

80
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:03,517
Eighteen.

81
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:04,983
A-ight, man,
i'm fifteen.

82
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:06,483
- I mean, yo, I can give you
a form to fill out,

83
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:11,617
but the manager, he ain't gonna
hire no one under seventeen.

84
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:18,016
Hey, yo.

85
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,716
You used to run
with the boy namond, right?

86
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,783
Yeah, I used to be
on them fayette corners.

87
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:24,149
- Oh yeah, man,
I remember you.

88
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:27,282
- Yeah, I just got tired,
ya know?

89
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:29,282
Shit got old.

90
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,516
So, I guess you need to bang
a while longer,

91
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:40,116
then come back,
see if we got something.

92
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:48,615
Then come back,
see if we got something.

93
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:49,848
Why me?

94
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,114
Why not somebody
from a district

95
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:55,181
where they caught
one of your homeless cases?

96
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:58,281
Well, there's a hitch.

97
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:09,114
- This is some
fucked-up mcnulty shit.

98
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,281
I don't want
to get burned here.

99
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:11,748
And I don't want any
of my guys getting burned.

100
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,648
Look, here's the deal.

101
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,580
Command is throwing
more resources at me

102
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,046
than I can use
on my homeless stuff.

103
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:18,380
I got that covered.

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,946
But lester--he's got
a fresh line on marlo stanfield,

105
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:23,147
and he needs people
to run it down.

106
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,414
A fresh line, huh?

107
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:28,046
He's got a fuckin' wire up
is what you mean.

108
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:30,580
- No, no, there's no--
There's no wire--

109
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,414
- Who the fuck
are you kidding?

110
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,913
I handed him a fresh cell number
for stanfield not two weeks ago.

111
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,013
- Listen, I don't know anything
about any wire.

112
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm just saying he's got
a new line on marlo,

113
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:44,579
and he needs people
to run it down.

114
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:47,579
Bosses stiff-armed him?

115
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,579
Jesus.

116
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,880
Guy drops all those
motherfuckers in the vacants.

117
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,979
Yeah.

118
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,079
- So you're throwing
people over to lester,

119
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:59,945
and paying for it
from your case, is that it?

120
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,246
O.t. Out the ass.

121
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:05,479
- What about
the paperwork?

122
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,045
I'll take care of that.

123
00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:08,346
Althe run sheets,
office reports,

124
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,579
they come through me.

125
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,345
All your people got to do
is straight police work.

126
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:12,612
Daniels gave me a free hand

127
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,678
to pull people
from any district.

128
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:23,512
Just make sure you send me
people who work.

129
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:24,978
Mcnulty.

130
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,879
What about cars?

131
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:30,178
- Departmental account
at enterprise downtown.

132
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,445
Get what ya need.

133
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:36,445
- We delay fleet maintenance
for public works

134
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:37,778
over the next
three months.

135
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:42,244
We cut snow removal in half
and pray for global warming.

136
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:44,778
That's enough to avoid
any ugly cuts in school funding,

137
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,077
at least
for this quarter.

138
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,977
- And this funds police
operations fully, correct?

139
00:07:48,077 --> 00:07:49,277
- They're back
to where they started

140
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,344
before we bled them out.

141
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:51,344
It's time anyway.

142
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:52,811
We ducked
the teacher layoffs,

143
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,611
and you got the fifteen points
on the third-grade m.s.a.s.

144
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,878
You can live with that.

145
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,210
But if we don't drop
the crime in this quarter,

146
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,711
and the next,
you are lnerable.

147
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,110
It's now or never.

148
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,811
- Besides, you're getting
traction in this homeless thing.

149
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,344
Governor was on y.p.r.
Yesterday,

150
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,909
and steiner laid him out
for the state cutbacks.

151
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,209
- Health care
for the homeless

152
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:09,476
have asked for city hall's
steps tomorrow night.

153
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:10,843
Candlelight vigil.

154
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:12,109
You said yes, right?

155
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,343
- Norman told 'em
they could do it

156
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:18,209
if I got a chance to say
a few choice words, yeah.

157
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,543
Speak of the devil.

158
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:21,276
- I just got off the phone
with the "post."

159
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,843
Reporter there wants
your comment

160
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:25,376
on a story he's workin
about dobey, down in p.g.,

161
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,543
looking to take you on
in the democratic primary.

162
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:28,643
What?

163
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:29,942
Dobey's getting in?

164
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,276
- Make matters worse,
upshaw's telling people

165
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:34,941
he might just throw in
with said county exec.

166
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,308
Shit, we might have a full-blown
p.g. Insurrection on our hands.

167
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,475
- Why the fuck
would they do that?

168
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:41,275
- Lots of pissed off
black folks down there.

169
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,842
Lot of grumblin' about always
a bridesmaid, never the bride.

170
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,842
- No way can dobey
take the statehouse.

171
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,375
All he's gonna do
is bloody us up

172
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,475
and make uspend money
we're gonna need in the general.

173
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,409
- When we went a-calling
in p.g. Last month,

174
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:53,575
who'd you see?

175
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:56,008
Steny.

176
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,575
Maloney, miller,
those guys.

177
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:59,108
White, white and white.

178
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,508
Not even a cup of coffee with
poor old congressman upshaw.

179
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,875
- I wasn't
snubbing the guy.

180
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,141
- Folks down there are tired
of being taken for granted.

181
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,875
- Fuck, I gotta kiss a ring,
don't i?

182
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:11,307
- More than a ring,
actually.

183
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:13,408
Unlimited o.t.

184
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:14,974
That's what I'm told.

185
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:17,074
- But you're sayin' we might not
be working the homeless cases.

186
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,141
Not all the time.

187
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,074
Major crimes
has a drug investigation

188
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:21,875
that may also need
surveillance work.

189
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:24,040
- Shit, who cares
what we work?

190
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,775
I need the money.

191
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,775
A-ight then.

192
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,841
You'll be
working out of homicide.

193
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,607
Report down there
to detective mcnulty.

194
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:33,440
Oh yeah--

195
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,774
Rented wheels
on the backlot.

196
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,507
Fuckin' a.

197
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,973
- Ah, man,
this is beautiful.

198
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:44,173
Oh, hell yeah.

199
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,607
- It's weird shit,
I gotta say.

200
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:47,073
Talkin' to a psychopath
like that.

201
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:50,906
- I interviewed
dick cheney once.

202
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,973
Whaddaya you think, gus?

203
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,140
Are we hyping this thing,

204
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,507
or is templeton
writing as it lays?

205
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,606
Police say it's real.

206
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,506
- An' those photographs
he got sent?

207
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,072
Hey, the guy's
fucking missing.

208
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:01,806
- So I guess now we're writing
homeless stories till december, huh?

209
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:02,972
Uh-huh.

210
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:04,539
Why till december?

211
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:07,905
- Pulitzer submissions
run the calendar year.

212
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,005
Anything a newspaper
cares about at christmas,

213
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:11,739
they give a fuck
about by new year's.

214
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,205
Homelessness
it is there, gents.

215
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:18,272
Hold on--

216
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:19,706
Hold on--

217
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,639
Fella down the lobby says
he wants to talk to an editor.

218
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,105
What kind of editor?

219
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:26,071
- The kind that worked on the
story about that homeless vet.

220
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:27,371
Scott's piece?

221
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:29,371
Sure they don't want
to talk to scott?

222
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,538
- Ys templeton won't
take his calls anymore,

223
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:36,104
so he walked over here
to talk to somebody else.

224
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:41,171
Tell him
someone's coming down.

225
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:44,204
That all he say?

226
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:48,405
- Just walked up
and said he got savino.

227
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:50,004
Said he gonna get
more of our muscle

228
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:53,036
if marlo don't come
to the street and step to him.

229
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:55,637
Good thing he didn't make me
from monk's apartment though.

230
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,737
I kept on lookin' away
from the motherfucker,

231
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,570
hopin' he ain't
remember me--

232
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,404
He was limpin' bad, too.

233
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,003
He had a crutch.

234
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:09,637
Wasn't lyin' about
savino, was he?

235
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,737
Everybody sayin'
omar's on this warpath.

236
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:16,771
Heard he got a stash house
last week.

237
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:17,771
Everybody's--

238
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:21,436
- Everybody need to
shut the fuck up.

239
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,935
Look, I'm just sayin',

240
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,669
if marlo was all that over
june bug callin' him a name,

241
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,603
so that y'all dropped june
and his whole family,

242
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:33,236
then what the fuck?

243
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:35,035
Omar out here callin' bitches
every damn day.

244
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:37,102
Fuck omar.

245
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:40,136
- What? What ya think we ain't
gonna catch this dicksucker?

246
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:43,403
This nigga gonna get got.

247
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,034
Y'all gonna tell marlo?

248
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,668
- We tell him,
we don't tell him.

249
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,268
- Man got enough
on his plate.

250
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:53,968
- Young'n's on some different
opinion shit there.

251
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:56,268
- I dunno.
If I was marlo--

252
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:59,901
Motherfucker, you ain't.

253
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:10,335
Raspberry?

254
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:12,402
Wild strawberry.

255
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,534
What?

256
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,701
Nothing, man.

257
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,701
- C'mon, man.
We gotta get across town.

258
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,667
- This bitch is gonna tell you
where there's construction.

259
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:23,467
It's gonna tell you left,
gonna tell you right.

260
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,100
Pretty much blow you
if you ask nice.

261
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,634
And look--

262
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:30,367
- Yo, you gotta play some old
school r&b shit on that, man.

263
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:34,267
- New car, o.t.
This fuckin' detail, man.

264
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,634
I hope we never catch
this goofy motherfucker.

265
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:40,367
- Hey, officers.
Lookey here.

266
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:43,366
You got two young bucks
'round the corner.

267
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,999
One in the white tee,
the other guy a throwback on.

268
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,366
One got the jump
his dip.

269
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,266
And the one with
a car tire, ya feel me?

270
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:49,333
'round the corner?

271
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,333
Fulton and lex.

272
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,366
A-ight.

273
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:52,366
Thanks, man.

274
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah.

275
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,833
Mr. Hanning?

276
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,566
It's an honor for me
to meet you, sir.

277
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,632
Who are you?

278
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:09,766
My name's gus haynes.

279
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,198
I edited the story
you're featured in.

280
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:15,565
- Then you're
a fucking liar.

281
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:27,799
- Omar.
It's omar, yo.

282
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,530
- Gotta giddy

283
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:15,063

284
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:37,262
One...

285
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,962
Two...

286
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:44,262
Three...

287
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:46,262
Four.

288
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:49,095
Ya see there?

289
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:52,629
Omar know which one it is.

290
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:56,895
Look like all your muscle
done up and indisposed now.

291
00:14:56,995 --> 00:15:02,094
So you might as well go ahead
and drop it out, ya feel me?

292
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:12,977
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--

293
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:19,961
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--

294
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:22,027
You workin'
a stanfield corner,

295
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:24,927
which means you workin'
for a straight up punk.

296
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:28,293
Ya feel me?

297
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,460
I'm out here in these streets
every day.

298
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,093
Me an' my lonesome.

299
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:36,293
An' where he at?
huh?

300
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,025
Yo, y'all put it
in his ear.

301
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,593
Marlo stanfield
is not a man for this town.

302
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,025
Ya dig?

303
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:06,760
Mmm-hmm--

304
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,226
Yeah--

305
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:12,593
Yeah, eight men,
four cars.

306
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:15,659
Ellis briefed 'em.
They know what's what.

307
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:18,693
No, they're just happy
for the o.t.

308
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:21,958
Look, don't worry, lester.

309
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:28,258
- Just sign the motherfucker
and shut the fuck up.

310
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,425
Gimme.

311
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:41,492
We ready?

312
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:42,759
'cause you gotta figure
an extra hour

313
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:46,759
to get 'round the capital
beltway this time of day.

314
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:49,957
You ever done
an f.b.i. Profile before?

315
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:50,957
Once.

316
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,824
How'd it go?

317
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,990
Oh, they take your file,

318
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,591
read you back some shit
you already know.

319
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,691
Then why do it?

320
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,357
So that we can saywe did.

321
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:14,741
- Need a pack of newport.
Soft pack.

322
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:21,690
- Need a pack of newport.
Soft pack.

323
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:22,723
And let me get one
of them, too--

324
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:31,022
Ahhhh!

325
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,523
Don't shoot!

326
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,021
- Lowenthal.
Where the fuck is he?

327
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:01,288
Um, he's, uh--

328
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:03,756
There you go, bunk.

329
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:08,222
- Hey. Request for
a d.n.a. Comparison.

330
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,589
case
Oh-six-h-two-seventy-one.

331
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,020
Latent trace
to obtained samples.

332
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:15,187
And it's a part of
the serial killer thing.

333
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,920
It's now a part
of that investigation.

334
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
Well, that's different.

335
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:19,321
If it's connected
to that investigation--

336
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:22,121
- It is.
It is, here.

337
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:23,187
It's in my notes.

338
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,087
- I never said
I was in a fire fight.

339
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,187
Not on that day.

340
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:27,788
- I'm sorry,
but you did.

341
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:30,521
- I told you the lead vehicle
took a hit from an elevated i.e.d.

342
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:31,688
Killed the fifty gunner,

343
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:33,855
and blew the hands
off the driver.

344
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:36,788
That's it.
That's enough, man.

345
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:38,321
Why you go and make
the rest of that shit up?

346
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:39,421
- I didn't make
anything up.

347
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,886
We sat there
having coffee--

348
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,886
Coffee--

349
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:42,886
- Having donuts
and coffee.

350
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,253
- And you said--
- What I say?

351
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:45,886
- Can I finish?
- I don't know.

352
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm hearing about coffee
and donuts, I'm not hearing--

353
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,220
- Can I finish? If you're not going
to let me tell my side of the story--

354
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:52,754
- A lie ain't a side
of the story,

355
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:53,787
it's just a lie.

356
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,153
- I don't have to
listen to this--

357
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,320
- Okay--hey, scott,
let's just relax here.

358
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,854
Both you gentlemen, let's just
step back here, please?

359
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,153
Now, Mr. Hanning,
forgive me,

360
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:04,453
but do you drink much?

361
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,519
- You think I fucking sleep
under a bridge sober?

362
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,419
- Sometimes when I have a few--
And I do like to have a few--

363
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,819
I tend to be a little more
descriptive in the telling of a tale.

364
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:15,819
In fact--

365
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:17,219
- I know what it
is to tell a story.

366
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:20,219
I've told plenty
in my time.

367
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:24,152
But there's some things
that happen,

368
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:27,252
you don't ever
fuck with them.

369
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,853
Scott?

370
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:38,017
- I believe you,
mr. Hanning.

371
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,551
I believe
that you believe.

372
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:44,084
That you believe
you told me one thing.

373
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,718
But, sir, with all
due respect and gratitude

374
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,551
for you and the service
you gave to this country,

375
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:50,385
you didn't tell me
that thing.

376
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:52,084
You told me
something else.

377
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:54,818
I wrote what
mr. Hanning told me.

378
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,017
Mr. Hanning--

379
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:57,084
- I know you probably--
- What if one of the guys,

380
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:58,917
what if a marine
who was there--

381
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,451
He reads that shit
that you made up?

382
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:03,083
That's why
I come down here today.

383
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:06,650
What if one of the guys
sees that?

384
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:09,817
Man, get him
outta my face.

385
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,384
- Guy's just off.
Off in general.

386
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:27,016
Off his meds.
I dunno, but off.

387
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:28,484
A lot of them are,
you know.

388
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:31,216
- I mean, I hate to say it--
- Yeah, he puts on a good front.

389
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:33,549
We'll call the marines,
get a service record,

390
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,583
reach out to some people
in his unit,

391
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:37,549
find out what the fuck happened
that day outside of--

392
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:38,915
What was it?
Fallujah?

393
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:40,816
Yeah.

394
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:42,015
- Alright, if it went down
the way you said,

395
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,616
we'll let it be.

396
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,649
But if not, we'll chalk it up
as a misunderstanding.

397
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,149
But misunderstanding or no,

398
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:53,783
we will write a correction if
what we printed wasn't accurate.

399
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:01,782
- And we didn't
have coffee.

400
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,948
We had chocolate milk.

401
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:13,014
- You Miss what you had,
though?

402
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:17,515
- I still got too much dog in me
to be settled like that.

403
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:23,682
It wasn't cheryl.
It was me.

404
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,581
Thing is, is I found a connect
with the boy, you know?

405
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,614
That part of it
feels right to me.

406
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:31,414
Kids are great.

407
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:34,147
Yeah.

408
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,147
What about you an' beadie?

409
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:40,147
You were quiet there
for a time.

410
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:41,247
Yeah.

411
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:43,247
Bunk once told me
i'm no good for people.

412
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,781
Everyone around me,
he said.

413
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,147
Was he drunk?

414
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:49,247
- Yeah.
But still.

415
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,747
- Omar be dead.
I'm tellin' you.

416
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,813
Heard that before.

417
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:54,813
F'real.

418
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:55,979
You see him?

419
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,546
- Seen his dead ass
layin' right up in there.

420
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,713
Boy up on the corner say
he try to rob them koreans

421
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:02,446
and got kilt.

422
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:15,879
- You shoulda let me give him
the years, bunk.

423
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:19,012
He'da been better off.

424
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,612
Thanks for calling.

425
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:21,712
- Figured
you'd wanna see this,

426
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:25,011
you being so tight
with the mope.

427
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:30,645
Professional job here.

428
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,078
- Nah.
Thought so at first,

429
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:34,212
but the korean broad
we sent downtown

430
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:37,645
said he got done in by a short
little fella with a big gun.

431
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:40,278
Shit, walked in
an' lit his ass up.

432
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:42,345
How short?

433
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,077
The boy robbed him?

434
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,745
- Counterlady said the hoppers
all ran up in here

435
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:52,378
afterward for souvenirs.

436
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:54,478
Took his shotty
and his semiauto too.

437
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:57,944
Ran all through
his pockets.

438
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,311
Be my guest.

439
00:23:14,678 --> 00:23:16,943
- Back on the hunt,
were you?

440
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:19,276
- Youngun say

441
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:22,043
walkin'
with a limp an' shit.

442
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:23,377
He gonna fall,
chris.

443
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:26,143
You gonna see.

444
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,443
Marlo need a meet.

445
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,143
For real?

446
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,610
- Leander,
where we at?

447
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:41,876
Still setting this up.

448
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,776
Why, did you catch
another one?

449
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:47,576
- Six-fifty-five
and thirty-four.

450
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,975
- Well,
we're not on anybody yet,

451
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:50,042
so we'll pick it up
in the morning.

452
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,709
- Alright.
Later.

453
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:53,942
Okay.

454
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:56,142
Doze, truck,
you're on monk metcalf.

455
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:58,142
Bobby, you and brian
are on chris partlow.

456
00:23:58,242 --> 00:24:00,042
He usually rides
with snoop pearson,

457
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:01,342
but if they split,

458
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:02,843
karen and tony
will pick up on her.

459
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,008
Marcus, angela--

460
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,875
You're the backup unit
when we need one.

461
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:07,542
- You're gonna be stanfield?
- Yeah.

462
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:09,008
All their business
is face-to-face,

463
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:11,274
and they meet in the open
several times a day.

464
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,074
We're just trying to find
the pattern in the meets.

465
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:15,441
- Where do we pick
these guys up?

466
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,907
- Stanfield has every corner
between m.l.k. And monroe,

467
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,141
and they start shaping it up
around eleven or so, okay?

468
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,007
That's when the re-up orders
start coming in,

469
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:27,341
that's when you'll start to see
monk making the rounds.

470
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:30,141
Most mornings, marlo starts off
with a parley or two

471
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:33,508
on the playground
between mosher and lanvale.

472
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:35,441
Now, these guys
seem to be wholesaling, too.

473
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,007
Other dealers,
players--

474
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,207
Anyone who wants to get
with him gets him there, okay?

475
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:42,807
Chris and snoop
are usually with him.

476
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,707
And mcnulty's got you
covered for paperwork.

477
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:48,340
None of what we do here
is necessary for court,

478
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,207
so rest easy on that, alright?

479
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:55,173
So we stage here
tomorrow at nine.

480
00:24:58,574 --> 00:24:59,841
No sign of him,

481
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:02,973
but I ain't on nothin' else
for as long as it take.

482
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:06,072
- You ain't heard?
Omar bagged up.

483
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,473
Shit, I thought y'all
was gonna tell me.

484
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:10,740
I just got the word myself
from monk.

485
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,939
- Who got him?
- Some young boy.

486
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,673
- Who?
- Ain't heard a name.

487
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:16,639
Don't even know
if there was a why.

488
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:20,005
Hopper wanna hear a pop,
see the damage, ya know?

489
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:22,139
Yeah--
That shit is gone.

490
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:23,573
We done
with this next resupply,

491
00:25:23,673 --> 00:25:29,039
you an' me got some time
in a.c. Coming to us, don't we?

492
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:32,206
- Forensically, this guy
is all over the map.

493
00:25:32,373 --> 00:25:34,839
Sexual to a point,
but inhibited.

494
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:37,772
Nocturnal on some,
diurnal on the others.

495
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:40,004
And the notion of targeting
the homeless, to begin with?

496
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,672
Well, we've only seen that
a couple times before,

497
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:45,605
but in those instances, it's
been someone within that cohort.

498
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:47,505
And they're not usually
carrying cell phones

499
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:48,971
and calling newspapers.

500
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:51,071
- You caught
a strange one here.

501
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:53,138
- Detectives,
hey, don't get up.

502
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:56,138
Arthur toland,
deputy director of the unit.

503
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:57,338
Just wanted to drop by

504
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:59,705
and make sure
we're progressing your case.

505
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,870
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,137
Great. Thanks.

507
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:04,504
- You might recognize
the director from television.

508
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,571
He's done all of them.

509
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,137
- You know
those news shows.

510
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:09,970
Always want a talking head
when a case comes up.

511
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,037
Greta van susteren,
nancy grace, chris matthews,

512
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:16,037
that fella with the big
forehead, whatshisname--

513
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:17,537
Larry king?

514
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:18,637
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

515
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:19,903
Hey, what the hell.

516
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,437
It's a chance to get the word
out for the bureau.

517
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:25,704
And I sell some books.

518
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:31,869
"human hunters: the rise
of the american serial killer"?

519
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,169
They've used a lot of my stuff
on those c.s.i. Shows.

520
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:38,536
I've consulted for them.

521
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:41,036
You haven't heard--

522
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:43,036
So, how long you been doing
death investigations?

523
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,603
Eight years.

524
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:48,069
We don't see a lot of
serial stuff actually.

525
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,269
Drug murders.

526
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,269
A street robbery
every now and then.

527
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,902
- Three hundred or so
a year.

528
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:55,570
- Well, you've got
a serial case now,

529
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:57,202
so, I'll leave you to it.

530
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:58,836
Good hunting.

531
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:00,736
- Art was actually
lead investigator

532
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:01,836
on the unabomber thing.

533
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:04,569
- That was like
sixteen years, right?

534
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:05,702
Yeah.

535
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:15,335
- Yeah, then his brother
ratted him out?

536
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,802
- Homeless is in
at thirty inches.

537
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:20,535
It's good shit there.

538
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:21,602
No really.

539
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:23,135
There was a real
sense of place,

540
00:27:23,202 --> 00:27:24,934
especially under
the hanover bridge

541
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:28,501
when the police came up
under there to give the warning.

542
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:30,568
Drama in small moments
like that.

543
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:32,634
- Truth is,
I had a tour guide.

544
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:33,768
Yeah?

545
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,134
- Yeah, fella I met
at a soup kitchen.

546
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,201
Volunteer there.

547
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:37,835
Ex-addict.

548
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:39,401
There's something
about this guy.

549
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:41,501
I mean, he's just--

550
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:43,468
I dunno, the more he talked,
the more I felt like

551
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:45,468
it was him I really
wanted to write about.

552
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:47,034
- Yeah?
- But he's not homeless.

553
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:48,568
And I don't have
any peg for him.

554
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,468
Shit, I don't know
what the story is.

555
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,734
Does he got a name?

556
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,033
Reginald cousins.

557
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,033
- Volunteers
at a soup kitchen.

558
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,033
What's he do for money?

559
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,567
- Sells the "baltimore sun"
every morning

560
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,800
out by light street.

561
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,300
- Well, shit not exactly
a growth industry, huh?

562
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:01,966
- He lives
in his sister's basement.

563
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,866
She'll take a plate down
to him every now and then,

564
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:05,333
but she won't let him
come up the stairs.

565
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,600
- Spend some time
with him.

566
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,667
- What about
the neighborhoods beat?

567
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:08,700
The homeless coverage?

568
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:09,767
You're covered.

569
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,700
Take a couple weeks,
see what you see.

570
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:12,866
A-ight?

571
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:14,667
- Late entries
from the copshop.

572
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,400
Two dead in
a charles county housefire,

573
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,133
and a homicide
from the city.

574
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,599
- Ettlin,
what do we got room for?

575
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,965
- We're shy one brief
in the metro digest.

576
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,499
Four paragraphs'll fill.

577
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,232
What's the homicide?

578
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,199
- The 34-year-old
black male

579
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:28,833
shot dead
in west baltimore grocery.

580
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:32,065
Juvenile suspect
is being sought.

581
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:33,599
Write up the fire.

582
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:35,499
Scratch the murder.
We don't have room.

583
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,532
- So what we conclude
from a behavioral analysis

584
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:41,165
of the known forensics
is the following:

585
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:42,432
the suspect is likely
a white male,

586
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:44,232
in his late twenties
to late thirties.

587
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:45,998
He likely is not
a college graduate,

588
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:47,698
but feels
nonetheless superior

589
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:49,598
to those with
advanced education,

590
00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:52,698
and he is likely employed
in a bureaucratic entity,

591
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,331
possibly civil service
or quasi-public service,

592
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:56,798
from which
heeels alienated.

593
00:28:56,897 --> 00:28:58,164
He has a problem
with authority

594
00:28:58,331 --> 00:29:00,531
and a deep-seated resentment
of those who he feels

595
00:29:00,598 --> 00:29:02,931
have impeded his progress
professionally.

596
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:05,064
The minimized sexual activity
suggests

597
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:07,565
that this is not a primary
motive for the killings.

598
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:10,064
In fact, the bite marks
in the last found victim--

599
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:11,931
Lacking the d.n.a. Of saliva--

600
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,831
Indicate to us
possible post-mortem staging.

601
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,063
The suspect has trouble
with lasting relationships

602
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:19,996
and is possibly
a high-functioning alcoholic,

603
00:29:20,097 --> 00:29:21,896
with alcohol being utilized
as a trigger

604
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:23,530
in the commission
of these crimes.

605
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,597
His resentment
of the homeless

606
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,364
may stem from
a personal relationship

607
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,163
with someone
who is in that cohort,

608
00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:29,896
or his victimization
of vagrants

609
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:31,831
might merely present
an opportunity for him

610
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:36,797
to assert his superiority
and intellectual prowess.

611
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,197
If you get more,
fax it down,

612
00:29:38,297 --> 00:29:46,262
and we can
update the profile.

613
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:47,296
Thanks for everything.

614
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:50,129
Thanks.

615
00:29:50,262 --> 00:29:52,129
So, what do you think?

616
00:29:52,262 --> 00:29:55,029
They're in the ballpark.

617
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:57,663
- Look, congressman,
i'll do whatever it takes

618
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,096
to make things right
between us,

619
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:01,929
but running dobey in the primary
is only gonna hurt everybody.

620
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:03,196
You mean hurt you.

621
00:30:03,296 --> 00:30:04,563
- All due respect,
i'm the only viable candidate

622
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:07,096
to beat that republican prick,
and I know you know that.

623
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:09,628
And, at the end of the day,
isn't that what it's all about?

624
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:11,028
Do not waste your breath

625
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:13,662
tellin' me what I already know
about our tax-cutting,

626
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:17,061
dump-it-on-the-counties,
ass-kiss-every-business-interest governor.

627
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:19,395
P.g. County has
a hundred murders a year,

628
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:21,061
school system held together
with spit and glue,

629
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,795
and worse rush-hour trafficthan atlanta.

630
00:30:23,928 --> 00:30:25,961
And the man in annapolis
wouldn't piss on us

631
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:27,495
if we were on fire.

632
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:29,395
- Don't hold back,
congressman.

633
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,128
- I'm tired of these
fuckin' republicans.

634
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:33,228
- Look, I fucked up
not coming to see you earlier.

635
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:35,028
But between the votes
I can pull outta baltimore,

636
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:38,494
montgomery and your county,
I am gonna take the statehouse.

637
00:30:38,594 --> 00:30:41,227
And then the frustration
that you feel is gonna end.

638
00:30:41,294 --> 00:30:43,728
I know you've heard this before
from every other sonofabitch,

639
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:45,761
but congressman,
I give you my word.

640
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,761
- You know,
you're right.

641
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,694
I have heard that before.

642
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:51,394
You wanna keep p.g. County
in your camp,

643
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:55,594
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than your word.

644
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,258
Fuck.

645
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,726
You rang?

646
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:54,625
Funny case you got here.

647
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:56,559
Your victim
had an address.

648
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,025
A home.
Paid rent,

649
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:00,924
so we assume,
maybe even a mortgage.

650
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,391
But not homeless,
in any case.

651
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:06,825
No strangulation,
no red ribbon--

652
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,524
Christopher partlow.

653
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:11,458
A lesser man
might get pissy

654
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:13,157
because you jumped the line,
bunk.

655
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,191
me?

656
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:18,758
I remember partlow's name
from all those cases last year.

657
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,924
Congrats.

658
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:21,825
Yeah.

659
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:28,190
- But don't fuck with me
like this again.

660
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,690
Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,956
- He lied on his mortgage
application, huh?

662
00:32:34,056 --> 00:32:35,123
You know, we have a name
for that over here.

663
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:36,390
- Yeah, the headshot.
I know.

664
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,856
- On a mortgage charge,
he's certain to plead out.

665
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,390
- Billy doesn't plead
his clients.

666
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,123
- Then he's looking
at a lot of years.

667
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:44,323
A federal jury
is a very different animal

668
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,956
than what they see
on calvert street.

669
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,323
- I tried
to tell them that--

670
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,856
---Yeah, but mister bond
wanted to try is himself,

671
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:53,757
see if he couldn't grandstand
his way to city hall.

672
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:56,022
Well, you have the headshot,
detective.

673
00:32:56,122 --> 00:32:57,988
But no gun with which
to fire it.

674
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,589
We can't take this case.

675
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:00,855
It's all on paper.

676
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:04,389
- You had canceled checks.
You had bank accounts.

677
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:06,422
You had his bag man
on the stand.

678
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:09,122
We had a city jury.

679
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:11,589
- You know, we've been gathering
string on clay davis

680
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,789
for six years,
detective.

681
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,756
Six years, we've had a file open
on that shakedown artist.

682
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:19,255
And now, after you
city sons of bitches

683
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:24,121
have managed, in a single week,
to transform clay fucking davis

684
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:28,221
into martin luther king, jr.,
you now come to me with this--

685
00:33:28,321 --> 00:33:30,788
Which you had in your
back pocket all along--

686
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:33,188
Looking for the federal jury
of mostly white faces

687
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:34,688
to remedy the problem?

688
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:39,822
Well, I'm sorry.

689
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,521
Thank you.

690
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:54,520
What's this?

691
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,821
- From the pocket
of a dead stick-up boy.

692
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,220
Omar little.

693
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,787
Omar? Dead?

694
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:02,986
- You stop readin'
the twenty-fours?

695
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,620
Killed yesterday
at a grocery.

696
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:06,454
Slow to the draw,
he was.

697
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:07,654
No shit.

698
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,654
- One to the back
of the head.

699
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:11,287
Norris and crutchfield
caught it.

700
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:12,821
They're looking
for a juvenile.

701
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,520
He was hunting
stanfield and crew.

702
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,754
And this was on him?

703
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,386
yep.

704
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:20,286
Thought of you and lester
when I saw it.

705
00:34:20,386 --> 00:34:23,019
Payback for you
getting me back some great lab.

706
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:25,820
Positive d.n.a.
On chris partlow.

707
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,919
An alley beating, not one
of the ones in the vacants.

708
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:29,619
Motherfucker.

709
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,553
You have all kinds
of news today, don't you?

710
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,186
- Yeah, going for a warrant
right now.

711
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:36,619
- Hey, can you wait
to serve it?

712
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,852
We're right at the edge,
bunk.

713
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,319
How long?

714
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,753
'cause this is an honest
fuckin' murder prosecution here.

715
00:34:41,852 --> 00:34:43,386
I'll talk to lester.

716
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:45,385
Congrats.

717
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:47,851
- Yeah.
No shuckin', no jivin'.

718
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:48,851
Just good ol'
police work.

719
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:49,851
How about that, jimmy?

720
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:50,951
Hey, without my bullshit,

721
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:54,318
you're still
waiting on lab work.

722
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:59,285
- Listen, jimmy, the conaway
shooting from westport?

723
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:00,652
The transvestite?

724
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,185
I go to vicap, there's
another one just like it--

725
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:05,585
Look--down in carolina,
four months ago.

726
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,752
For a road car
and two nights in a hotel,

727
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:09,285
I can put this down.

728
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:10,385
- What are you
talking about?

729
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:12,883
Yours is a 9 mm,
this one's a 32.

730
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,250
Yours was a bar pick-up,
this one's a home invasion--

731
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:18,784
- Still worth
checking out.

732
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,784
- I don't see it.
Sorry.

733
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:23,617
- You're gonna make me
spit it out, aren't you--

734
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,950
You ever played
hilton head?

735
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,050
I get a call from my
brother-in-law a few days ago.

736
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,017
He managed to swing
a tee-time for this weekend.

737
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:31,651
Jimmy,
i'm going, goddammit.

738
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:34,651
The fuck do I care? Go.

739
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:37,684
- You know, this is some real
cute shit you're pulling here.

740
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:39,317
Taking the detail money

741
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:42,216
and doling it around
ke a priest passing wafers.

742
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:43,882
Now, I don't know
exactly what you're up to,

743
00:35:43,982 --> 00:35:46,817
but I know this: if someone
picked up a phone around here,

744
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:51,450
your shit is
critically fucked.

745
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:55,350
Two nights
and a road car.

746
00:36:07,615 --> 00:36:10,716
- Leander, I'm showing ten-fifty-five
and thirty-four from marlo's phone.

747
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:12,248
Anybody on the move?

748
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:14,948
- I got him coming eastbound
on baltimore street at calhoun.

749
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:16,215
Who's on monk?

750
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:18,915
Wait one.

751
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:20,749
Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-eleven.

752
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:21,816
Where you at, man?

753
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:22,915
Twenty-three-eleven.

754
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,449
Southbound m.l.k.
Approaching route forty.

755
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,749
That's the meet, lester.

756
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,282
Monk and marlo
on the westside.

757
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:30,382
We on it.

758
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,815
- Corner of argyle
and dolphin.

759
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,715
Monk and marlo,
as expected.

760
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:54,247
- Now I got four-forty and
thirty-five coming into marlo's phone.

761
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,748
- Yeah, he's scoping
that, lester.

762
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,081
- We know it ain't
monk callin'.

763
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,748
- Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-twelve.

764
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:01,748
Twenty-three twelve.

765
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:02,814
Who do you have eyes on?

766
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:03,846
Both my subjects.

767
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:04,913
- They go to
their cell phones?

768
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:05,913
Negative.

769
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:07,580
They on the move?

770
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:08,747
Negative.

771
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:10,280
Twenty-three-fourteen.

772
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,913
- We got nothing moving either.
- No one elscalling or moving.

773
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:13,747
- Means we got somebody else
on this network

774
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:17,647
we don't yet know.

775
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:19,846
Oh, boy.

776
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,945
- Hey, man.
Let me give you a hand.

777
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,945
Alright, you ready?

778
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:42,512
ah.

779
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:44,479
- I don't have no money
in the moment,

780
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:48,646
but I'll be going down
to the scales in a hour or two.

781
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:55,312
You help me out,
i'll go ten for your trouble.

782
00:37:55,347 --> 00:38:01,877
You help me out,
i'll go ten for your trouble.

783
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:05,144
Got a rag
for that behind you.

784
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:08,311
Junk!
Junkman!

785
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,511
Junk! Junk!

786
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:13,078
Junkman! Junk!

787
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:21,311
- Where the fuck
are you going?

788
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:25,976
- Oh, uh, I gotta
see lester about--

789
00:38:26,077 --> 00:38:27,510
What's all that?

790
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,510
- Parole info on known sex
offenders for five zip codes.

791
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,377
I've also got background
info on my desk

792
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:35,377
for everyone we picked up
at pier five with a cell phone.

793
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,110
- You're actually gonna--
- Compare the f.b.i. Profile

794
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:39,277
with every person of interest
I can find.

795
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:42,711
Hell yeah,
somebody's gotta.

796
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:43,876
- Come here.
- The fuck are you doin'?

797
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:45,444
Come here.

798
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:53,710
- Maurice dobey?
For governor?

799
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:57,409
Of my state?
Sheet.

800
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:58,909
That's some cynical politics,
right there.

801
00:38:58,975 --> 00:39:01,142
Playin' like you gonna
run a man you know can't win

802
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:03,343
to scare people
into payin' off.

803
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:04,842
- Dobey could
bloody you up, tommy.

804
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,676
In baltimore
and p.g. Both.

805
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,443
- Playin' that race card.
Shameful.

806
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,209
- What does upshaw want
to stay out of the race?

807
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:12,209
Tomuch.

808
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:13,376
Are you going to pay?

809
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,309
- Well, let's just say
i'm in negotiations.

810
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:16,543
- Well, I'll do everything
I can to make sure

811
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:18,743
this insurrection
doesn't spread into the city.

812
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:21,275
- Wonderful! And how much
is the loyal support

813
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,841
of the eastside democratic
coalition going to cost me?

814
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:26,742
- Only an endorsement,
given that this man right here

815
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:29,375
is still standing,
I don't believe that rupert bond

816
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:30,908
is going to find his way
into this office.

817
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:32,108
Do you?

818
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,275
And for my endorsement,
you will return the favor

819
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,742
and ignore our friends
in prince george's.

820
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:36,742
And the loyalty
of the westside

821
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,408
is going to cost me
what exactly?

822
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:39,941
Oh, nothin' big.

823
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,234
You got three seats comin' open
on the liquor board.

824
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:43,432
You get one seat.

825
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:46,277
Two, and you have me out there
raising money for you in the primary.

826
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:48,737
Sold. And clay,
it scares me to think of the damage

827
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:51,019
you could do with two votes on the liquor board.

828
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:56,954
It ain't right.

829
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:00,029
No... It just is.

830
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,792
No, I mean, you can't do this.

831
00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:04,201
We're doing it. Whatever
they give us to work the bullshit,

832
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:08,496
I throw it to lester. Or crutchfield,
or norris. Anyone else who has a case ***

833
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,040
it was bad enough I wasted your day
yesterday going to quantico,

834
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,988
I can't stand to see you wasting
any more time on this,

835
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:14,763
you should be back working
your home invasion.

836
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:17,170
- Jimmy, you can't do this.
- A couple days more.

837
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,262
Lester gets his best shot at marlo,
after that

838
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:21,650
we'll never hear
from the *** killer again.

839
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,345
Bosses will lose interest,
i'll pretend to run out of little more string.

840
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:28,336
And then it goes right back to the adman office.
No harm, no foul.

841
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,569
Whatever you need, kima...

842
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:34,336
To work your triple,
or any case that matters to you.

843
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:38,859
Manpower, o.t., labwork, cars...

844
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,153
Just let me know.

845
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:46,740
I gotta go.

846
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:51,839
Wake up!

847
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:01,172
Hey, bug! Up here.

848
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:03,418
Hold, boy.

849
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:07,242
I'll get you that 10 tomorrow.
And if you're looking for work,

850
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:08,971
I got work needs lifting.

851
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:12,480
You know the stable on Booth Street?
Be there before 9.

852
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,318
Dang, dukie ***

853
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:23,234
i'm showing 5:15 and 34 seconds.

854
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:26,337
I'm up park heights,
but I lost him just past the park.

855
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,604
M.t.a. Bus
clipped a curb

856
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:29,404
and it knocked down
a utility pole.

857
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:31,205
By the time I detoured,
he slipped me good.

858
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:36,171
Well, let me know.

859
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:37,904
Big news.

860
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:40,636
Bunk has a murder warrant
on chris partlow.

861
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,970
The hell you say.

862
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:43,336
- Not one
from the vacants.

863
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:45,436
D.n.a. Match
on an alley beating.

864
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,603
He lets this go now,

865
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:48,170
these guys are gonna
go to ground.

866
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,803
We're right at the edge
of something here.

867
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:51,770
- He's giving us
a couple of days.

868
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,803
He owes me.

869
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:54,703
I expedited his lab work
for it.

870
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,703
Oh, and omar little?
Stickup-boy?

871
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,970
What about him?

872
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,403
- Caught one in a korean joint
over westside.

873
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:02,070
Bunk pulled that out
of his pocket.

874
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,536
Mean anything
at all to us?

875
00:42:03,703 --> 00:42:06,303
- Look's like he was
after marlo's crew.

876
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:11,836
Cheese.
Cheese wagstaff?

877
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:13,836
In addition
to their corners,

878
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:16,535
these guys are wholesaling
all over town at this point,

879
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,435
so I figured cheese
was just one of many.

880
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:22,735
- Note reads like omar
had him under marlo'wing.

881
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:24,468
A lieutenant, at least.

882
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:25,735
Anyway,
I gotta go,

883
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:29,368
do more pretending
for the rest of the city.

884
00:42:29,435 --> 00:42:33,069
Oh, by the way,
i--I told greggs.

885
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:34,801
- Oh, mcnulty.
How many more people--

886
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:37,168
- She was about to jump into the
serial murders with both feet.

887
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:39,001
I couldn't stand
to spin her like that--

888
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:41,868
How'd she take it?

889
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:50,135
- Twenty-three-oh-six to
any twenty-three sequence.

890
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,401
Trying to reconnect
with my subject.

891
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:53,101
- Anyone near northwest
who can assist?

892
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:55,135
- Twenty-three-fifteen
to twenty-three-oh-six.

893
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:56,835
I'm in the twenty-eight
hundred block

894
00:42:56,935 --> 00:42:59,467
edgecombe circle south,
sitting on the female subject.

895
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:01,201
Maybe that's the other end
of your meet.

896
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:02,201
Edgecombe circle?

897
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:03,201
Where's that, twenty?

898
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:05,466
It runs off pall mall.

899
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:06,834
Where's pall mall?

900
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,301
I'm not too good up
in the northwest.

901
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:09,466
It's between pimlico--

902
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:14,366
- Never mind,
I got a map book.

903
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,767
Okay,
see what we got here.

904
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:24,500
Map thirty-four,
grid e-three.

905
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:31,033
Thirty-fr, e-three,
thirty-four, e-three--

906
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:37,866
Three--

907
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:38,966
Whaddya got?

908
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:40,866
- Lester,
what'd that last clock show?

909
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:43,399
- And these people that I
share the stage with tonight

910
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,833
are here as representatives
of the hundreds,

911
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:49,033
no, the thousands of citizens
without shelter,

912
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:52,699
without protection,
in this city tonight.

913
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,532
Why does this have to be?

914
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:57,265
Certainly,
the last seven years

915
00:43:57,331 --> 00:44:00,165
have not brought the same levels
of federal commitment

916
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:04,798
to american cities as from
previous administrations.

917
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:07,965
And certaiy, our governor
has in the last year

918
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:13,431
placed severe restrictions on whatever
stopgap state programs were in place.

919
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:16,165
And what little remained
of our so-called safety net

920
00:44:16,232 --> 00:44:17,698
was simply shredded,

921
00:44:17,832 --> 00:44:20,165
and more and more
of our fellow citizens

922
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:22,731
found themselves living life
at the broken edges,

923
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:24,430
in the street.

924
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,530
Well, I say that this is
not on tragic,

925
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,363
it is unforgivable!

926
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,630
And I am here to say
that no longer can these people

927
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,463
with whom I share this stage
tonight be invisible,

928
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,164
just, just, just as all of those
without shelter in this city,

929
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:42,430
in this country, can
no longer be invisible to us.

930
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,797
And it is regrettable
that it has taken the actions

931
00:44:44,897 --> 00:44:47,164
of a remorseless predator
to make us reflect.

932
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:49,430
But we in baltimore
have been tested,

933
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,529
and we have been taught
that all of our citizens

934
00:44:52,696 --> 00:44:55,163
deserve the full protection
of the law,

935
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:58,629
and the full support
of the community.

936
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,763
And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

937
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:03,529
and to all the other ills
that prey on those

938
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:06,462
without shelter
in our city--

939
00:45:06,563 --> 00:45:08,197
Not tonight
can you prey on them.

940
00:45:08,297 --> 00:45:13,396
And not tomorrow.
Not any longer.

941
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:16,563
We will protect you!

942
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:18,462
Thank you.

943
00:45:57,494 --> 00:46:01,128
- She asked you keep
that one stirred.

944
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:05,594
- Hey, you were
on my thing, right?

945
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:07,894
I guess I owe you
a drink on that.

946
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:09,061
What's your poison?

947
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:12,394
- I'm okay, senator,
thank you very much.

948
00:46:12,494 --> 00:46:13,761
Obonda, huh?

949
00:46:13,894 --> 00:46:16,227
That's a good one.

950
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:19,160
You know, that was mostly my
evidence you beat back there, right?

951
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,294
You think you
could do that again?

952
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:22,693
Excuse me?

953
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:25,660
- 'Cept this time,
the jury's a federal one.

954
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,760
Say, nine white,
three black.

955
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,960
- Time for you
to tip on out, detective.

956
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,359
- Bank records
on that mortgage application

957
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:40,359
you made on the calvert county
property years back.

958
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:43,592
Now, why don't you
take that back to billy murphy?

959
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:46,059
Ask your attorney
what you're exposed to.

960
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,792
At this point, this is just between
us two gentlemen here, senator.

961
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,826
And no one else
till I make it so.

962
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:55,892
What?

963
00:46:55,992 --> 00:46:57,792
You tryin' to sell
a case back to me?

964
00:46:57,892 --> 00:46:59,525
Motherfucker,
if you don't get--

965
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:00,892
- I don't get paid
like that.

966
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:02,592
I get paid when
I come bacup in here

967
00:47:02,725 --> 00:47:04,226
a couple nights time
with questions.

968
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:05,525
And you, sir,
have answers.

969
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,425
Or my next call will be
to the u.s. Attorney's office,

970
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,825
and we will go again.

971
00:47:09,925 --> 00:47:11,192
But for real.

972
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:19,025
You can keep tt copy.
Ma'am.

973
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:26,758
You can keep that copy.
Ma'am.

974
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:29,192
- Just to let you know,
before the fireworks start,

975
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:31,091
i'm spiking this lede
and I'll play it straight.

976
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:32,158
But you got back?

977
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:35,292
As best I can.

978
00:47:35,357 --> 00:47:37,024
Scott!

979
00:47:49,957 --> 00:47:53,557
I'm spiking your lede.

980
00:47:53,657 --> 00:47:56,857
I'm not running a story
about a public gathering--

981
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,191
A candlelight vigil
at city hall, in fact--

982
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:03,090
Where the lede anecdote and quote
is from an unnamed homeless woman.

983
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:04,756
- She doesn't want to be
known as homeless.

984
00:48:04,856 --> 00:48:06,290
I explained that.

985
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:09,389
- Scott, there were hundreds of
homeless down there tonight--

986
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:12,223
People who voluntarily
attended this event.

987
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,023
And I'm gonna guess
that any number of them

988
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,023
would've let you put
their names in the paper.

989
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:18,622
- But her story is great.
Look at that quote--

990
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:19,756
It's a perfect quote.

991
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:21,256
Best quote
I could ever ask for.

992
00:48:25,956 --> 00:48:27,689
Jesus christ.

993
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:31,290
To hell with you
if you think I made it up.

994
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:34,955
- We have a standard
that we follow here.

995
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:37,321
And I'm gonna follow it.

996
00:49:03,154 --> 00:49:05,954
Here it comes, gus.

997
00:49:06,054 --> 00:49:08,353
yep.

998
00:49:14,787 --> 00:49:18,054
- Gus, you're retopping
scott's vigil copy?

999
00:49:18,154 --> 00:49:19,353
I am.

1000
00:49:19,487 --> 00:49:20,620
But I thought--

1001
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,087
- Anonymous attribution
in a public setting.

1002
00:49:23,188 --> 00:49:24,554
There's no need for it.

1003
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,754
Gus, let's discuss this.

1004
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,921
- Actually,
I did discuss it.

1005
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:28,519
I discussed it
with the metro editor,

1006
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:29,519
and he agrees.

1007
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:31,653
Now, the story's
on the copy desk,

1008
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,287
and as a line editor
working this story,

1009
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:35,086
I feel I've done my job.

1010
00:49:35,187 --> 00:49:39,386
Now, you as the m.e.,
if you want to go another way,

1011
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,020
you pull the story back
and re-edit.

1012
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:42,920
But we have a sourcing
policy here,

1013
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,719
and I knowt,
and I do not feel comfortable

1014
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,619
bending the rules
in this instance.

1015
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,287
G'night.

1016
00:50:07,485 --> 00:50:08,952
Yeah?

1017
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:10,485
- Mcnulty,
it's christeson.

1018
00:50:10,652 --> 00:50:12,219
Listen,
my case is down an'

1019
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,286
I wanted
to thank you.

1020
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:15,019
I couldn't have done it
otherwise.

1021
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,451
No problem.

1022
00:50:29,851 --> 00:50:32,151
Hey. It went great.

1023
00:50:32,218 --> 00:50:33,151
Kids asleep?

1024
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:35,118
- Yeah, but they saw you
on w.b.a.l.

1025
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:36,784
Anna said your hair
looked funny.

1026
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:39,051
- Well, just so long as
she was impressed.

1027
00:50:39,151 --> 00:50:40,584
Cnn was there.

1028
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,218
I wonder if they'll cycle
any coverage through tonight.

1029
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:45,018
- A good day
for hizzoner, huh?

1030
00:50:45,118 --> 00:50:46,285
I dunno.

1031
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:47,851
Nerese shook me down
for a mayoral endorsement,

1032
00:50:47,951 --> 00:50:50,117
and clay davis,
back from the grave,

1033
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,050
took a couple
liquor board seats.

1034
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,583
Just so as they won't join
in upshaw's little warparty

1035
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:56,650
down in prince george's.

1036
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,850
- You're gonna endorse
nerese?

1037
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,583
You told me
you prefer bond.

1038
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:02,716
- I do,
but this thing with upshaw--

1039
00:51:02,817 --> 00:51:04,583
Shit, I might even
have to give him a bump

1040
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:05,983
just to calm him down.

1041
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,616
- God.
What's he asking?

1042
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,516
There--look.

1043
00:51:09,616 --> 00:51:11,416
What's upshaw asking?

1044
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:14,683
- Half of any extra school
or anti-crime money

1045
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:16,250
I get outta the legislature
for baltimore

1046
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:17,782
would go to p.g. County.

1047
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,715
- You take that deal
and baltimore's out

1048
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:22,082
half of what you want to bring
back to the city schools.

1049
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:26,348
- Yeah, but if I don't win, jen,
I bring back exactly nothing.

1050
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:28,249
Look.

1051
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:30,348
- And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

1052
00:51:30,415 --> 00:51:33,582
and to all the other ills--

1053
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:44,382
- Go on.
Straight to bed.

1054
00:51:44,515 --> 00:51:45,381
Hey, kiddo.

1055
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:49,081
Hey, mcnulty.

1056
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:51,648
Where'd you go to?

1057
00:51:51,714 --> 00:51:53,714
- None of your business
really, jimmy.

1058
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:55,447
Next time,
i'm not going anywhere.

1059
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:56,915
Next time, you're gonna
be out on your ass,

1060
00:51:57,015 --> 00:52:00,714
because that's
my fucking house.

1061
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:08,548
That's police work, son.

1062
00:52:08,614 --> 00:52:10,648
- I pull the a.d.c. Book
to find a location,

1063
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:14,014
and I'm on the same page number
as the second hand.

1064
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:15,380
And I remember
wead a lotta clocks

1065
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,713
with thirty-four seconds.

1066
00:52:16,814 --> 00:52:18,380
- That's a page
from west baltimore.

1067
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,647
Right.

1068
00:52:19,747 --> 00:52:22,181
Now, the second hand
is always the map page.

1069
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:25,214
Longitude, a-through-k,
is the hour,

1070
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:29,114
and for the latitude, they go
by five-minute intervals.

1071
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:31,114
Now they know
the meeting spot in advance,

1072
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,747
and they code it
by the grid square.

1073
00:52:33,847 --> 00:52:36,580
But if the clock
has nothing to do with time,

1074
00:52:36,713 --> 00:52:39,980
how do they know
when to meet?

1075
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:46,946
- Everything's less than
a half hour of driving,

1076
00:52:47,046 --> 00:52:51,345
even in traffic.

1077
00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:53,412
My guess is
that the standing logic

1078
00:52:53,512 --> 00:52:57,646
is that they meet
within an hour or so.

1079
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:05,479
You know what else
makes sense?

1080
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:10,945
This clock face when no one
was on the move?

1081
00:53:11,045 --> 00:53:13,845
The times are all
at thirty-five seconds.

1082
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:17,711
And that's the page
for east bawlmer.

1083
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:19,344
Cheese.

1084
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:21,212
Cheese wagstaff?

1085
00:53:26,511 --> 00:53:28,878
- Marlo's wholesaling
on the westside through monk,

1086
00:53:28,978 --> 00:53:29,878
and on the eastside
with cheese.

1087
00:53:29,978 --> 00:53:31,711
He's got the whole
goddamn city.

1088
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:35,145
- How do we know
it's cheese?

1089
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,077
oh--

1090
00:53:41,977 --> 00:53:45,410
You, too, huh?

1091
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,144
You all
are good with this?

1092
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,710
Kima--

1093
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:50,443
Not me.

1094
00:53:55,244 --> 00:53:56,811
All the guysat the bar, jimmy?

1095
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,544
All the girls?

1096
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:01,244
They don't show up
at your wake.

1097
00:54:01,343 --> 00:54:03,076
Not because
they don't like you

1098
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:06,543
but because they never
knew your last name.

1099
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,076
A month later, someone tells 'em
"oh, jimmy died."

1100
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:10,509
"jimmy who?"

1101
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:11,643
"jimmy the cop."

1102
00:54:11,776 --> 00:54:15,910
"ohh," they say.
"him."

1103
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:18,177
And all the people
on the job,

1104
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:21,177
all the people you spent all
those hours in the radio car with,

1105
00:54:21,277 --> 00:54:24,076
the guys with their feet up
on their desk telling stories,

1106
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,843
who shorted you
on the food runs,

1107
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:28,442
who signed your
overtime slips.

1108
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:32,475
In the end, they're not
gonna be there either.

1109
00:54:32,575 --> 00:54:33,942
Family.
That's it.

1110
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:35,009
Family.

1111
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:36,708
And if you're lucky,

1112
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:40,276
one or two friends
who are the same as family.

1113
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,375
That's all
the best of us get.

1114
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:45,475
Everything else is just--

1115
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:57,375
- There is no
serial killer.

1116
00:54:57,475 --> 00:55:01,141
There are no murders.
I made it all up.

1117
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,141
They were--they were
shutting us down.

1118
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:09,307
They were--
They were just--

1119
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:10,507
It's hard to explain.

1120
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,474
I don't even know
where the anger comes from.

1121
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:15,208
I don't know
how to make it stop.

1122
00:55:15,374 --> 00:55:22,641
They fucking task me,
they do.

1123
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:25,008
We took the money from
the bullshit investigation,

1124
00:55:25,108 --> 00:55:26,840
and we routed it
to lester.

1125
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,606
Now he's got the cake
to take down marlo stanfield.

1126
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:34,073
And now
that I've done all this--

1127
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,073
Now that I've
watched myself do it,

1128
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:41,140
I can't even stand to--

1129
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,339
Lester says he's close.

1130
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:44,406
Time will pass,

1131
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:48,773
and I'll be able
to shut this thing down.

1132
00:55:48,873 --> 00:55:52,140
If you don't go to jail.

1133
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:58,772
You had no fucking right.

1134
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:04,972
- I know.
- This is my life, too.

1135
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:06,906
You start to tell the story;
you think you're the hero.

1136
00:56:07,006 --> 00:56:20,871
And then, when you get done
talking, you--
