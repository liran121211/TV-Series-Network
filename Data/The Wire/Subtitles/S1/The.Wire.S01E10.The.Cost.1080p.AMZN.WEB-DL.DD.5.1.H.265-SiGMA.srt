1
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,863
This is the second
time this week

2
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,334
I had to pay for a sitter
'cause he was working late.

3
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,269
With all that money you
making, you can afford it?

4
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,485
Lord.

5
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,595
What's up, Bubs?

6
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,598
Hey.

7
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,402
Well, there you go.

8
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,574
- Man: well, what you got?
- I got some starters.

9
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,364
( theme music playing )

10
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,634
* If you walk
through the garden *

11
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,738
* You better
watch your back *

12
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,643
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

13
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,280
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

14
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:57,151
* If you walk
through Jesus *

15
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,555
* He'll save your soul

16
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,823
* You gotta
keep the devil *

17
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,796
* Down in the hole

18
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,400
* All the angels sing

19
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,504
* About Jesus' mighty soul

20
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,239
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

21
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:24,011
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

22
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,615
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

23
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:31,619
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

24
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,389
* You got to
keep the devil *

25
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,859
* Way down in the hole

26
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,670
* Way down in the hole

27
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,873
* Way down in the hole

28
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,246
* Way down in the hole

29
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:01,415
* Way down in the hole.

30
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,423
My fault, A.

31
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,559
I should've never
left you alone, homie.

32
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,826
Naw, shit.

33
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,363
Man, you ain't pull up
when you did, I'm gone.

34
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,931
Listen, what I want
to know is how the fuck

35
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,933
we come back
on this cocksucker?

36
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,469
We don't.
Not now.

37
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,903
You feel me?
Listen, your advice,

38
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,039
Stringer, your advice
was good advice.

39
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,276
I want to
let you know that.

40
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,077
What I want you
to do now,

41
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,145
I want you to put
the word out there.
I want you to let him know

42
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,381
we willin' to squash this,
if he is.

43
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,450
And then what the fuck
if he ain't?

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,452
Naw, this nigga
lives in the town too,

45
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,687
he gonna listen,
if we parlay.

46
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,757
And then when he creep out
of his hole and shit.

47
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,025
- Boom.
- Okay.

48
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,261
- Smoke him.
- Say no more, got you.

49
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,463
- Put that out there, yo.
- A'ight.

50
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,301
What about them
police, though?

51
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,168
They was on your ass
after the game?

52
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,538
Yeah, man,
it was like two cars.

53
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,809
See, if they on you,
then they got a name.

54
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,745
If they got a name,
then they know you
ain't got no license.

55
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,980
Yeah, but they don't want
no traffic charges,

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,816
you know what I'm sayin'?
They don't want no humble shit.

57
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,184
I think they was tryin'
to see where I might go.

58
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,587
Where the fuck was you
gonna take their asses?

59
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,389
I was takin' them
to the barbershop.

60
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,291
For real, I was goin'
to get a haircut.

61
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,192
Get a fade?

62
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,828
I know, B, but...

63
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,263
these motherfuckers are on us.
What the fuck?

64
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:27,601
They always been on us,
we just got to be careful.

65
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,137
Well, you not been
talkin' on any phones.

66
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,272
And you not been
touching any drugs.

67
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,208
And from now on,
you are not doin'
the money runs.

68
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,144
Me and Bey, we gonna
take care of that shit

69
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,812
until this
whole thing cool off.

70
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,814
Let me
get that pager.

71
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,883
Oh, what's up,
you serious?

72
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,185
Serious, I'm gonna get you
a New York supply number only.

73
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,755
Any of these motherfucking
local cats want to talk to you,

74
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,990
they gotta talk to me.

75
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,498
We gotta build
a wall around you, B.

76
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,803
Another month
on a fresh phone?

77
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,172
Yeah, they ripped out
the pay phones in
the low-rises.

78
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,474
Now they're walking
a block or two away.

79
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:07,608
I'm just asking,
how much longer

80
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,909
until you bring
this case in, Jimmy?

81
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,411
The quicker you can,
the better for everybody.

82
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,945
Yourself included.

83
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,882
Look at this,
Judge Gwynn sends
his regrets.

84
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,785
He can't make lunch.
Like I got the plague
all of a sudden.

85
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,653
There's your new phone,
30 days.

86
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,390
A couple of weeks ago,
when Burrell wanted
to take down the wire,

87
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,657
you were the one
breaking it off in his ass.

88
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,626
Jimmy, Jimmy,
there's a lady here.

89
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,161
Rhonda talks more trash
than both of us, Your Honor.

90
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,664
I have never been anything other
than lady-like, Your Honor.

91
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,301
Detective McNulty
is going out of his way

92
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:36,203
to insult an officer
of the court.

93
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,871
McNulty,
I hold you in contempt.

94
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,840
Who doesn't?

95
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,410
What's with him?

96
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,645
- You haven't heard?
- No.

97
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,818
What's wrong
with the picture?

98
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,087
- Don't know.
- Phelan isn't in it.

99
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,723
What, he's up
for election?

100
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,058
I thought judges
had 15-year terms.

101
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,394
They do, but Phelan was named
to finish Halpern's term,

102
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,563
which only had
two years left.

103
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,364
So he has to run
on his own in the primary.

104
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,966
What, he's not
on the ticket?

105
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,300
Why the fuck not?

106
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,337
Maybe it's
the company he keeps?

107
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,372
Oh, fuck.

108
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,307
No, see, you ain't
thinkin' about

109
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:15,876
how much room
the baby gonna need.

110
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,511
Especially when
he get to growin',

111
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,181
'cause, I mean, there are
things we got to have.

112
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,051
Like a real crib,
a play desk,

113
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,754
and you know, he got to have
one of them little tyke cars.

114
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,389
I'm not sayin' your place
ain't nice enough.

115
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,659
'cause for you,
it do just fine,

116
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,594
but if we gonna
be a family,

117
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,062
we need at least
one more room,

118
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,397
if not two.

119
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,966
So you add
the bedroom set,

120
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,401
a nice bedroom set
like the one they got

121
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,336
down at that baby store
on Howard Street,

122
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,072
and that's a room
right there.

123
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,908
And I think we might could
get some better furniture

124
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,410
and put your stuff
in the other bedroom,

125
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,379
like it was a den,

126
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,782
'cause the sofa you got
seen better days.

127
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,650
I think you
know that much.

128
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,122
Dee, where you goin' at?

129
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,292
I told you I need money
for the new bedroom set!

130
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,627
- ( door closes )
- Dee!

131
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,095
Man:
Why you holler at me?

132
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,830
Man 2:
Yo, man, we gettin'
down to it.

133
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,699
I get to you
when I get to you.

134
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,100
That's the main
stash house.

135
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,703
Say what?

136
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,271
The incoming call is the guy
who runs the main stash

137
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,573
- for Barksdale's people.
- Who is he?

138
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,174
McNulty
We don't know.

139
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,110
So, you all just guessing
he's on the stash, right?

140
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,612
No, he's on it.

141
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,548
Lester was checking the logs
a couple of weeks ago

142
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,916
when he picked up
the pattern.

143
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,984
Every time they get down
to the ends on a package,

144
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,953
somebody in the tower
hits that pager number.

145
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,422
And then, within a half hour
every fucking time,

146
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:36,857
a call comes back
to the tower pay phone

147
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,192
from that number
in Pimlico.

148
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,494
Which is?

149
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,762
It's a pay phone
at a Mondo Mart

150
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,631
in Reisterstown
at Cold Spring Lane.

151
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,634
You see it now?

152
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,235
Hmm?

153
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:55,208
When the supply gets low,
they page this mope,

154
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,245
who always calls back
from a pay phone

155
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,680
way the fuck out
in northwest.

156
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:01,615
Same phone,
same pattern.

157
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,185
So, y'all think that
he's taking the re-up order

158
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,155
and that the stash is somewhere
near the Mondo Mart, right?

159
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,590
You are on it,
Detective Sydnor.

160
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,159
Okay, so what do
you do with this?

161
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,094
What do we do?

162
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,031
We're gonna be sittin'
on that pay phone in Pimlico

163
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,133
all day and all night,
waitin' on Mr. Mondo Mart.

164
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,602
Herc, too.

165
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,604
Herc's out this whole week.
In-service training.

166
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,405
That's too bad.

167
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,908
So, instead of three
eight-hour shifts,

168
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,410
you two are gonna
have to pull 12 hours.

169
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,380
Just fucking
kill me now.

170
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,415
( chuckling )

171
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,884
Heard from Omar?

172
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,686
Nope.

173
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,988
I'm gonna go try
to scare him up.
Where you gonna be?

174
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,223
Well, everyone on the wire
keeps talking about

175
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,793
how this kid's all tore up
about the dead stickup boy.

176
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,995
- I'm gonna see for myself.
- All right.

177
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,663
You need us,
we're on the radio.

178
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,364
Okay.

179
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,034
( car radio playing )

180
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,900
Hey, what up, man?

181
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,440
This first time,
I can go four ounces of rock.

182
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,842
But hey,
if the shit is right,

183
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,010
then next time
I can step that up.

184
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,646
Almost ain't
worth it for four.

185
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,681
Just this
first go-round.

186
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,450
You do right by me,

187
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,252
I'll turn around
and come back on it.

188
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,054
Where your
money at, man?

189
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,265
We good.

190
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,102
So, where the shit at?

191
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,283
( laughing )

192
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,623
( dog barking )

193
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,750
Woman:
Ain't nobody been there
but you.

194
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,320
Nobody came in my house
but you.

195
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,322
- Man: Everybody been.
- Nobody but you.

196
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:58,959
You're the only person
that came in my house.

197
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,094
So, what you got
goin' for you?

198
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:05,265
Ain't got nothin' left,
burnt it away.

199
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,000
Family?

200
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,137
Mother dead.
Father, who the fuck know?

201
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,172
Brothers, sisters?

202
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,474
A sister.

203
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,076
She lets me
stay in the basement,

204
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,812
but she lock the door
so I can't go upstairs.

205
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,113
About the best
she can do for me.

206
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,717
I got a kid,
a son.

207
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,485
Imagine me bringing life
into the world.

208
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,187
What's his name?

209
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,688
Keyshawn.

210
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,958
His mother took him up
Jersey way,

211
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,793
said I wasn't fit
to be with the boy.

212
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,694
I ain't disagree.

213
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,363
Well, at least
you got your health.

214
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,733
Ha ha.

215
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,735
Here's to health.

216
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,439
I got the bug.

217
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,509
Had it since '94.

218
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:53,180
Gave that shit
to my ol' lady.

219
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,382
Worried about passing it on
to my baby girl.

220
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,719
Naw, I was spared
that at least.

221
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,456
Damn, how you carry it?

222
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,459
You ask her
forgiveness?

223
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,128
'Course.

224
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,462
What she say?

225
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,932
What she needed to say.

226
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,168
Look, forgiveness
from other folks is good,

227
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,471
but ain't nothin' but words
comin' at you from outside.

228
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,473
You want
to kick this shit,

229
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,509
you got to forgive
your own self.

230
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,415
Love yourself some,
brother.

231
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,853
And then drag your sorry ass
to some meetings.

232
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,688
- Meetings?
- What the fuck
do you wanna hear?

233
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,125
That you strong enough
to do this by yourself?

234
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,526
Gettin' clean's
the easy part.

235
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,463
Now comes life.

236
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,768
McNulty:
It's this one here
with the orange cord

237
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,571
coming out of the back.
They're pirating juice
from the other house.

238
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,774
You fucking
gotta be kidding me.
Now I'm policing for BG&E?

239
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,810
They're not
there yet.

240
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,211
But when this kid
here posts,

241
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,779
snatch him up.

242
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,748
Park our asses
outside this shit hole

243
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,716
and wait for some little
project yo to raise up?

244
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,019
Mrs. McNulty
raised no fools.

245
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,488
Four Faidley's crabcakes
in the bag,

246
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,858
24 Dutch beers
in the box.

247
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,626
- Faidley's, huh?
- You're alright, McNulty.

248
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,363
I don't care
what all them other fucks
downtown say about you.

249
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,833
11-35,
what's up?

250
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,502
Greggs:
Our friend wants a meet.
Same spot.

251
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,171
Copy that, 15 minutes.

252
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,538
What's the deal
with the yo boy?

253
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,507
What he do?

254
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,776
He stumbled
into my world.

255
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:33,213
* If you leave,
I'll go crazy *

256
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:37,517
* If you forget me,
I'll go crazy *

257
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,553
* 'Cause I love you

258
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,096
* You gotta live
for yourself *

259
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,131
* For yourself
and nobody else *

260
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,768
* You gotta live for yourself,
for yourself and nobody else *

261
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,906
* If you leave,
I'll go crazy... *

262
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,074
Five minutes, c'mon.

263
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,475
- I have to go.
- Shardene.

264
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,044
I said,
I have to go.

265
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,513
- I can't have five minutes?!
- No, not right now.

266
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,052
Fuck!

267
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,989
* You gotta live
for yourself *

268
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,024
* For yourself
and nobody else... *

269
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,192
How close
did you get?

270
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,961
Y'all be chalkin'
that nigga

271
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,230
if Wee-Bey ain't pop up
at the last second like.

272
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,132
Remember when
we last talked?

273
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,867
You were gonna lay back,
let us work our case.

274
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,736
I said I'd do
what I can.

275
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,139
Still, I thought
I might let y'all know

276
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,873
Avon's people
got in contact,

277
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,308
talkin' about they want
to end the beef.

278
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,545
They offered me
some kind of amnesty.

279
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,746
Amnesty?

280
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,915
Look, I chill out
on the manhunt

281
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,985
and stop hittin' them
in the head for they product.

282
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,519
They gonna
call off the bounty.

283
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,155
Take the truce, Omar.

284
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:52,092
I might, if they ain't
tryin' to play me.

285
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,094
They said they want
to parley on it.

286
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,562
- Parley?
- Look, I don't know, man,

287
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,299
but right now I need
some assistance from y'all.

288
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,314
Yo, son, I go to the ER
and word get back to Avon,

289
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,882
you know he gonna
have his henchmen

290
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,985
waitin' in
the parking lot for me.

291
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,524
Look, I know y'all friendly
with a couple of doctors, right?

292
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,259
Right?

293
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,047
He says
he can buy weight.

294
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,382
Says he runs with
some decent-size locals.

295
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,750
Like who?

296
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,719
Avon something...

297
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,354
Barksdale.

298
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,089
Avon Barksdale.

299
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,557
Run it through
the Dex and HIDTA,

300
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,160
see what comes back.

301
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,232
All right,
I'm gonna check around,

302
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,500
see if anybody's working
these names you're giving us.

303
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,237
And if you full of shit, pal,
I'm gonna know it quick.

304
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,305
But, what happens to me
while you checkin'?

305
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,806
Eager Street.

306
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,076
City jail,
motherfucker.

307
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,147
Philip came home
last week.

308
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,515
I ain't seen him
since Afram. Uh-huh.

309
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,984
Yep.

310
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,355
I can't believe it.

311
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,500
( belches )

312
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,078
Damn, Carv,
you's triflin'.

313
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,579
Yeah, I admit it,
I'm disgusting.

314
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,815
Cheese Puffs
and fuckin' Ring-Dings?

315
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,417
Yeah.

316
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,543
( phone ringing )

317
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,812
Yeah.

318
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,315
The big fuck
from the high-rise,
what's his name?

319
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,518
- Little Man.
- Yeah, him.

320
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,386
All right.

321
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,329
( phone ringing )

322
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,330
Yo.

323
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,265
Be ready,
we're on it.

324
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,406
Look at this
pretty motherfucker.

325
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,317
Too fucked up
to drive home, McNulty?

326
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,463
Hey, Bunk.

327
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,670
Kid gave us
a murder.

328
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,838
More than that,
he's put in Stringer Bell.

329
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,507
Oh, yeah?

330
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,777
Picks out Wee-Bey, Bird
and Stinkum from photo arrays.

331
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,078
Puts them all up
at the Greek's

332
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,980
the night they grab up
Omar's boy Brandon.

333
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,349
Puts Bell
in the truck, too.

334
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,219
Says Stringer told him
to point out the stickup boy.

335
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,888
Geez, what do you
have over him?

336
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,356
Not a fucking thing.

337
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,025
Kid was ready,
barely had to push him.

338
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,760
Whose case?

339
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,729
Norris's.

340
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,898
How old?

341
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,366
16.

342
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,135
Lives in a shit-hole vacant
over on Argyle.

343
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,805
When I grab him up,
I swear he's halfway
into a nod.

344
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,508
- Using?
- Hmm.

345
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,743
When they killed
the stickup boy,

346
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,246
the motherfuckers dumped
the body in the alley
right behind where this kid

347
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,515
and all the other
low-rise hoppers
lay their heads.

348
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,317
Can you imagine?

349
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,320
All he can think about.

350
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,022
You tell him he's gonna
have to testify?

351
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,624
Not yet,
we'll get there.

352
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,427
Problem is, what do
I do with him now?

353
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,936
( camera clicking )

354
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,743
( phone ringing )

355
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,777
Yep.

356
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,413
Big boy picking up.

357
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,848
Okay.

358
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,352
You holler at me, right?

359
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,354
Where you at, man,
we all the way down.

360
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,589
First thing tomorrow, man.

361
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,262
- ( phone ringing )
- Yeah?

362
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,597
- It's him, stay on it.
- All right.

363
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,591
I didn't do nothing, man.
Get me outta here.

364
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,398
Man on radio:
The two-two grounded
slowly towards third

365
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:35,402
and gets foul
at the last moment.

366
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:39,406
Suzuki's at the plate,
here's the pitch.

367
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:44,311
Line drive, up the middle,
a base hit for Suzuki.

368
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,415
Suzuki's very patient
at the plate.

369
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,419
Yeah, man, it's me.
Guess who's up in here.

370
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,589
Pimpin' ass Orlando,
from the club.

371
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,157
Yeah.

372
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,393
Courtside.

373
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,311
( beeping )

374
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,255
Daniels:
So how long
you been slingin'?

375
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,858
Since I was,
maybe, 12.

376
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,094
And how long were you
with Barksdale's crew
in the low-rises?

377
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:39,031
With D'Angelo?
Not long.

378
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,134
He came down from the towers
at the beginning of the summer.

379
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,503
Before that I worked
for Ronnie Mo.

380
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,105
D'Angelo ever talk
to you about

381
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,374
what happened in
the 221 building?

382
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,610
With Pooh getting shot?

383
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,278
How about anything else
like that?

384
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,080
Like what?

385
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,948
Killings, murders.

386
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,452
He say anything about
a girl getting shot

387
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,987
in an apartment up
on the eastside?

388
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,823
He--

389
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,895
naw, Dee,
he was good to me.

390
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,830
He all right.

391
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,401
But D'Angelo, he was
who you called that night

392
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,235
when you saw the stickup boy
at the Greek's, right?

393
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,237
Yeah, but he didn't
go up there.

394
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,639
It was mostly
those tower boys.

395
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,241
And Stringer.

396
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,776
You said Stringer
was in the truck.

397
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:24,877
He called you over,

398
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,946
asked you to point out
the stickup boy.

399
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,055
All of it corroborated
by the beeper logs

400
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,224
and the pen registers
from the project pay phones.

401
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,260
Stinkum's dead.
We've already got Bird
for the Gant killing.

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,295
- This ties them all in.
- D'Angelo, too.

403
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,065
Maybe, but since he didn't
show at the Greeks,

404
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,201
he takes the stand
and tells the jury he didn't
see the murder coming.

405
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,670
Well, it's enough
to charge him, anyway.

406
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,304
- Parents?
- Alcoholic mother.

407
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,940
In the wind,
no fixed address.

408
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,042
Says he's got a grandmother
down on the eastern shore,

409
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,411
- but he hasn't
seen her in years.
- How about a hotel room?

410
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,179
On whose dime?

411
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,382
No way the deputy
approves the manpower
to stash a 16-year-old,

412
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,051
much less
the room service.

413
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,019
McNulty, line two.

414
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,763
How about you run this
up to front office?

415
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,631
See if the state's attorney
will kick in.

416
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,801
He's a kid, Cedric.

417
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,269
Even if
we clear the money,

418
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,771
do you really want
to put a juvenile

419
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,206
in a hotel for six months
waiting on a trial date?

420
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:31,177
I think you all need
to get with grandma
down on the shore.

421
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,748
Now?
She's doing this
right now?

422
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,418
They don't have to
set a hearing date
or something like that?

423
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,257
Christ, yeah, okay.

424
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,126
Yeah.

425
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,664
I fucking need
a fucking lawyer.

426
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,236
What?

427
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:01,007
Still, you can see that
they got the security bars.

428
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,108
And look there.
Cameras...

429
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,579
that see over the yard
out to the street.

430
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,881
And I checked
with Verizon,

431
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,650
there's no phone service
at that address.

432
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,585
Well, that's a telltale
right there.

433
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,021
So what?
We try to write a warrant
for this place, right?

434
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:16,656
Right?

435
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,434
What are you seeing?

436
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,436
No pattern, really.

437
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:32,438
Except this cluster
of old storefronts

438
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,774
and warehouses on
the westside of downtown.

439
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:38,210
Around Paca, Eutaw,
Howard Street, mostly.

440
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,213
- Storefronts?
- Vacants, usually.

441
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,949
Three different
holding companies.

442
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,952
Detective Prezbylewski.

443
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,419
What?

444
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,256
You have a gift
for the paper trail.

445
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,128
Tomorrow calls for
some street work, though.
Are you street ready?

446
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:01,400
Um, you know the lieutenant
has me in-office.

447
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,969
I don't have my gun
until the grand jury.

448
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,404
- You won't need one.
- On the street?

449
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,273
- No gun?
- No gun.

450
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,275
Not for this.

451
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,045
Furthermore, Mr. McNulty,
having utilized his sons

452
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,050
in an act of police work,
involving a criminal suspect,

453
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,954
actually lost track of them
in a crowded municipal market.

454
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,724
This is simply unacceptable,
Your Honor.

455
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:27,694
Be that as it may,
an emergency ex parte order

456
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:29,796
is an extraordinary
request, Mr. Palmer.

457
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,964
You actually want me
to limit visitations

458
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,133
to afternoons only
and you want

459
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,869
Mrs. McNulty present
at all visitations?
Come on.

460
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,672
Palmer: It is not
a single lapse, Judge.

461
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,874
Mr. McNulty
has time and again

462
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,876
failed to properly care
for the children

463
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,645
when they're
in his custody.

464
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,047
I have a list of recent
events, Your Honor,

465
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,916
that justify an order.

466
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:53,119
Ms. Pearlman
do you have a response
you'd like to offer up here?

467
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,455
Nope.

468
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,057
Nothing?

469
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,361
If this were
possession with intent,

470
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,896
I'd be a prosecutor
with a plan.

471
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,231
But a domestic
order hearing?

472
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,868
Your Honor,
I'm officially clueless.

473
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,703
In fact, as an employee
of the state,

474
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,639
I should not
actually be here.

475
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,241
All right,
listen up, people.

476
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,878
Before you have
me make a ruling
on an emergency petition,

477
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,447
everybody here just needs
to take a deep breath, huh?

478
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,249
Literally, come on.
( breathing deeply )

479
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,153
Now, then,
is Mr. McNulty capable

480
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,255
of having a civil conversation
with Mrs. McNulty?

481
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,457
Yes, Your Honor.

482
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,092
And is Mrs. McNulty
equally capable

483
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,261
of having a conversation
with Mr. McNulty?

484
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,329
Yes.

485
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,198
Good, then
I'm going to lunch.

486
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,734
And let's see when I return
if we can't busy this court

487
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,469
with something just
a little more engaging

488
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,004
than the problems
of the McNultys.

489
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,040
Look, the charge
is on me.

490
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,508
I understand that,
I'll carry that.

491
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,910
But the least
our people can do

492
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,479
is throw down a little
something to pay the bondsman.

493
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,281
That's the deed
of transfer for the club.

494
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,284
And the other thing
is a license transfer
application

495
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:02,054
for the liquor board.
They're both backdated
and notarized for last week.

496
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,223
What?

497
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,059
A front
has to be clean.

498
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,661
And right now,
you ain't that.

499
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,664
Sign.

500
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,935
I want my bail paid.

501
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,670
You send me a bondsman,
I'll sign.

502
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,440
Is that what you
want me to tell him?

503
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,309
That I asked you to sign
and you wouldn't?

504
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,412
Hmm?

505
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,695
You wanted to be
in the game, right?

506
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,965
Now you're
in the game.

507
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,236
Unbelievable,
you show up with her ?

508
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,872
Elena, you went for
an emergency ex parte.

509
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,473
I grabbed whatever lawyer
was standing around.

510
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,208
Oh, she was standing?

511
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,211
Hey, ask her if she wants
the pictures back.

512
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,380
Let's see, I've got her
at the restaurant

513
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,982
with you
pulling out her chair.

514
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:05,017
I've got her at
the motel parking lot

515
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,819
with you opening
the car door for her

516
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,687
because you're such
a fucking gentleman now.

517
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,222
Yeah, well, I can't
believe you hired Buckman.

518
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,992
Son of a bitch never made
a case that counted.

519
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,194
Yeah, well he caught
your cheating ass.

520
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,566
Elena,
why are we here?

521
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,234
Because you can't--

522
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,171
you can't have
Sean and Michael
around criminals.

523
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,807
You can't lose them
in a Baltimore market.

524
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,942
- That's why.
- It wasn't a criminal.

525
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,445
I know the guy.

526
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,247
It was a game
we were playing.

527
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,249
It was daylight
on a crowded street.

528
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,151
They could've been
following Al Capone.

529
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,252
It would've been fine.

530
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,989
Look, Elena,
these are my sons.
I love them.

531
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,024
Do you hear?
I love them.

532
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,458
I'm not gonna
let them get hurt.

533
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,498
I love you, too.

534
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,168
I still do.

535
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,476
Does she know
about the detective
and the pictures?

536
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,081
No, why would
I tell her about that?

537
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,482
And are the two
of you still...

538
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,485
No.

539
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,459
Yes.

540
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,062
A little.

541
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,474
Come on, let's make nice
for the judge.

542
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,145
Okay.

543
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,485
Man on TV :
We know we have
a month more to go

544
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,587
and we're not
gonna let up.

545
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:52,091
We are going to raise more,
we are going to spend more,

546
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,994
and on election day,
we are going to be out there,

547
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,528
pushing the vote
in every precinct.

548
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,398
You ready?

549
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,472
Come on, we'll get
dinner first.

550
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,541
Ain't so hungry.

551
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,345
Come on.

552
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,558
How much
were you using?

553
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,865
I'm asking if you're
gonna be sick in my car.

554
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,968
A cap now and then.

555
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,204
You just snorting?

556
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,376
You'll be all right
in a day or two.

557
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,278
Come on.

558
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,356
Yo, this nigga comin'
or what, man?

559
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,691
Said he would,
if I guaranteed a parley.

560
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,627
And I'm here on it.

561
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,596
'Course, he said y'all
would be paying my fee,
rather than his ownself.

562
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,065
Your fee?

563
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,067
I'm doin' like one of them
marriage counselors.

564
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,169
Charge by the hour
to tell some fool

565
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,837
he need to bring
some flowers home.

566
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,973
Then charge another hour
tellin' the bitch

567
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,108
she ought to suck some cock
every little once and a while.

568
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,644
You know, keep a marriage
strong like that.

569
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,414
Speakin'
of cocksuckers.

570
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,518
Don't believe we met.

571
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,254
Proposition Joe.

572
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:32,324
You ever steal from me,
I kill your whole family.

573
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,928
All right. Y'all both here
on my guarantee,

574
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:38,965
so respect that shit
and say what you feel.

575
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,133
I'm up outta here.

576
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:49,541
I gotta man who say he gonna
give you your life back, yo.

577
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,344
Who, Barksdale?

578
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,780
My man say,
tell that motherfucker that

579
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,149
if he can find a way
not to dip in our pockets,

580
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,618
we're gonna call
this shit even.

581
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:03,990
Y'all aced Bailey,
and what you did to my boy?

582
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,326
So, y'all think after
what you did to Brandon,

583
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,927
we supposed to find
some even on this, huh?

584
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,397
Yo, I don't know
shit about shit, a'ight?

585
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:12,864
I'm just the messenger.

586
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,766
Whatever, man.

587
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,269
You know there's dead
on both sides, right?

588
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,771
And there's gonna be
a whole lot more

589
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,440
if this beef keep up.

590
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,874
But the truth be told,

591
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,910
there be more soldiers
in one half than the other.

592
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,979
You know what
I'm sayin'?

593
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,318
Hey, look here, son,
you tell Barksdale,

594
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,753
that he's been paid back
for what he did to my peoples.

595
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,222
But as for
his product,

596
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:39,058
well, a man's got to
earn a living, you know?

597
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:41,227
I don't know nobody
called Barksdale, B.

598
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,762
The man
I'm talking about,

599
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,531
can't have his shit
taken like that.

600
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,965
That won't do.

601
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,735
A'ight, tell him
throw me some cash then,

602
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,937
and we'll see.

603
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:53,605
'Bout five
or 10,000.

604
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,875
You know what I mean?
For my retirement, homes.

605
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,078
Five if you can
keep quiet about it.

606
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,846
Send my money
through Joe, man.

607
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:04,516
You go through Joe,
you're not gonna see
2,000 of that.

608
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,518
Why don't you tell
my man where you at--

609
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,986
Naw, naw, naw, naw.

610
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:09,821
We gonna figure something
else out, you heard?

611
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:13,125
I'll be in touch, homes.

612
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,132
How careful
is Stringer Bell?

613
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,834
"I don't know no one
named Barksdale."

614
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,336
Shit.

615
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,338
Still we got him tied
to the Brandon killing.

616
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:29,108
That can be enough
for one day's work.

617
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,519
Did what I could
for y'all.

618
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,110
You sure, right?

619
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,945
Yeah, I spent a summer here
when I was nine.

620
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,547
When was the last time
they saw you?

621
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:12,851
When I was nine.

622
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,187
( crickets chirping )

623
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,491
- What's that?
- What?

624
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,127
That noise.

625
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,295
It's crickets.

626
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:25,764
Cricket.

627
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,799
Crickets.

628
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,206
He tried to go
in my pockets again ?

629
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,442
This nigga talkin'
'bout five Gs, B.

630
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,076
Oh, shit.

631
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,578
( knocking )

632
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:44,183
Oh, what's up, baby?

633
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,651
Antwon said
to bring these up.

634
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,619
- Y'all want anything else?
- Naw, we cool.

635
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,356
I'm sayin' though,
how we supposed to pay that?

636
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,359
He talking about
goin' through Joe,
but I'm like, fuck Joe.

637
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:57,062
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Thank you, mon amie.

638
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:59,765
You look good
and your services
are appreciated.

639
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:04,336
Keep them tips.
I hope you makin'
them, baby.

640
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,906
Avon:
Make the motherfucker
come down to the towers

641
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,309
to get the rest
of his money, you know
what I'm sayin'?

642
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,345
If he stupid enough
to come down to the towers,
he gonna get got.

643
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,948
It's a wrap, pow.
How you supposed
to pay that?

644
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,318
A'ight.

645
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:26,225
Y'all think you can hang,
but, look.

646
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:33,865
No, no, no, you see,
I went to journalism school.

647
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,301
All right?
Northwestern.

648
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,269
So, y'all can't stay
with me on this.

649
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,605
Girl, you talkin' like
you some crusty old reporter.

650
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,940
Well, excuse me?

651
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,942
Bitch, you work
at a TV station.

652
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,845
It's the same thing,
all right?

653
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,880
Look, come on,
stop talkin'.

654
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,616
Here we go.

655
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,020
- Bring it.
- Come on, Kima.

656
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,988
Come on.

657
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,990
I gotta work tomorrow.

658
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,926
All: Aw!

659
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,229
Candy ass.

660
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,564
That's all
I have to say.

661
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,568
Okay, you see?

662
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,770
- I'm with you.
- All right.

663
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,740
Look at Tonya.
And she run a damn
art gallery.

664
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,578
You see, police in
this town ain't about shit.

665
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,949
- Guess not.
- Mm-hmm, thank you.

666
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,852
- Can't hold our liquor.
- Mm-mmm.

667
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,222
Can't hold a donut.

668
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,458
( laughing )

669
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,861
And if you ask me,
I guess we...

670
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,365
ain't good in bed,
neither.

671
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:41,767
Oh, don't go there,
Officer.

672
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,602
Don't go there.

673
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,873
Kima, how did you know
you wanted to be a cop?

674
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,609
I mean, how did
you choose that?

675
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:56,415
When you were little, did you
think about it at all, or...

676
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:01,152
Come on, Kima.

677
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,322
I remember when I was
in the northeast,

678
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,624
still field-training
as a cadet.

679
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,627
I didn't know if I was gonna
stick with it or not.

680
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,062
And then we got
this one call.

681
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,966
We chased this purse-snatch
up into these apartments.

682
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,336
I got separated
from my FTO

683
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:20,105
and shit, I ain't
even no police yet.

684
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,974
You know,
I'm just a trainee.

685
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,876
And I'm alone.

686
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,046
Anyway, I mean,

687
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,615
I don't know how,
but I find the guy.

688
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,385
So I catch him
and I hold on to him

689
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:36,121
and I manage
to get to my radio.

690
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,357
And we in the middle
of this parking lot,

691
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,191
and we're rolling
around and shit

692
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:44,262
and this motherfucker's
steady kicking my ass
trying to get away.

693
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,399
And I look over and I see
these black patents,

694
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,135
and these uniform
blue pants.

695
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:54,272
I look up
and it's Charlie Smoot.

696
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,144
Charlie fucking Smoot.
You know, this guy's a legend.

697
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:00,646
He looks down at me
and he smiles,

698
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,849
you know
real quiet-like.

699
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,884
And he drops his cuffs.

700
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,953
He says,
"Here ya go, rook."

701
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:12,157
That's all he says.

702
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,626
"Here ya go, rook."

703
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:18,930
And then he dropped
the bracelets and walked away.

704
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,070
I mean, I know
you don't like it.

705
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:30,376
But, shit,
I was proud.

706
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,485
Ooh.

707
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,489
Goddamn.

708
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,370
Lester says we ain't gonna
write a warrant on this place.

709
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,372
How do we not
with all this PC?

710
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,775
Greggs:
We're on the main stash,
right?

711
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,376
Why would
we kick the door in

712
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,446
when all we have to do
is park a van down the street

713
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:43,782
and follow the entire
westside drug supply in
and out of the place?

714
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,017
We're gonna start picking up
pieces of Barksdale's world

715
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,853
we never even
knew about.

716
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,821
Been hell looking
for you people.

717
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,389
What the hell's the name
of this unit anyway?

718
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,126
- What up, Wig?
- Aw, shit, Kima in the house.

719
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,328
- What up, Wig?
- What's up, girl?

720
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,397
State police, CID
out of Pikesville.

721
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,767
Name of Troy Wiggins.

722
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,334
But pay no attention
to the man,

723
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,070
'cause he about
90-95% pure bullshit.

724
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,340
Kima, she just
talk like that

725
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,942
'cause I had her
when she was good.

726
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,278
Shit, you
the ugly-ass motherfucker

727
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,080
- turned me the other way.
- Shit, a'ight.

728
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,650
Here's the thing,
boys and girls.

729
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,219
I'm doin' a reverse buy
down in Arundel, right?

730
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:25,223
And I get this
westside asshole nibbling
on four ounces, right?

731
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:27,893
- A whole four ounces?
- I know, he ain't much, but...

732
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,228
I get him in the boat
and he starts floppin' around

733
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:33,799
sayin' he can buy weight
from some motherfucker
name of Barksdale.

734
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,701
I never heard
of no Barksdale.

735
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,435
But I put
the name into Dex,

736
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,738
and the computer
has Avon Barksdale entered

737
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,307
as an active
Baltimore City target.

738
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,442
So, I go down to city
narcotics and Dawson,

739
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,444
he sends me down here
to see y'all.

740
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,079
So, what's the name
of your fish?

741
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,449
Wendell O, as in,

742
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,986
Oh-Shit-I-Tried-To-Buy
From-A-State-Police Blocker.

743
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,388
That wouldn't be
Wendell Orlando Blocker
would it?

744
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,225
Yeah.
You on it.

745
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,195
Orlando.

746
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,997
They keep that
back room locked.

747
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,700
And even if I do get
back there on an errand,

748
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,436
then they
kinda shut down.
They get real quiet.

749
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,939
You said you heard
one say something

750
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,441
about making someone
come into the towers.

751
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:20,378
- Yeah.
- Which one was talking?

752
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,814
He was tall,
I think.

753
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,483
All right,
but who else was there?

754
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:31,089
I don't really see that well
without my glasses.

755
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,891
Where are
your glasses?

756
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,699
You can't see faces
without those?

757
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,237
You don't wear those
while you're working,
do you, darlin'?

758
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,239
Would you?

759
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,976
I gotta live off
drinks and tips.

760
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:54,980
- No way!
- Why not?

761
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,182
Because a player
wouldn't be the name
on the liquor license.

762
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,651
And a player would
have a connect for
Barksdale's coke.

763
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,219
He wouldn't walk
into state troopers.

764
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,655
He caught a charge and now
he's talking out his ass.

765
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,423
I mean, face it.
You're never gonna
get Avon or Stringer

766
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,058
in the same room
as the dope.

767
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:08,794
We'll make this case
on their voices alone.

768
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,796
So, maybe he can't
buy from Barksdale.

769
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,931
Maybe he can only buy
from Savino or Wee-Bey.

770
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,432
Greggs:
Well, fuck him, then.

771
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,434
We already got Wee-Bey
tied to a murder

772
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,570
and Savino's the runt
of the litter.

773
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,111
We can take what Orlando
gives us about the club.

774
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,046
The money laundering,
maybe, or the girls.

775
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,949
For that kind
of cooperation,

776
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,151
I'll drop a few years
and call it fair.

777
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,820
( knocking )

778
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,988
- Daniels in here?
- Yeah.

779
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,424
Call from Deputy
Commissioner for you.

780
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,193
You want it in here?

781
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,262
No.

782
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:45,697
He doesn't miss much.

783
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:49,935
( pager beeping )

784
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,745
I need
some help here.

785
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,748
Come on, Bubs
You got me comin'
across town

786
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:04,449
in the middle
of a fucked-up workday

787
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,317
just so you can hold 10?
That shit ain't right.

788
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,019
Hold on,
I don't need 10.

789
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,855
Okay, I don't know.

790
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,123
I need a place
of my own.

791
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:16,361
All right, some bed,
some sheets, some clothes.

792
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,463
I definitely need
some new clothes.

793
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:21,599
How long you been clean?

794
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,070
Three days.

795
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,707
You serious about it?

796
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,043
Who knows?

797
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:37,749
What the fuck am I gonna do
with a clean informant?

798
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,384
Did you think
about that?

799
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,726
A'ight,
I'm on it with you.

800
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

801
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,300
Yo, what the fuck,
gimme some love.

802
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:57,736
Okay, I mean,
I think I can get,

803
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,772
you know, a mattress,
my own place,

804
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:03,141
everything for like
a couple hundred dollars.

805
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,210
A'ight.

806
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,545
We'll talk.

807
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,282
I gotta be somewhere tonight,
so hit me on my page tomorrow.

808
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,053
Tomorrow?

809
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,055
I got you.

810
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,661
The cooperator says
he can buy weight.

811
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,330
Daniels:
Not from Barksdale
or Bell.

812
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,664
How can you be sure?

813
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,266
How much dope or coke

814
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,936
do you think
gets Avon Barksdale
into the room?

815
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:31,937
A kilo?

816
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,205
Two kilos,
20 kilos?

817
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:37,675
We are not going to buy
our way up the ladder here.

818
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,477
These people
do not touch the drugs.

819
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:41,212
They don't go near
the drugs.

820
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,915
The wire is what
gives us Barksdale.

821
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,951
It gives us
the whole crew.

822
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:49,921
Day by day,
piece by piece.

823
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:56,294
Buy-bust, Lieutenant.

824
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:59,497
It's what I asked
you for months ago.

825
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:01,933
It's what we do
successfully

826
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:05,236
time and again
to make these cases.

827
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,046
Why New York?

828
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,448
Must be somethin'
happenin' out there, man.

829
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,084
Too big a town,
you know what I mean?

830
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:21,452
You don't believe
in the truce?

831
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,254
That's why I asked
for that money.

832
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:26,057
If he had said,
"We ain't paying you.
Just be happy to live,"

833
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:27,959
I'd have been like,
a'ight they keepin' it real.

834
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,460
But he say, c'mon down
for $5,000,

835
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,030
I'm, like, man, please.

836
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,100
Hey, look here, homes,
I ain't asked for much,

837
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,503
but, um, I'm a little light
on traveling money.

838
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:41,172
I'm sayin' I could go around
the block and get myself paid,

839
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,074
but I'm thinkin'...

840
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,312
You keep in touch
with my pager.

841
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,747
We're gonna need you
for the Gant trial.

842
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,750
Go easy, Omar.

843
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:58,990
Stay free!

844
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:05,296
Man on tape:
You be pickin' me up outside
the Cut-Rate on Lex and Fulton.

845
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,999
I'll be up there
after 10:00, right?

846
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,467
Man 2:
That'll work.

847
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,502
Listen up, people.

848
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,905
We've got 30,000
in buy money

849
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,506
courtesy of our friends
over at DEA,

850
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,308
but the thing is,

851
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,110
they can't have that
money walkin' on them.

852
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,745
Definitely not.

853
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:23,882
So Kima will be
in the car for the buy,
fronting as our CI's girl.

854
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:25,516
Lookin' the part, too.

855
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,953
( laughs )

856
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:29,320
Now, where's your
weapon gonna be?

857
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,656
He might pat me,
so it has to stash
in the car.

858
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:34,025
I figure when Savino
gets in the car
at the Cut-Rate,

859
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,493
I'll be going in back.

860
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:37,328
It'll be up under
the rear seat.

861
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:41,499
And we probably
can't be close enough
for an eyeball on this,

862
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,268
but the car
will be a live wire

863
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,503
and Kima will be throwin' us
20s whenever she can.

864
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,038
Rhonda?

865
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,074
I only want to remind
Mr. Blocker here

866
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,110
that his plea agreement
is contingent on cooperation.

867
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,346
A buy-bust on Savino Bratton
is less cooperative

868
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,216
than a buy-bust from someone
higher up on the food chain.

869
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,086
If you can get Savino
talking about Avon or Stringer,

870
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:03,288
that's better for us
and better for you.

871
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:06,157
They already know
that he got jacked
on a reverse buy, right?

872
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,293
Why wouldn't they assume
he's snitchin'?

873
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,795
I need money
for a lawyer, right?

874
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:12,463
That's the story.

875
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,299
He got popped
and now he needs

876
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,368
to get right back into it
to pay the bondsman
and the lawyer.

877
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:19,504
All right.

878
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,239
Let's make this work.

879
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:25,010
Careful.

880
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,511
That's my career
you're holding there.

881
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,148
- You got a unit?
- Parked in the mezzanine.

882
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,550
- Gimme the keys, man.
- Naw, I'm driving,
motherfucker.

883
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,453
Come on, man.

884
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,892
Death row here.

885
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,362
Ain't up.

886
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,465
Death row.

887
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,475
( car radio playing )

888
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:51,997
That's my girl.
Half the money hers.

889
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,601
( turns up radio )

890
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,311
Baby, since we goin'
down North Avenue,

891
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:09,314
stop by the carry-out
so I can pick me up
some cigarettes.

892
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:11,216
They're goin' up North,
stay loose.

893
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,387
( turns up radio )

894
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,958
- Shit.
- It's too loud.

895
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,378
Does any unit
have the eyeball?

896
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:43,948
Negative, 11-35.

897
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:47,018
C'mon, Greggs, tell us
where the fuck you are.

898
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,754
Pull in there.

899
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:51,322
What?

900
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,291
Pull in there.

901
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,043
( music stops )

902
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,611
( baby crying )

903
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:17,282
Don't fuck
with this count.

904
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:21,552
I'll be right back
with your shit.

905
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,031
Where are we?

906
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:37,335
That sign said Longwood,
but I could swear
this was Warwick.

907
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:40,505
Hoppers be turning
the sign poles
to fuck with y'all.

908
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:45,476
I make it we're on
the north side of Warwick,

909
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,011
in an alley.

910
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:49,080
I don't know, shit,

911
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,616
half of block west
of Longwood, maybe?

912
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,218
I hope y'all
copy that.

913
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:55,420
Yeah, that puts us
about eight blocks away.

914
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,422
I'm pushing in
a little closer.

915
00:50:57,522 --> 00:51:00,191
All units be advised.
Warwick near Longwood

916
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,760
in the northside alley
or near that 20.

917
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,962
Greggs:
This got the right
feel for you?

918
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,498
- ( starts engine )
- You creepin' closer?

919
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:22,012
He better not be long,
'cause, see, I don't know
where the stash is,

920
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:24,549
and if they draggin'
us all over this part
of town, you know--

921
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,851
What's that?

922
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:29,187
- What?
- Something ain't right.

923
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:31,556
- What?
- Shit ain't right.

924
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:36,060
You snitchin'
motherfucker.

925
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:37,595
- ( gunshots )
- Signal 13, signal 13!

926
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:41,966
- Gunshots, gunshots.
- Shit.

927
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:44,669
- McNulty: 11-35.

929
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:50,975
Greggs:
Two males, black hoodie,
both of 'em. One is--

930
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:53,110
- ( gunshots )
- Signal 13.

931
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:54,879
Warwick, near Longwood
in the alleys.

932
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,014
Check the alleys!

934
00:51:58,683 --> 00:52:00,385

- Foxtrot.

944
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:25,676
11-35 to KGA.
We can't find
the officer down.

945
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:28,646
We need Foxtrot

Lincoln Town Car

946
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,616

parked in those alleys.
