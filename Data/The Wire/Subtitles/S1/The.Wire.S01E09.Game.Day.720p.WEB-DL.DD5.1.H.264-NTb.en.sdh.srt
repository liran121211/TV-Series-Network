These shits right here is
yellow tops and they right.

173
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:39,526
<i>So, remember where y'all</i>
<i>caught this blast</i>

174
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,145
<i>and tell your</i>
<i>fiend-ass friends.</i>

175
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,646
<i>Line the fuck up.</i>

176
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,015
Back up, back up.

177
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:48,067
Get to the end
of the line.
What the fuck?

178
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,953
Line the fuck up.

179
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,287
Get the fuck
outta here.

180
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,541
- Damn, fuck y'all.
- There you go.

181
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,459
Hurry up, hurry up.

182
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,961
They're over here.

183
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,662
I got one, girl,
over here.

184
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:01,498
I got one.
I got one.

185
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,500
You get one?

186
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:07,170
Hold up, hold up.

187
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,038
Hey, hey,
you catch one?

188
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:11,207
'Cause, you know,
I got three if you need.

189
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:13,009
You was
at the meeting

190
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,512
- over at Samuel Morse.
- Mr. One Day man.

191
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:18,481
- It wasn't even that.
- Stood up though.

192
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,150
So, why you down
at the tester line
if you ain't chasin'?

193
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,986
Tryin' to get my little
nephew off the corner.

194
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,855
<i>His mama sent him up</i>
<i>to Cumberland, you know?</i>

195
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,158
Try to keep him clean
at my grandma's.

196
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,394
He ain't anywhere
near his bottom.

197
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:34,030
Gotta see that bottom
comin' up at him.

198
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:36,916
<i>Hard, too,</i>
<i>'cause he's young, 24.</i>

199
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:40,503
<i>Most people don't get tired</i>
<i>'til they're 35, 40.</i>

200
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,922
How old are you?

201
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,959
Young at heart.

202
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,211
Walon, man.

203
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,213
Bubs.

204
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:00,356
Give 'em a long rope.

205
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,091
<i>The farther away from</i>
<i>the projects you pop him,</i>

206
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,560
<i>the less risk</i>
<i>to the wire.</i>

207
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:06,396
- Herc:<i> Hell with the wire.</i>
- Excuse me?

208
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:09,983
<i>Gotcha, McNulty.</i>
<i>You're too easy.</i>

209
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,242
Freamon:
<i>We can come</i>
<i>at this a few ways.</i>

210
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:22,128
First thing is
we need the names
of all front companies,

211
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,048
limited partnerships,
LLCs, and all that mess

212
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,249
LLCs?

213
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,051
Limited liability
corporations.

214
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,153
Start with the nightclub
which Barksdale owns.

215
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,504
Look up Orlando's.

216
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,172
By address,
you match it

217
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,058
and you see
it's owned by who?

218
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,594
It's on Baltimore Street,
right?

219
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:47,236
Got it.
D&B Enterprises.

220
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,138
Hand that over to Prez,
who's gonna get off his ass

221
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:52,358
and walk on over
to the state office buildings
on Preston Street.

222
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,943
Preston Street?

223
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:55,762
- Corporate charter office.
- Corporate who?

224
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,331
They have the paperwork
on every corporation

225
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,334
<i>and LLC licensed to do</i>
<i>business in the state.</i>

226
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,037
<i>You look up D&B Enterprises</i>
<i>on the computer.</i>

227
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,089
<i>You're gonna get a little</i>
<i>reel of microfilm.</i>

228
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,925
<i>Pull the corporate charter</i>
<i>papers that way.</i>

229
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,961
<i>Write down</i>
<i>every name you see,</i>

230
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,163
<i>corporate officers,</i>
<i>shareholders,</i>

231
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,765
<i>or more importantly,</i>

232
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,235
<i>the resident agent</i>
<i>on the filing who is</i>
<i>usually a lawyer.</i>

233
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,605
<i>While they use</i>
<i>front names, you know,</i>
<i>as corporate officers,</i>

234
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,025
<i>they'll usually use</i>
<i>the same lawyer to do</i>
<i>the charter filing.</i>

235
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,277
<i>Find that agent's name,</i>
<i>run it through the computer,</i>

236
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,364
<i>find out what</i>
<i>other corporations</i>
<i>he's done the filing for,</i>

237
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,850
<i>and that way we find</i>
<i>other front companies.</i>

238
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,019
While he's doing that,
what do I do?

239
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:38,137
You're gonna keep your head
in this here assessment book.

240
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,140
Look up any properties that
you can connect to Barksdale.

241
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,876
How do you know it connects
to Barksdale, right?

242
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,378
<i>For one thing,</i>

243
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,046
<i>you work off of</i>
<i>what Prez gets you</i>

244
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,581
<i>from the corporate</i>
<i>charter documents.</i>

245
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,133
<i>Whatever companies</i>
<i>he links to Barksdale</i>

246
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,634
<i>or people connected</i>
<i>to Barksdale,</i>

247
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,137
<i>you look for those companies</i>
<i>in the city land records.</i>

248
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,339
- Huh?
- For example,

249
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,225
McNulty said that
he heard that Barksdale

250
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,211
owned an apartment building
up on Druid Park Lake.

251
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,647
<i>You look up all the blocks</i>
<i>on Reservoir Hill.</i>

252
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,383
<i>See if there's anything</i>
<i>owned by D&B Enterprises</i>

253
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:11,053
<i>or any other company</i>
<i>that Prez finds through</i>
<i>corporate charter</i>

254
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,672
<i>or anything similar.</i>

255
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:14,240
<i>If you find something</i>
<i>that fits,</i>

256
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,225
<i>you write down</i>
<i>the folio number</i>

257
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:18,661
<i>so that you can look it up</i>
<i>later at the courthouse.</i>

258
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,096
<i>You don't</i>
<i>find anything,</i>

259
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:22,615
<i>just take the names of</i>
<i>all the corporate listings</i>

260
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,600
<i>for the multi-units</i>
<i>near the lake.</i>

261
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:26,619
<i>You call that list</i>
<i>over to Prez,</i>

262
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:28,621
<i>who pulls</i>
<i>the charter papers</i>

263
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:30,373
<i>and he'll look</i>
<i>for connections.</i>

264
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,809
This is like
a scavenger hunt.

265
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,577
Yeah, but what if
Barksdale is careful?

266
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,679
I mean, what if we can't
find his name on anything?

267
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,347
In this country,

268
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,718
somebody's name has got
to be on a piece of paper.

269
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,886
A cousin, a girlfriend,
a grandmother,

270
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,104
a lieutenant
he can trust,

271
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,973
somebody's name is
on a piece of paper.

272
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:50,926
And here's the rub,
you follow drugs,

273
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:54,230
you get drug addicts
and drug dealers.

274
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,783
But you start
to follow the money,

275
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,102
and you don't know where
the fuck it's gonna take you.

276
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,821
While we're running
around on this,

277
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:04,457
what are you gonna do?

278
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,796
- You need something?
- Yeah.

279
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,547
Let me get the...

280
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,667
campaign financial reports
for the western districts,

281
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,969
and actually,
any citywide race.

282
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,839
You want quarterly reports
or individual donor lists?

283
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:21,174
Both, please.

284
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:23,476
It'll be a couple
hundred pages.

285
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,813
Really?
I'll take all of it.

286
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,099
(siren blares)

287
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:34,771
What the fuck, man?

288
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,660
Driver,
with your right hand,

289
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,161
reach through the window
and open the door.

290
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:45,815
- Herc:<i> C'mon, hurry up, man.</i>
- Step out of the car.

291
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:48,484
Drop the cane.
Toss the cane.

292
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,820
Come around
to the back.

293
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,539
<i>All right.</i>

294
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:55,991
Turn around.

295
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,661
Sir, is there
anything in the vehicle
we should know about?

296
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,179
Nope.

297
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,132
No guns, no drugs?

298
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,438
We ain't got shit.

299
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:19,348
This money right here,

300
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,484
I didn't just pull this
out of your truck?

301
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,619
What money?

302
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:27,540
Damn, we'll be counting
this limp dick cash all day.

303
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,125
Where you guys
going with all this?

304
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,211
Like the man said,
it ain't ours.

305
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,996
It ain't yours, huh?

306
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:36,249
So, you don't mind if we just
take it off your hands?

307
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,750
Do what you feel.

308
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:39,335
You pretending to take
money up out this truck

309
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,887
I didn't even know
was there.

310
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,471
You know, I know
how that shit is.

311
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,808
The other day,
I took up the sofa
cushions off my couch.

312
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,678
Found a buck 40
I didn't even
know was there.

313
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,267
Y'all ain't
got no charge, right?

314
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,489
No, fucko, we do not
have a charge.

315
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,391
We just
got your money.

316
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,076
You want it back,
you can explain it

317
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,078
to the state's attorney
where you got it.

318
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,753

your day now, you hear?

00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:49,108
this ain't shit.

340
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:53,362
I'm not high neither.

341
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,083
It's fuckin'
Arm & Hammer.

342
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,453
<i>We just been</i>
<i>firin' baking soda.</i>

343
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:03,255
- Fuck.
-<i> It's all right, man.</i>

344
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,591
<i>I'll just come up</i>
<i>with another plan.</i>

345
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,043
-<i> I did it once, right?</i>
- Just...

346
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,234
Fuck me.

347
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,216
Carv. You go
to a restaurant

348
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,803
and say the waitress
gives you good,
decent service.

349
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,388
How much do you tip?

350
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,757
How much do I tip?

351
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,628
For good service.

352
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:01,497
I don't know, 15%.

353
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,065
Some people tip 20.

354
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,568
Some people
got money.

355
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,120
What you think
Wee-Bey would tip?

356
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:10,239
You'd be
a clever motherfucker

357
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,324
if there wasn't
a wiretap running.

358
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,326
What do you mean?

359
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,820
Say we turn in 20
and this afternoon

360
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,255
the bosses are listening
to the wiretap

361
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,125
and they hear we took
30 out of that car.

362
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,630
Didn't think of that,
did you?

363
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:37,800
We're finding a lot of stuff
on the Westside of downtown

364
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:41,387
that might be his over by
that Howard Street corridor.

365
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,173
- What kind of property?
- Low-rent commercials.

366
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,608
A lot of vacants.

367
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,226
The fuck does
Avon Barksdale want

368
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:49,211
with a string of
empty storefronts?

369
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:52,281
- This feels premature.
- What does?

370
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,016
<i>Chasing up assets.</i>

371
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:55,901
We're not close to putting
a charge to the man.

372
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,203
That should
be the priority.

373
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,988
We put a charge
to Avon Barksdale,

374
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:01,223
the deputy shuts us down,
tells us to go home.

375
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:02,691
You want the moneyside
of this case,

376
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,326
it's now or never,
Lieutenant.

377
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,878
Whoop-whoop!

378
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,415
- Hey, I'm working here.
-<i> Whoop-whoop!</i>

379
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:13,335
- Herc:<i> Maybe 20 or 30.</i>
- Dollars for donuts.

380
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:17,423
You should've seen
the looks on their faces.

381
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,708
- What did Wee-Bey say?
- "What money?"

382
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:23,395
The only hassle is
we need to sit here
and count this shit.

383
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,647
Do the ECU
submissions.

384
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,066
And it's all limp-dick,
dime-vial money.

385
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,852
Dirty bills
right off the corner.

386
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,271
McNulty:
<i>You all got the pit boys</i>
<i>on a fresh pay phone, right?</i>

387
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,023
- Yeah, on McCulloh.
- You take pictures?

388
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,492
-<i> Fuck, yeah.</i>
-<i> Good, we're gonna need</i>
<i>an additional affidavit</i>

389
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,676
to get up on that phone.

390
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:40,029
Another 30 days, McNulty?

391
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,585
-<i> (door slams)</i>
- What the fuck did I do?

392
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,570
One day he fights,
the next day he's ready
to roll over.

393
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,122
<i>Does he want this</i>
<i>fucking case or not?</i>

394
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:52,407

Hey, fuck, no,

Phone sex?

413
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,250
Shit was hilarious.

414
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,085
You know you're supposed
to shut down

415
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,503

Pertinent now, right?

432
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,793
Well, it is if you
can explain why we're
still on the line

433

after 10 minutes
jerking off.

434
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,247
You gotta
justify that.

435
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,834
Maybe three holes
was the code for
three stash houses.

00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,675

I thinks not, Terrell.
I thinks not.

00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:01,897
Y'all might need
to think this through

454
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:03,565
and stop
wasting my time.

455
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,318
'Cause Omar
can come back tomorrow.

Where's everybody at?

481

Sure.

No.

I'm thinkin', um--

509
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,532
I'm thinkin'
about gettin' clean...

510
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:42,618
again.

511
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:46,755
I'm thinkin', you know,

512
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,790
I ain't got no other place
to go, maybe...

513
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:51,593
that's wrong, right?

514
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:54,796
<i>That ain't right,</i>
<i>right? Sorry.</i>

515
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:57,466
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:01,803
Wait.

517
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,952
Back door only.

518
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,987
There's an old sofa
in the basement

519
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:20,956
and I'll throw you
down some blankets.

520
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:24,242
You try to come
up those stairs,

521
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:25,794
and I'm gonna call
the police on you.

522
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,546
I swear I will.

523
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,831
<i>(thunder rumbling)</i>

524
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,311
West fucking Baltimore
is on vacation.

525
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,515
No crews slinging
in the low-rises,
the towers.

526
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:56,575
(cheering)

527
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,362
What the fuck?

528
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:14,843
Who's playing who?

529
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,911
West against east.

530
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,747
Baltimore?

531
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:20,081
The projects, man.

532
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,350
The braggin' rights
to the projects.

533
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:27,055
The projects
got a ball team?

534
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,204
How long you been
working at Orlando's?

535
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,790
-<i> Four or five months.</i>
- You like it?

536
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:45,991
Pays the rent.

537
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,743
You must see a lot
there, I imagine.

538
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:49,211
What do you mean?

539
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,445
Well, there's a lot
of players there.

540
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,946
A lot of game
being played.

541
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:53,915
I don't know
nothin' about that.
I just work for tips.

542
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,635
- Greggs:<i> For tips?</i>
- Tips, drinks.

543
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,019
You know,
<i>I'm just a B-girl.</i>

544
00:29:58,055 --> 00:29:59,688
<i>I don't mess with</i>
<i>nothing beyond that.</i>

545
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:03,058
<i>Some of the girls in there,</i>
<i>they're into drugs and whatnot.</i>

546
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,510
Some of 'em turn tricks
in the rooms upstairs,

547
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:08,797
<i>but I mostly just</i>
<i>stay at the bar.</i>

548
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,849
You know, Miss Ennis,
it's a rare thing

549
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,484
when we ask somebody
to come on downtown with us,

550
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,236
<i>and we don't</i>
<i>have a charge on them,</i>

551
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,138
<i>we don't tell them</i>
<i>what we're gonna talk about,</i>

552
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:18,173
<i>and they come along</i>
<i>without complaining.</i>

553
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,809
-<i> That hardly ever happens.</i>
- Rarely, if ever.

554
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:22,994
I figure
you got your reasons.

555
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,030
The crew
that runs Orlando's.

556
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:27,582
They've dropped about a dozen
bodies over the last year.

557
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,335
<i>And they're running the drugs</i>
<i>in every housing project</i>

558
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,370
<i>west of</i>
<i>the Martin Luther King.</i>

559
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:35,990
I don't know
anything about that.
I just work for tips.

560
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:38,426
But now you do know, right?
'Cause we're telling you.

561
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,645
You know a girl
named Keisha Michaels?

562
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:42,914
She dances with me.

563
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,817
- How's she doing?
- All right, I guess.

564
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,221
Will you excuse us
a moment?

565
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,283
So, what do you think?

566
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,318
I think
she's a sweetheart.

567
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:04,903
I think if we push
her hard, she'll tumble.

568
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:06,988
You want to show her
the pictures?

569
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:09,908
I want to do better
than that.

570
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:12,994
(cheering)

571
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:26,007
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

572
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:30,812
C'mon, man,
play defense.

573
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,597
- D up.
- Let's go!

574
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,015
D up, B.

575
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,384
Avon:
<i>Who is he?</i>

576
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,069
That's Marcus Rivera
right there, man.

577
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,740
He out of Lake Clifton.
That nigger played
in Italy and shit.

578
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:46,411
Hey, yo, Slim.
What's up, man?

579
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,079
You gotta go all
the way over to Europe
to get you a ringer?

580
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,031
Naw, he home now.

581
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:53,501
But I see you pullin' boys
out the junior colleges.

582
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,403
He from Eastside,
went to Dunbar.

583
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:56,705
Hey, yo,
what's up, playboy?

584
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,173
How come you wearin'
that suit, B?

585
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,908
For real, it's 85
fucking degrees out here

586
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:01,376
and you trying to be
like Pat Riley.

587
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:03,295
Man, look the part,
be the part, motherfucker.

588
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:05,931
Nigger, please.
You walkin' around with
a fake fucking clipboard.

589
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,249
You can't even
read a playbook.
Be for real.

590
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:10,435
<i>You bunch of bitches.</i>

591
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:19,427
Yeah!

592
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:20,729
Let's go.

593
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,147
That was nice.

594
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,399
That boy was talkin'
to God, right?

595
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:32,941
-<i> Ain't y'all</i>
<i>on the clock?</i>
- Ain't you?

596
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,710
- We on break.
- Then we on a break, too.

597
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,446
What's up
with this game?

598
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:40,215
Naw, just something we do
every year, you know?

599
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,167
Eastside versus
Westside niggers.

600
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:43,551
Loser gotta throw
a big-ass party

601
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,286
up at Droodle Hill
next weekend.

602
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:46,621
Who's favored?

603
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,623
Eastside won
the last two years.

604
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:51,125
My boys.

605
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:52,560
Coroner:
<i>Found nude Monday morning</i>

606
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,597
<i>in a Dumpster</i>
<i>off Reisterstown Road,</i>
<i>above Northern.</i>

607
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:59,067
<i>Toxicology is positive</i>
<i>for heroin and cocaine.</i>

608
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:05,907
- In a Dumpster?
- Freamon:<i> Rolled up in a rug.</i>

609
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,860
She overdosed and whoever
was with her didn't do shit,

610
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:10,278
but roll her up
and throw her away.

611
00:33:10,313 --> 00:33:11,813
'Cause that's
how they do.

612
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:14,983
Coroner:
<i>Positive for semen in vaginal,</i>
<i>anal, and oral cavities.</i>

613
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:17,702
Three different blood types,
all secreters.

614
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:20,088
They fucked her
and threw her away.

615
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,091
The only reason
we knew who she was
or what she was about

616
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,260
or what she might mean
to someone like you,

617
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,662
is because we've been keeping
an eye on the people

618
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:30,548
who run Orlando's
for some time now.

619
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,885
We got ways of knowing
what they're saying,
what they're thinking.

620
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:35,387
You know what they said
about this one?

621
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,188
Greggs:
<i>That the stupid bitch</i>
<i>didn't know how good</i>

622
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,840
<i>the snort was</i>
<i>at Little Man's party.</i>

623
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:42,027
That it was her own fault.
That's how they do.

624
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,229
They use people,
and when they throw
them away,

625
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:45,897
they find a way
to say it ain't on them.

626
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:48,033
Lying motherfucker.

627
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,735
<i>He said they took her</i>
<i>to a hospital.</i>

628
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,749
Hell, yeah.

629
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,335
That's what
I'm talkin' about.
Now, get back on D.

630
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,337
Check out Avon.
He freakin'.

631
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,258
<i>Shit, man, we gotta</i>
<i>win this one.</i>

632
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,510
Yo, I think
Avon's here.

633
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:17,312
Where?

634
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,314
Like I know
what he looks like?

635
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,349
He's a black guy
rooting for Westside.

636
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,191
<i>(phone rings)</i>

637
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:32,193
We might have
a visual on Avon.

638
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:34,662
<i>Street ball game</i>
<i>up at Cloverdale.</i>

639
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,064
Where's Greggs
and Freamon?

640
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,750
Pressin' the stripper
they picked up.

641
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,204
You and Carver
stay on the radio.

642
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,926
- We should follow him.
- Why?

643
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,095
He ain't gonna
touch drugs or money

644
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,263
<i>anywhere you can see him,</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

645
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,116
In Narcotics
we follow guys.

00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:58,053
<i>We do it well,</i>
<i>we make cases on it.</i>

647
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:06,394
Mount up.

648
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,266
We've been on this guy
three months.

649
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:14,435
Don't you even want
to get a look at him?

650
00:35:14,454 --> 00:35:16,538
Wouldn't know
Avon Barksdale

651
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,056
if I fell over him
in the street.

652
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:19,424
<i>The thing is,</i>
<i>I don't need to.</i>

653
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:22,143
<i>We get him by voice alone</i>
<i>or we don't get him.</i>

654
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,749
Yeah, baby!

655
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:31,252
(blows whistle)

656
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:32,954
<i>Half-time.</i>

657
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:35,090
Got yourself
a fine ringer.

658
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,291
Well, yeah, baby,
it's not your year,

659
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,459
you know what
I'm talkin' about?

660
00:35:38,478 --> 00:35:39,894
It look that way,
but you never know.

661
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,479
Oh, I know, man,
we up 12.

662
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,765
Yeah, you is,
but, hey...

663
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,984
I got a proposition
for you.

664
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,986
Okay.

665
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,437
Double down?

666
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:51,472
Let's give this wager
a clean six-figures.

667
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:54,159
You serious?

668
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,827
I don't give a fuck, baby,
it's your money.

669
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,278
You can waste it
if you want,

670
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:58,780
you know
what I'm talkin' about?

671
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,337
Daniels:
<i>Anyone got him?</i>

00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,296
- 12-10.
- You have him?

675
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:18,299
Lieutenant, I don't even
know what I'm looking for.

676
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:33,648
Whoo!

677
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:38,203
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

678
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,823
Foul.

679
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:12,153
Got him marked.
On the sideline,
red shirt, white visor.

680
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,522
I think he's coaching
or somethin'.

681
00:37:14,557 --> 00:37:17,358
Who this
fucking midget, yo?

682
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,007
Get that midget
outta here, B.

683
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:44,719
Hey.

684
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,357
Man:
<i>Why you holler at me?</i>

685
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,808
Man #2:
<i>Yo, man, we gettin'</i>
<i>down to it.</i>

686
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,527
<i>I get to you</i>
<i>when I get to you.</i>

687
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,280
That's it,
we're on the stash.

688
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:59,284
- We are?
- Uh-huh.

689
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:07,992
How can you
put that down

690
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:09,911
when Sydnor
wasn't on the roof?

691
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:11,546
Yes, he was.

692
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,215
No, he's not.
He's with Daniels.

693
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,718
No, he isn't.

694
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,103
Get the fuck
outta here.

695
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:37,772
<i>Yo, yo, ref, ref, ref,</i>
<i>what the fuck?</i>

696
00:38:39,993 --> 00:38:42,243
(blows whistle)

697
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,670
What the fuck?

698
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:57,658
Yo, ref, yo, ref,
what the fuck?

699
00:38:57,677 --> 00:38:59,210
The boy was fouled.

700
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:00,995
Clear, straight up!

701
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:03,298
How you gonna
not call that?

702
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,268
Look, if you want,

703
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,836
I can put time back
on the clock and replay it.

704
00:39:08,855 --> 00:39:11,139
You talkin' about
a do-over, baby?

705
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:12,440
Are you talkin' about
a fuckin' do-over?

706
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,891
That's not how
the game is played!

707
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:16,144
You can't do that!
Fuckin' believe
this shit?

708
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:17,729
<i>Nigger talkin' about</i>
<i>doing it again.</i>

709
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:19,564
Look, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

710
00:39:19,616 --> 00:39:21,366
Ain't gonna be no trouble
over no ball.

711
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,985
Man, you supposed
to be the ref, right?

712
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,871
Why don't you stand up
for your fucking self?

713
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,790
You pussy.

714
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,491
You can't just let any
old motherfucking nigga

715
00:39:30,526 --> 00:39:33,161
get in your face,
you understand?

716
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,214
Now, walk away.

717
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,166
Walk away.

718
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,967
Turn around
and walk the fuck away.

719
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,754
Ignorant motherfucker.

720
00:39:44,474 --> 00:39:46,641
- We cool?
- Yeah, we cool, baby.

721
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,710
You tell your people
to come out here to
the park Saturday at noon.

722
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:53,047
'Course you come
on the Westside again,
baby, without a ball,

723
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:55,016
<i>I'm gonna</i>
<i>light your ass up.</i>

724
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:00,905
D'Angelo, huh?

725
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,324
You know him?

726
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
At this point,
it feels like I do.

727
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:13,084
We sorta
moved in together.

728
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:16,954
He seemed like
he was different.

729
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,291
I have
to quit the club.

730
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:22,844
Yes, you do.
But not just yet.

731
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,578
We need your help.

732
00:40:24,597 --> 00:40:26,414
<i>Which is why</i>
<i>we came to you.</i>

733
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:27,515
I don't know
what else you--

734
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,801
Keisha was
not the first.

735
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:31,552
Unless somebody steps up
a little bit,

736
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:34,055
she's not gonna
be the last neither.

737
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:42,230
<i>Do you like that one?</i>

738
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:44,232
Why don't you keep it?

739
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,205
Thank you.

740
00:40:57,613 --> 00:40:59,831
He's getting into
a black Ford Excursion.

741
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:01,132
Herc:
<i>Copy that.</i>

742
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,284
Daniels:
<i>He's pulling out,</i>
<i>north on Collington.</i>

743
00:41:03,303 --> 00:41:06,387
<i>(rap music playing)</i>

744
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:19,133
11-71.
You got the parallel
on the north,

745
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:20,651
<i>I got him on the south.</i>

746
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:24,439
11-71, I got him.
Looks like he's going
east on Oliver.

747
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,673
He just parked.

748
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,792
East of Oliver.

749
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:47,678
12-10,
you keep the eyeball.

750
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,014
11-71, take up
a position on Federal,

751
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,099
west of Montford.

752
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,802
I'm coming up
from the south.

753
00:41:57,774 --> 00:41:59,273
11-71, I copy that.

754
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,477
He's just
sitting there.

755
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,385
- He's doubling back.
- Copy.

756
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:37,411
He's south
on Montford.

757
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,861
He's at the light
at Preston and Milton

758
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:55,613
and is south on Milton.

759
00:43:06,175 --> 00:43:08,593
Be advised that he didn't
make it to Chase.

760
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,745
11-71,
what's your status?

761
00:43:11,764 --> 00:43:13,798
Herc:
<i>He couldn't have</i>
<i>gone past us.</i>

762
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:18,185
Sydnor:
<i>11-71, nothin'</i>
<i>on this side.</i>

763
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,191
Must have
went to ground.

764
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:32,233
All right,
hold your positions.
I'll take a look.

765
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:40,041
<i>(rap music playing)</i>

766
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,232
He called again,
same pay phone.

767
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,684
Same voice?

768
00:44:06,736 --> 00:44:08,269
The main stash house,
it's gotta be.

769
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:09,470
The pattern fits.

770
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:11,305
Who took the call
at the projects?

771
00:44:11,324 --> 00:44:12,440
Who knows?

772
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:13,858
There was no one
on the roof.

773
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,994
Sydnor was off with Daniels
chasing Avon in the street.

774
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,413
We had a good day, too.

775
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,699
Kima turned
one of the dancers
over at Avon's club.

776
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:25,119
The one who's
fucking D'Angelo.

777
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:27,622
<i>(muffled TV playing)</i>

778
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,977
(laughs)

779
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,820
This guy's good.
We threw everything
we had at him.

780
00:44:59,855 --> 00:45:01,205
Well, you know
what they say,

781
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,124
stupid criminals
make stupid cops.

782
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,326
I'm proud to be
chasing this guy.

783
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:08,129
We got four front
companies so far,

784
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,715
buying up
all kinds of shit.

785
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,417
A club,
an apartment building,
the funeral home.

786
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:15,553
And a whole lot
of real estate on
the Westside of downtown

787
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,471
by that
Howard Street corridor.

788
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,890
<i>Shop fronts</i>
<i>and warehouses.</i>

789
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,392
Barksdale's name on it?

790
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,061
Fronts, mostly.
Relatives, some.

791
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,931
Mind if
I have a seat?

792
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,101
<i>The point is,</i>
<i>he's had the projects</i>

793
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:32,236
<i>for more than a year now</i>
<i>and it's a money factory.</i>

794
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,556
We popped Wee-Bey coming out
the other day with $22,000,

795
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:37,057
<i>and the boys</i>
<i>talking on the wire</i>

796
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:38,693
were saying that it wasn't
that much of a loss.

797
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:40,494
22?

798
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,247
And that's just from one morning
from the towers and the pit.

799
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,399
Add the avenue corners,
you're probably up near 30.

800
00:45:45,418 --> 00:45:47,901
Another take
for the evening...

801
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,603
$60,000.

802
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:51,038
A day?

803
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:54,175
<i>That's 20, 25 million</i>
<i>a year, conservatively.</i>

804
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,261
<i>You take out 20%</i>
<i>for running expenses</i>
<i>and spillage</i>

805
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,015
and you are still clearing
a million dollars a month.

806
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,550
So, where's it all go?

807
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:04,385
<i>He shows no flash.</i>

808
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,472
He's got no house,
no car in his name,

809
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:11,308
no jewelry,
no clothes.

810
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,928
Just front companies
and the property.

811
00:46:13,963 --> 00:46:16,564
<i>And political</i>
<i>contributions.</i>

812
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,436
<i>$75,000 in last month alone,</i>
<i>all from his front companies</i>

813
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:23,954
<i>or their</i>
<i>listed officers.</i>

814
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,939
<i>And that's just</i>
<i>at a quick glance.</i>

815
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,409
<i>I'm just totaling up</i>
<i>the legal contributions.</i>

816
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:31,662
<i>You've got the likes</i>
<i>of Damien Price,</i>

817
00:46:31,714 --> 00:46:33,614
<i>aide to a state senator,</i>

818
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:36,517
<i>driving out $20,000 in cash</i>
<i>from the projects</i>

819
00:46:36,552 --> 00:46:38,519
<i>whenever he feels it.</i>

820
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:40,838
Now, I know you don't want
to hear this, Lieutenant,

821
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:43,591
but the money is real
and it's everywhere.

822
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:47,478
And more than the drugs,
it's the money that matters.

823
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:53,017
I ain't fucked nobody else
if that's what you thinkin'.

824
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:56,654
A'ight, I mean, fuck it.

825
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,856
Fuck it,
if you wanna go, then go!

826
00:46:58,908 --> 00:47:01,742
But you could give me
a goddamn reason.

827
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,083
What do I look
like to you?

828
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,451
What you mean?

829
00:47:10,486 --> 00:47:13,120
What do I look
like to you?

830
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:15,206
You look like a girl,
a woman.

831
00:47:15,258 --> 00:47:17,291
A beautiful woman.
You fine, what?

832
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:19,794
I don't look like
trash to you?

833
00:47:21,097 --> 00:47:23,380
Baby, this ain't
about what you do.

834
00:47:23,432 --> 00:47:25,999
I don't look like something
you could roll up in a rug

835
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:28,636
and throw in the trash?

836
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:37,695
Shardene.

837
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,647
Shardene!

838
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:41,982
Shardene!

839
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:44,819
Lieutenant,
you paged us?

840
00:47:44,854 --> 00:47:46,203
We were almost home.

841
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,155
Sit.

842
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,000
-<i> Yeah?</i>
-<i> Checked my count</i>
<i>again, yo.</i>

843
00:48:00,036 --> 00:48:03,370
-<i> How bad?</i>
-<i> Not too bad, man.</i>
<i>Not too bad.</i>

844
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:06,090
<i>We, um, we got hit</i>
<i>by a 22.</i>

845

-<i> That's all.</i>

846
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:10,678
<i>A'ight.</i>

847
00:48:20,556 --> 00:48:24,024
I got towers two,
three, five and six

848
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:25,910
and another one
labeled "P" for the pit.

849
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,411
<i>Where's one and four?</i>

850
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,080

to crawl back to whatever
rock you hid it under.

855
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:43,377
<i>It comes back</i>
<i>and it goes to ECU.</i>

856
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:46,380
This doesn't happen.

857
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:50,301
Not with me.
Not with my unit.

858
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,031
I wouldn't steal
and not tell you about it.

859
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:28,389
This some of
Avon's shit.

860
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:32,259
You got Avon Barksdale chasin'
your ass all around town,

861
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:34,461
<i>and you still find time</i>
<i>to take his shit.</i>

862
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,598
- It's your shit now.
- What I want with that?

863
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,733
What anybody want
with that, man.

864
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,318
How much you askin'?

865
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,903
Oh, we free.

866
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:44,738
Free?

867
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,693
I'm sayin', I got a little
proposition for you.

868
00:49:49,745 --> 00:49:53,480
Proposition is, you get
four G-packs for free

869
00:49:53,499 --> 00:49:56,834
and you give me some better
idea on how I can reach Avon.

870
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,019
How to contact him?

871
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:00,821
Y'all just had
a game, right?

872
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,173
How you get ahold
of him to parlay?

873
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,209
We talk now and then.

874
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:07,544
I page his ass.

875
00:50:07,596 --> 00:50:11,015
Okay. Okay.

876
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,667
That all you need?
A number?

877
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:15,185
<i>Oh, I'll make</i>
<i>do with it.</i>

878
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,721
<i>And a code for</i>
<i>one of his peoples.</i>

07.

881
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:31,652
What makes you think
I just ain't gonna take
this shit off your hands

882
00:50:31,687 --> 00:50:33,037
and throw your ass
up outta here?

883
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,705
C'mon, man,
Avon goes down,

884
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,291
the projects be open
market again, right?

885
00:50:39,045 --> 00:50:41,161
Let me understand.

886
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:44,197
Avon loses
a hundred large
to me on a bet,

887
00:50:44,216 --> 00:50:47,251
then you bring me
some of his shit

888
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:50,921
so that I can put your
predatory self on his ass?

889
00:50:52,808 --> 00:50:54,725
Not his day, is it?

890
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,518
Fuck.

891
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:15,329

Would you?

898
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:55,152
You didn't
believe me.
