1
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:20,850
Fuck me.

2
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:23,284
I'm dying here.

3
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:26,520
Let me get on the other side,
work it from there.

4
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:29,829
One, two.

5
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:31,058
-Three.
-Three.

6
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:43,202
Shit.

7
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:45,778
Need help?

8
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:54,856
Right. On three, motherfuckers.
One, two, three.

9
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm embarrassed for you all.

10
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:11,330
Yo, Herc, I catch my breath,
I'm gonna shoot the drawers off this bitch.

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,465
It's caught on something, Lieutenant.

12
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:16,335
Get over there with Carver.

13
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,356
One, two, you know what to do.

14
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:35,759
What the fuck?

15
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:49,736
Jesus. My ass is kicked.

16
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:54,042
I could move it a bit when I was alone.
It must've got wedged in the door somehow.

17
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,411
Desk is empty, right?

18
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:57,686
-Yeah.
-You checked it?

19
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,822
At this rate, we're never gonna get it in.

20
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:10,290
What?

21
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,125
In?

22
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,593
In.

23
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:19,341
Unbelievable, unbe-fucking-lievable.

24
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,037
Christ.

25
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,759
This case is a bit humble for you.

26
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:21,925
I know it doesn't look like much on paper,
but see what you can do.

27
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:32,434
-Making new friends?
-Not yet.

28
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,177
I spent the morning down
in juvenile court...

29
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:39,406
but the kids know they can't be hurt
with a street-weight charge...

30
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,142
so didn't get much there.

31
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,239
You tried?

32
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:46,153
Nothing like being told,
"Fuck off," by a 14-year-old.

33
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,049
-Right here's our best shot.
-Him?

34
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:54,261
Hand-to-hand with Bubbles,
and he's carrying a long-ass sheet.

35
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:57,958
All right. Who's first? Ms. Dawkins?

36
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:00,225
State versus Marvin Browning, Your Honor.

37
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:03,530
One count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, heroin...

38
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,938
and one count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, cocaine.

39
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:10,101
-Quantity?
-One gelcap and one vial, Your Honor.

40
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,944
Bail recommendation?

41
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:15,915
State requests defendant be held, as he
is part of a continuing investigation...

42
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:19,215
and further, is subject to a mandatory
five years without parole...

43
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,652
because of prior convictions.

44
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:23,589
Will your office be seeking
the mandatory five in this case?

45
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,057
Absolutely, Your Honor.

46
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:29,225
Very well, I'll take
that into consideration.

47
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,826
Got his attention, at least.

48
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,710
Lieutenant, come have a taste.

49
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,176
Come on, we're celebrating.

50
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,848
Patrick's going out on medical.

51
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,909
Sweet, sweet Cervical 6.

52
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:55,715
My shoulder's numb, my arm's numb.

53
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:59,657
My fingers feel like they belong to
some son of a bitch in the next county.

54
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:03,220
This is my ticket out of
this rat-shit department.

55
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:07,166
66 2l3% pension,
and I don't have to wait for my 30.

56
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,965
-I'm gone.
-Fucking yo did you a favor.

57
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,901
Kid hit like a mule, I've got to say.

58
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:15,465
You should take a couple of days.
Think it over before you put in papers.

59
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:18,444
My brother-in-law's got
a video store out on Moravia.

60
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:23,448
Does $6,000 a week straight rentals,
another $8,000 in porn.

61
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:24,875
He needs a partner.

62
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,353
But they take that off
the top of a medical pension.

63
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:30,755
If you report it as income, they do.
Do I look that fucking stupid?

64
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:33,723
Have a nice life, Lieutenant.

65
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:46,665
What's with you?

66
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,143
You gonna miss me, Augs?

67
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,172
What the fuck am I going to do, Paddy?

68
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:53,947
Tell you what.

69
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:57,577
-What do you say we go out together?
-What do you mean?

70
00:06:57,686 --> 00:07:01,952
I mean, it only hurts for a minute. And it
doesn't have to be line-of-duty either.

71
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,749
I'm serious. You know those stairs where
they send us down to the basement?

72
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,692
-Yeah.
-It's dark down there.

73
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,323
You go up eight or nine steps,
let go of the rail, take a little jump--

74
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:16,063
-I'd break my fucking neck like that.
-You don't break nothing.

75
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:20,602
You do a little dance on those steps,
you're up to two-thirds with me.

76
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,544
And maybe you sue the city,
get a little more.

77
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:27,744
Can't say we don't deserve it.

78
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,513
Five in. For a one-and-one.

79
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,421
Now, why bang me like that
for a one-and-one?

80
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,961
Because it's your turn, Mr. Browning.
Everybody out there gets a turn.

81
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:43,063
You're all running wild here.
I think a judge might want to...

82
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:45,360
take a look at this
and slow you all down a mite.

83
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:49,232
I don't know, Marvin.
I'm looking at your sheet here, and...

84
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:53,407
for one thing, it's a little wrong
to be calling it a sheet.

85
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:55,204
More like a book.

86
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,939
Point is, we got the room
to get a little crazy on you.

87
00:07:58,047 --> 00:07:59,776
Like she said, it's your turn.

88
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:03,683
Tell us some stories,
it could be somebody else's turn.

89
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:07,016
Stories.

90
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:08,984
Avon Barksdale.

91
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:12,382
Know the name?

92
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:15,292
Every motherfucker up in them towers
knows the name.

93
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:17,922
Myself, I ain't never really
had a word with the man.

94
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,591
Stringer Bell, then?

95
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,562
Wee-Bey? Savino?
Stinkum? C.C.O.? Roc-Roc?

96
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,100
Who're you gonna give us, Marvin?

97
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:31,978
You don't say a name soon,
you're gonna be courtside.

98
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:33,575
All right.

99
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,145
All right, what?

100
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:38,843
All right, I'll take the years.

101
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,229
Damn, boy.

102
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:56,970
You should see the cop.

103
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:59,839
When you're ready to get up, put that on.

104
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:04,068
-Report to bunk A-7.
-A-7.

105
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:06,213
Don't be later than breakfast.

106
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:13,388
Who else is up in here?
Anybody from Westside?

107
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,123
D.C. boys, mostly.

108
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:50,911
Long fucking drive.
Me and you drawing another shit detail.

109
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:53,821
-This ain't a shit detail.
-No?

110
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,116
I'm in Upper fucking Marlboro, Maryland,
and still going south.

111
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:00,756
Look. Another cow.

112
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,932
Use your imagination.

113
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:09,470
This little shitbird, having already been
whipped good by us once...

114
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:12,573
he sees us, right?
And he starts crying like a little bitch...

115
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,472
because he knows we drove
all the way to Prince George's...

116
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:16,771
for more of his ass, right?

117
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,009
Imagine we jack him up,
toss him into a small room...

118
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,042
and tell him that Detective Mahone
is near dead from the sucker punch.

119
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:28,817
No shit. The drunk old fuck
suddenly slipped into a coma.

120
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:32,686
And now the Commissioner and
Mrs. Mahone are at his bedside in the ICU.

121
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:37,231
And we've been ordered to come down here,
rip off his scrotum, put it in a jar...

122
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:41,234
and drive it back to Baltimore, so it can
sit with the fucking bowling trophies...

123
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:43,270
behind the bar at the FOP Lodge.

124
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,465
All right? After which...

125
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,606
fucknuts stops whimpering long enough...

126
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,646
to just start giving people up, whoever.

127
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,943
Stringer Bell. Avon Barksdale.

128
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,712
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

129
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,845
Little prick turns on everybody...

130
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:04,722
and we break the case wide open.

131
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:08,123
-Cool.
-Right?

132
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:27,738
So, from all them hand-to-hands,
nobody flipped?

133
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,586
No, that part of town,
Barksdale carries more weight than we do.

134
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,212
Just like all these fucking homicides.

135
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,656
Witnesses lying, witnesses paid off,
witnesses backing up on their story.

136
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:41,591
-Can you blame them?
-Not really.

137
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:45,291
Every now and then, we visit the projects.
They live there.

138
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:48,733
-Your man's Dee, right?
-D'Angelo, yeah.

139
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,998
This one's got a Dee as a possible shooter.

140
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:54,599
-This one connects.
-No way.

141
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:57,711
Yeah? I'm seeing it.

142
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,720
It's Diedre Kresson,
one of Keeley's cases.

143
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:02,874
Come on, Jay, this
is a college girl...

144
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:05,681
blown up in the kitchen
of an apartment up in Northeast.

145
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,517
How does this match with the rest
of the Westside mopes?

146
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,148
-They don't have cars?
-This doesn't match, Jay.

147
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,285
It does. Take a look at your office report.

148
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:16,193
A witness puts her
with a Dee the night she's aced.

149
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,766
How many Dees do you think
there are in the system, Jay?

150
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:19,856
As a street name?

151
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,697
Let me ask you something, Jimmy.

152
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:24,704
How many case files you got
that you're putting on Barksdale?

153
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:27,834
-Maybe a dozen.
-A dozen cases.

154
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:30,343
So, how many of those are from our squad?

155
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:33,838
One. Gerard Bogue.

156
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:38,078
One case?
Your squad's down a man for weeks, Jimmy.

157
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,121
We're gonna be humping your calls,
catching your cases...

158
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:45,023
hopping around like a one-legged pigtown
whore on check day, and for what?

159
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:48,654
So that you can have your big adventure
and solve everybody else's cases?

160
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:50,732
Is this what I'm hearing?

161
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,729
He's got you, Jimmy.

162
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:56,867
Where's the love, McNulty?
Show me some fucking love.

163
00:13:56,972 --> 00:14:01,409
-All right.
-Attaboy. He's my son.

164
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:10,076
Why don't you just dump
this loser on Santangelo?

165
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,346
He's supposed to be down here
helping us, anyway.

166
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:16,914
I would if I could find the fucker.
Must have another job, he's gone so much.

167
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,392
-What does Daniels have to say about that?
-Nothing, I cover for him.

168
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:23,794
He was out in the wind there
all day yesterday, half the day before.

169
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,333
Man, Keeley really dogged this one.

170
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:30,769
Ain't nothing in here but a 24
and some crime scene photos, and this.

171
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,441
"Tywanda called.
N.F.D., no last name, no address.

172
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:40,775
"Claims your victim killed after being
visited by a suspect named Dee."

173
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,580
No further description.

174
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,613
There's a callback number, though.

175
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:47,984
So, call.

176
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,709
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.

177
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,812
Disconnected.

178
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:14,876
"He got you, Jimmy."

179
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:18,081
All right, motherfucker, he got me, too.

180
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:23,317
So, I'm gonna call Verizon,
see if they got a fresh listing.

181
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,517
You happy now, bitch?

182
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:30,126
You sure about that tag, Bubs?

183
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,198
I seen the van.

184
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,565
It cleared the Court
and rolled up Amity toward Lexington.

185
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:39,104
Plates were reported stolen off a car
parked right here, on this block.

186
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:42,174
So you're thinking they're from
right around here?

187
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,403
Maybe.

188
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,475
Word in the Towers said
it was Omar and his crew.

189
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:50,244
-Omar? Who's he?
-You ain't know Omar?

190
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:54,517
Omar, the terror. Been ripping and robbing
out here for years now.

191
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:57,289
-Is he fierce?
-That nigger don't play.

192
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,557
-Got a last name?
-Just Omar.

193
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:02,653
He don't need no last name.

194
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,163
Who's his family?

195
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:07,702
You remember No-Heart Anthony?
Came up with him, they brothers.

196
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,828
No-Heart Anthony?

197
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:14,364
Miss Kima, do not tell me
you don't remember No-Heart Anthony.

198
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:19,507
Damn, girl. What town you been policing at
all these years?

199
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:23,414
And right now, I am personally
ashamed to be your snitch.

200
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:28,753
-Shit.
-What?

201
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,581
-I'm late for my class.
-Class?

202
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:35,292
-1 2-14.
-12-14?

203
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:39,125
Requesting anyone in my unit who's up
to report to Channel 13.

204
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,835
35, I got that.

205
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:51,205
Package be moving.

206
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:53,440
Avon's stuff always be good.

207
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,111
It's a sweet score?

208
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:57,842
It's all right.

209
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:01,386
That play was a little bit
raggedy in there, though.

210
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,320
I fucked up, I know, letting go your name.

211
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:09,021
I don't really care you shouted me out.

212
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:12,062
Everybody in these projects
been knowing Omar, you heard?

213
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:16,268
I just don't want them
coming down on you, baby-boy.

214
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:24,043
Shirley coming with her game.

215
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:28,049
-Every fucking day with that shit.
-Mr. Omar?

216
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:31,315
My check late.

217
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,804
Yo, Mike. Hook a sister up, yo.

218
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,372
So, what next, yo?

219
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,574
Got some iron.

220
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:06,051
Thinking about working
the flush-and-run over on the Eastside...

221
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:07,855
till things cool a mite.

222
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,048
That'll work.

223
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:13,487
So you don't want to
lay over here tonight?

224
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:14,190
No.

225
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,994
-Sure?
-No, I'm gonna go see my mom.

226
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,458
-Keep it close.
-I hear that.

227
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:36,014
Who the man?

228
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:51,723
I gotta be somewhere first,
but I'll run him back downtown after.

229
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,825
No problem, thanks for answering.

230
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:59,872
-Bubbs.
-McNulty.

231
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:04,775
What's up?

232
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:08,246
You ever heard of No-Heart Anthony?

233
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:14,054
Who, Anthony Little?
1058 Argyle, Apartment 16-J.

234
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:17,620
He's up in Hagerstown on a robbery bit.
What about him?

235
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,851
My man.

236
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:23,423
Fuck y'all.

237
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:30,332
You know how the cracker motherfuckers do
when they kill a deer?

238
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:33,234
Or, like, when they go out
killing animals and whatnot?

239
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:35,069
Got them on the front of the truck...

240
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:38,873
tied up, stretched out,
so everybody could see it?

241
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,007
You feel me?

242
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,180
I'm serious, that's what I want.

243
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:46,649
I want that motherfucker on display.

244
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:49,883
I'm gonna send a message
to the courtyard about this motherfucker...

245
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,652
so people know we ain't playing.

246
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:54,091
Yeah, we got people on it.

247
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:56,859
You tell them it's $1,000 on the bucks...

248
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,489
and it's $2,000 on Omar.

249
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,133
-Yeah, Bird's on it.
-Savino, too.

250
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:05,701
You know, Bird jailed
with Omar down the cut, right?

251
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,908
He said he all a faggot.

252
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,307
A faggot? Get the fuck out of here.

253
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,108
Yeah, said he had a whole
stable of boys down in Jessup.

254
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:17,014
This punk motherfucker got even less use
for pussy now that he home.

255
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:19,780
So, he gotta a lotta
heart for a cocksucker?

256
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:23,756
Yo, we doubling down
on Sweet Lips, all right?

257
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:26,417
We make it motherfucking $4,000 on him...

258
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:30,126
$6,000 if I get the chance to
holler at him before he get got.

259
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:32,825
-Say no more.
-Take care of all that.

260
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:36,465
Stickup come up dead
on the stash one night.

261
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:41,002
-Police jumping out the next.
-Something up at the Pit?

262
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,268
Maybe, yeah.

263
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,075
-What's up with my nephew?
-I don't know. He doing good.

264
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:50,583
He making that money out the hole, but...

265
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,279
he might have a problem
he don't know about.

266
00:20:56,691 --> 00:20:58,659
I'm on him.

267
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,702
Yo, where in
Leave it to Beaver-land are you taking me?

268
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,137
I'm late for something.

269
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,971
I'll drop you after,
on the way back downtown.

270
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,435
-What you late for?
-Soccer.

271
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:20,805
Suck what?

272
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,161
Get in the goal!

273
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,656
Spread it out, spread it out, there you go.

274
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,944
First team, fall in!

275
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,977
-Dad!
-Mikey, how are you?

276
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:02,078
-Who's winning?
-They are, 4-1 .

277
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,055
4-1? Who got the goal for you guys?

278
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:07,559
-Ricardo, my assist.
-Assist? That's good.

279
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:12,826
You've got to drink on the breaks, okay?
I don't want you to get dehydrated.

280
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,629
-Hi.
-Hey.

281
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,903
This is Bubbles.

282
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,540
-Hi.
-Second team, come on!

283
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:22,667
-Go on, Mike, go get 'em.
-Bye, Dad.

284
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:30,676
You're late. He thought you weren't
gonna come this time either.

285
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:32,309
This job, you know this job.

286
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,780
I can't get out here
when he gets off the bus at 4:00.

287
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,121
I need more than every other weekend.
He needs me more, so does Sean.

288
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,058
I'm not giving up any more weekends.

289
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:43,562
50-50 split's all my lawyer says
I have to give--

290
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:46,395
It's not 50-50 if I don't
see him all goddamn week.

291
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:49,368
-You see him every day--
-Don't curse at me. My lawyer says--

292
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,960
Fuck your lawyer.

293
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,003
Fuck you.

294
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,774
-Did you see?
-Yeah, I saw.

295
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:05,319
Come on, you get out.

296
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:25,132
This good for you?

297
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:33,239
Thin line between heaven and here.

298
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:09,747
How did he know where the stash at?
The knockos don't know, but he do.

299
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,284
Because some nigger's snitching.

300
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:14,287
Man, ain't nobody got to be snitching
for Omar or his boys...

301
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:16,448
to creep by and see where the stash at.

302
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,394
-Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
-They stomped his ass.

303
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:22,022
-Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
-They stomped his ass.

304
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,098
How he ain't courtside
for banking a knocko?

305
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,759
Boy, how you get home so quick?

306
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:34,265
-Nigger, what you steal?
-Camry XLE.

307
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,242
You all want a ride?
It's right around the corner.

308
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,810
Man, Boy's Village ain't shit.

309
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:44,681
I'm just too bad for that off-brand
little-boy bullshit, man.

310
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,378
It can't hold me.

311
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,051
What you laughing at? What's so funny?

312
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:55,996
If you was me,
your ass would still be down there.

313
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:00,232
You ever seen a city jail, nigger?

314
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:02,269
You ever caught a body?

315
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,863
I'm the one who just got home, remember?

316
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,407
Eight months over on Eager Street
with a body on me.

317
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,942
-Yeah, you got the one.
-Yeah, the one you know about.

318
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:12,740
You little motherfuckers
need to ask around.

319
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:18,646
Yo, out near the county, right,
on the high end of the Eastside?

320
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,848
They got these apartments,
out there, right?

321
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,589
So there was this little shorty
who used to stay out there.

322
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:26,990
She was, like....

323
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,431
I ain't seen a female that fine since.

324
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:35,602
I gotta say, Shorty was right.

325
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:38,200
You fucked her?

326
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:40,206
No, man, it wasn't like that.

327
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:42,868
This was a shorty
my uncle was messing with.

328
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:45,678
They was going on at it
for a little while...

329
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,272
till she find out that my uncle got another
little shorty round the way.

330
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:51,944
More right to say he got a few of them
around the way...

331
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:53,418
know what I'm saying?

332
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:56,955
So, she goes off the hook,
talking about calling the police...

333
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:58,787
about shit she ain't supposed to know.

334
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,123
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah, you know it.

335
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:06,294
But see, I got some creep to me,
and my uncle, he know that shit.

336
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:09,794
So they roll me out past her crib.

337
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:14,607
And they show me how she lives
right on the ground floor, first level.

338
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:20,406
I go creeping around the back,
to the back window.

339
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:23,440
I got the .45 on me, the big gun.

340
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:27,480
I walk up to the window and I look in,
and it's dark as shit...

341
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,216
because it's 3:00 a.m.,
and you can't see shit.

342
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,192
What did you do?

343
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,292
So I pulled out the piece...

344
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:40,526
and I start tapping with the back of it
on the window.

345
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:44,332
And it was quiet, but it was loud enough
so she can hear that shit.

346
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:52,241
That's what she heard, yo.
Sure enough, she comes out.

347
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,445
She's naked and shit.

348
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,107
I don't know why the fuck,
but she has a robe...

349
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:01,711
and as she slipping on her robe,
she turns on the light...

350
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:04,656
and when she does that,
and it's light on the inside...

351
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,818
she can't see shit on the outside.

352
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:10,057
Damn, she naked.

353
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:17,370
She hears that shit on the window
and she ain't got no choice...

354
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:20,066
but to walk over there and see what it is.

355
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,398
She steps up...

356
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:24,837
Iooks out...

357
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:26,436
see where it's coming from.

358
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,013
What happened?

359
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:37,683
He shot her.

360
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:46,028
Yo, Dee, if she was all that,
why didn't you fuck her first?

361
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:49,499
-Nigger, you sick, just shut up.
-What? I'm just saying....

362
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:51,595
There is something seriously wrong.

363
00:27:58,379 --> 00:27:59,710
This is ridiculous.

364
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:03,851
Because a lab freezer goes out
with an electrical short...

365
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:07,750
blood samples in 56 homicides...

366
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:11,523
15 rapes, are allowed to putrefy.

367
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,557
-State's attorney knows?
-The mayor, too.

368
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:20,332
Most of our trace lab is now 25 years old.

369
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:24,036
You ever go outside for money?
The non-profits?

370
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,206
Such as?

371
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:29,799
The Abell Foundation, for one.
My brother's on the board.

372
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:32,674
If you want me to run
it up there for you....

373
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,375
-You could swing that?
-Never hurts to ask, does it?

374
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,686
It never does, Your Honor.

375
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:42,488
So, in that same spirit...

376
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:45,358
where are we with the Barksdale probe?

377
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,219
My other reason for stopping by.

378
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,831
Hand-to-hands and search-and-seizures,
I've heard about these.

379
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,635
Some mid-level players caught up,
as you can see.

380
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:07,214
Look, it's not a knockout blow,
but we sent a clear message.

381
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,718
I don't see Barksdale's name anywhere...

382
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,912
or Bell, or anything about the murders.

383
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:16,481
The casework, it goes towards that.

384
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:17,615
No.

385
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,993
So, we've got work to do, don't we?

386
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:35,837
Police, open the damn door!

387
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:42,711
-What?
-Open the motherfucking door!

388
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:57,462
-Upstairs front clear.
-Kitchen's clear.

389
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,389
I'm at the backdoor.

390
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,258
-Anybody pop out here?
-Okay, quiet.

391
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:06,002
Upstairs rear, clear.

392
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:09,274
I'm gonna beat this bitch
like a red-headed stepchild...

393
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:11,345
for hiding up in this pisshole.

394
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:14,078
Goddamn creepy crawlers everywhere.

395
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,446
Tell Bodie we're on his ass.

396
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:35,365
I'm sorry for cursing at the door.

397
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:38,461
I mean, I couldn't see
that it was only you.

398
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,571
Is it the drugs again?

399
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,735
Would you like to sit down?

400
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:50,780
Preston came to me when my daughter died.

401
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,347
He was four years old.

402
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:57,887
But even then, I knew he was angry.

403
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,990
His mother lived out
there, caught up in it.

404
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:06,926
After a while, you couldn't make her
see nothin' else.

405
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,831
No, man, that wasn't us.

406
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,165
2:30 in the towers?
You guys are crazy, man.

407
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:14,434
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

408
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,940
So, how you think you gonna carry it?

409
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,071
I'm sorry, ma'am.

410
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:23,274
And I'm sorry for the way
we came through here.

411
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,885
If Preston comes past...

412
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:30,754
give him this...

413
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:34,089
and tell him we need to talk, okay?

414
00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:37,323
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,372
What the fuck you doing in there?

416
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:48,464
Talking.

417
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,467
-Talking?
-Yeah.

418
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,685
-See you later.
-All right, catch you later.

419
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,048
I'm driving.

420
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:26,506
Yeah?

421
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,515
McNulty.

422
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:34,147
Some judge for you.

423
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,754
Yeah?

424
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:44,921
Look, can I call you back?

425
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,803
-Major, sir?
-Yeah.

426
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,042
I've been thinkin'.

427
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:02,541
It's a clear violation of the
general orders, I know, but....

428
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:12,790
Last night, I'm at home,
I'm sittin' up buck naked.

429
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:16,954
And I got one hand wrapped around
a cold domestic beer...

430
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:20,065
and the other wrapped around
my magnificent, flaccid...

431
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:24,797
four-and-one-half inch wonder,
and I am trying with all my might...

432
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:28,602
to remember what Leila Kaufman's nipples
looked like...

433
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:32,304
when her bathing top slipped off
at the Hillendale pool swim party.

434
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:35,973
-Leila Kaufman?
-Yes, sir.

435
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:37,775
Summer of '72.

436
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:41,644
I got this saucy wench
in my gun-sights, so to speak...

437
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:46,583
and I am dangerously...

438
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:49,591
close to engorged...

439
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:53,133
when all of a fuckin' sudden,
out of fuckin' nowhere...

440
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:57,493
fuckin' Detective, fuckin' Jimmy McNulty
pops into my head.

441
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:58,996
McNulty?

442
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:01,505
Obviously, I gotta open my eyes
and admit to myself...

443
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,008
that my whole night is ruined.

444
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,374
At which point, I got nothing to do...

445
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:07,941
but think about the problems
of Jimmy McNulty.

446
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:10,312
Because, clearly, this guy...

447
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:14,750
and his fuckin' problems are standing
between me and all worldly pleasure.

448
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:16,047
Clearly.

449
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,791
First of all, it's not Jimmy's fault.

450
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:22,519
-No?
-No.

451
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:25,164
Jimmy is an addict, sir.

452
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:27,057
What's he addicted to?

453
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,330
Himself.

454
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:32,832
It's not funny, sir.

455
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,137
As a matter of fact,
it's a fuckin' tragedy is what it is.

456
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,705
The guy, he has come to believe...

457
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:41,508
that he is always the smartest fuck
in the room.

458
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:45,216
And you know what? It's not his fault,
because let's face it...

459
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,947
he's not going to Johns Hopkins
or joining Mensa...

460
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:51,388
he's taking a fuckin' job
with the Baltimore Police Department.

461
00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:54,689
His first two years in Homicide,
he's in Ulmansky's squad...

462
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,660
partnered with Tony Lamartino.

463
00:34:57,298 --> 00:35:00,699
Christ, it must've been months even...

464
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,326
he was the smartest fuck
in the fuckin' room.

465
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,029
What's your point, Jay?

466
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:06,939
My point is...

467
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,370
he can't help it.

468
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:13,076
It makes him an asshole, I know...

469
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,911
but it's also what makes him good police.

470
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:22,980
Last year, he gives me eight clearances.

471
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:28,219
One of them was a decomp floater...

472
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,362
who was John Doe for three weeks.

473
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:44,702
Tell your boy to wrap up that
bullshit detail in two weeks.

474
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:48,509
He does that, he comes home, clean slate.

475
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,192
You would've loved it.

476
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:07,825
Burrell is sittin' across from me
with a handful ofstreet-level arrests...

477
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,732
pretendin' he has a plan.

478
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:11,598
So, what did you tell him?

479
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:15,163
"Never shit a shitter, Deputy. "
That's what I fuckin' told him.

480
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,671
-I did good, right, Jimmy?
-I gotta go.

481
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:33,183
"Discuss the Hicks ruling
as a manifestation...

482
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,694
"of the judiciary's attempt
to maintain a speedy disposition...

483
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:40,028
"of criminal cases within
a modern court system."

484
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,194
What?

485
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:44,927
That's what I said.

486
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,265
"What?"

487
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:48,966
What the hell's the Hicks ruling?

488
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,442
Did you highlight my sofa?

489
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:53,304
What? No.

490
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,143
Yes, you did.

491
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,178
That was there from before.

492
00:36:57,284 --> 00:37:00,048
Hell it was.
Damn, Kima, marker does not come out.

493
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:03,851
-No, I didn't do it, I swear.
-Okay, let me see the marker.

494
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:07,483
You want my marker,
I need to see a warrant.

495
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:10,660
I'm serious, I need to see
some probable cause.

496
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:13,494
I'm gonna beat your ass.
How about that for probable cause?

497
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,094
-Give me the marker.
-Damn, gettin' all violent and shit.

498
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:20,965
You know you just violated my civil rights?

499
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,134
That's it, new rule: no
marker on the couch.

500
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,905
You get over to that table over there
and do your homework.

501
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:28,948
Go. Take it and go.

502
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,846
Gimme my marker.

503
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:46,430
I'm gonna need some club soda.

504
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:50,902
Damn, girl, this cell phone bill
must eat up the paycheck.

505
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:53,996
No, most of that's work,
it's on the company.

506
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:04,883
Phelan won't let go.

507
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,881
Are we anywhere close on Barksdale?

508
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:11,282
-No, sir.
-So, what are you telling me?

509
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:15,153
I'm not telling you anything, sir.
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

510
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:17,791
I can do whatever
you need me to do with this.

511
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:20,423
If you want me to push it further,
I can do that.

512
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,399
If you want it to go away....

513
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:29,168
If you wanna bring in someone else,
maybe do things differently.

514
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:33,746
You looking for the back door, Lieutenant?

515
00:38:34,114 --> 00:38:35,103
Already?

516
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:39,215
McNulty says this case needs a wire.

517
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,844
You think he's right?

518
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:46,420
It needs somethin'.

519
00:38:57,771 --> 00:38:59,363
Just climb your ass up the pole, man.

520
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:02,135
No, man. This'll work.

521
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:07,036
I'm not climbin' no damn ladder.

522
00:39:10,384 --> 00:39:12,318
You never gonna hit it, man.

523
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:13,511
Bomb!

524
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,211
-Housing must think we just dumb.
-Is that--

525
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,924
-That's your pager or mine?
-That's me.

526
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,828
-Yo, watch that shit on my head.
-Man, it ricocheted off the fuckin' camera.

527
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:27,059
Yeah, you need some aim.

528
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,010
Yo, who this?

529
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,334
So, what do you think?

530
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:11,771
Title 3?

531
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:16,448
Right, but it's not for a wiretap. It's
to clone a pager, I got it from Pearlman.

532
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,781
-Pagers?
-Some kind of throwback thing.

533
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,081
-You mean, why not cell phones?
-Right. Who uses pagers anymore?

534
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:28,217
Tell you what, I was checking out
a wireless bill last night.

535
00:40:28,528 --> 00:40:30,723
Every incoming call was listed.

536
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:35,199
Right. So, if we get Barksdale's pager,
we might get off the street.

537
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:37,167
Maybe even trace some supply.

538
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:43,676
So, who's No-Heart Anthony?

539
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,307
No-Heart ran drugs in the homes
in the early '90s.

540
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:49,279
So, a couple years back,
I don't know why...

541
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:52,910
he finds himself in Randallstown,
tryin' to take off a jewelry store.

542
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,547
He fucks it up, half the county
chases him back downtown.

543
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,853
And I guess No-Heart figures
he's not up for doing the time...

544
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,327
'cause he puts a .44 against his chest,
pulls the trigger.

545
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,692
A .44?

546
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,456
It's a contact wound.

547
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:10,732
Wakes up two hours later
in the University ER.

548
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:13,470
-With a new nickname.
-Right.

549
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,206
Bubbles says it's Anthony's brother...

550
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:20,303
who took off with the Barksdale stash
the other night.

551
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,005
Dude named Omar.

552
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:26,279
It's not the easiest trade, you know,
robbin' dealers.

553
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,351
Man like that is likely to have
a weapon on him.

554
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,221
We jack him up, there's
a charge to work off.

555
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:37,457
And if he knows where
the Barksdale stash is...

556
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,292
he probably knows a whole lot more.

557
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,264
See? Another plan.

558
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:02,812
The thing is, we're gonna
have to sell this.

559
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:05,619
You wanna raise it with Daniels?

560
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:08,024
He'll listen to you more than me.

561
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,233
Where's Santangelo?

562
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:18,597
He's at ECU. He's got a case going today.

563
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:24,207
As of today, I haven't heard anything
to the contrary, so...

564
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:26,807
we're gonna press on.

565
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:30,808
Ideas?

566
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:34,552
We could continue with the busts.

567
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:39,324
But I don't think that's gonna
get us too far off the street.

568
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:42,657
On the other hand, the people we pulled in
last week had pagers.

569
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:45,755
So did D'Angelo Barksdale
when McNulty jacked him up.

570
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:48,528
We could clone a couple of pagers,
see where that takes us.

571
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:50,830
-Clone what?
-Their pagers.

572
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:55,474
They get beeped, we get beeped.
We see who's calling, from what number.

573
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:58,134
If they're all that,
why are they still using pagers?

574
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:00,770
Why not un-ass a few dollars
for cell phones?

575
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:02,779
It's a discipline.

576
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,947
You can't bug a pager.

577
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:10,387
But you can't make a call
with a pager, either.

578
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,153
You're gonna want a pen register
on all the payphones in the low-rises...

579
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:16,786
and any other phones
that link to the pagers.

580
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:19,593
What would it take to do the pagers?

581
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,326
A wiretap affidavit.

582
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:24,595
I think we got enough PC
from the hand-to-hands and surveillance.

583
00:43:24,704 --> 00:43:25,864
We got most of the exhaustion.

584
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:27,769
I'm exhausted just listening to this shit.

585
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:32,743
Good. Exhaustion is a legal requirement
for using electronic intercepts.

586
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:35,310
We gotta prove nothing else works.

587
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:38,316
See, we did the raids, we made the arrests,
but nobody flipped.

588
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:41,410
We don't have an informant
who takes us anywhere above the street.

589
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:42,715
That's pretty much exhaustion.

590
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:45,383
All we got left to do now
is follow one of these mopes...

591
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:47,221
and prove to ourselves we can't do it.

592
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,420
We try to show a judge we can't make...

593
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:51,588
the case by following these guys,
and we can't.

594
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:54,098
How can we keep on any of them
when they're in those towers?

595
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:55,725
But you gotta show you tried.

596
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:02,104
Do we have a pager number?

597
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:13,481
This was written on the stash house wall...

598
00:44:13,753 --> 00:44:16,017
with the letter "D" next to it.

599
00:44:16,623 --> 00:44:19,183
Is that D'Angelo? Did you check it?

600
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,221
It's him.

601
00:44:35,775 --> 00:44:37,072
Let's do this.

602
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:45,647
What does he want us to do?
I don't understand.

603
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:48,882
I'll explain it to you
if you buy me breakfast.

604
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:03,767
Will you explain to me again...

605
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,168
why I'm about to rework
a six-month-old crime scene?

606
00:45:06,273 --> 00:45:09,208
Look at this narrow-ass file.
Keeley didn't do shit on this.

607
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:10,276
He did the scene, though.

608
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,844
This is Keeley we're talking about.

609
00:45:11,945 --> 00:45:14,004
Fucking Jay and his leaps of logic.

610
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:16,139
This case is nowhere near
anything we're doing.

611
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:18,012
So? Give it a shake or two anyhow.

612
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:20,177
-Make a sergeant happy.
-Whatever.

613
00:45:21,254 --> 00:45:23,051
Do you know Lester Freamon?

614
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:25,450
A little. Why?

615
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,618
He's with us on this Barksdale thing.

616
00:45:27,727 --> 00:45:29,388
I thought you said they gave you humps.

617
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:31,729
He looks like a hump,
he acts like a hump,

618
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:34,195
sittin' there, playing
with his toy furniture.

619
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:38,196
Jimmy, he makes more money off of
that shit than you do off of this job.

620
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:40,603
-Don't let Lester fool you.
-He did already.

621
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:42,470
Today in roll call, he showed something.

622
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,942
Hey, he's natural police.

623
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:46,770
He used to be Homicide.

624
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,278
-Why did he leave?
-Ask him.

625
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:55,579
-This is the one?
-Yup. Hasn't been rented since.

626
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,369
Fuck.

627
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:15,440
Motherfucker.

628
00:46:25,752 --> 00:46:27,344
Fucking fuck.

629
00:46:29,222 --> 00:46:30,587
Fuck.

630
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:38,592
Fuck.

631
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:47,729
What the fuck?

632
00:46:55,915 --> 00:46:57,109
Fuck.

633
00:47:04,557 --> 00:47:05,581
Fuck.

634
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:35,950
-No.
-Fuck.

635
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:47,224
Fuck it.

636
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:50,628
Fuck.

637
00:47:58,044 --> 00:47:59,807
Motherfuck.

638
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:07,344
Fuck.

639
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:24,865
Fuckity, fuck, fuck.

640
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:29,966
Fuck.

641
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:32,135
Fuck.

642
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,181
Motherfucker.

643
00:48:49,529 --> 00:48:50,996
Fuckin' A.

644
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,672
Fuck.

645
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:21,990
Check this.

646
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:24,295
Motherfucker.

647
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:28,764
Fuck me.

648
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:44,171
Sydnor's on foot, Carv's in the car...

649
00:50:44,477 --> 00:50:47,913
Herc, you need to be
on top of the roof behind Amity.

650
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:50,576
Again, I get the shit detail?

651
00:50:50,683 --> 00:50:52,674
The plan is to stay on D'Angelo.

652
00:50:52,852 --> 00:50:54,786
If we lose him, we lose him, right?

653
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:56,116
We're gonna lose him.

654
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:57,814
You can't follow people in the towers.

655
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,449
You can't hang in the low-rises
unless you got a reason.

656
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,290
Just to make sure,
we want to lose him, right?

657
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:04,954
Losin' him is good?

658
00:51:05,765 --> 00:51:06,789
Right.

659
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,795
Then why the fuck do this?

660
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:12,433
Come on, Herc.
Roll with me on this one, all right?

661
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:26,775
So, you're police after all.

662
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:31,423
You know what you doing,
but you ain't been doing it.

663
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:33,352
How long you been in the Pawnshop unit?

664
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:34,892
13 years and four months.

665
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:37,019
-13 years?
-And four months.

666
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:38,764
I gotta ask you...

667
00:51:39,198 --> 00:51:42,361
what exactly does a police officer assigned
to the Pawnshop unit do?

668
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:44,527
You intake reports
from registered pawnshops...

669
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:46,605
on all items valued over $50.

670
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:48,934
Then you make an index card for that item.

671
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:50,703
Then you file that index card.

672
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,711
If someone wants to find out
if something stolen was pawned...

673
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,110
we see if we have an index card.

674
00:51:55,214 --> 00:51:56,875
If we do, we do, if we don't, we don't.

675
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:59,213
-You did that for 13 years?
-And four months.

676
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:00,616
Why'd you ask out of Homicide?

677
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,846
Wasn't no ask about it.

678
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,286
You got the boot?

679
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:04,718
What'd you do to piss them off?

680
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:06,052
Police work.

681
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:09,959
I think I need to buy you a drink.

682
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:12,457
Just one?

683
00:52:13,866 --> 00:52:17,165
Caught this case in a Brooklyn home
in the summer of '87.

684
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:20,602
80-year-old woman, stabbed up...

685
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:23,642
nightgown, in bed,
forced window, rear entry.

686
00:52:24,577 --> 00:52:26,010
Worked it for a couple of weeks.

687
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:28,706
Got the names of two squirrels
over in Curtis Bay.

688
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,180
Squirrel number one gives it up...

689
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:33,047
and tries to put all the weight
on squirrel number two.

690
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:34,483
Back up the statements?

691
00:52:34,587 --> 00:52:36,578
Print it on the rear
window for number two...

692
00:52:36,689 --> 00:52:38,850
another one for number one
on the medicine chest.

693
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,425
So, it's down, yeah?

694
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:44,859
Even better when squirrel number one
drives it by the house...

695
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:46,556
where they fenced the old lady's shit:

696
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,861
clock-radio, TV, toaster oven.

697
00:52:49,802 --> 00:52:51,394
So, what's the problem?

698
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:53,538
The problem is the fence.

699
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:56,037
Turned out he was the son
of one of the big editors...

700
00:52:56,142 --> 00:52:57,666
over at the News America.

701
00:52:57,777 --> 00:52:59,711
This man is running
the afternoon newspaper...

702
00:52:59,812 --> 00:53:01,473
and his son is getting all fucked up...

703
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:04,550
doin' the dirt and getting high
down in Locust Point.

704
00:53:04,984 --> 00:53:07,885
The deputy, who I guess
is in a favor-doin' mood...

705
00:53:07,987 --> 00:53:09,249
sends word down to the major...

706
00:53:09,355 --> 00:53:12,654
I'm supposed to make
the case without the fence.

707
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,758
Just the print hits and the statement.
Play it like that.

708
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:18,023
So, he's doin' this for what?

709
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:19,928
To have some newspaper guy in his pocket?

710
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,762
Yeah, I guess so.

711
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,501
Is this Burrell?

712
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,807
No, no, Mueller. Deputy Ops before Burrell.

713
00:53:29,976 --> 00:53:31,443
So, what did you do?

714
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:34,041
What do you think I did?

715
00:53:34,447 --> 00:53:38,008
I charged him with receiving,
then had his ass testify.

716
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:41,883
You could've made the case without him.
Just on the prints and the statements.

717
00:53:41,988 --> 00:53:43,922
Probably, yup.

718
00:53:46,025 --> 00:53:47,617
Why didn't you?

719
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:49,358
Why?

720
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:54,725
Why are you fuckin' up yourself
chasing Avon Barksdale?

721
00:53:58,738 --> 00:54:01,605
A week after trial ends,
Major comes to me...

722
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,471
asks me where I want to go.

723
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,604
I tell him, I don't care,
I like to be outside, you know?

724
00:54:07,714 --> 00:54:08,874
Give me a goddamn foot-post...

725
00:54:08,981 --> 00:54:10,539
I'll still make my money, you know...

726
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,141
send my ass up to Edmondson Avenue,
I don't give a shit.

727
00:54:13,252 --> 00:54:14,514
You went to a foot-post?

728
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,589
Major come back,
asks me where I don't want to go.

729
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:21,260
And he asks it like
he wanna make sure I land okay.

730
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:24,995
So, I tell him, I don't want
no fuckin' paper-shuffle.

731
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:26,698
No office shit.

732
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:29,727
Send my black ass outside
and let me police somewhere.

733
00:54:29,836 --> 00:54:31,235
Pawnshop unit.

734
00:54:32,238 --> 00:54:33,967
They got me good.

735
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,437
So, why'd they let you out of the box?
Why now?

736
00:54:40,513 --> 00:54:42,811
I guess they just forgot about me.

737
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,012
Shit, Lester.

738
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:48,078
You back from the dead?

739
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:51,119
You rolled away the stone.

740
00:54:51,724 --> 00:54:55,626
Bunk Moreland says you're natural police.
One of the few.

741
00:54:56,896 --> 00:54:58,864
Yeah, I've had my moments.

742
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:03,399
Detective...

743
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:07,737
when they ask you where you wanna go...

744
00:55:08,107 --> 00:55:11,634
and they are gonna ask you
where you wanna go...

745
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:13,609
do yourself a favor...

746
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,548
keep your mouth shut.

747
00:55:19,218 --> 00:55:21,482
I gotta take a tinkle, boy.

748
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:25,123
-I got it.
-All right.

749
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:40,365
Hello.

750
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:46,306
-Is Kima there?
-And you are?

751
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:49,374
Tell her it's McNulty.

752
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:03,561
For you, Kima,
a decidedly confused white boy.

753
00:56:04,163 --> 00:56:05,425
God.

754
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:20,537
How'd it go today?

755
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,641
Lost him in the 221 .

756
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,615
Picked him back up in the low-rises...

757
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,347
and then lost him
on Schroeder Street after dark.

758
00:56:29,455 --> 00:56:30,888
Nicely done.

759
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:36,521
-Are you okay to drive?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

760
00:56:36,629 --> 00:56:39,325
I just wanted to thank you.

761
00:56:40,132 --> 00:56:41,121
For what?

762
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:44,135
For today, you know, with Daniels.

763
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:47,729
-You should be thanking Lester.
-I did.

764
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:51,105
I just wanted to thank you, too,
Detective Greggs.

765
00:56:54,146 --> 00:56:56,944
No problem. Good night.

766
00:56:57,049 --> 00:56:58,710
That it is.

767
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:10,522
What'd I miss?

768
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,763
Nothin' much.

769
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:14,528
Lovelorn?

770
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,791
Worse. Lonely.

771
00:57:20,573 --> 00:57:23,007
You didn't make it into class again today.

772
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:26,968
You said you'd stick with it.

773
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:28,410
I'm tryin'.

774
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:31,249
Things are hot right now.

775
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:34,712
I'm doing the best I can.

776
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:38,384
You said yourself,
you need to do somethin' else.

777
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,619
Somethin' better for us.

778
00:57:41,928 --> 00:57:43,452
You promised.

779
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:48,656
Man.

780
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:54,569
What am I gonna do with you?

781
00:57:55,841 --> 00:58:00,278
You know better women than you
have fallen for my tricks, right?

782
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:20,055
What have you got under this?
