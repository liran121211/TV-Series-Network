- Yeah.

Who are
the primaries?

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,446
Cole and Norris.

10
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:42,366
Cole's here and Norris
is at the hospital.

11
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,985
What do you need?

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,904
Room to work.

13
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:48,856
I keep ordering people
off the scene,

14
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,042
and between narcotics,
DEA and the two districts,

15
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,495
we keep collecting more
and more bodies around here.

16
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,882
Nobody move!

17
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:01,719
I said,
nobody fucking move!

18
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:05,506
If you have not been
assigned a specific task

19
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,007
by a homicide detective,

20
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:09,477
you need to step away
from this crime scene.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,681
Is there anybody doesn't
understand a direct order?

22
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,552
If you have not specifically
been instructed otherwise,

23
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:23,190
then remove your useless
interfering asses from the area.

24
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:26,577
Now!

25
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,366
Slow this thing down
to a crawl.

26
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,836
Give these bastards no chance
to fuck up in a meaningful way.

27
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:38,372
Okay.

28
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:40,174

Wedged all the way
to the back.

30
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:46,931
She couldn't
get to it.

31
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,549
Well, she taped it
up front,

32
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,684
but as soon as
she put any weight

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,436
on these
worn-ass car seats,

34
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:54,188
<i>they pulled</i>
<i>the tape off.</i>

35
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,724
Gun slid back behind the mesh
as they drove, probably.

36
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:59,109
Christ.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,147
Where was
her support?

38
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,098
There were
two follow cars,

39
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:06,600
they were several
blocks distant.

40
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,402
I think she got turned
around in the alleys,

41
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:10,771
she gave her 20
as the north side
of Warwick.

42
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,272
They went there
on the shots?

43
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,493
This, uh... Foxtrot
finally found her.

44
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,247
So, we had two units
covering the north side

45
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:21,882
and a helicopter
up on top.

46
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:24,668
And no one saw
any vehicles in flight.

75
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,456
She was throwing out 20s

76
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,125
Understood,
I'm just asking.

77
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,294
The link we have to this
is Savino Bratton.

78
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,330
A minor lieutenant
to our target, Barksdale.

79
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:07,831
I gave your people
all that at the scene.

80
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:10,000
And we're hitting
his last knowns.
We're on that.

81
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,502
The set-up
was more than him.

82
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:12,636
Casings are
different calibers,

83
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,638
and her Glock
was full up, so...

84
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:17,958
How bad?

85
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,394
Chest wound, no exit.
Through-and-through
to the throat.

86
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:21,478
She wasn't stabilized.

87
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,296
They had the pressure
pants on her.

88
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,765
Trying to push up
the pulse.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,567
They put those pants
on you, it ain't good.

90
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,603
Right.

91
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:32,573
So, you're on Baker

92
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,024
Where was the second car?

93
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,776
Um, Warwick, I think.

94
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,644
Okay. You've got everything
to the east well-covered

95
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,246

is the railbed.

96
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,197
What did Foxtrot see?

97
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,199
Nothing moving
except our units.

possible way.

106
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,975

115
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,424
It's not that the money
is anyone's primary concern.

116
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:42,559
I understand that.
I'm not going to be
standing here

117

118
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,647

119
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:48,398
I mean, Jesus,
this is awful.

120
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,684

Savino character quick--

121
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:52,853
Hey!

Can I get 18-12
up here?

180
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:33,606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

181
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,709
Yeah, yeah.

182

You're camped here.

185
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,800
Nobody touches this shit,
nobody even comes near it

186
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:45,752

does his recovery.

187

Whoa.

He stopped running.

190
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:03,820
Either he
got tired or--

191
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:06,523
- Or he got into a car.
- Right.

192
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:08,859

My people at the scene

201
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,552
Okay, we brought

You did a lot

You played a lot

Fuck if everybody in CID
doesn't know it.

But fuck if I'm gonna
stand here and say

244

No, it isn't, asshole.

248
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:48,468
Believe it or not,
everything isn't about you.

So you know
if it was on you,

252
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,028
I'd be the son of a bitch
to say so.

253
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,584
Shit went bad.

254
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,986
She took two

255
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:10,006

Ripples in the pond.

Talkin' ain't

277
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:08,565
Skin this cat

278
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,884
Two pages to Stringer
tonight, right?

279
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:15,188
Only this one
after the shooting.

<i>Who's 0-7?</i>

281
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,793

for Stringer to call him back?

282
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,787
- Shit went good,
but there was--
- Hold on.

283
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,205
Radio:
<i>...around 12:30</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

284

286
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,931
- All right, so talk.
- Like I said, it went good.

287
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,384
Except there was this bitch
curled up in the back-seat.

288
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,586
- Surprised
the shit out of us.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:48,921
Didn't even see her
till the shit popped off.

290
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,807
I mean, and if it
was up to me,

291
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:53,760
I'd let the girl walk.
She didn't look like
the talkin' type.

292
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,945
But Little Man
seen her,

293
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:57,430
and bugged out,
let a couple go.

294
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,315
Savino didn't tip y'all
off to that bitch?

295
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,618
Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car,

296
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,936
we see him go up the block
like we said, right?

297
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:06,122
After that,
he out of sight

298
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,374
and we bring it home
like we planned, baby.

299
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,743
Well, shorty was a cop.

300
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,081
And she ain't dead.

<i>Where'd y'all</i>

302
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,223
She wasn't no cop, man.

303
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:24,974
She look like
one of Orlando's ho's.

304

Bey, where the fuck
are the guns?

305

A storm drain off
of Park Heights, man.

306
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,399
What the fuck is wrong
with Little Man?

307
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:34,984
I mean, this motherfucker
bugged out one time.

308
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,319
Well, he gonna
bug out again,

309
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:37,854
when he find out
shorty's a fuckin' cop?

310
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,972
I mean, c'mon, man.

311
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:42,409
Savino got a story that
he can keep to and he know it,

312
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:45,311
but Little Man, he always
been fuckin' weak like that.

313
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,530
Little Man gotta go.

<i>Yo, you hear me?</i>

Yo, this shit
gonna get real heavy.

316
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,674
You understand me, Bey?
We gotta fall back.

317
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,176
I wanna see how it go
with this Savino bullshit,

318
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,345
see how they
go past that.

319
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,130
But if the shit
don't hold,

320
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,217
or if this motherfuckin' cop
wake up and start talkin' shit,

know for sure.

346
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:53,039
Lieutenant?

347
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:56,492
I'm sitting over there
with Kima's girl and,

348
00:18:56,545 --> 00:19:00,129
I mean, maybe somebody
from the department
or the city,

349
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,664
maybe might want
to say something.

350
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:03,750
Who's here
from the family?

351
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:05,835
- A daughter, you say?
- A daughter?

352
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,805
Officer Greggs
has a girl?

353
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:13,760
A roommate.

354
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:16,846
The family's in Richmond,
driving up first thing today,

355
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,399
but the roommate's
already here.

356
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:37,033
I'll do it myself.

357
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:42,205
No problem.
If we lose her,

358
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,290
he can always pose
for the funeral.

359
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,353
Still need a right door
for Savino.

360
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:50,406
His last knowns,
his girlfriend, his mama,
all empty holes.

361
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,609
Tracers picked up a couple
hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.

362
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:56,663
So, either these motherfuckers
are a pair of neighborhood yo's

363
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:59,749
who lucked into $30,000
on a street stickup or...

364
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:03,119
Or they're pros
who set up in an alley

365
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:05,421
on one side of the tracks,
then slip over to
the other side

366
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,373
where they park
their ride.

367
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:09,092
What about the post?

368
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:12,295
Cause and manner of death
on Mr. Blocker is homicide,

369
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:15,247
to wit, close-range GSWs
to the shoulder,

370
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,883
chest and left arm.

371
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:19,018
Nine millimeter,
six left twist,

372
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:20,770
<i>suitable</i>
<i>for comparison.</i>

373
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:23,389
We pulled something
different from the back seat
of the car, right?

374
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:25,441
Yeah, 380,
semi-jacketed.

375
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:26,859
Casings were
different, too.

376
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:28,444
So, we confirmed
the two shooters.

377
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,645
Print hit.

378
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,532
Wynton "Little Man" Rice,
enforcer in the 221,

379
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,484
a definite connect
to Barksdale's world.

380
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:37,370
- A print hit?
- Print hit from what?

381
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,605
Soda can.

382
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:41,908
Dropped at the pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere.

383
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:44,577
<i>Still had a little fizz</i>
<i>in it when I got there.</i>

384
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:47,330
What the fuck is this pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere?

385
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:49,582
It's a phone from which some
motherfucker paged Stringer Bell

386
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:51,167
20 minutes
after the shooting.

387
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:53,636
I dusted the phone, too,
but it was smudged.

388
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:58,057
So, we got a Barksdale pro
in the northwest,

389
00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:01,127
ringing up the boss
minutes after the deed.

390
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:03,296
So much for
the amateur-hour theory.

391
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:05,348
Good pull.
You are?

392
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,350
Freamon,
Lester Freamon.

393
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,736
Where you workin'?

394
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:11,654
Pawn shop unit.

395
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:17,693
I mean, how you gonna
shoot a police, yo?

396
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:20,580
Ain't no percentage in that,
you know what I'm sayin'?

397
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:21,948
For real.

398
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,499
Somebody around here
do that shit,

399
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:25,201
you know every knocko
in the world be down here,

400
00:22:25,253 --> 00:22:26,652
bustin' heads.

401
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:28,704
I guess them
Park Heights nigga's

402
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:31,007
just ain't got
no fuckin' common sense.

403
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,176
A lotta heart,
just no sense.

404
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:35,128
Hey, yo, Poot.

405
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,013
Wallace on
the phone, yo.

406
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:39,165
- Yeah?
- Wallace?

407
00:22:39,184 --> 00:22:41,267
Nigga ring me up
twice a day

408
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:42,885
whether he got shit
to say or not.

409
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:45,104
Homesick motherfucker
makin' me bug, yo.

410
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,773
Yo, where's he at, yo?

411
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:50,109
At the shore
with his grandma,
down there...

412
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:53,896
Probably surfin' or
some bullshit.

413
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:56,566
<i>Or something.</i>

414
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:59,986
P.A. system:
<i>Dr. Zellesky, you have</i>
<i>a call on line five.</i>

415
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:03,039
<i>Dr. Zellesky, you have</i>
<i>a call on line five.</i>

416
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:09,545
<i>(pager beeping)</i>

417
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:28,681
(tires screeching)

418
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:34,937
You just
use that phone?

419
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:36,656
Yeah, a little
earlier, man.

420
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:37,857
Y'all might wanna go
to Mosher Street.

421
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:40,293
- Just now, you used it?
- Yeah.

422
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,697
Man downtown
needs to talk to you.

423
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:45,915
Man downtown?

424
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,367
Okay, make some sense
for me, please, all right?

425
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:49,869
I ain't been so clean
in my whole damn life.

426
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:52,088
- Look, man,
I'm just doin' my job.
- Okay.

427
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:00,429
What up,
Mr. Beachfront Property?

428
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:02,598
Wallace:
<i>Naw, fool, I told you,</i>
<i>I'm bayside.</i>

429
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:04,183
<i>My grandmother</i>
<i>on the bayside.</i>

430
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:06,686
Still, man, you on vacation
and not bringin' me with you.

431
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,638
<i>How you get all the way</i>
<i>down there, anyhow?</i>

432
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,422
- I took a bus.
-<i> Well, shit.</i>

433
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:12,225
<i>Tell me how to go</i>
<i>and I grab a 'Hound, too.</i>

434
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,310
<i>Come down there</i>
<i>and hang with your ass.</i>

435
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:16,946
No, man,
it ain't like that, yo.
The air down here all sticky.

436
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:18,231
Worse than Baltimore, yo.

437
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:21,651
<i>And these crickets,</i>
<i>louder than a motherfucker.</i>

438
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:23,152
<i>Can't get no sleep.</i>

439
00:24:23,204 --> 00:24:25,872
I don't think I'm cut out
to be no country-ass nigga, man.

440
00:24:25,907 --> 00:24:29,709
Operator:
<i>Please deposit $2 for</i>
<i>an additional...</i>

441
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:32,211
- Shit, I gotta go.
-<i> You can take a nigga</i>
<i>up out the Westside,</i>

442
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:34,714
- but you can't take--
-<i> (dial tone)</i>

443
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:04,610
What's your name?

444
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:08,414
Look, I didn't
do shit here, okay?

445
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:11,867
I asked you your name.

446
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,003
Naw, this shit
ain't right.

447
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:15,855
Who'd you try to page,
shitbird?

448
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,707
Why the fuck
do you care, okay?

449
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,292
I mean...

450
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:23,662
you have exactly
three more seconds

451
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:26,048
to explain yourself
to me, asshole.

452
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:31,837
One shooter definitely
opened the passenger door,

453
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:33,606
so any latent prints
from that side of the car.

454
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:35,191
-<i> I didn't do nothing, man!</i>
- (thumping)

455
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:38,527
- Why'd you
page her, shitbird?!
- Get off me, man!

456
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:40,446
- Get off me!
- You think this
is a fucking game?!

457
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:41,864
I wanna talk
to Detective Greggs.

458
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:44,150
- You can't, motherfucker.
- Then, McNulty then.

459
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:46,485
This shit
ain't right, sir!

460
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:56,528
<i>Savino, Savino.</i>

461
00:25:56,547 --> 00:25:58,547
Mope ain't around.

462
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:06,372
(dialing, ringing)

463
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:09,375
Yeah, one of them
low-rise hopper's
on tower phone two.

464
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:11,310
Okay.

465
00:26:16,484 --> 00:26:19,602
(camera clicking)

466
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:23,739
Maybe he forgot
the number.

467
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,600
<i>(camera clicking)</i>

468
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:38,704
What the fuck was that?

469
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:40,572
You don't know?

470
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,876
We just caught a re-up
off a tower stash.

471
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:46,045
Fourth floor, south side,
second unit down.

472
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,631
(dialing, ringing)

473
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:53,352
Daniels:
<i>Put that away.</i>

474
00:26:56,974 --> 00:27:00,726
Put that away
and work the case.

475
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:03,179
Can I ask you something?

476
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,740
How much of this case would
you give up to get her back?

477
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:17,043
That's not the point.

478
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,978
<i>Well, how much?</i>

479
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,847
All of it.

480
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:24,533
But it doesn't
work that way.

481
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,535
You can't give it back.

482
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:33,392
I'm sitting here with
a hospital progress report

483
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:35,528
that shows
no fucking progress.

484
00:27:35,563 --> 00:27:38,531
<i>She's not conscious,</i>
<i>she's intubated.</i>

485
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:39,982
<i>She's had a trach</i>
<i>and a lung collapse,</i>

486
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:41,767
and if she's got
a shred of luck,

487
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:44,387
the shot she took
to the neck didn't
catch any spine.

488
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:48,274
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

489
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:50,776
It wasn't worth it.

490
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:56,582
Homicide for McNulty
on line two.

491
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:09,095
Do your job.

492
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,673
Yeah?

493
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:23,459
Bunk:
<i>So how you doing</i>
<i>with it?</i>

494
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,111
I'll live.

495
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:26,946
Yeah?

496
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:28,731
Well, listen, Jimmy,

497
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:32,067
we had a little
dust-up over here.

498
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,522
Holley mighta beat one of
your girl's CIs on spec.

499
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:39,041
What is he,
a short guy?

500
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:40,359
Mumbles a lot?

501
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:42,378
<i>Yeah, that's him.</i>

502
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:44,713
<i>You might wanna roll past</i>
<i>and squelch this shit</i>

503
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:46,632
<i>before it gets outta hand.</i>

504
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,834
Yeah.

505
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:56,675
- It ain't worth it, man.
- Naw.

506
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,394
It ain't worth it
at 10 times the price.

507
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:00,095
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!

508
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:02,264
How stupid
is this motherfucker?!

509
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:04,383
If you see a bitch
in the car, change it up.

510
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:06,735
We can go to Orlando
another fuckin' day.

511
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:08,220
Savino say
he was tryin' to signal,

512
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,688
but he in the dark,
he don't know
where Bey's at,

513
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:10,940
or where
they comin' from.

514
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:12,575
Nothin' breakin'
our way, man, damn.

515
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,909
We gotta
burn this shit.

516
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:16,228
This is cop money,
it's probably marked somehow.

517
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:18,897
The guns are in the sewer,
Bey's a rock, so that's cool.

518
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:21,283
But it's the bitch cop.
If she wake up
and start talkin',

519
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:23,252
she gonna put Little Man
in there, Bey in there.

520
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:26,038
- What up with Little Man?
- He's scared.

521
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:27,873
- He shot a cop.
- Fuck.

522
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:29,625
But I put Bey on that.

523
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:33,128
What about Savino?

524
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,630
Well, Savino,
he gotta eat the charge,

525
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:35,965
but he knew that.

526
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:38,684
So if he keep
his story tight,
he gonna be all right.

527
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:41,437
Yeah, we knew Orlando was
a snitchin' motherfucker, man.

528
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:43,722
Fuck him, but this cash
got us caught up.

529
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:46,141
I know, man,
that's my fault, man.

530
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:48,777
Bey and Savino came to me
with the idea that, yo,

531
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:51,697
if they take Orlando,
they can take the cash, too.

532
00:29:51,732 --> 00:29:53,732
I was like, all right,
y'all get your payday.

533
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:56,952
Yo, how the fuck is Orlando
gonna front this type of cash?

534
00:29:56,988 --> 00:29:58,904
<i>What it say?</i>

535
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,873
I know, I know.

536
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:02,291
I fucked up, I know.

537
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:06,879
A'ight, take this trash
outside, fuckin' burn it.

538
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:10,382
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up
the mess before he jet.

539
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:19,225
He was throwin' 911
messages to her pager.

540
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,143
I asked him why,

541
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:22,895
he raised up.

542
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,231
Shit got outta hand.

543
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:30,352
- Does he know?
- Uh-uh.

544
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:33,489
Bubbs:
<i>Hey, McNulty, man.</i>

545
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:35,190
<i>What they doin'</i>
<i>over there, man?</i>

546
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:36,808
<i>It's fucked up,</i>
<i>they beatin' on me.</i>

547
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:40,329
Last night,
she got shot.

548
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:42,031
Bubbs:
<i>Where the fuck</i>
<i>were you at?</i>

549
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:45,034
- Where were you?
- I was there.

550
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:49,305
Hey, Bunk.

551
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,758
We got no good latents
on the passenger side door.

552
00:30:55,096 --> 00:30:56,762
What about the dash?

553
00:30:56,797 --> 00:31:00,015
Call the lab.

554
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:06,021
So, what can I do?

555
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:09,892
Well, for one thing you can
roll around the projects,

556
00:31:09,944 --> 00:31:12,844
see who's missing.
Who ain't around.

557
00:31:12,863 --> 00:31:15,481
You okay with that?

558
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:18,534
Yeah, yeah,
I just, um...

559
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:21,654
I been keepin' it
kinda close, you know?

560
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:24,373
Ain't been around
the projects much lately,

561
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:25,908
you know
what I'm sayin'?

562
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,294
You beefin' with
someone down there?

563
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:30,362
Naw.

564
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:32,498
No, I'm not
beefin' with...

565
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,840
<i>Eyes open, Bubbs.</i>

566
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:44,593
For Kima.

567
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:47,146
Hang loose,
I'll get you a ride.

568
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:52,851
Where are we
with Savino?

569
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:54,069
Still MIA.

570
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:56,221
Enough of
this bullshit.

571
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:59,224
Well, if he calls me
for anything,

572
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:00,943
I'll tell him
to turn himself in.

573
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:02,227
You know
I'm going to do that.

574
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:04,563
- Not good enough.
- Excuse me?

575
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:06,415
We need him now.

576
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:10,035
No, thanks.

577
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,954
Perhaps as
an officer of the court,

578
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:14,139
-<i> you could endeavor to--</i>
-<i> Ronnie's being polite.</i>

579
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,291
She's a member of your
twisted little tribe,

580
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:18,677
so she's putting it into
your twisted little language.

581
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:21,246
Me? I wouldn't wipe my ass
with a Baltimore lawyer,

582
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:24,099
no offense.

583
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:26,268
None taken.

584
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:28,920
I mean, I'm willing
to let you little ratfuckers
suborn perjury,

585
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:30,422
<i>and blow smoke up</i>
<i>a judge's ass</i>

586
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:32,591
<i>and jury-tamper</i>
<i>your balls off</i>

587
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,727
without losing the slightest
bit of my sunny disposition.

588
00:32:34,762 --> 00:32:36,612
<i>And fuck me</i>
<i>if I don't let you</i>

589
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:39,264
<i>structure your cash</i>
<i>into briefcase fees, either.</i>

590
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:40,716
<i>That's between you</i>
<i>and the IRS.</i>

591
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,785
And neither one of you
is anybody's friend, right?

592
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,605
I think what Jimmy
is trying to say is--

593
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:49,274
No, what Jimmy is saying is
if you want me to keep my nose
closed to your shit,

594
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:51,810
then you're gonna have to
throw me something
when I need it,

595
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:54,380
and right now
I need Savino Bratton
in bracelets.

596
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:57,416
I don't know
where he is.

597
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,451
Well, you repped him
the last four felonies.

598
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,920
I'm guessing you can get word
to him if you want to.

599
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:07,959
A police may die, Maury,
and Savino was there.

600
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:10,095
<i>He comes in</i>
<i>this afternoon</i>

601
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,130
he takes the drug charge
at least.

602
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:15,184
Or what?

603
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,986
Or we send tactical
teams into his momma's
house every night,

604
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:21,023
till there's no house
left to worry about.

605
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:23,158
And you get a target
letter from the state's
attorney's office,

606
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:25,694
followed by subpoenas for
every fucking bank account

607
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:28,747
in your fucking name
and let's see if all
those cash deposits

608
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:30,399
match the reported income.

609
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,953
I'm hearing this
from him,

610
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:37,823
and I understand
that he's distraught.

611
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:39,491
I understand that.

612
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:42,961
<i>Am I hearing this from</i>
<i>the state's attorney's</i>
<i>office as well?</i>

613
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,767
You are.

614
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:52,838
I'll see
what I can do.

615
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:56,775
Fuck you, Jimmy!

616
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:58,811
You didn't tell me
that was coming.

617
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:00,345
He'll bring him in.

618
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:02,397
He will if he can,
that's not the point.

619
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,732
Well, what's the point?

620
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:06,118
The point is that Maury Levy
is a past officer

621
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,703
of the Monumental
Bar Association,

622
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:11,022
and unless I want
to spend my whole life
as a fucking ASA,

623
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,242
I can't spend my afternoons
pissing on people who matter.

624
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:15,494
Another career
in the balance.

625
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:20,198
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

626
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:23,669
If only half you
motherfuckers in the state's
attorney's office

627
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:25,220
<i>didn't want</i>
<i>to be judges,</i>

628
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:27,306
didn't want to be partners
in some downtown law firm,

629
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:29,758
if half of you had the fucking
balls to follow through,

630
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,310
you know
what would happen?

631
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:33,562
A guy like that
would be indicted,
tried and convicted.

632
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:35,314
And the rest of 'em
would back up enough

633
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:37,683
so we could push
a clean case or two
through your courthouse.

634
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:40,719
But no,
everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.

635
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:43,489
And everybody's got
a fucking future.

636
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:46,575
You'll just use anyone,
won't you?

637
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:57,035
So, I've been
searchin' the logs

638
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,838
for pager hits that used
an 0-7 code, right?

639
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:02,374
It comes up now and then
on D'Angelo's pager.

640
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,543
Stringer's too,
but less often.

641
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:07,078
Most of the time,
there's nothing
to place the guy,

642
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:09,214
but check it.

643
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:12,601
And this is
on Stringer's page?

644
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:15,086
It comes back to the pay
phone in the emergency room

645
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:16,638
at Maryland
General Hospital.

646
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,256
Let me guess.

647
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:21,443
The date of this page
is the same day that
Stinkum got killed.

648
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:23,962
And Wee-Bey
got shot in the leg.

649
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,398
That was the talk
on the wire, anyway.

650
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:27,950
You go
to Maryland General

651
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:29,768
and pull the ER records
for that morning,

652
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:31,486
you're gonna find
Wee-Bey in the pile.

653
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:35,107
0-7 is Wee-Bey,
it's gotta be.

654
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:39,110
And we have Wee-Bey
and Little Man

655
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:40,712
at the pay phone
at Park Heights

656
00:35:40,748 --> 00:35:42,497
20 minutes
after the ambush

657
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,384
<i>throwing a page</i>
<i>to Stringer.</i>

658
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:49,087
<i>We're all over town for</i>
<i>this piece-of-shit Savino.</i>

659
00:35:49,122 --> 00:35:51,223
With ties to
the Barksdale organization?

660
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:53,559
- Yes, sir.
-<i> What else?</i>

661
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:55,894
Well, the case
is progressing.

662
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,014
We're starting to glean
some possible shooters
from the wiretap.

663
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,016
You know, I asked
for the controlled buy.

664
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:03,769
I put one of our people
in harm's way.

665
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:07,706
So right now
I want to make sure that
we are doing<i> everything.</i>

666
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,274
We are, sir.
We're on it.

667
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:12,027
<i>Good. The commissioner</i>
<i>wants raids citywide.</i>

668
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,478
Every door
we can take.

669
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,030
Any addresses
we can write on.

670
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:17,499
Anything connected
to a narcotics case.

671
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:20,168
<i>CID, Tactical,</i>
<i>the DEUs,</i>

672
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:22,504
and tomorrow
on the 6:00 news,

673
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:26,008
we put a lot of fucking
dope on the table.

674
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:27,593
<i>A lot of it!</i>

675
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:29,761
Dope on the table?

676
00:36:29,797 --> 00:36:32,180
We need to let them
know who we are.

677
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:35,634
We can't for
one minute let them
think that this will stand.

678
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:41,056
The commissioner wants
to send a message, Lieutenant.

679
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:43,675
You make sure you
and your people

680
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:46,945
do everything possible
to see that it is heard.

681
00:36:55,188 --> 00:36:57,189
Dope on
the damn table.

682
00:36:57,224 --> 00:37:00,459
Hey, it's like
the man said.

683
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:01,994
We're letting them
know who we are.

684
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:03,629
Yeah?

685
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:05,297
And who the hell
are we?

686
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:13,889
Again, for the record,

687
00:37:13,924 --> 00:37:15,707
let's make clear
that Mr. Bratton

688
00:37:15,726 --> 00:37:17,843
has not been Mirandized
and that what is said

689
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:20,062
at this juncture is for
purposes of a proffer.

690
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:22,213
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

691
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:24,433
Okay, then.

692
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:26,435
Here you go.

693
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,693
<i>That's baking soda.</i>

694
00:37:34,728 --> 00:37:38,113
Which Mr. Bratton intended
to sell to Orlando Blocker.

695
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:39,581
You can keep it
with our compliments.

696
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:42,000
Where's the money?

697
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,919
Mr. Bratton did not
receive money.

698
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:47,506
He left it in the car
when he went to retrieve
the sham cocaine.

699
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,374
<i>If you were recording</i>
<i>the transaction,</i>

700
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:50,625
<i>the tape will</i>
<i>confirm this.</i>

701
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:52,911
And he wasn't around
for the shooting either.

702
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,746
In fact, he doesn't know
who the shooters are.

703
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:57,182
Jay:
<i>And God knows he wasn't</i>
<i>in on the setup.</i>

704
00:37:57,217 --> 00:37:59,584
I mean, it was pure dumb
luck that he left them

705
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:02,721
in an dead-end alley
and they were shot-to-shit
just two minutes later.

706
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:06,141
This is bullshit!
A police is down.

707
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Mr. Bratton
had no knowledge

708
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:11,697
that the young woman
was a police officer.

709
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:14,032
And no intention
of doing anything

710
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:17,536
other than defrauding
Mr. Blocker of $30,000.

711
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,372
Ms. Nathan?

712
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,793
No charge if he gives
us the shooters.

713
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:27,779
And if he testifies,
we'll find a way
to squeeze him

714
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,881
<i>into the federal</i>
<i>witness program.</i>

715
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:34,252
As I indicated,
Mr. Bratton has no idea
who shot Mr. Blocker

716
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:36,638
or the undercover officer.

717
00:38:38,976 --> 00:38:41,343
Best you can do
is 286-B.

718
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:44,312
What the hell
is that?

719
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:47,099
Distribution of sham CDS,
three year maximum,

720
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:48,567
$5,000 fine.

721
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:50,352
That's it?

722
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:53,355
If he took the cash,
we could go to felony
theft or fraud,

723
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:56,875
but the tape has him
leaving the money.

724
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,477
Three years.

725
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:01,329
A cop was shot, Maury.

726
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:03,749
So if we convict,
he'll do every damn day
of the three.

727
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:07,002
I can do the three,
ain't no thing.

728
00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:09,371
Bunk:
<i>And the $5,000 fine?</i>

729
00:39:09,423 --> 00:39:12,040
Oh, shit,
you still up 25, right?

730
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:23,018
Nicely done.

731
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,558
Gimme two, yo.

732
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:02,307
<i>(radio playing)</i>

733
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:06,211
Damn, Orlando, yo.

734
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,513
I still can't
believe that shit.

735
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:11,733
Man, all this shit
behind this motherfucker.

736
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:13,268
Who the fuck was he?

737
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,770
He ran a club
for my uncle, yo.

738
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,239
Yeah?

739
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:19,724
Yeah, first Stink,
and now him.

740
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:22,694
Yeah, man, and I heard
the cop's been all in
Savino's shit, too.

741
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:25,580
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man, neither.

742
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:28,250
Somebody could get
to cleanin' up shit
around here.

743
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:32,704
True. You can't just
be goin' around, droppin'
five-O like that, yo.

744
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,590
You know how your uncle
is when people get to
fuckin' up, man.

745
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:38,009
He start takin'
that shit personal, man.

746
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:41,579
Look like a couple more
nigga's gonna get dropped.

747
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:43,181
- Yo, what up?
-<i> You Dee?</i>

748
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:44,599
Yeah.

749
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:47,135
They sayin' you need to get
with Stringer, right away, yo.

750
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:52,757
See? You movin' up
in the world.

751
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:56,111
As long as you don't fall in
with the trash they takin' out.

752
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:58,263
Yeah, whatever, nigga.

753
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:00,598
I'll be right back.

754
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:03,235
<i>Tower boys</i>
<i>all nervous and shit.</i>

755
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,570
Little Man
ain't post for work.

756
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:07,706
Ain't answerin'
his page, neither.

757
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:10,942
See?

758
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:12,794
I'm not gonna lie.

759
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:15,947
She's got swelling
around the vertebrae
from a through-and-through,

760
00:41:15,966 --> 00:41:18,550
and some indications
of partial paralysis.

761
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:20,835
That might go away
when the swelling goes down.

762
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:22,337
And it might not either.

763
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:23,972
Her family
is with her.

764
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:25,924
What the fuck is up
with homicide?

765
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:27,842
Are we on
the shooters yet?

766
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:29,728
They're working it hard.

767
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,014
The departmental response
is gonna be to take doors

768
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:34,733
tomorrow morning.
Citywide.

769
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:37,569
Every unit, every district
is kicking in

770
00:41:37,604 --> 00:41:39,487
<i>any drug-connected address</i>
<i>they can write on.</i>

771
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:41,323
<i>We're gonna</i>
<i>do the same.</i>

772
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:42,607
Lieutenant, is that--

773
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:43,975
Except...

774
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:46,094
we're gonna hold back
on the main stash,

775
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,947
<i>the house up in northwest</i>
<i>we tracked off the wire.</i>

776
00:41:48,982 --> 00:41:51,983
For one thing,
we advance this case more
by sitting on that location.

777
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,419
<i>For another,</i>
<i>raids that are too much</i>
<i>on the bulls-eye</i>

778
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:56,254
<i>will have Barksdale</i>
<i>changing up.</i>

779
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,007
We might blow
the wire altogether.

780
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,293
We got two addresses
in the low-rises

781
00:42:01,328 --> 00:42:04,095
that are probables,
and another two rowhouses
off the avenue

782
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,048
that have been used for stash
as recently as last week.

783
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,883
But this...

784
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:11,836
this here is the best bet
for a good rip.

785
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:14,556
Herc picked up
on it yesterday.

786
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:17,392
Fourth-floor,

787
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:19,561
end unit on the south side
of the 221.

788
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:21,846
They're droppin' the re-ups
out the window

789
00:42:21,865 --> 00:42:23,365
to the hoppers
who run it off.

790
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,783
What if they change up
the apartment?

791
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:26,684
Well, they do that
every day.

792
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,620
Yesterday was the fifth floor
on the north side.

793
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:31,356
We're gonna have
a man on the church
watching with a cellphone.

794
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,575
They change up,
we call the duty judge

795
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:36,077
who orally
amends the warrant.

796
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:38,213
We hit everything
at 1100 hours.

797
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:42,083
But the squad
that takes the high-rise
needs to stage at 0500.

798
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:44,552
We need to be inside before
the building even wakes up.

799
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:47,222
Anyone who wants
to sleep tonight,

800
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:49,975
he needs to start typing
his ass off right now.

801
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:54,729
What's up?

802
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:57,382
Why ain't
the club open?

803
00:42:57,401 --> 00:42:59,017
You goin' with Bey.

804
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:01,770
Hey, yo, Bey.

805
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,024
<i>Keep it clean.</i>
<i>Don't make no mistakes.</i>

806
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:17,752
Goin' where?

807
00:43:17,788 --> 00:43:20,455
What the fuck you
waitin' for?

808
00:43:36,756 --> 00:43:39,224
(muffled talking)

809
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:48,700
Stop bullshittin' me!

810
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:07,952
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.

811
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:10,088
He knows
we held it back.

812
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:12,173
The deputy.

813
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:15,427
We grab a senator's
bag man in the projects,
he knows that.

814
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:17,762
State police come in here
with a cooperator,
he knows that, too.

815
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:20,515
- It's like
fucking clockwork.
- He's got a rat.

816
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:22,567
Here, in the detail.

817
00:44:27,824 --> 00:44:29,624
In the beginning,

818
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:31,326
when we started,
Burrell had me.

819
00:44:31,361 --> 00:44:34,028
I pipelined everything
to that motherfucker.

820
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:36,748
- But now...
- He lost you.

821
00:44:36,783 --> 00:44:39,617
So now he's picked up
someone else.

822
00:44:39,652 --> 00:44:41,786
That's how they do.

823
00:44:46,326 --> 00:44:48,893
(chattering)

824
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:07,862
(laughing)

825
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:11,449
Can we talk?

826
00:45:11,485 --> 00:45:13,868
Excuse me a moment,
gentlemen.

827
00:45:16,623 --> 00:45:18,523
It's Burrell, he's gotta
back off already.

828
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:19,958
What now?

829
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:21,576
We're on
a prime location.

830
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:23,161
Barksdale's stash.

831
00:45:23,196 --> 00:45:24,996
Instead of sitting on it
and making cases off it,

832
00:45:25,031 --> 00:45:26,464
he wants us
to write a paper
and take the door.

833
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,917
- Why?
- Dope on the table.

834
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:30,418
It's a photo op
to make us all feel better

835
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,170
about Kima Greggs
catching a bullet or two.

836
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:34,305
Oh, Christ.

837
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:36,707
You need to rip him
a new one, Your Honor.

838
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:38,309
Uh...

839
00:45:38,345 --> 00:45:40,178
I don't know, Jimmy.

840
00:45:42,899 --> 00:45:45,183
You back on
the ticket, huh?

841
00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:50,221
<i>It was just</i>
<i>the usual bullshit.</i>

842
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:55,076
They're just, um,
dickin' me around,

843
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:57,195
trying to get another
black face on the ticket,

844
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,664
make it four-and-one
to even up for the last time.

845
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:01,699
<i>The governor had to promise</i>
<i>two new appointments,</i>

846
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:04,035
so now we're back
where we were.

847
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,920
That's all it was.

848
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,706
That's all?

849
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:11,626
