1
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:11,907
Low man scrapped, yo.
He all the way down.

2
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,974
But we going to start fresh
on the latest tomorrow...

3
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:18,486
-down from up North.
-No problem.

4
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:21,954
-No problem?
-Yeah, yo's talkin' about some guy...

5
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,958
named Lohman, who's down with strep...

6
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:27,689
-Iike he's sick.
-And the last part?

7
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,865
And the last part is something about
how he's gonna start up...

8
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,161
a Fashion Lady or some shit.

9
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:34,597
-Fashion Lady?
-I'm fluent in the Perkins Homes...

10
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:37,537
and Latrobe Tower dialects,
but I haven't quite mastered...

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,607
the Franklin Terrace.

12
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,801
He's saying they're sold out
in the low-rises...

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,504
so tomorrow they're gonna
start fresh with a new package.

14
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:45,808
-That's what you hear?
-Listen again.

15
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:50,579
-Low man scrapped, yo.
-Low man, meaning the low-rise pit.

16
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:56,183
-He all the way down.
-Is down to scraps on the last package.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,458
But we going start fresh
on the latest tomorrow...

18
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:00,654
down from up North.

19
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:03,095
Tomorrow, he'll start
fresh on the latest package.

20
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,826
Damn, how you all hear it so good?

21
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:07,402
"Gold Coast slave ship
bound for cotton fields...

22
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:09,495
"sold in a market down in New Orleans."

23
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:10,628
What the fuck is that?

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,573
Rolling Stones.
First two lines to Brown Sugar.

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,806
I bet you've heard that song 500 times,
but you never knew, right?

26
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:21,907
I used to put my head to the stereo speaker
and play that record over and over.

27
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,553
That explains a lot, actually.

28
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:30,959
-So, wait on black, yo?
-What's white on black?

29
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:34,229
Wait on black, right?
Even I heard that shit.

30
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:38,797
Black's code for Stinkum.
We picked that up once we got on his pager.

31
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:42,564
Now, there's gonna be a re-up of
four G-packs in the low-rise court.

32
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:45,936
Stinkum is on the re-up
and it's gonna go down around noon.

33
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,509
Are you sure about all that?

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,621
Turn it upside down.

35
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:11,596
Four hash marks in a row,
one for each G-pack...

36
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,628
"LO" for low-rises.

37
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,528
-1 2 for the time.
-"S" for Stinkum.

38
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:23,740
-How long to figure that out?
-Four or five hours.

39
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:27,806
You sit here looking at beeper messages
for five hours at a time?

40
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:30,812
I don't know, it's kinda
fun figuring shit out.

41
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:10,644
You're not helping me out here, Sanny.

42
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,415
-Major, l--
-I ask you for one fucking thing....

43
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:16,287
-I know, but I don't--
-All these months, I'm carrying you.

44
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:19,486
I'm sitting here, watching case
after case stack up, right?

45
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:23,264
These are all yours,
and they're all open, Sanny.

46
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,798
Last year, your clearance rate was 40%.
This year, it's less than that.

47
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:31,605
I caught some tough ones.
There's not a lot of dunkers in there.

48
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,701
Mike, you're good on the dunkers.
I'll give you that.

49
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:39,009
Shit, comes to dunkers,
you solve probably 6, 7 out of 10.

50
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:42,947
-But a stone fucking whodunit?
-That's not a fair assessment, Major.

51
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:45,782
Fair? What the fuck is fair?

52
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:49,686
I got a detective out there, unsupervised,
running his own special ops unit...

53
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,760
burning me every chance he gets.

54
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:53,954
It's not my job to fuck another cop.

55
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:57,222
Not your job?

56
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:02,303
Tell you what, Detective.
I'm gonna be so fucking fair...

57
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:03,963
I'm gonna give you the choice.

58
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:08,769
Either bring me something on McNulty,
or go out there and do your job.

59
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,412
-Pick a file, any file.
-Major--

60
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,210
Pick a murder and solve it...

61
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,580
or bring me McNulty,
there's no third choice.

62
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:28,854
Stinkum will have a runner with him.
The runner's gonna be holding the package.

63
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:32,401
-When you get them, ride the bumper.
-So he knows we're there?

64
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:36,563
Right. Lay on the blue light if you
need it. Now, the runner's gonna bolt.

65
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,800
-I got the runner, you stay with Stinkum.
-No.

66
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,899
-I got the runner, he takes Stink?
-No.

67
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,673
You both take the runner.

68
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,213
-And Stink gets away?
-Nobody gets away.

69
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:49,115
If we pull in Stink on a car stop now,
we got to give up PC...

70
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,379
which means we got to give up the wire.

71
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,320
We didn't set all this up
for two days' worth of coke, did we?

72
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:57,324
We snatch the runner,
stick a hook in him and go back fishing.

73
00:05:57,427 --> 00:06:00,396
And between the wiretap
and the runner bolting from the truck...

74
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:03,397
we got a charge on Stinkum
any time we want it.

75
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:10,065
We're also edging back into old murders,
pulling up fresh witnesses.

76
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:13,802
And there are assets to be seized,
stuff that fronts for the drug money.

77
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,775
-Like what?
-A strip club...

78
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:19,336
a couple of Westside laundromats,
a triple-A rated towing company...

79
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,643
a funeral parlor.

80
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:22,200
A funeral parlor?

81
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:24,583
He bought out one in
Gwynn Falls last year.

82
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,052
The money's going everywhere.

83
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:29,488
That's just what we know from
one of Avon's girls bragging to a friend.

84
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:31,958
God knows what else he's got
that we don't know of.

85
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:32,528
Understand Barksdale's name is on nothing.
He's always a step or two removed.

86
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:35,759
Understand Barksdale's name is on nothing.
He's always a step or two removed.

87
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:37,900
It's a career case, Your Honor.

88
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,026
Look here, Jimmy.

89
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:44,464
You misspelled "culpable"...

90
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,269
and you're confusing "then" and "than."

91
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:52,877
T-H-E-N is an adverb used
to divide and measure time.

92
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,283
"Detective McNulty makes a mess...

93
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,984
"and then he has to clean it up."

94
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,250
It's great that you're going through
every word--

95
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:07,295
Not to be confused with T-H-A-N,
which is most commonly used...

96
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:10,298
after a comparative adjective or adverb,
as in:

97
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,759
"Rhonda is smarter than Jimmy."

98
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:18,535
Yeah? Look, there is more than enough
indication of progress...

99
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:20,575
to justify continued intercepts.

100
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:24,840
I'll sign an order
for 30 more days on all taps and clones.

101
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:28,011
One copy to the court,
one to the State's Attorney?

102
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:33,119
-Anything else you need?
-What, from you?

103
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:40,656
I think I'll go see a man about a dog.

104
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:47,193
It's always a pleasure, Ms. Pearlman.

105
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,439
Your professional demeanor
and your overall competence...

106
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,636
stands in stark contrast against
the usual municipal backdrop...

107
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:59,943
of mediocrity and indifference.

108
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,342
-Sarcasm, Judge?
-No.

109
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:05,853
Another 10 years of this nonsense,
and I see you wearing the robes...

110
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:08,219
of the District Court for Baltimore City.

111
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:13,388
That or a straitjacket.

112
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,837
Jesus.

113
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:25,403
I would love to throw a fuck into her.

114
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:28,836
The red hair, freckles....

115
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:31,404
Don't you think, Jimmy?

116
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:34,950
As in all matters before the Court,
I think whatever the Judge thinks.

117
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,408
Come on, Jimmy.

118
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,847
Sit. Talk.

119
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:58,304
-1 2-14.
-What's up?

120
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,877
Eastbound on Preston.
Stinkum and a young boy riding shotgun.

121
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:04,173
They're at the light right now.

122
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:19,294
Got them.

123
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:38,175
Let's see how he plays it.

124
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:43,747
Fucking shit.

125
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:54,325
He's gonna bail any moment.

126
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,465
-Jump out!
-Bail-out on Druid Hill, 700 Block...

127
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:04,631
suspect wearing gray sweats,
running into the court.

128
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,439
Fuck me.

129
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:10,610
Close shop. Police.

130
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,913
-C'mon, shorty. Step.
-He ain't man enough for you.

131
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:19,677
Re-up!

132
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:20,949
Hello, Officer.

133
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:23,514
Run, man!

134
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:25,924
-Move, motherfucker.
-White man walking!

135
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,623
Yo, move, shorty, that's my re-up, yo!

136
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,762
-Goddamn.
-He's coming back!

137
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,431
-Give it up, son!
-Cut him off, cut him off!

138
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,902
Yo, get him!

139
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:42,508
-I got the bag!
-He's going right.

140
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:47,348
-Get the bag.
-Yo, move, man!

141
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:50,213
What's up?

142
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:51,881
Damn, motherfucker.

143
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,683
Bet you don't do that shit to a white man.

144
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:01,354
Y'all get the fuck away from him.
That man ain't did nothing to nobody.

145
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,562
Four packs. Street-ready.

146
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,233
-1 2-08.
-12-08.

147
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:11,805
Need a wagon inside the 800 block of Lex...

148
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:15,501
-inside the court.
-10-4, 12-08.

149
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,277
Anyone got a smoke?

150
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,348
How are you sitting with your bosses?

151
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,790
Rawls tried to close
this thing down last week.

152
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:34,328
Blow the wiretap by charging
some weak-sister murders.

153
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,990
-What stopped him?
-Daniels.

154
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,960
-Daniels?
-I couldn't believe it either.

155
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,936
I'm ready to throw in the fucking towel,
Daniels stepped up.

156
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:46,166
Yeah? Why didn't you come to me?

157
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:50,805
You don't trust me no more, Jimmy?

158
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:53,939
Who dropped a dime to that
newspaper reporter, Your Honor?

159
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,347
Where you been?

160
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:59,648
35 cents these days,
before anybody'll cough up a dial tone.

161
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,686
No, it's 50.

162
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:05,918
I got another week before my
homicide shift flips to night work.

163
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm not back with them,
Rawls sticks it to me.

164
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,299
You got a friend here.

165
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:16,895
Worse comes to worse,
Pearlman goes to her bosses.

166
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:20,032
The State's Attorney's office
still has some love for you, Jimmy.

167
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:23,305
I'm starting to worry more
about the people who claim to love me...

168
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:24,811
than the ones who don't.

169
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:03,342
Now?

170
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,412
Yeah.

171
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:09,787
Somebody's hitting Stringer Bell's pager
from the Number 2 payphone...

172
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:10,793
in the Tower Court.

173
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,325
-Now?
-Now.

174
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,002
What's up?

175
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,940
-Freamon.
-Visual on Stinkum.

176
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:04,177
-Yo, we lost four to 5-0.
-What?

177
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:07,773
-We lost four.
-Yo, why the fuck are you telling me this?

178
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,449
I'll talk to you later.

179
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,201
Does he think I can
just pull it out of my ass?

180
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:44,245
Can't go outside and play till
your homework's done?

181
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:47,083
Can't do shit till I clear
this case for Rawls.

182
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,756
How old is it?

183
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,458
Old and cold.

184
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,918
Yours to begin with?

185
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,531
Then, my friend, you are double-fucked.

186
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:04,364
Motherfucker.

187
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,170
Son of a bitch!

188
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:12,641
Give me the card.

189
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:21,088
-You sick, heartless bastard.
-Come on, give me the card.

190
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:31,232
She was a gypsy woman

191
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,964
She was a gypsy woman

192
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:48,949
-Madame Laurie?
-You scoff?

193
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,084
Madame fucking LaRue, Jay?

194
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:56,282
Better men than you have
turned to this lady...

195
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:58,622
in their dark night of dead ends.

196
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:02,221
You're not serious.

197
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:05,061
I don't joke
when it comes to Madame LaRue.

198
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:08,363
The woman, she has an unexplainable gift...

199
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,802
in matters of death investigation.

200
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,303
She transcends the rational.

201
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:20,375
Give her a call.

202
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:38,830
He's dropped here,
so the dumpsters cover it from this side.

203
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:42,502
But everyone over there
with a window had a view.

204
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,542
Merit badge for two good little Scouts.

205
00:16:56,852 --> 00:17:00,549
Ma'am, you need some help with that?

206
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:06,056
-I'm all right.
-Please, it's our pleasure.

207
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:16,529
Let me understand.

208
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:20,332
Y'all hang around the projects,
white and black together...

209
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:24,012
ties and jackets on, looking to help ladies
with their shopping carts...

210
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:25,239
and whatever else.

211
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:28,950
Police, right?

212
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:30,585
Afraid so, Ma'am.

213
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:33,211
About the murder a while back, right?

214
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:34,914
Maintenance man?

215
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,131
The defendants can take a seat.

216
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:52,530
-The judge will be in shortly.
-Can I take the file?

217
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:55,175
-Here.
-Thank you.

218
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,044
Excuse me, Ma'am?

219
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,433
-Detective?
-I need to pull one out.

220
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:21,002
Yeah, which one?

221
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:31,911
Let's see. Dope, coke, dope, theft, dope...

222
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:34,448
Ioitering, coke, attempted theft, dope...

223
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,849
dope, theft, dope,
and the charge du jour is...

224
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:41,179
possession, to wit, cocaine.

225
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,417
-But you need him?
-I need him.

226
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:46,253
Okay, he bounces over to drug court...

227
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,795
pleads to possession
and agrees to probation...

228
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:50,125
with ongoing treatment.

229
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,200
-That's it?
-That's it.

230
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:53,925
Okay.

231
00:18:58,173 --> 00:18:59,936
I'm with your boy Bubs.

232
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,543
-You want out, right?
-Yeah.

233
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:05,680
Plead guilty to possession
and convince the drug court judge...

234
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:07,408
you want to get your shit clean.

235
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:10,041
-Drug court?
-Shake it off in treatment...

236
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:12,643
go to some meetings
and pee when they tell you to pee.

237
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,722
-No jail?
-No jail.

238
00:19:14,923 --> 00:19:17,289
-I'm out right now?
-Soon as you're processed.

239
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,322
Okay.

240
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:37,674
Dead man was coming this way
and another man was walking behind him.

241
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:42,713
Must've said something to him, because he
turned around before he got shot.

242
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:45,584
-Do you know the man who did it?
-No, sir.

243
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:47,378
-What'd he look like?
-Who?

244
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:51,022
-The bad guy.
-Light skin, medium height.

245
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,227
Didn't have no meat on him.

246
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,897
-Young or old?
-He wasn't young.

247
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,633
Okay, if you pretend
my partner here is the victim...

248
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:02,829
and I'm the guy with the gun....

249
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,774
-This close?
-No.

250
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:16,975
Like that?

251
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,012
Yeah, that's about right.

252
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:27,352
-Do you think, if you saw this guy again--
-I didn't....

253
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:28,895
Ma'am, please, don't be afraid.

254
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,158
From where I was sitting,
his back was to me.

255
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:36,632
It's all right, you done good.

256
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:39,366
You have any trouble at all, you call us.

257
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:53,150
-She can't make a positive ID.
-My man Omar can.

258
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:56,554
A stickup artist with a half-dozen priors.
That's your eyeball witness?

259
00:20:56,658 --> 00:21:00,059
She corroborates him on the details,
right down to the close-range shot.

260
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:03,029
We've also got Omar saying
if we jack Bird, we'll get the gun.

261
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,723
Says he's too stupid to throw it off.

262
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,166
So, between her and Omar,
a match on the gun gets us over.

263
00:21:11,073 --> 00:21:12,665
It happened like you said...

264
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:14,202
Iike it was a plan.

265
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,799
It was a plan.

266
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:25,681
What's your address?

267
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:28,321
734 Fayette.

268
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:31,084
734 Fayette.

269
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:34,056
What's the apartment?

270
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:38,193
Kid, what apartment?

271
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,198
Come on, kid, what's the apartment?

272
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:46,730
-1 1-M.
-Okay, 1 1-M. Is that so hard?

273
00:21:47,643 --> 00:21:49,201
What's your DOB?

274
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:51,478
Come on, kid.

275
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:55,407
What?

276
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:57,413
It's him.

277
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,146
Who?

278
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:25,209
Kevin Johnson?

279
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,682
You hungry? Ham and cheese? Tuna?

280
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:35,081
I want a Reese's, yo. Peanut butter cup.

281
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:38,018
Drink?

282
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,827
Tea in a can.

283
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,087
You got it.

284
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,590
Go down to the machines.

285
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,760
Get a peanut butter cup
and a can of Lipton's tea.

286
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:03,584
Motherfucker can't even look at me.

287
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,784
-What say we start over on this?
-Start over?

288
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,483
My lawyer said I got a case
against y'all for this shit.

289
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,050
Fuck the lawyers.
I'm trying to talk about life here, Kevin.

290
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:20,797
Game already cost you, right?
More than it should have, I know.

291
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,300
Whose fault is that?

292
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,500
His. Ours.

293
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:29,034
Mine, maybe.

294
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:33,079
Thing is, I feel like
I owe you something here.

295
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:36,708
So, I'm asking how you want to carry this.
You want to get out?

296
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,214
You want to do something else
with the rest of your years?

297
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:42,688
You come see me.

298
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:48,426
Tea was sold out.

299
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:55,027
Might be tomorrow, might
not be for a while.

300
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:58,163
But when you're ready for
something different, give me a call.

301
00:23:58,273 --> 00:23:59,638
I'll remember.

302
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,846
Motherfucker thinking he can
pimp me over a candy bar.

303
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:17,552
I'm thinking it might be a drug thing,
or maybe straight-up robbery.

304
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:22,128
-You're lrish, no?
-Italian.

305
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:25,525
-Santangelo?
-Santangelo.

306
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,665
Saint Angelo.

307
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:31,136
Early martyr, patron
saint of Licata, ltaly.

308
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:34,104
Prayed for his killer
with the knife still in him.

309
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,939
But it's not Saint Angelo calling.

310
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:40,211
It's Saint Anthony who wants to help you.

311
00:24:40,615 --> 00:24:41,809
He does?

312
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:44,549
Very much.

313
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:48,021
Ain't he the guy you call
when you lose something?

314
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,474
You sure that's Anthony?

315
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:10,677
Go to the victim's grave,
bury the statue...

316
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:14,473
wait an hour, a full hour, no shortcuts.

317
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:17,580
Then dig it up. Go straight home.

318
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,350
When you go to bed, hold it to your ear.

319
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:24,085
And he tells me who did it?

320
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:36,828
I think it was my turn to pick.

321
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:41,238
Yeah, definitely my turn. You had me
down at the B&O the other night.

322
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,901
After you dragged me
to the Sugar Hill Tavern, remember?

323
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:45,001
No.

324
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:47,705
Hey, Turk.

325
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:00,324
Where's Nadine this fine evening?

326
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:05,527
Gainesville. Been down in Florida
at her sister's all damn week.

327
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:14,669
Shame to say, though. Lack of pussy
will change even a good man's demeanor.

328
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:18,937
Sweet as can be.

329
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,797
Marla.

330
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:39,298
Good to see you.
You remember my husband, Cedric?

331
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:41,961
Yes, I do. Nice to see you.

332
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,405
Marla's with me on the GBC's
downtown redevelopment committee.

333
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,840
She's the one that prods me
awake at the meetings.

334
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:52,380
That was drastic stuff.
Everybody was nodding off.

335
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,108
-That last one was so long--
-Excuse me.

336
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,548
I think it's the best ticket in years.

337
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:13,824
$500-a-plate fundraisers
for a police lieutenant?

338
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,696
Even in this city, that constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment.

339
00:27:19,774 --> 00:27:22,971
And which member of the ticket
has so energized you?

340
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:26,305
The Mayor? Council President?

341
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:31,150
-The Registrar of Wills, maybe?
-The Mayor, I might recognize if I saw him.

342
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,282
For the rest,
I'd pretty much need B of I photos.

343
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:35,788
You're not wrong, Lieutenant.

344
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,224
In this state, it's a thin line
between campaign posters...

345
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:41,989
and photo arrays.

346
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,465
Pop quiz.

347
00:27:57,078 --> 00:27:59,069
City council? Eastside, maybe?

348
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:03,041
State senator.
Clay Davis, from the 39th District.

349
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:05,843
Vice-chair on the budget committee.

350
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:09,081
You'll never make Major at this rate.

351
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:18,156
Excuse me, while I do my duty
and kiss some senatorial haunches.

352
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:24,996
Clay, nice to see you again.

353
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:31,807
Come on, let's roll.

354
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:45,925
Ain't you gonna sign it?

355
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:48,860
No, you get that back
when the meeting's over.

356
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,998
And if you don't stay, we don't sign.

357
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:53,632
That's how it works.

358
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:02,036
Come on, I want to see the show.

359
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:04,906
Bubbs.

360
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:09,649
10: We continue to take
personal inventory...

361
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:12,345
and when we are wrong, promptly admit it.

362
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:15,285
1 1 : We sought through
prayer and meditation...

363
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,349
to improve our conscious contact with God,
as we understood Him....

364
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:24,025
I ain't seen some of these faces in
so long, thought they were dead.

365
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:25,856
Same thing, ain't it?

366
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:29,130
Having had a spiritual awakening
as the result of these steps...

367
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:31,762
we try to carry
this message to other addicts...

368
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:34,307
and practice these principles
in all our affairs.

369
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,605
Today's speaker is going to be Waylon...

370
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:40,340
who, if you come to these meetings,
you have to know.

371
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:49,523
Hell, you all know I'm Waylon,
and I'm an addict.

372
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,023
Hi, Waylon.

373
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:55,563
And the fact is that I want to be clean
today more than I want to be high.

374
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:57,629
I know that's right.

375
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:02,167
It's good to be here.
Hell, it's good to be anywhere clean.

376
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:04,529
Even Baltimore.

377
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:09,668
I been clean a few 24 hours now,
and I'm still dead certain...

378
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,905
that my disease wants me dead.

379
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:15,259
Yeah, I'm in here with
you all, talking shit

380
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,380
about how strong I am,
how strong I feel...

381
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:21,581
but my disease is out there in that
parking lot, doing push-ups on steroids...

382
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:25,125
waiting for the chance to kick my ass
up and down the street again.

383
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:28,891
Scars on my hands, on my feet...

384
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:31,622
two bouts of endocarditis...

385
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:37,027
Hep C and whatnot knocking down walls
and kicking out windows in my liver.

386
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,532
I lost a good wife...

387
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,810
bad girlfriend, and the
respect of anyone...

388
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:47,711
that ever tried to loan me money
or do me a favor.

389
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,781
Pawned my pickup, my bike...

390
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,821
my National Steel guitar...

391
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:58,152
and a stamp collection
that my granddad left me.

392
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,490
And when it was almost over for me...

393
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,764
and I was out there on them corners...

394
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:07,130
not a pot to piss in,
and anyone that ever knew me or loved me...

395
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:09,760
cussing my name,
you know what I told myself?

396
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:12,768
I said, "Waylon, you're doing good."

397
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,103
I surely did.

398
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:18,502
I thought I was God's own drug addict.

399
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:21,047
And if God hadn't meant
for me to get high...

400
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:24,141
he wouldn't have made
being high so much, like, perfect.

401
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,980
Now, I know I got one
more high left in me...

402
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:31,115
but I doubt very seriously
if I have one more recovery.

403
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:36,153
So if there's anybody out there
that sees that bottom coming up at them...

404
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,623
I'm here to talk sense.

405
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:41,464
I don't care who you are...

406
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,201
what you done...

407
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:45,030
or who you done it to.

408
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,671
If you're here...

409
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:48,075
so am l.

410
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:49,937
That's right.

411
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:58,515
The Mustard Seed Group
gives out key chains...

412
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,417
for stretches of clean time.

413
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:03,182
So if you've earned it,
come on up and get it.

414
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:06,125
Does anybody have nine months?

415
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:11,290
Does anybody have six months?

416
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:15,829
-Does anybody have three months?
-Yeah.

417
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:25,742
Does anybody have one month?

418
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:37,250
And now, for the most
important person in this room...

419
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:39,451
does anybody have 24 hours...

420
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:41,558
or a sincere desire to live?

421
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,027
Yeah, all right.

422
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,483
We shoved off this morning.

423
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,651
"God grant me the strength...

424
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,321
"to accept the things I cannot change...

425
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:18,831
"and the courage
to change the things I can...

426
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:21,299
"and the wisdom to know the difference."

427
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,041
What's the score?

428
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:33,372
Orioles, 4 to 3.
Bernie Williams just doubled, though.

429
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:35,972
They always let the Yankees
back into it, always.

430
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,143
No, they got a bullpen this year.

431
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:42,019
-Who's pitching?
-Buddy Groom.

432
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:45,392
Who you driving for?

433
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:47,055
Marla Daniels.

434
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:52,833
I'd love to crack this here crib.

435
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:55,402
Yeah?

436
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:57,903
Good day's work. Good day's work.

437
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:00,565
What about the alarm system?

438
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:03,166
Shit, I'd wire that weak-ass
thing back on itself...

439
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:06,110
pull the truck up,
bust through those French doors.

440
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:09,207
-That'd work.
-Yes, indeed.

441
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:11,485
Sell most of this good
shit around the way...

442
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:15,522
but some of it, like the art and all,
I might have to run it up New York.

443
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,090
Name's Damien Price.

444
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:19,150
But I mostly go by Day-Day.

445
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,622
I'm Cedric Daniels.

446
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,565
But I mostly go by Lieutenant.

447
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:30,462
Look, they're bringing in Roberts.

448
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:33,301
There you are.

449
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,036
There's somebody I need you to meet.

450
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:50,991
-Go on.
-Yeah.

451
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:53,854
-Take it all off.
-Rub them together like that.

452
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:56,988
See here, motherfucker.

453
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:59,423
You got to put this Gant thing on Bird...

454
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,934
and you got to do something
with that other case...

455
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,003
the young girl.

456
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:04,366
Diedre Kresson.

457
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:07,464
You need to be able to
charge both them murders...

458
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:09,736
and then you walk that on up to Rawls.

459
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,402
Now, you see, Jimmy...

460
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,906
here's the hard part,
for an asshole like yourself:

461
00:35:15,016 --> 00:35:18,975
You just got to give him
them clearances like a goddamn gift.

462
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,713
And then you still might have
to kiss his ass...

463
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:24,223
for about three, four motherfucking months.

464
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:25,986
You're gonna have to do it.

465
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,618
Three or four months?

466
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:32,459
Got to, Jimmy.

467
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,294
Too fucking late to do anything else.
You gonna be one ass-kissing white man.

468
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:41,439
You know why I respect you
so much, Bunk?

469
00:35:44,312 --> 00:35:46,439
It's not 'cause you're good police.

470
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:48,911
'Cause, you know, fuck that, right?

471
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:50,576
Fuck that, yeah.

472
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:55,145
It's not 'cause when I came to Homicide,
you taught me all kinds cool shit about....

473
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:58,116
I don't know, whatever.

474
00:35:58,526 --> 00:35:59,515
Whatever.

475
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:04,262
It's 'cause when it came time
for you to fuck me...

476
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,462
you were very gentle.

477
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:10,565
Damn right.

478
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:14,507
See, 'cause you could've
hauled me out of the garage...

479
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:17,476
and just bent me
over the hood of a radio car.

480
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:22,544
But no, you were very gentle.

481
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:27,453
I knew it was your first time.

482
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:30,750
I wanted to make that shit special.

483
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:32,652
It was, man.

484
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,257
It fucking was.

485
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:43,635
-Take your fucking money back.
-No, this is mine.

486
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:45,535
Take it back, you old whore.

487
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:47,663
Turk.

488
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:50,610
Can I get one more?

489
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:04,616
What's up?

490
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,594
-They up there, right?
-Yeah, they up there.

491
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:09,285
Hey, Dee.

492
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,760
You get a chance, man,
let me pull your coat to something.

493
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:17,463
I got a little move we might could do.
So get with me after, okay?

494
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:19,139
All right. Most def.

495
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:24,840
The only reason why I even called Bell
was because these niggers--

496
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:28,438
You're not supposed to talk shit
on the phone and you know that.

497
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:35,984
What's up, bro?

498
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,089
Who's snitching?

499
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:44,663
-Nobody.
-Is you sure on that, man?

500
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,323
You done had the stick-up,
then the jump-out.

501
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:50,063
-Now, they running up on Stink.
-My crew, we tight.

502
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:51,396
All right?

503
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:54,133
Ain't nobody holding no extra money.
I checked all that.

504
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:57,643
Maybe your ass just ran a stop
or had a taillight out or some shit like--

505
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,576
You think I'd run a stop with $40,000?

506
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,341
-Fuck no.
-Nigger, I don't know.

507
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:02,780
Something is up.

508
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:05,979
So go down there today...

509
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,555
tell them hoppers you got
working for you down there...

510
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:10,681
that this shit is about to change.

511
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,022
Stringer gonna come down there,
he gonna run through the changes.

512
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:16,722
Until this shit is
straight, the Pit is dead.

513
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,443
Thing is, why they didn't pop Stink?

514
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:35,848
Knockos took the boy and the package, and
they got Stink by the tags on the truck.

515
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:39,075
You took that down to the police
and filed a report, right?

516
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:42,280
Truck, I ditched that shit
up off Cold Spring Lane, man.

517
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:45,857
You ain't heard nothing
from the knockos yet, right?

518
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,920
-No.
-What the fuck?

519
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:54,426
They catch four packs
popping out the truck.

520
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:56,435
They don't even get the plate?

521
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,630
What's all this shit?

522
00:39:01,342 --> 00:39:02,809
Something's up, man.

523
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,040
Something is definitely up.

524
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:13,542
I got somewhere I gotta be.
Cover me with Daniels, will you?

525
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:18,792
Asshole.

526
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,027
Herc, Carver.

527
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:24,987
-What?
-What?

528
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,157
Come here.

529
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:27,825
Come here.

530
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:39,974
Them two is freaks.

531
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:43,380
Stash-finding motherfuckers
popped the package from nowhere.

532
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:44,576
Who you talking?

533
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:48,052
Skinny black motherfucker
and that ass-ugly knocko.

534
00:39:48,456 --> 00:39:50,185
The white boy with the ball cap.

535
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,953
-The ones who jumped Bodie?
-Batman and Robin.

536
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,286
All right?

537
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,665
-Bang.
-You got them, baby.

538
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,259
-I'm Batman.
-I don't think so.

539
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:05,965
-Batman's white.
-And Robin's black?

540
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:15,010
You heard the hopper,
you're the ass-ugly white guy.

541
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:18,585
Boy Wonder,
why don't you suck my bat-dick?

542
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:20,647
Get the fuck outta here.

543
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:28,618
Why don't you sign this for me there,
Mr. One-day Man?

544
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:36,467
God have mercy when they piss you, boy.

545
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:39,568
You mean the god of my understanding?

546
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,176
No, we gotta get you
some clean piss, you know...

547
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:45,769
so you can take up
into your probation office.

548
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,108
Yo, Bubs.

549
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,444
Who the fuck do we know with clean piss?

550
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:04,028
-So you're ready to charge this one?
-If we luck into the gun, yeah.

551
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:06,093
And then we tag-team Bird.

552
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,395
If we get him with the gun,
we take it federal.

553
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:11,096
Five years minimum,
and he's got prior felonies...

554
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:12,172
it's a lot more.

555
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:14,332
We got an address we want to hit?

556
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:19,005
We're working with informants.
As soon as we get something, we jump.

557
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:22,673
...warm air for the afternoon...

558
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:25,616
partly sunny, windy and warm
with a chance of thunderstorms...

559
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,621
high up to 83, and then on Friday,
clearing and windy with a high near 70.

560
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:32,886
Weather updated around
the clock on WTOP radio.

561
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,858
I'm meteorologist Dave Lew
at the Weather Channel.

562
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,022
This is the WTOP radio network.

563
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:43,534
You worried about being seen?

564
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,804
If anybody got a problem
with me spending time with y'all...

565
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:51,071
I'd be much obliged to stick
my gun straight in their mouth.

566
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:53,074
How's that work?

567
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:00,483
Bird not up in the mix today.

568
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:04,388
If we had more than a street name,
maybe we could come up with an address.

569
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:08,023
What can I say? Out here, Bird just Bird.

570
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:11,661
So, what up,
you all fixing snatch him from out here?

571
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:12,754
That's the plan.

572
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:16,200
He don't pack down here, none of them do.
And that's the rule.

573
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:19,795
Now, if you want iron, you gotta go
to one of those kids up in the towers.

574
00:42:19,907 --> 00:42:22,000
-We need the gun.
-Then y'all got a problem.

575
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,509
Without knowing his crib,
we definitely got a problem.

576
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:26,842
Not unless y'all know
where Bird like to cop.

577
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:29,438
-What, Bird gets high?
-Not in the towers, he don't.

578
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,542
Avon ain't having his people using.
That's another rule.

579
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:35,121
"Never get high on your own supply."

580
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:39,052
Now, if I was hunting Mr. Bird...

581
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:42,792
I would consider the best package
to be the red Dilly...

582
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,591
that's over there in Carrollton.

583
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:47,565
That's if I have to be
constabulating like you all.

584
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:49,427
Carrollton?

585
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:53,571
I know one thing, when you all
run up on him, you all best be more...

586
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:55,138
careful, that is.

587
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:56,510
Why is that?

588
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,306
Bird will throw down
without thinking, for sure.

589
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:08,255
Poot.

590
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,453
Where Wallace been at, man?

591
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:12,986
I don't know.

592
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,524
He in the wind.

593
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:19,726
Wallace been fucked up.

594
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:24,693
Since they got that stickup boy, you know?
Put him on the car like that.

595
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,403
Wallace all quiet and shit.

596
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,440
Don't even come out his room some days.

597
00:43:35,182 --> 00:43:37,082
I'm looking for Dee. You seen him?

598
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:45,025
Dee.

599
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:46,648
Chilling?

600
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:48,519
What's up?

601
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,396
-What're you doing down in the projects?
-I got something, man.

602
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,632
Something right.

603
00:43:58,238 --> 00:43:59,432
Come on over.

604
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:03,140
Where the shop at?

605
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:05,606
Nothing today.

606
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,077
See, that's the thing,
'cause if you need more of that...

607
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:11,617
I got this connect.

608
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,009
Yeah?

609
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:16,248
This guy I know from the club, he from D.C.

610
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:19,656
He got this thing through New Orleans,
these Jamaicans down there.

611
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,886
New Orleans?

612
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,224
They're offering weight, Dee.

613
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:30,031
-My uncle know about it?
-No, see.

614
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:33,229
This thing on the side for me...

615
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:35,973
I got enough to turn
a New York quarter on it...

616
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:39,273
but I don't have what you got right here
with the distribution.

617
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,041
You see what I'm saying?

618
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:47,050
I'm saying, Dee, I'd be taking
all the risk with them peoples.

619
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:50,954
Once I have the package, I bring it
down here to you, and you put it out.

620
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:53,390
We do an even split on what comes back.

621
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:55,651
Right?

622
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,492
Let me think on that, all right?

623
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,865
Finally get some ends for us.
You see what I'm saying?

624
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,192
Yeah.

625
00:45:05,305 --> 00:45:06,533
Yeah, most def.

626
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:10,402
I'm out.

627
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:13,572
-Be good.
-Think on that.

628
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,170
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.

629
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,365
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.

630
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:16,606
$5, yeah. Everybody, $5 hats right here.

631
00:46:17,377 --> 00:46:19,436
Which door are we watching again?

632
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,479
The vacant next to the store.

633
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,745
That's the shooting gallery.

634
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:26,217
Is he still in there?

635
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,653
Greggs is on the back
and we're on the front, so you tell me.

636
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:38,789
Yeah.

637
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:02,316
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.
I got you right here.

638
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,886
Cover up that head of yours.
You know what I mean?

639
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:09,920
Can't beat that, right?

640
00:47:10,564 --> 00:47:13,032
$5 hats, right here. $5 hats.

641
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:19,404
-$5 hat there, mister.
-Fuck you, man.

642
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:26,737
Take them.

643
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:28,414
Shorty.

644
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:32,251
Get your hands back.

645
00:47:36,223 --> 00:47:37,451
I got him.

646
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:38,889
Get off me, man.

647
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,927
Get the fuck off me.

648
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:43,825
-I got the feet.
-Bitch-ass cops!

649
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:49,333
There we go.

650
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,838
Yeah, look what we have here.

651
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:58,733
Baby.

652
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,513
Get the fuck off me.

653
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:03,605
My hand.

654
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:06,319
-Fucking bitch.
-Shut the fuck up!

655
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:09,054
Shit is tight, man.

656
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:16,087
We should leave the couch
right there, right?

657
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:19,723
-Yeah, leave that shit right there.
-That's nice, that's straight.

658
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,029
So?

659
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,436
What's the deal, String?

660
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:35,011
-How often you all changing the stash?
-Every night since we got jacked.

661
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:38,744
-Anybody on the team getting high?
-No, man. Just the old touts.

662
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:41,511
And they ain't handling no money, no vials.

663
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:43,681
You all been going in and out
of the vacants?

664
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,384
Making sure them narcos
don't set up in there?

665
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:47,515
Yeah, for sure.

666
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:50,756
I got no cell phones,
no house phones neither, right?

667
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:55,358
No, man, nothing but these pagers
and them pay boxes over there, that's it.

668
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:04,074
All right, tear them motherfuckers out.

669
00:49:04,645 --> 00:49:05,634
What?

670
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:08,904
Tear out them phones.

671
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,683
From now on, you all need a payphone,
you walk a few blocks...

672
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,346
and you do not use
the same phone more than once a day.

673
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:16,581
You hear me?

674
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,486
-You hear me, right?
-Done.

675
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,271
All right. Bey, tear
them motherfuckers out.

676
00:49:22,283 --> 00:49:23,091
Come on, man.

677
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:37,371
Man, come on. Get off the phone.

678
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:03,962
So, we wanted to hang...

679
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:06,101
the velvet backdrop...

680
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,174
with the Lexus and the pit bulls...

681
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:12,275
but it's still out at the dry cleaners.

682
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:17,809
But seriously, folks,
we really wanted to show all the jurors...

683
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:21,877
that you left our little interrogation here
without any more scuff marks...

684
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,684
than what you brought in.

685
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,925
Fuck you, fat man.

686
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:29,652
"Fuck you, fat man."

687
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:32,497
I thought we were friends.

688
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:43,705
That gun is downstairs now,
in the ballistics lab.

689
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:47,980
It comes back on a dead state's witness,
then you're gonna see death row.

690
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:52,211
-You up for that?
-Suck my dick, dyke cunt.

691
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,510
Where's my lawyer at?

692
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:56,986
Freak. Cunt-eater.

693
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:02,153
You got one chance,
you stupid motherfucker.

694
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:05,427
You roll back on the people
you killed William Gant for...

695
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:07,523
or you gonna eat the whole meal.

696
00:51:08,568 --> 00:51:09,796
Tell you what...

697
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,965
gimme this hand back and step to me,
and I'll fuck you in all three holes.

698
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:15,769
Fucking charmer, this one.

699
00:51:18,011 --> 00:51:19,000
Bitch.

700
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:21,607
You ain't got shit on me.

701
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,573
-One of you should go in.
-Is she in trouble?

702
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:27,346
Kima? He keeps this up, she'll cut his ass.

703
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:28,713
You ain't shit!

704
00:51:29,656 --> 00:51:31,283
You ain't got shit on me!

705
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:37,854
So, you're my eyeball witness?

706
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:41,599
So, why'd you step up on this?

707
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:46,734
Bird trifling, basically.
He killed an everyday working man and all.

708
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,742
Don't get it twisted, I
do some dirt, too...

709
00:51:49,843 --> 00:51:53,210
but I ain't never put my gun
on nobody who wasn't in the game.

710
00:51:53,847 --> 00:51:55,712
A man must have a code.

711
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,210
No doubt.

712
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:08,022
-Man, I know you from somewhere.
-Yeah?

713
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:11,253
I was in Southwestern
before I came to Homicide.

714
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:12,888
Worked Frederick Road.

715
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,391
No, I mean, back in the day.

716
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:20,435
You go to Edmondson, right?

717
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:23,570
Yeah, you was ahead of me.

718
00:52:23,677 --> 00:52:27,477
I remember you was the first brother
I ever seen play that sport with a stick.

719
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,208
What's it called?

720
00:52:29,716 --> 00:52:31,581
-Lacrosse, man.
-For sure.

721
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:34,582
Yeah, I was All-Metro attack.

722
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:39,125
Prep school boys used to pee themselves
when they see old Bunk coming at them.

723
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,659
So look here, homey.

724
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:51,261
Seeing as how you're being all charitable
with your recollections...

725
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:54,172
what else you got in the way
of open murders?

726
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:56,435
-Going to Barksdale?
-Going anywhere.

727
00:52:56,743 --> 00:52:59,871
-How far back do you want me to go?
-As far as you need.

728
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:02,047
Murder stay murder.

729
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:11,746
Thanks.

730
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,224
Gun matches.

731
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:21,798
You're done, Bird.

732
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:25,395
Last chance to grab a little something
for yourself on a deal.

733
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:28,235
Eat my shit first,
you downtown white whore.

734
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:39,651
Yeah, that's right. Take this
ugly-ass cunt-eater with you, too.

735
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,034
Yo, I'm cuffed, man.

736
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:01,504
You gonna at least give me
a fair chance, right?

737
00:54:01,608 --> 00:54:03,974
Come on, man. Don't do me like that, man.

738
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:09,842
You fat fuck!

739
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,285
Take these handcuffs off, man!

740
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:18,186
Fulton and Baker, you say?

741
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:22,387
It happened last year,
couple days after Easter.

742
00:54:22,495 --> 00:54:26,431
This girl by the name of Neecee.
She about 30, 35.

743
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:28,128
Denise Redding.

744
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,531
Yeah, I got it.

745
00:54:32,672 --> 00:54:33,900
I'll be damned.

746
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:40,036
Bird sure know how to bring it
out in people, don't he?

747
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:46,975
Hello?

748
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:54,253
The Lindsey case, right?

749
00:54:56,696 --> 00:54:59,358
No, Lindsey. Martin Lindsey.

750
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:07,340
Who the fuck is Denise Redding?

751
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:24,585
-What the fuck did you do to him?
-Here's yours, Mike.

752
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:37,937
I don't even fucking remember this one.
I swear I don't.

753
00:55:38,038 --> 00:55:39,096
Well, it's down.

754
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:44,034
Our boy gave us a statement,
two witnesses and an ID of your shooter.

755
00:55:45,045 --> 00:55:46,910
Take it with our compliments.

756
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:49,541
Sanny.

757
00:55:49,816 --> 00:55:52,216
What are you doing downtown
this time of night?

758
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,446
Madame fucking LaRue?

759
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:58,319
I gotta thank you, Jaybird,
you saved my fucking life here.

760
00:55:58,425 --> 00:56:02,452
Only thing I can't figure is I asked
for help on the Lindsey case, not this one.

761
00:56:02,562 --> 00:56:03,551
Mike...

762
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:05,931
fuck the gypsy shit.

763
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,933
These are the guys that
saved your ass, right here.

764
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:15,908
Thanks.

765
00:56:19,846 --> 00:56:20,835
Jimmy.

766
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:25,784
We gotta talk, man.

767
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:29,218
It's about Rawls.

768
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:12,487
What's the plan here?

769
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:15,229
Drunken fuck on a Tuesday night?

770
00:57:15,668 --> 00:57:18,694
-Is it Wednesday morning?
-I'm not drunk.

771
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:24,034
It's Rawls.

772
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:27,140
He's going after my badge.

773
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:31,606
What?

774
00:57:32,352 --> 00:57:34,149
They're gonna do me, Ronnie.

775
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:37,883
They're gonna do me.

776
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:40,755
I love this fucking job,
and they're gonna do me.

777
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,696
Come on.
