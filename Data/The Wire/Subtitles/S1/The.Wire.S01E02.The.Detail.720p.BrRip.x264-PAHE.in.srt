1
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:12,941
That's the witness all right,
the one from the Barksdale case.

2
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,779
Gant, William. 41 years.

3
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:20,202
Single headshot, close range.
Bullet pancaked on the inner skull.

4
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,378
-Ain't necessarily what it looks like.
-No?

5
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:30,679
A man's walking down a street
in West Baltimore.

6
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:33,050
That'll catch you a bullet
for a half-dozen reasons.

7
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,851
-Yeah, that it will.
-You run him for a sheet?

8
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,823
Yeah, a couple of disorderlies is all.

9
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,918
Guy works maintenance
down at Poe Homes.

10
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:42,224
Lives alone, no wife, no kids.

11
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:44,856
Only time his name pops up
on the courthouse computer...

12
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:46,992
is for being a state
witness in Barlow's case.

13
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:49,628
Otherwise,
I don't even make that connection.

14
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:54,806
I mean, you've got to admit...

15
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:58,142
it don't make sense to ace this
motherfucker after he done testified.

16
00:00:58,247 --> 00:00:59,646
Sends a hell of a message though.

17
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:03,617
He's one hardheaded fuck in the Terrace
you can't run off or buy out, right?

18
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,818
If your audience is the
high-rise projects, a

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,849
move like this cuts
right through the shit.

20
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:09,390
What are you gonna tell the major?

21
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:12,188
That I caught a stone fucking whodunit.

22
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:15,128
-Don't soft-sell the witness angle.
-Come on.

23
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:18,428
Why get the bosses riled
before we know for sure?

24
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:20,832
If I start talking shit
that a witness got killed--

25
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:22,529
-Bunk, tell him.
-Why?

26
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:24,401
Just cover yourself on this.

27
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:27,999
Jimmy, you ain't gonna do what I think?

28
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,846
Listen to me.

29
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:35,248
This shit is gonna jump up
and bite you in your ass.

30
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,080
Just cover yourself.

31
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:41,856
-What the hell was that about?
-Nothing.

32
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:28,323
Morning.

33
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,008
Jesus Christ.

34
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,655
Goddamn.

35
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:36,653
Who do you got to fuck in this town
to get a real office?

36
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,562
At least that works.

37
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,775
It was for McNulty.

38
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,649
-I shouldn't be here.
-Then you shouldn't.

39
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:01,245
They killed a fucking witness
out of your court.

40
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,053
Yeah, you told me. You did your civic duty.

41
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,493
Under the power vested in me
by the circuit court for Baltimore city...

42
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:10,030
I absolve you of all your sins,
Detective McNulty.

43
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,929
You are my sin, you know that?

44
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,502
For talking to you,
my major is ready to cut my throat.

45
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:17,629
Jimmy, you knew I was gonna
make that call. Admit it.

46
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,676
I didn't think you would straight-up
hang me out on the line in a shitstorm.

47
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,207
Look, it's not like it was
when I was a prosecutor.

48
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:28,374
-I'm a judge now, the rules are different.
-You missed a spot.

49
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,452
Yeah, what's done is done.

50
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:34,022
Question is,
what do you want me to do now?

51
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,219
I think you can leverage the Deputy Ops
with a phone call.

52
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:39,556
-He's already detailed people.
-Some detail.

53
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,927
Asshole lieutenant thinks
he can buy-bust his way to Avon Barksdale.

54
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:44,431
You want leverage?

55
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,229
We give the dead-witness angle
to the newspapers.

56
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:48,530
Stir some real shit.

57
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,969
No, that tips Barksdale
that someone's working him.

58
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,303
-We don't want to go public.
-No?

59
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,967
Just put it to the Deputy Ops...

60
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:57,204
you lost a witness
who testified in your court.

61
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:00,111
That forces the department
to commit to the investigation.

62
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:03,947
And when you call Burrell this time,
will you forget my fucking name?

63
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,192
-You missed a spot.
-Why don't you fucking do it?

64
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:16,594
Seniority.

65
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:34,708
-You found us.
-Wasn't easy.

66
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:39,019
-You asked for these guys?
-I asked for more manpower.

67
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,655
Have a seat.

68
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,192
What the fuck....

69
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:57,066
Sir, l--

70
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,606
He was showing me
the trigger pull on his Glock.

71
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:03,235
-And he was just--
-Detective?

72
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:06,838
Officer Pryzbylewski shot the wall,
Lieutenant.

73
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:08,840
Why?

74
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:11,681
Why did you shoot the wall,
Officer Pryzbylewski?

75
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:15,223
I was just showing Carv
how my trigger pull is light, you know.

76
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:19,154
-I got it so it's real light.
-He took the clip out, boss.

77
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,152
But not the one in the chamber.

78
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:25,427
No, I forgot the one in
the chamber, and....

79
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,265
Shit, I'm sorry, lieutenant.

80
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:33,207
-You want him to write on it?
-Write on what?

81
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:37,439
You let one go, you got to write.
You got to justify the use of deadly force.

82
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,078
Against a plaster wall.

83
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:45,051
It's an accident, okay?
Give me a fucking break already.

84
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:48,146
-Your name is what?
-Pryzbylewski.

85
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,523
From Auto Unit, right? Cantrell sent you.

86
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:56,562
Not exactly.

87
00:07:56,665 --> 00:08:00,999
Lt. Cantrell sent me
to Casualty Section a couple months back.

88
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:04,001
And I asked out of Casualty.

89
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,634
You came here from Casualty Section?

90
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:15,143
Man, these shits is right, yo.

91
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:22,619
-It's good with the hot sauce, too.
-Most definite.

92
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:26,692
-Dee, want some nuggets?
-No, go ahead, man.

93
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:29,855
Man, whoever invented these,
he off the hook.

94
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,023
Word!

95
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:35,003
Motherfucker got the bone
all the way out the damn chicken.

96
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:38,005
Till he came along,
niggas be chewing on drumsticks and shit...

97
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,075
getting their fingers all greasy.

98
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,938
He said "Later" to the bone.

99
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:45,107
Nugget that meat up
and make some real money.

100
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:47,546
-You think the man got paid?
-Who?

101
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,812
-Man who invented these.
-Shit, he richer than a motherfucker.

102
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,581
Why? You think he get a percentage?

103
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,383
Why not?

104
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:58,652
Nigga, please, the man
who invented them things...

105
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,195
just some sad-ass down
at the basement of McDonald's...

106
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,856
thinking up some shit
to make money for the real players.

107
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:06,332
-No man, that ain't right.
-Fuck right.

108
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:08,867
It ain't about right, it's about money.

109
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,462
You think Ronald McDonald
gonna go down that basement...

110
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:14,201
and say, "Mr. Nugget, you the bomb.

111
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,971
"We selling chicken faster
than you can tear the bone out.

112
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:20,913
"So, I'm gonna write my clowny-ass name
on this fat-ass check for you."

113
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,708
Shit.

114
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:25,447
The nigger who invented them things...

115
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,715
still working in the basement
for regular wage...

116
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:31,156
thinking of some shit
to make the fries taste better.

117
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,654
Believe.

118
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:39,126
He still had the idea, though.

119
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,197
Who?

120
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:50,403
Polk and Pat Mahone.
A couple of drunks from Property.

121
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:52,275
-I don't know them.
-Why would you?

122
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:54,849
They haven't made a case in 10 years.

123
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,147
Also got handed some kid
named Prezbelowski or Prezbelewski--

124
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:01,347
-Pryzbylewski, him, I know.
-Yeah?

125
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:05,249
-Why was he in Casualty Section?
-He shot up his own car.

126
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,692
-You remember?
-He did what?

127
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:11,232
He fired two clips into an unmarked car,
somewhere out in West Baltimore.

128
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,235
Called in a Signal 13 on the radio,
like he was under fire from a sniper.

129
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:17,168
You didn't hear about that?

130
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,833
He stuck to his story for half a day,
until Ballistics matched the bullet...

131
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,342
to his off-duty weapon.

132
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:25,208
-We almost indicted him for false report.
-Why didn't you?

133
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:28,545
He's got some kind of suction
with the Mayor's office. I'm not sure.

134
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,744
My point is, I can't build much
with the garbage they sent me.

135
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:34,948
So, go to the deputy, right?
You've got his ear on this.

136
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:38,184
Why not?

137
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,491
I ask the deputy for manpower.

138
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:44,054
He then tells Property to send me two men,
and Special to send two more.

139
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,428
And those shift lieutenants...

140
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:47,627
they know it's a chance
to dump their deadwood.

141
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:50,000
The deputy, he knows this, too.

142
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:52,835
He could have offered
to let me pick but he didn't.

143
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:55,501
-He sent me a message on this.
-And the message is?

144
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,806
Don't dig in, don't get fancy.

145
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,113
Put a quick charge on this Barksdale
and then get out.

146
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:04,310
If he sends me good police,
I might do good police work.

147
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,561
-But if the state's
attorney's office were to--

148
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:09,446
-No, no.

149
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,197
Rhonda, darling...

150
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:27,673
it's bad protocol for me to ask for help
and then trash the help I'm given.

151
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,676
-You, on the other hand--
-No way.

152
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:31,609
My office doesn't play that way.

153
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:34,307
You people staff your cases,
you bring us casework.

154
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,317
I cross that line, I
only piss everyone off.

155
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:42,589
Best I can do is tell my unit chief
that you drew shit.

156
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:43,988
He wants to take it upstairs...

157
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:46,253
call the deputy for operations,
that's his choice.

158
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,727
-That won't happen.
-Probably not.

159
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,800
Make lemonade.

160
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,018
Fuck!

161
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:21,558
Yo, Kima, where you taking us?

162
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,755
-Get down.
-What?

163
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:26,925
Jesus. You all ain't got no creep to you.

164
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,327
Pair of goddamn elephants.

165
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:35,235
A rusted nail just went through my shoe.

166
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:38,677
I'm gonna need a tetanus
to get behind this bullshit.

167
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:44,847
-Kima.
-Hand me that bag.

168
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,692
Kima, if you don't mind me asking...

169
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:57,191
when was it that you first figured
you liked women better than men?

170
00:12:57,766 --> 00:12:59,393
I mind you asking.

171
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:09,971
Gentlemen, what's going on there, guys?

172
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,569
-Testers, man, already out.
-No.

173
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:16,310
I'm not in need of your services, bro.
I'm offering my services to y'all.

174
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:17,783
What you got in the bag, man?

175
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:22,016
One thing a gentleman of color like better
than a new pair of downtown shoes...

176
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:24,092
is a downtown brim, right?

177
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,317
What's with the hats?

178
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,699
-Five-o!
-Five-o!

179
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:08,635
Shut it down!

180
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:19,573
Clean?

181
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:52,305
You ain't gonna put that one on me.
He a witness.

182
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:56,282
You picked that shit up off the ground,
so don't be trying to put shit on me.

183
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,751
Is that what you think I'm about?

184
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:01,952
Boy thinks I'm gonna dirty him.

185
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:04,091
Like y'all won't do it.

186
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:07,184
You Western knockos come here,
picking shit up off the ground...

187
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,263
putting it on whoever you damn well please.

188
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:10,831
Do I know you?

189
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:15,535
Let's understand each other.
I'm not Western District.

190
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:18,367
I'm not a knocko. I don't dirty people...

191
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:20,600
because I don't care
about a possession charge.

192
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,042
I'm a Murder Police,
I'm here about the bodies.

193
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:28,510
D'Angelo here knows that.
He remembers me from the trial, right?

194
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:32,553
I'm sitting in back there, behind Stringer,
watching, listening.

195
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:35,145
Y'all hassling me about that shit?

196
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:37,257
I thought you heard
what the jury had to say.

197
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,350
-Fuck the jury.
-Yeah, fuck the jury.

198
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:40,928
This is just us talking, right?

199
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:44,556
Just you, me, my partner and....
What did you say your name was?

200
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,963
I didn't say shit.

201
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,934
Just you, me, my partner and Mr. Shit here.

202
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:51,668
We're just talking
about how things go, right?

203
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:54,207
We are just sharing our thoughts here.

204
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,003
Bunk, a vial for your thoughts.

205
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,575
I'm thinking it's one
thing for one of you...

206
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,308
Iittle Terrace niggers
to shoot somebody in the lobby...

207
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,976
of the 221 building, you know?
Who gives a fuck?

208
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:06,110
-But when you ace a witness...
-A working man.

209
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:08,382
...who ain't even in the game....

210
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,822
You gonna act like this is news?

211
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:16,759
I tell you this, I don't know shit
about shit, but I do know this...

212
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:20,525
anyone who spend time witnessing shit,
you gonna get got.

213
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,734
I know that sounds kind of harsh,
but that's the way things go around here...

214
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:27,035
officer.

215
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,942
Let's roll.

216
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:46,357
That how you see things, D'Angelo?
Like your friend here?

217
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,627
I'm here trying to outfit niggers
with something to rile up some pussy.

218
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:58,763
You don't want to know,
Bubbles used to get that pussy.

219
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:02,268
I reckon the pussy ain't worth
what it used to be...

220
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:04,402
if you can do it without
a proper brim, right?

221
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:06,105
Come on, big man.

222
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,130
-Something's up.
-What?

223
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,537
Don't know.

224
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,635
Yo, Carv. Come here.

225
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:41,011
Listen, you see Bubbs
put a hat on anybody...

226
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:42,583
you take some pictures, all right?

227
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:44,675
-Yeah?
-Especially the red one.

228
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:47,914
If you see him put that red hat
on anybody's head...

229
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,684
snap your fucking fingers off.

230
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,315
Where you going?

231
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:55,357
Yo, Carv. Notice that most of the time...

232
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:58,193
it's like Kima thinks
she's above us or something?

233
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,064
I mean, I don't see any stripes
on her fucking sleeve...

234
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:02,636
I don't see that.

235
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,163
All I see is some stuck-up dyke bitch...

236
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:07,673
who ain't been in CID
half the time of you or me...

237
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,006
and she's fucking telling us what to do.

238
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:13,478
It ain't right. You think it's right?

239
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:17,416
Shut up for just a minute. I'm trying
to concentrate on this shit here.

240
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,822
Nice truck.

241
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:33,293
No? Makes your breath minty fresh.

242
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:36,393
Is you all gonna arrest me?
Then go the fuck ahead and arrest me.

243
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:37,562
If not, shut the fuck up.

244
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:39,264
-You want to get arrested?
-No.

245
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:42,172
-Shut the fuck up your own self.
-I'm out of here.

246
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:46,137
Hey, D'Angelo.
You better bend the fuck over.

247
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:48,106
Shit.

248
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:53,079
-You ain't got nothing else to do today?
-No, no, nothing.

249
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:56,248
Y'all ain't got no charge.

250
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:02,922
You're getting awfully close, man.
You new on the force or some shit?

251
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,366
All right, Dee.

252
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:44,665
Move it.

253
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,557
It's Greggs. Get me the lieutenant.

254
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:04,161
Prez? He's no good to anyone, he's a goof.

255
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:07,463
How is he my problem then?
How is he still carrying a gun and badge?

256
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,730
You know Valchek in Southeast?

257
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,829
-Yeah.
-Son-in-law.

258
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:15,768
I can't carry him on this.
You know who Special sent me?

259
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:17,708
-Who?
-Polk and Mahoney.

260
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:20,673
Between the two of them
I don't have a designated driver.

261
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:22,477
I heard you have someone from Pawnshop.

262
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,984
Lester Freamon? A cuddly housecat.

263
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:27,915
I don't think he can even find his gun.

264
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:31,556
Look, take Pryzbylewski back.

265
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,187
You know I can't. I would, but I can't.
I gave Valchek my word on it, okay?

266
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:37,822
I can't help it that Prez
is fucking the guy's daughter.

267
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:41,596
-If not for that, he's gone, no question.
-So, you got suction with Valchek?

268
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:44,570
If I cross him,
I'm fucked on the next round of promotions.

269
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:47,972
For Christ's sake,
I'm with you on the short list for major.

270
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:50,874
Valchek has suction
with the First District Democratic Club...

271
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:54,915
and they got suction with the Mayor,
and I'm the runt without a tit here.

272
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,708
I owe you, okay?

273
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:00,646
-So, give me Sydnor.
-No way.

274
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,154
Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.

275
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:04,088
He's my best man, you can't take him.

276
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:07,252
-I'm taking your worst, remember?
-How about Steinman?

277
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:10,798
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore,
I need a black guy for surveillance.

278
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:12,366
I need Sydnor.

279
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:16,526
-Jesus, know what Prez did this morning?
-Tell me.

280
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:20,197
He put a bullet through a wall,
dry-firing in the detail office.

281
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:21,633
Look, no promises.

282
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:24,541
You give me Sydnor,
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.

283
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:27,513
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever. Jesus Christ.

284
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:35,887
How did you handle the judge?

285
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:38,960
I told him we were looking
closely at the situation.

286
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,824
I asked him not to say anything publicly.

287
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:45,695
So, then he's not gonna go public, right?

288
00:21:47,502 --> 00:21:49,026
Judge Phelan called this morning...

289
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:52,300
crying about a witness
in his murder trial who was killed.

290
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:54,637
Did the judge say where he heard it?

291
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:57,143
He heard it from our man, McNulty.

292
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,276
That's his pipeline on this crap.

293
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:03,784
Pardon my French, but I got no problem
giving that asshole up at this point.

294
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:06,886
-I don't need people I can't trust.
-Yeah, who does?

295
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:10,151
The newspapers get hold of this,
it'll be a complete clusterfuck.

296
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:13,523
Okay, so the thing to do
is reassure the judge...

297
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:15,923
keep him off his damn soapbox.

298
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:18,524
An arrest or two would help.

299
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:21,428
What if it's true?

300
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:24,598
What if Barksdale ordered the murder
of a state's witness?

301
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:25,695
Are you serious?

302
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:28,537
Why would anyone do that
after the witness testifies?

303
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:31,578
-It has no effect on the case.
-Payback, plain and simple.

304
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,272
Bullshit, plain and simple.

305
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:36,316
Look, I know there could be
two dozen other reasons...

306
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:38,648
for this man to be murdered, but what if--

307
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:42,280
No money for pretrial.
No witness protection program.

308
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:46,292
Look, this is a poor
fucking city, gentlemen.

309
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,624
The last thing we ever need to do
is to announce we lost a witness.

310
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:53,594
I mean, it's hard enough
pushing felony casework...

311
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:55,169
through that courthouse as it is.

312
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,206
-You got to pull McNulty off this.
-Who caught the murder case?

313
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:02,572
-Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner.
-Then you'd have to pull him, too.

314
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:07,137
No, we pull McNulty up,
the judge will bring the press into this.

315
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:09,307
I can see that a mile away.

316
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:13,485
No, we're gonna sit tight,
let McNulty take his best shot...

317
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:16,148
and hope like hell he comes up short.

318
00:23:18,393 --> 00:23:21,624
How do you wanna handle this?
We got nothing on him.

319
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,664
We try to front, he'll
see right through us.

320
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:25,733
He's scared though. Soft.

321
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,328
Go with the deuce?

322
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:31,035
Hold up, hold up.

323
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:39,740
-He part of my case?
-No, sir.

324
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:42,608
He's a potential suspect in my murder.

325
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,683
Which might be part of my case.

326
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:52,526
I could use some coffee.
You want some coffee?

327
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:59,698
-I need a word with you.
-We're just about to go--

328
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:00,825
Now.

329
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:07,071
You remember all that bullshit I gave you
about keeping me informed...

330
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:09,735
about nothing happening
that I don't know about?

331
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:11,141
-Lieutenant--
-Wasn't bullshit.

332
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:14,704
My partner caught a murder.
It may have nothing with Barksdale at all.

333
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:16,716
I just came from Deputy Ops' office...

334
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:19,343
where your own major's
telling Burrell to do you.

335
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:21,820
You hear me? Rawls is giving you up.

336
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:25,188
-What the fuck did I do?
-You can't shut your mouth.

337
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,127
You think that downtown judge
is gonna bail your ass out on this?

338
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,393
You really think that?
You should have come to me.

339
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:35,297
We bring this business to the deputy first,
we got a shot.

340
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:37,769
But no, you're out there all alone,
jumping bad.

341
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:40,033
-You got the deputy's ear?
-On this case, I do.

342
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:42,939
Then how come they sent
every worthless hump in plainclothes?

343
00:24:43,044 --> 00:24:46,275
You ask for men,
they send you drunks and fuck-ups.

344
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,381
I want to do this case.

345
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:51,678
So do l.

346
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:54,414
Then you're gonna get
all the way in, Lieutenant.

347
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:58,925
If I see you get all the way in,
then I know who you are, what you're about.

348
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:02,463
-Who is he?
-D'Angelo Barksdale.

349
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:05,894
-Nephew to the king.
-That's the one that beat the murder?

350
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,297
Yeah, him.

351
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:09,968
What do you have
to connect him to the dead witness?

352
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:13,063
-Not a thing.
-Why did you pick him up?

353
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:17,406
Press him. See what kind of flex he shows.

354
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,944
-She goes in with you.
-We don't need her.

355
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:24,251
Bunk and me, we got our own rhythm.

356
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:28,118
You want me in, McNulty?
I thought you said you wanted me in.

357
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:34,354
You're along for this interview,
but it's Homicide's play, so let him lead.

358
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,728
You might want to run
tag and title on these two trucks.

359
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:45,101
-They scoped us when we jacked the kid.
-Been there.

360
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:47,966
Info's already in the file.

361
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:51,445
Y'all weren't the only lawmen
down in the Canyon today.

362
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:54,606
-Really, where were you?
-Where was she?

363
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:05,392
I mean, the thing is, I can't see
a reason for that man to be dead.

364
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:08,594
I can't. I mean, hell,
you beat us in court.

365
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:10,664
-We don't take it personal.
-Fuck, no.

366
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:14,531
We get paid either way. And it's not
like you did anything real bad...

367
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,137
throwing a couple of hot ones
at Pooh Blanchard.

368
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:19,172
No one's gonna miss that motherfucker.

369
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,742
But you know the man
who got killed this time?

370
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:23,970
You know who that
poor son of a bitch was?

371
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:25,204
A citizen.

372
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:28,544
Worked every goddamn day of his life.
You know that?

373
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:32,344
He would get up every day,
go out and do maintenance work.

374
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:35,251
Then on the weekends,
he was driving a cab out to the airport.

375
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:36,584
Two jobs.

376
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:39,489
And he volunteers what little time
he has left at his church.

377
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:42,392
-Church-going man.
-A bethel man, a deacon.

378
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:46,694
Two jobs and three kids.
Did you know that?

379
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,331
Three kids. Young, too.

380
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:52,666
Five, eight, eleven.

381
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,006
Crying their little
orphaned asses to sleep...

382
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,408
'cause they lost their mama
some years ago...

383
00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:01,004
and now they out there on their own.

384
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:07,417
-He doesn't believe us.
-I know he don't believe it.

385
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:10,682
We've been here two hours,
telling you what's true in the world...

386
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,453
and you sit like nothing happened.

387
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,652
Where my lawyer at?

388
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:15,922
We called him.
When he comes, we'll let you know.

389
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,793
I got nothing to say.

390
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:20,730
I mean, I'm sorry for the man,
but I ain't got nothing to say.

391
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:24,464
You sorry? You sorry for him?
You fucking killed the man.

392
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:26,301
-No.
-Yes, you did.

393
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:30,002
We don't think that you shot him,
but if you weren't so busy...

394
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,806
Iighting folks up in high-rise lobby...

395
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:34,279
he ain't coming out of the elevator
and see it happen.

396
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,179
He don't see anything, he doesn't testify.

397
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:38,980
He doesn't testify,
those kids still got a daddy to lean on.

398
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,816
-Why'd he testify?
-How would we know?

399
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:44,187
-He didn't have to testify.
-No, he didn't, but he did.

400
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:46,055
And you still beat the charge, didn't you?

401
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,890
But that wasn't enough.
It's not enough to beat the murder.

402
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:51,625
They gotta send a cold message
to everyone in the Terrace.

403
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:55,396
Fuck the working man.
Fuck his kids, that shit don't count.

404
00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:00,465
See, that's what I don't get
about the drug thing.

405
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:04,102
Why can't you sell the shit
and walk the fuck away?

406
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:07,778
You know what I mean? Everything
else in this country gets sold...

407
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:10,077
without people shooting each other
behind it.

408
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:13,085
In the Terrace, it's one
body after another.

409
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:15,556
You remember that little boy...

410
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:19,420
got shot in the barbershop
on West Lombard last summer?

411
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:23,723
One asshole chases another into a house...

412
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:25,423
empties a 9.

413
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,434
Bullshit argument over
20 missing gelcaps...

414
00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:32,233
and that little kid,
instead of getting his first haircut...

415
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,137
he gets one in the eye.

416
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:36,232
You remember that?

417
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:38,413
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.

418
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:39,243
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.

419
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:43,608
They didn't have to do that.

420
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:45,652
Shoot up a barber shop?

421
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,420
No, they did not have to do that.

422
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:52,889
That man was just...

423
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,692
my thing.

424
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,860
My thing, they ain't had....

425
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:05,195
They ain't had to do that.

426
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:16,280
No mama and no daddy.

427
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:18,716
Lord Jesus!

428
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:27,058
I'll tell you what I think
you should do, D'Angelo...

429
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:30,493
not because I think you wanted that man
to get shot...

430
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:33,123
or had anything to do with shooting him.

431
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:36,601
But I think you could just sit here...

432
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,930
for a moment or two,
collect your thoughts...

433
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,406
you know, get your shit together.

434
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:44,011
And then I think it might
be a good thing...

435
00:29:44,112 --> 00:29:47,445
for you to write a little letter
to those children...

436
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:50,210
and you let them know you're sorry...

437
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:54,949
that they're not gonna
have anyone left, you know?

438
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:58,358
I mean, just say something.

439
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:01,553
Tell them how you personally
think your uncle...

440
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:04,756
maybe he got it wrong this time,
because it's wrong...

441
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:08,495
that they lost their daddy
behind what happened, you know?

442
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:14,773
It might mean something to them to know
that you're feeling for them.

443
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:23,948
Man, I ain't got nothing to say.

444
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:27,581
Just say what's in your heart.

445
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:51,611
Church deacon? That was thick.

446
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:53,976
Got good to me, what can I say?

447
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:57,846
It's sad enough with the kids
being orphaned and everything.

448
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:00,413
Photo was from Bunk's desk.

449
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,088
-They're yours?
-Yeah, afraid so.

450
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:08,921
Good thing they look like their mama.

451
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:12,725
Maurice Levy just posted.
He's by the elevators.

452
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:23,205
-The defense never rests.
-Shame on you, McNulty.

453
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:26,178
Dragging me from the Levy family preserve
on a Friday night.

454
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,771
-My apologies.
-Yvette made brisket.

455
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:31,351
-Good?
-When served hot. One or two?

456
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,181
Your client.

457
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:36,156
What the fuck! Stop writing! Now!

458
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,952
-I'm just--
-Shut up!

459
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:41,822
He calls his lawyer, that's supposed to be
the end of the interview.

460
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:44,295
Your client gave no statement,
we took no statement.

461
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,198
He just decided, voluntarily,
to write a letter to the victim's family.

462
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:50,566
-To say that--
-Shut up!

463
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,965
-Any charge here?
-No charge.

464
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:58,671
Good, get up. Go! Walk!

465
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:03,476
Listen to me, you don't say anything...

466
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,109
you don't do anything,
you don't write anything.

467
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,278
Do you hear me?

468
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:08,582
Shut up!

469
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:12,819
How many times do I have to tell you people
the same fucking thing?

470
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,168
What the fuck is that?

471
00:32:32,113 --> 00:32:36,106
Armoire. Louis Quatorze.

472
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:39,543
I mean, what is it, a toy?

473
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:44,450
Some of you I know.
Some of you I will know.

474
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:48,228
If you've ever worked with me before,
you know I don't want cowboy shit...

475
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:50,092
and I don't want surprises.

476
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:51,931
The task...

477
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:59,334
is Avon Barksdale,
and Avon Barksdale only.

478
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,875
No sidetrips, no sprawl.

479
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:06,874
Primary investigators
are Greggs from my unit and--

480
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:13,547
Greggs from my unit
and McNulty from Homicide.

481
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:17,654
They keep the file.
On the street, we work partners.

482
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,220
Greggs and Sydnor. Herc and Carver.

483
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:24,894
McNulty's with Santangelo,
Mahone and Polk.

484
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:27,200
Pryzbylewski and Freamon.

485
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:29,668
To start with, we got nine--

486
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,170
How's that? Did that get it?

487
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:35,542
What? Do you hear me?

488
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,336
What?

489
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,342
To start with, we have
nine or ten open homicide files...

490
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,577
to work back through for leads.

491
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:47,583
McNulty and Santangelo,
they're on that already.

492
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:51,681
Herc, Carver, Sydnor, and me,
we'll be targeting street dealers...

493
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,352
and rolling them back up
at Barksdale's people.

494
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:57,625
Polk and Mahone are available
to run down specific leads.

495
00:33:57,732 --> 00:34:00,132
Freamon, Pryzbylewski,
are gonna start in-office...

496
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:01,633
on clerical duty.

497
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:05,172
-You need a prosecutor--
-No, turn the shit off!

498
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:06,966
What?

499
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,040
You need a prosecutor.

500
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:12,874
Rhonda Pearlman from Narcotics
is assigned.

501
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:17,278
Now, we don't have enough desks yet,
so we gotta share--

502
00:34:17,385 --> 00:34:19,785
-Y'all from Purchasing?
-No.

503
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:28,621
Like I was saying, we've been promised
some computers...

504
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,560
and surveillance equipment.

505
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:34,600
-Questions?
-Yeah, who signs the overtime slips?

506
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:37,499
No OT, unless prior authorization.

507
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:41,234
A case goes from red to black
by way of green, Lieutenant.

508
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:44,267
You people bring me
something that needs OT...

509
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:45,936
you'll get OT...

510
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:49,539
until then, live on your fucking salaries.

511
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:06,233
"I'm very sorry for your father.
If I could've stopped it, I would have."

512
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,163
What can you do with this?

513
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,703
Nothing legally.

514
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:14,366
He doesn't put himself in,
or anyone else for that matter.

515
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,403
You can't read that letter...

516
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,842
and think that man was killed
for any other reason...

517
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:20,072
than he was a witness.

518
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:23,582
Why apologize at all
if you got nothing to do with it?

519
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:31,582
We lost a state's witness.

520
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:35,125
Even in Baltimore,
that's supposed to mean something, right?

521
00:35:35,229 --> 00:35:37,459
Just go to the deputy,
show him what's what...

522
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:39,430
and let's put something real together.

523
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:43,060
This case needs informants.
It needs long-term surveillance.

524
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,570
And eventually,
it's gonna need a Title 3 wiretap.

525
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:49,541
Most of all, it needs police who know
how to work those things.

526
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,144
You think it's good for business
to put it out on the street...

527
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:54,441
that our witnesses get killed?

528
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:57,016
You think it's not on the street already?

529
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:01,721
No grandstanding, no red balls.

530
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:04,552
Like I said, we get in and out.

531
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:22,904
Aunt June.

532
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:28,446
Yeah, I hope you're hungry.

533
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:29,777
Starving.

534
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:31,746
Hey, Dee!

535
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,314
What's up, baby?

536
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:36,412
-That your uncle?
-Yeah.

537
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:38,852
I thought he'd look different.

538
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:41,928
My man, Dee. What's up, man?

539
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:43,792
This the little man?

540
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:47,723
Yo, you see how shorty
favor your nephew here?

541
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:51,696
What's up, little man?
You ain't gonna be able to deny that child.

542
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:55,741
You wanna come to me?
I know you tryin' to come to me.

543
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:57,606
-Been napping.
-Yeah?

544
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:58,769
Just woke up.

545
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,779
You got a grip, let me see your grip.

546
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:03,315
C'mon, give us a twirl, let's take a look.

547
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:06,980
What you looking at?

548
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:09,021
-Go fix her a hot plate.
-All right.

549
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:11,819
Put everything on it.
She's the skinniest thing in here.

550
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:13,484
Come on, girl, we gonna hook you up.

551
00:37:13,594 --> 00:37:15,755
Don't let that fool you, she can eat, man.

552
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:19,731
-How y'all doing? You doing good?
-Yeah, we all right.

553
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,802
She want me to move in,
I'm thinking about it.

554
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,238
Let's walk.

555
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:24,795
Let's walk.

556
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,375
Here you come.
You gonna take my man from me?

557
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:30,534
Yeah.

558
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:33,309
Be careful with my little soldier.

559
00:37:34,114 --> 00:37:36,378
-Got a name for that one?
-No.

560
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:40,248
But he's one of the boys
they use in the stairwell.

561
00:37:40,354 --> 00:37:42,822
-What about him?
-That's Little Man.

562
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:44,922
He's muscle.

563
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,159
You know his real name?

564
00:37:49,563 --> 00:37:51,997
-Cl?
-Yeah.

565
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:55,334
-You need some privacy?
-No, it's all right.

566
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,867
He's cool.

567
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,903
What's with the hat?

568
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,234
Go ahead, tell him, Bubbles.

569
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:08,642
I go down the way
with some hats that I'm selling.

570
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,183
If someone is someone you need to know...

571
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:14,482
I put the red hat on them
and Kima here take the pictures.

572
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:16,588
If they in the mix, they get another color.

573
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,385
If they ain't shit, they don't get shit.

574
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:20,892
Everyone in the hat's
part of Barksdale's crew?

575
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:22,485
At the Terrace.

576
00:38:22,863 --> 00:38:25,195
We haven't hit the low-rises yet.

577
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,632
That's sharp.

578
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,264
I like that.

579
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,065
Bubbles does not forget a face.

580
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:34,470
Ain't so good with names,
but, you know, faces I keep in my head.

581
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:38,272
I used to take him down to Escape Unit,
let him look through the warrant books.

582
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:42,748
He'd call me up that night, telling
me to go to this corner, that corner.

583
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:45,681
Yeah, paid $25 a pop.

584
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,311
-That's good money.
-Yeah.

585
00:38:48,856 --> 00:38:51,256
How much does the hat routine pay?

586
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:52,986
Nothing.

587
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:55,119
We free on this.

588
00:38:57,364 --> 00:39:00,595
-Motherfuckers beat my boy down.
-Who?

589
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:02,999
Little hoppers in the low-rises.

590
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:04,536
Who's your boy?

591
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:06,162
I got a friend.

592
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:08,702
Younger white boy.

593
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:11,471
Used to come down to the corners,
real green.

594
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:13,443
I was schooling him, you know?

595
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:15,014
What happened?

596
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:19,247
-They stomped him.
-You see it?

597
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:25,690
Fuck a man like that up
for a couple dollars, you know?

598
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:28,626
He still at University,
tubes all up in his nose.

599
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:31,220
Can't say but a fucking word or two.

600
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:35,595
But you know, that's how it goes, right?

601
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:38,368
How you feeling, Bubbles?

602
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:40,435
Restless.

603
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:44,271
Yeah, I could tell.

604
00:39:44,578 --> 00:39:45,636
What the fuck?

605
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:48,271
Can you hook a nigger up with
$10 then till tomorrow?

606
00:39:48,382 --> 00:39:51,146
I mean, you know, just to carry me, Kima.

607
00:39:57,424 --> 00:39:58,516
Bubbles.

608
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:02,156
Obliged.

609
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:06,532
Stay out of the projects
the next couple of days...

610
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:07,861
just to be safe.

611
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:10,232
Girl's always fretting over me.

612
00:40:11,772 --> 00:40:13,831
-Change it up, Bubs.
-Yeah, yeah.

613
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:15,340
Go Eastside.

614
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:16,940
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,246
$20?

616
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:24,684
-You gonna spoil him with that shit.
-I respect the work.

617
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:31,317
They used your name, Stringer, Wee-Bey...

618
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:33,690
Savino, Peanut....

619
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:37,422
They knew a lot of names. They knew a lot.

620
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:39,522
But you didn't say nothing?

621
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:42,765
Shit, man, I don't know nothing.

622
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,228
What was you writing then?

623
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,774
Yo, they was talking about
the man who got killed...

624
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:50,468
and his kids, they asked me to write.

625
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:53,705
-What you got to do with them, Dee?
-Yeah, that's what I said.

626
00:40:53,814 --> 00:40:56,339
Then they cried
about how the kids ain't doing so good.

627
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,851
I'm like, it ain't gonna hurt for me
to say I'm sorry the man got killed.

628
00:40:59,953 --> 00:41:02,353
Why the fuck you gotta say you're sorry?

629
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:04,924
Motherfuckers tried to
put your ass in the stir.

630
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:07,220
Yeah, but it didn't turn out that way.

631
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:10,626
You know, that's what I'm saying,
it's a shame that y'all....

632
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:17,064
I'm saying, it's a shame
what happened to that man, all right?

633
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:19,696
'Cause he didn't do anything
but come off the elevator...

634
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:22,708
when I was doing that thing
that I was doing.

635
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:26,143
What you think, cuz?

636
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:28,341
About what?

637
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:31,077
I'm saying, what you think
about what happened to the man?

638
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:33,619
You think we killed the motherfucker?

639
00:41:35,556 --> 00:41:37,114
Speak your mind.

640
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:42,819
-Man, I don't know.
-Exactly.

641
00:41:43,163 --> 00:41:45,063
You don't know,
and you don't need to know.

642
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:48,532
And if we did, we had a reason.
And if we didn't, we had a reason.

643
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:51,502
But either way,
you ain't got shit to do with it.

644
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:53,602
It ain't on you, cuz.

645
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,369
You feel me? It ain't on you.

646
00:41:57,344 --> 00:41:59,608
Now, if you get jacked again...

647
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:02,944
I don't want to hear shit about
you writing nothing to no one.

648
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,018
-Got it?
-Yeah.

649
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:09,088
Come on, let's have some good times...

650
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:12,647
and get some ribs
before they done ate all the ribs up.

651
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:17,357
-This case isn't shit, Carv.
-I know it.

652
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:21,127
We're dancing around
with this motherfucker, typing shit out...

653
00:42:21,235 --> 00:42:23,465
taking pictures of assholes in hats.

654
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,731
-What the fuck is that?
-It's bullshit.

655
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,706
I say we go down there right now.
Right fucking now.

656
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:31,403
We go into those towers,
and we let them know.

657
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,277
I'm serious.

658
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:37,612
You got to let these motherfuckers know
who you are.

659
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:40,117
You coming?

660
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:43,983
-I'm with you.
-Carv?

661
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:48,217
What the hell?

662
00:42:48,962 --> 00:42:50,327
Let's do it.

663
00:42:55,736 --> 00:42:56,930
Come on.

664
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,648
Shut it down. Five-O.

665
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:16,248
Five-O, five-O, break out.

666
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,641
Yo, come here, man.
Come here, where you going?

667
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:40,008
Don't act like you don't know me.
Get your hands up.

668
00:43:40,113 --> 00:43:41,546
Put that down.

669
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:45,345
-Drop that shit! Kiss the fucking ground!
-Put your hands up.

670
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,618
Don't look at me like I
ain't talking English.

671
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:52,385
You got a needle on you?
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?

672
00:43:52,626 --> 00:43:55,186
No? What's that?

673
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:57,687
What you got in your pockets?

674
00:43:57,798 --> 00:43:59,959
You know what?
Put your pants down, man.

675
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:02,092
Put your pants down
and get down on the ground.

676
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:04,500
Get down on the fucking ground!

677
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,838
All right, spread your shit out.

678
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:11,843
Nice shoes. Think a happy thought.

679
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:18,179
Why don't you go somewhere else
with that bullshit?

680
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,885
No-good motherfuckers.

681
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:24,287
Stay down, man, stay down.

682
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:27,326
Y'all can let Barksdale and them know
who owns these towers.

683
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:28,826
'Cause we're coming back.

684
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:30,829
-I'm sick of this shit.
-Kiss my ass!

685
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:33,627
We roll out, come back in an hour,
catch everybody dirty.

686
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:34,826
You'll see how that goes.

687
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:37,199
-That's bullshit, man.
-Yo, stay down, man.

688
00:44:37,304 --> 00:44:40,364
That's fucked up. Man ain't did nothing.

689
00:44:41,642 --> 00:44:43,166
Want something?

690
00:44:48,148 --> 00:44:51,049
-Move, shitbird.
-I ain't doing nothing.

691
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,148
Really? I got nothing for you.

692
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:02,153
-My eye, my eye.
-Who you gonna eyefuck now?

693
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:06,122
Are you serious?

694
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:08,531
You bleed on my car?
Don't bleed on my car.

695
00:45:08,635 --> 00:45:10,569
Get your shit off my car.

696
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:19,308
What the fuck's the matter with you?

697
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,233
Got a visual?

698
00:45:42,669 --> 00:45:43,693
Fuck.

699
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:45,794
Get the radio.

700
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,109
1 1 :35, Signal 13.

701
00:45:50,577 --> 00:45:52,841
771 Franklin, in the Court.

702
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:54,675
Son of a bitch!

703
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:57,773
Shots fired, shots fired.
Officers need assistance.

704
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:01,115
I'm hit! Signal 13.

705
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:03,314
Officer down, Officer down!

706
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:11,955
Shit!

707
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:35,086
-Hello?
-You seen the paper?

708
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:38,152
-What?
-The newspaper, get it.

709
00:46:55,976 --> 00:46:57,375
Hey, kids.

710
00:47:19,266 --> 00:47:20,824
Oh, no.

711
00:47:22,669 --> 00:47:23,863
You happy now, bitch?

712
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,968
McNulty!

713
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:30,834
Where in fuck is he?

714
00:47:30,944 --> 00:47:34,641
He's detailed, Major, to Narcotics--

715
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:38,149
I fucking know where he's detailed.
I fucking already know that!

716
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:39,218
Yes, sir.

717
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:42,220
-Where is he right now?
-I can page him, sir.

718
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,685
Move that fucking desk out of my unit.

719
00:47:48,795 --> 00:47:51,662
I do not want that
fucking man's desk in my unit.

720
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:53,892
That's Crutchfield's desk.

721
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:57,793
Crutchfield's?

722
00:47:58,238 --> 00:47:59,865
McNulty sits here.

723
00:48:06,947 --> 00:48:10,405
-What the fuck was that about?
-Did you see today's paper?

724
00:48:10,517 --> 00:48:13,577
-Just sports.
-You gotta check out the front page.

725
00:48:19,626 --> 00:48:22,789
-What do you think they'll do to him?
-Let me tell you something.

726
00:48:22,896 --> 00:48:26,525
If he gets caught with his dick up the ass
of the deputy's wife...

727
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:31,468
he's still gonna have more of a career than
if they find out he's behind that story.

728
00:48:52,993 --> 00:48:54,358
Lieutenant.

729
00:48:55,629 --> 00:49:00,066
I saw the story in the paper.
I want you to know I had nothing to do....

730
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:23,249
-They jumped us, Boss.
-Who?

731
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:25,758
Fucking project niggers.

732
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,851
What are you doing here
at 2:00 in the morning?

733
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:32,426
Field interviews, sir, police work.

734
00:49:32,532 --> 00:49:34,591
-Police work?
-Yeah.

735
00:49:37,103 --> 00:49:41,301
I got a 14-year-old in critical
but stable condition at University...

736
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:43,467
and two witnesses who say
one of you princes...

737
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:45,544
cold-cocked him
with the butt-end of a pistol.

738
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:47,476
-No, sir.
-I got his mother over at lID...

739
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,639
filing a formal brutality charge...

740
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:52,445
which for Herc will make an even four
in the last two years.

741
00:49:52,552 --> 00:49:54,452
-None sustained.
-But all of them true.

742
00:49:54,554 --> 00:49:55,612
We thought that--

743
00:49:55,722 --> 00:49:58,282
I got one less Crown Vic
than I had last night.

744
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:00,859
I'm out two Kevlar vests
that burned in the car...

745
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:03,327
two hand-held radios, a shotgun...

746
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,866
and I'm about to lose this idiot here
for a week or two of medical.

747
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,400
And for what?

748
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:11,697
What did you all learn
when you went to the Terrace...

749
00:50:11,805 --> 00:50:14,330
at 2:00 in the morning
to conduct field interviews?

750
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:18,207
What valuable information did
we acquire from this situation?

751
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:24,380
IID is gonna be on all three of you
by afternoon...

752
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:27,452
and if you don't get a story straight
by then...

753
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:31,923
you're gonna have a file thick enough
to see the light of a trial board.

754
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:36,790
Now tell me, who cold-cocked the kid?

755
00:50:45,672 --> 00:50:46,730
Me.

756
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,368
Why?

757
00:50:53,446 --> 00:50:55,073
He pissed me off.

758
00:50:58,485 --> 00:51:01,682
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,
he did not piss you off.

759
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:07,219
He made you fear for your safety
and that of your fellow officers.

760
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:10,353
I'm guessing now, but maybe...

761
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,728
he was seen to pick up a bottle
and menace officers Hauk and Carver...

762
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:17,064
both of whom had already sustained injury
from flying projectiles.

763
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,730
Rather than use deadly force
in such a situation...

764
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,242
maybe you elected to approach the youth,
ordering him to drop the bottle.

765
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:27,172
Maybe when he raised the bottle
in a threatening manner...

766
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,681
you used a Kel-Light,
not the handle of your service weapon...

767
00:51:30,784 --> 00:51:32,911
to incapacitate the suspect.

768
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:36,654
Go practice.

769
00:51:37,424 --> 00:51:40,222
You fuck the bullshit up
when you talk to lnternal...

770
00:51:40,326 --> 00:51:42,886
I can't fix it, you're on your own.

771
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:54,634
-Push the arraignments back to 3:00.
-And the Gillette case?

772
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:57,767
The Gillette trial goes back
on the move docket.

773
00:51:57,877 --> 00:52:00,471
Come on, walk with me. I'm running late.

774
00:52:02,882 --> 00:52:05,077
-It wasn't me.
-The story quoted you.

775
00:52:05,185 --> 00:52:08,245
Reporter has the story confirmed
when he calls me about the quote.

776
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:09,582
What am I gonna say?

777
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:13,455
No, he wasn't a witness? No, he
didn't testify in my court last week?

778
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,686
What?

779
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:17,088
You don't think it's around
about the witness?

780
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:20,132
Lawyers, clerks, jurors, everybody talks.

781
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:23,725
-I'm in the shit here, Your Honor.
-What can I tell you?

782
00:52:23,837 --> 00:52:27,170
I called the deputy, not the newspapers.
I gotta run.

783
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:35,405
-You should have hung them.
-If I hang them, I hang myself.

784
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:37,940
I'm the man in charge, remember?

785
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:41,043
Besides, you don't
give your people up to lID.

786
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:42,982
You don't do that.

787
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:46,422
Even if they put
a 14-year-old kid into Critical Care?

788
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,498
This case, it's just....

789
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:54,633
Get out of it.

790
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:58,100
-How do I do that?
-I don't know.

791
00:52:58,204 --> 00:53:00,729
But you can't lose if you don't play.

792
00:53:01,975 --> 00:53:05,411
I always heard it
that you can't win if you don't play.

793
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:08,269
The department puts you on a case
it doesn't want.

794
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:11,441
You're given people
that are useless or untrustworthy.

795
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,779
Correct.

796
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:15,551
If you push too hard,
and any shit hits the fan...

797
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:17,589
you'll be blamed for it.

798
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:18,983
Correct.

799
00:53:19,092 --> 00:53:23,586
If you don't push hard enough, and there's
no arrest, you'll be blamed for that, too.

800
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:24,958
Correct.

801
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:26,860
The game is rigged.

802
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,162
But you cannot lose if you do not play.

803
00:54:14,614 --> 00:54:16,343
In the hole, y'all.

804
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:23,006
Hey!

805
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:25,946
Hey, you fuckheads!

806
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:31,388
Hey, police!

807
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:02,845
-Hello.
-Lieutenant Daniels?

808
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:04,013
Yeah.

809
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,267
Who was that?

810
00:56:16,436 --> 00:56:19,701
It was the duty officer
down at University hospital.

811
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:21,296
What happened?

812
00:56:22,775 --> 00:56:25,335
-He's blind in one eye.
-Who?

813
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:30,010
The kid. The 14-year-old.
