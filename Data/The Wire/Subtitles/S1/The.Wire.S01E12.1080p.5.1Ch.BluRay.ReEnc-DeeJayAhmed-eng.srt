1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,011
How is she?

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,649
In and out of the morphine drip.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,921
They got her stabilized is all I know.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,361
Go on in.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,001
No.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,285
Unfreeze your ass off that wall, then.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,969
Either pay your respects
or get your head back into this case.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,281
- Fuck this case.
- Fuck it?

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,087
You're just gonna call off your little crusade?

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,689
Is that what you think it was? A crusade?

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,051
Avon Barksdale was a way

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,565
to show everyone how smart I was

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,641
and how fucked up

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,926
the department is, that's all.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,241
Just put Jimmy McNulty

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,446
up on your shoulders,

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,806
march him round the room,

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,845
break out the keg.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,371
It was never about
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,410
It was all about me.

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,520
You think I didn't know that?

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,767
You think we all didn't know?

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,244
Listen. This case is gonna
move forward with you or without you.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,651
This case got her shot.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,725
I put a battery up her ass

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,882
and got her thinking it meant something.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,841
And you know what?

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,361
Burrell, Rawls, and them, they were right.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,642
This case means exactly shit.

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,811
Well, I know it meant damn near nothing to me
when you came in beating the drum.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,001
But now we got that woman in there,
that good police,

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,681
breathing through a fucking tube
because it meant something to her.

33
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,328
And the shooters who dropped Kima?
They're still in the wind.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,200
And whoever sent those motherfuckers
into that alley, he needs to get got, too.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,762
You can stand there dripping with
liquor smell and self-pity if you got a mind to,

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,402
but this case, it means something. Now.

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,529
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,607
<i>You better watch your back</i>

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,448
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,450
<i>Walk the straight and narrow track</i>

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,726
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,926
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

43
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,291
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,129
<i>Down in the hole</i>

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,764
<i>All the angels sing</i>

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,046
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,762
<i>And they shield you with their wings</i>

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,811
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

49
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,531
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,122
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

51
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,610
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,605
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

53
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,888
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,926
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,283
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,286
You hit them again?

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,646
I been calling all morning.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,324
They ain't hit me back yet.

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,165
Damn, we gonna tap out by noon.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,407
Yo, Poot! What we got over there?

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,411
200, maybe.

62
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,008
- Shit.
- (Distant shouting)

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,445
What the fuck is this?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,923
What the fuck you think, nigger? Fish food.

65
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,687
Give me my shit.

66
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,405
Heads up.

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,560
String.

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,644
I need your pagers.
All y'all, the whole crew.

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,363
- Who else?
- Sterling, Cass and Manny.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,366
- Go get them shits.
- How am I gonna talk to my girl?

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,488
Talk to your hand.
That's the only girl you got.

72
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,484
No more. Get out of here.
Just get the fuck out of here, man.

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,090
No more pagers.
Touts, lookouts, off the air, all right?

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,562
Nobody gonna use these cellphones
except for you and Bodie,

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,491
and y'all don't say shit on these,
you understand?

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,967
We the only niggers that need them numbers.

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,044
Not your moms, not your girl, nobody.
You feel me?

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,891
You use these phones to set up a meet,
go to that meet and talk face to face, period.

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,323
- So no more payphones?
- You deaf? I said no phones.

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,568
How I'm gonna reach y'all?

81
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,243
All right, top number's for re-ups,

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,411
second number's for muscle.

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,084
You need me, hit me on the third number.

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,843
Learn them shits, then throw that shit away.

85
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,331
You doing this in the towers, too?

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,210
Doing it everywhere. Payphones is dead.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,567
All right?

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,641
Yeah.

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,328
Yo, String. We need some re-up, man.

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,321
Re-up from where? You niggers ain't heard?
Narcos took the main stash.

91
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,448
Why the fuck you think we changing up?

92
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,522
Back the fuck up, young'un.
These shits ain't for you.

93
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,400
All right.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,843
Cool. There you go.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,606
There we go. All right.

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,082
The gift of corrected vision.

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,242
Compliments of the BPD.

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,886
Dang, y'all are focused.

99
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,849
What man wouldn't be?

100
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,961
Excuse me.

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,047
They been cleaning us for a few days.

102
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,006
- Last night they burned us all the way.
- I knew it. I fucking knew it.

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,490
- I'm in this motherfucker's head.
- Not a message since early morning.

104
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,809
I had to cut Prez loose.

105
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,281
- Send him down to Annapolis.
- For what?

106
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,651
State finance reports. I checked the stuff
here but Barksdale's money has legs.

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,520
Shit. All the work we did
to get up on this fucking wire.

108
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,843
You don't hit these guys
and expect them to stay in the pocket.

109
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,003
- They know they dropped a police.
- We need to change up, too.

110
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,523
Come on. Shardene. Honey, this is
Detective McNulty who's working with us.

111
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,527
She works at Orlando's,
helping us out there from time to time.

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,241
And now I think that she can see
well enough to match faces to voices.

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,403
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm scared of this shit.

114
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,246
Time comes, though,
I know you gonna step up.

115
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,291
We need Pearlman
to approve her wearing a wire.

116
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,722
- Can I get a coffee?
- How do you take it?

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,765
I'll get it. A little cream, right?

118
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,726
Those narco motherfuckers
cleaned my shit out.

119
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,003
You can replace product and currency.

120
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,161
He right.

121
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,370
- We gotta focus on what's real here.
- All of this shit is real. All of it.

122
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,726
They wanna put me in a box.

123
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,006
I think what's important is to take stock.

124
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,687
Ask yourself what's
out there that can hurt you.

125
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,443
Where are you weak?
Where you need to clean up?

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,210
Think it through.

127
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,367
Start with Orlando, if Orlando rolled.

128
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,723
You know he talked about the club, at least.

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,644
That punk-ass nigger
ain't talk about shit else.

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,882
That's all he knew about. He wasn't with us.

131
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,405
We kept him on the outside.

132
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,609
So you walk away from the club.

133
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,921
You're not on the license,
you're not a listed owner.

134
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,722
- They can't make a connect.
- When did this shit start up?

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,410
About the time
that your nephew beat that charge.

136
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,762
When they found that witness with the lead
in his dome, the shit hit the newspapers.

137
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,366
But around that time,
the cops was on our shit.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,524
The security guard
whose testimony sprung D'Angelo.

139
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,650
- Nakeisha Lyles?
- Bug-eyed ass bitch. But we hooked that up.

140
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,965
- So she can still hurt you, right?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,690
The point is anybody
who can hurt you can be put into play.

142
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,445
- The less I hear, the better.
- All right, yo.

143
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,008
Hey, yo, lock that door.

144
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,965
Lock that door.

145
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,451
So we got Bird and Bey.

146
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,440
Bird will stand tall.

147
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,091
He already in jail, and Bey about to go, too.

148
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,486
And Wee-Bey hard like a rock.

149
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,244
And we got Savino.

150
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,766
It ain't nothing but an Arm & Hammer charge.

151
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,889
He ain't gonna flip out
over a motherfucking three years.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,001
True.

153
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,404
Then we got that shit with Orlando,
and the only problem there was Little Man.

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,331
Was.

155
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,611
- Was.
- Was.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,411
Who else?

157
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,241
It's over, your Wire's cold.

158
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,164
The court orders give me
a total of 90 days on five phones.

159
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,685
I'm doing the full 90.

160
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,890
You want to sit listening to a bunch
of broke-ass pay phones, have at it.

161
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,771
But you don't need
all that manpower to do it.

162
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,366
You want some bodies back,
I'll send a couple.

163
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,364
Hold on, Lieutenant.
I gave you those people.

164
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,442
I decide who comes back.

165
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,520
But feel free to speak your mind,
if it were up to you.

166
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,327
He asked you a question, Lieutenant.

167
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,361
I have no opinion. Take your pick.

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,284
What's the name of that
old detective from Pawnshop?

169
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,048
And that young one,
Valchek's braindead son-in-law.

170
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,882
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.

171
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,040
Keep them.

172
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,646
Send back Sydnor and Santangelo.

173
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,010
And, Lieutenant, if you want to do anything

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,765
beyond listening to those dead phones,

175
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,250
you need to brief me first. Hmm?

176
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,410
You did good, Cedric.

177
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,970
You play your cards right, all the work
you did over the past few months

178
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,008
will speak volumes for you.

179
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,766
Major Spurgeon says
he's retiring at the end of November.

180
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,242
- Opening up the Northwest Command.
- That's right.

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,407
Hi, Ronnie. Come in. Sit.

182
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,923
- Sheila, send Patrick in.
- Yes, sir.

183
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,321
- Anything up?
- With me?

184
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,010
Same shit, different file.

185
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,124
- How about the Barksdale thing?
- You got my office reports.

186
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,210
We're looking into a bug
in the man's nightclub.

187
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,726
Aside from that, you're doing what?

188
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,364
Pulling campaign finance reports for every
politician in the city of Baltimore, right?

189
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,767
I am?

190
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,801
We are?

191
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,210
And making calls to some contributors,

192
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,648
asking questions, doing background checks.

193
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,003
I don't know anything about this.

194
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,401
I mean, Ronnie,
where the fuck is all this going?

195
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,170
Those are public reports, right? I mean...

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,402
No one on that detail
has come to me for any kind of subpoena.

197
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,847
You got back-doored, too, huh? Well...

198
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,962
Just so there's no misunderstanding,
I want to give you this.

199
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Copies of checks on the account
of my re-election committee

200
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,646
representing the return of five separate
contributions, totaling $4,500.

201
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,165
Also copies of the checks
from the donor are represented in there, too.

202
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,166
Kind of like Caesar's wife and all that shit.

203
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,242
The only thing that we could
come up with were those five checks.

204
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,723
I don't know those people,
and I don't know why they gave.

205
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,526
That money's gonna be
returned to the donors.

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,524
Guys, listen to me.

207
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,206
I don't know a fucking thing about anyone
looking at campaign contributions.

208
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,086
Be that as it may, this should make it clear
that our hands are clean.

209
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,644
I want you to take that back
to whoever's on the hunt

210
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,443
and I want you to tell them
they've got no quarrel with me.

211
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,685
What's up, String?

212
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,566
So y'all want to get with me?

213
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,250
We need to holler at your boy. You know,
the one that dimed on Omar's bitch.

214
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,641
Can't recall his name.

215
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,610
Which one?

216
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,962
The one that was at the Greek's that night.

217
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,964
- We paid him for the lookout.
- What y'all need him for?

218
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,524
What's it to you?

219
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,248
- You ain't got to worry about him.
- Say what?

220
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,120
- He's gone, he's out the game.
- Out the game?

221
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,880
The man asked you a simple question.

222
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,761
I don't mean y'all no disrespect.
You know I don't.

223
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,565
I am sitting here telling you
that the boy is out the game.

224
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,962
Even if he wasn't out the game,
he wouldn't be no problem.

225
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,449
Well, you know we just want to talk to him, D.

226
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,330
Avon...

227
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,922
let the boy be.

228
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,802
Just let him be.

229
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,602
<i>(Thumping music)</i>

230
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,567
(Interference)

231
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,291
Honey, just leave the damn thing alone.

232
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,965
- Where'd you get these, man?
- Prevas.

233
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,121
Broadway market?

234
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,522
- Best chili dogs in the city.
- No, man, not even.

235
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,323
I'll give you ten bucks
if you can name a better dog.

236
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,131
- George's on Light Street.
- The Greek joint?

237
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,647
That closed when you were
still sucking on your mama's nipples.

238
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,644
My mama's nipples?
I was sucking on them last night.

239
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,245
You owe me ten.

240
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,529
I said name a better dog
you can have today, not in history.

241
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,490
You go get that dog right now.

242
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,610
- You cannot go get that now.
- You said the best fucking dog.

243
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,681
Can you please keep it down?

244
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,966
I can't hear a goddamn thing!

245
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,123
(Woman) You'd know how much I got
if you laid something on me.

246
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,010
- You like that freeze?
- If you holding.

247
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,050
I'm fixing to be.
That's why I'm here, you know?

248
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,285
'To discuss some things.'

249
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,204
When you done discussing, you come back.

250
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,250
All right, then.
Hold that pose right there, shorty.

251
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,482
I'm gonna hook you up with some uncut.

252
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,641
Y'all niggers talk too damn much, man.

253
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,766
Who the fuck is she? Housing police?

254
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,086
No, she's one of them civilians
they got doing security.

255
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,405
- Housing cops wear the grey uniforms.
- So she's not armed or nothing.

256
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,931
Do she look it?

257
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,249
You leaving early?

258
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,721
I was early, I worked the lunch crowd.

259
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,366
She's out.

260
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,527
Anything?

261
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,131
Scraps. What we want is in that office.

262
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,761
There's no reason for Shardene
to be in there long enough for us to get it.

263
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,883
- Take it out, I can't do this any more.
- You won't have to.

264
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,804
I think they'll look at me and know.
I need to quit.

265
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,123
I don't need you wearing
this wire, all right, honey?

266
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,445
L just need you to go in there
and do one more thing.

267
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,246
Oh, look at this country nigger.

268
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,241
- Damn, Wallace.
- Wally!

269
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,888
He kept crying till I sent him bus money.

270
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,124
All right. I just got tired
of that same old country scenery.

271
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,685
It was just too slow for me.

272
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,684
But did you get some of that country ass?

273
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,564
If he did, it was on four legs.

274
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,884
Nigger, they got no farms down there, man.
They did have some Bamas though.

275
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,924
They got their Saturday night
shit down at Sears.

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,369
- They was like...
- You were about to cry. You got diehards?

277
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,246
- These Timbs.
- Yeah, they Timbs.

278
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,527
I can see the tree on the side of them.

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,490
So you gonna put me back on the money?

280
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,011
Hold. Look, if we do put you back on,
you have to start as lookout, man.

281
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,085
You lost your spot
when you bucked town, dawg.

282
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,640
A real man would stay with his people.

283
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,722
He wouldn't run at the first sight of blood.

284
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,808
Y'all can still holler Five-0, right?

285
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,086
If he want back on the money,

286
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,851
he back on the money. If he want it.

287
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,643
My man might be thinking of going back

288
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,961
to Edmondson like we talked about, right?

289
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,365
Come on, nigger, let's walk.

290
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,604
Dawg, you ain't cornholed
no animal for real, did you?

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,441
- Go ahead, Poot.
- You're stupid.

292
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,291
Don't be fucking with my Sean John.

293
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,807
- So who caught it?
- Garvey.

294
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,881
He knows about the witness angle

295
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,044
but he doesn't want to run it up
until he knows more.

296
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,087
Why ace Nakeisha Lyles now?

297
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,168
Now they know we're for real.

298
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,641
Avon's cleaning the house all the way.

299
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,725
First the phones go dead and then anyone
he thinks we might be able to flip.

300
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,889
What about the boy?

301
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,680
Fuck me.

302
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,329
We took him to the shore Friday.

303
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,846
The plan was to bring him back up
for the Grand Jury.

304
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,491
- What happened?
- Greggs got shot.

305
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,607
Trooper Reese?

306
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,691
This is Lieutenant Daniels,
Baltimore Department.

307
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,606
Can someone go near Cambridge and
check on a kid we got stashed down there?

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,728
- 'Call him.'
- There's no phone.

309
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,290
- 'Can you hang on?'
- I'll hold.

310
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,769
Have Sydnor pull a car from motor pool.

311
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,607
We get the kid here. He sleeps on my sofa
and we Grand-Jury him in the morning.

312
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,764
- What about your stripper?
- The woman's got heart.

313
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,249
I mean, I want her protected.
No more bodies, hear?

314
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,729
I got room at my place,
she can lay up with me.

315
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,247
- I got no problem with that.
- Remember who you are, Detective.

316
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,528
Protect and serve, Lieutenant.
Protect and serve.

317
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,447
I'm saying, this here game,
it ain't gonna work for you no more, man.

318
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,803
You leaving, you stirred up some shit.

319
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,891
- I'm saying it ain't your fault.
- D, look.

320
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,284
I appreciate what you trying to say and all,
but I grew up in the courts, all right?

321
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,449
I been with them niggers since forever.

322
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,611
I guess this is home, right?

323
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,203
You ain't hearing me, Wallace.

324
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,770
You ain't hearing me.

325
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,650
Anybody asks you whether you in this game,
you tell them you in it for life, all right?

326
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,529
Play it hard, play it tight and make sure
niggers know you stand by your people.

327
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,846
No loose talk,
no second thoughts, and no snitching.

328
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,080
Play it like that.

329
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,491
(Horn blares)

330
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,241
<i>HEY-</i>

331
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,324
- What you doing down in the PJs? Lost?
- I'm looking for you.

332
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,806
You know I be down here working.

333
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,167
A working man got to eat.

334
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,483
- My favorite spicy fish cakes?
- On the saltines with the mustard.

335
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,403
You gonna make me cry, you know.

336
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,847
I need to get up out of here and get back to it.

337
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,404
- You be safe.
- You, too.

338
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,606
All right.

339
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,090
This here.

340
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,331
Sterling's, baby, we're about to feast.

341
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,250
What the hell is Sterling's?

342
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,046
Sterling's on 29th Street?
Don't you know nothing?

343
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,329
Shit, if it ain't up
on the Westside, I don't know shit.

344
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,167
Cos this shit, this is me, yo, right here.

345
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,041
Who was that, your new girl or something?

346
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,050
No, nigger, that's my mom.

347
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,244
You know Senator Davis?

348
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,246
No, sir.

349
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,570
Lieutenant.

350
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,050
Clay wanted to meet you,
see if there was any help he can offer.

351
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,367
Help?

352
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,047
Your people are apparently
pulling finance reports

353
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,885
and checking up on some of the contributors.

354
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,250
I wanted to reassure you on that front.

355
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,168
I'm not involved in drugs, Lieutenant.

356
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,641
Good.

357
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,884
And this business with the senator's driver.

358
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,609
- Mr. Price, Damien.
- Day-Day.

359
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,926
This er... This business with Mr. Price,
this is a misunderstanding

360
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,367
that is really of no concern to the police.

361
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,360
We hid $20,000 of cash on him

362
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,843
delivered out of a project tower
by a known drug suspect.

363
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,805
The money was
banded and manicured by denomination.

364
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,524
This is...

365
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,802
There's no crime here.

366
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,170
That was money that Damien already had
on him when he drove to Franklin Terrace.

367
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,801
Money from a cash-bar fundraiser
the previous weekend.

368
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,362
We filed an amended
finance report that shows that...

369
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,561
Fine.

370
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,328
There's no probable cause
for a search of Mr. Price.

371
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,366
I think we are in agreement on that.

372
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,882
No, there was PC for the search.

373
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,090
You're saying you have evidence
that a senatorial aide is involved in drugs?

374
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,848
I'm saying we had reason
to stop Mr. Price and search him,

375
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,443
after which we discovered
$20,000 in cash, in banded, manicured bills.

376
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,965
That's all I'm saying.

377
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,927
Explain to this motherfucker
just what it is he's doing here.

378
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,923
- Lieutenant Daniels?
- Excuse me, sir.

379
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,051
But it's pretty basic.

380
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,923
If the senator is not involved in anything
illegal then he doesn't need to worry.

381
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
I can't be any clearer about it than that.

382
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,085
Fool, what do you think?

383
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,968
That we know anything
about who gives money?

384
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,841
That we give a damn about
who they are or what they want?

385
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,364
We have no way of running down
them or their stories.

386
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,243
We don't care. We just cash the damn
checks, count the votes, and move on.

387
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,565
Anything else, Deputy Burrell?

388
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,166
Gentlemen.

389
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,722
You need to put his ass
on a foot post so far out in the sticks

390
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,770
that he's gonna see
the Philadelphia cops walking towards him.

391
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,081
Now you just ain't talking to me now, Erv.

392
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,367
You talking to the Mayor,
the city caucus, the state central committee.

393
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,046
And right now,
you got your hand in our pocket.

394
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,244
18,baby!

395
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,885
Eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-
eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight.

396
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,242
18 with a bullet, baby.

397
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,284
Detective Sergeant Hauk
reporting for duty, sir.

398
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,880
And the best part? Carver's 37.

399
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,726
You know, it helps
if you know them by the numbers.

400
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,928
It makes you sound more professional.

401
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,370
Fucking Carver. He gets back from training,
he's gonna kiss the stripes.

402
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,364
I'm gonna make him kiss the stripes.

403
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,609
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

404
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,409
- Sergeant Hauk?
- God help us.

405
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,928
- Daniels.
- 'Daniels, this is Trooper Reese.

406
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,606
'Grandmother says this kid's
been gone two days.'

407
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,001
Wallace is out of pocket. Two days.

408
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,000
Thanks.

409
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,170
Ain't no re-up in the towers, neither?

410
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,402
No. Shop dead, yo.

411
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,806
- What up, man?
- Same old, same old.

412
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,402
What's up with that boy?

413
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,723
Oh, man. He just a punk, that's all.

414
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,650
D put him back on count though.

415
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,485
Word? I heard he was out the game.

416
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,329
He was, but he back now.

417
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,685
Where he been at?

418
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,411
Down his granny house, he says.

419
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,771
His granny.

420
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,164
I heard he damn near shit his pants when

421
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,242
he saw what happened to Omar's bitch.

422
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,321
He just ain't built for this, you know.
His heart pump Kool-Aid.

423
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,563
Right. What about you?

424
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,761
You built for this shit?

425
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,126
No doubt.

426
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,970
You ready to put the work in?

427
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,966
You got heat?

428
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,763
All right, soldier.

429
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,963
It's clear upstairs.

430
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,081
- No extension cords. No juice boxes.
- No Wallace.

431
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,447
Dang, boy, Chink Bob's
never be putting no napkins in the bag.

432
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,331
Motherfucker. Napkins expensive and shit.

433
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,970
So is my money.

434
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,004
All right, come on, go. Something to eat?

435
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,763
Y'all know what's here.

436
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,809
Y'all need to get up in this Chinese food
cos I'm looking needy right about now.

437
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,445
What you listening to?
Hold up, take them plates first.

438
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,091
Big Tymers, their new video
on 106th and Park.

439
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,686
- 106th and Park?
- The joint is vicious.

440
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,487
- What they call you?
- Buff, cos I got the stuff.

441
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,531
You got the stuff? You need to get up
in these egg rolls or something.

442
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,410
Any word on the kid?

443
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,486
I rolled around Cambridge
all night with his B of I.

444
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,366
If he's down there, he ain't got no profile.

445
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,960
We got lookouts to every car.

446
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,168
We're trying for an address on his mother.

447
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,485
- Detective.
- Lieutenant.

448
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,487
Wire's dead so we've been ordered
to begin sending bodies home.

449
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,928
Sydnor, we have a little longer
because Cantrell still owes me.

450
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,482
- You OK with Rawls?
- I gave him his clearance, right?

451
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,841
What's he gonna do to me?

452
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,850
Keep it warm, Sanny.

453
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,171
What's that?

454
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,445
- Plans for Orlando's. The upper floors.
- This is the property next door.

455
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,648
- How'd you get them so quick?
- costar.

456
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,009
Plan is to get a remote mike into the office.
Maybe even some fiber optics.

457
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,527
Only we don't know where Avon's office is.

458
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,682
Which is where Shardene helps us out.

459
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,442
Is she gonna take out a tape
and ask Avon to hold the other end?

460
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,522
Ain't none of y'all been in the military?

461
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,881
How do you learn a 30-inch, quick-time?

462
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,722
Draft-dodging peace freaks.

463
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,562
- Get me a ruler and some string.
- Why me?

464
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,130
Why? Why?

465
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,767
- Because the man said so, that's why.
- Wallace ain't no snitch.

466
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,690
Man, how you know?
How you know where he been running to?

467
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,201
He was getting high. I've seen him cop.

468
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,691
He probably went down
to the shore to clean that shit up.

469
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,086
Man, if he using, then you know
he ain't reliable. Come on, think.

470
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,084
Look, the man gave the word, all right?
We either step up or we step the fuck off.

471
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,845
That's the game.

472
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,925
That's the fucking game.

473
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,691
Cedric.

474
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,928
You ever hear of an elected official
in Baltimore giving money back?

475
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,244
Whatever you're doing
scared my boss shitless.

476
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,087
He calls me in and hands me that.

477
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,001
Forgive me for prying
into the details of our investigation.

478
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,880
I know, it's annoying.
But what the hell are you guys doing?

479
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,649
Is that Avon's money?

480
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,083
Eastside addresses but maybe Barksdale
has fronts we don't know about.

481
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,483
- State's Attorney's returning this?
- Fast as he can.

482
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,689
Y'all are stirring some shit here.
Why didn't you tell me?

483
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,242
Aren't you better off that we didn't?

484
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,002
I remember my mom used to bring me here.

485
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,923
We used to go to Fruit Fantasy.

486
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,684
Orange soda, some shit like that?

487
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,171
No, these were fresh.

488
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,322
My mom poured Bacardi in hers though.

489
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,962
- Wasn't much she didn't pour it into.
- Talking about her like you're still a kid.

490
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,045
I got to thinking on her.

491
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,845
Your ass ain't got
to be hard all the goddamn time.

492
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,204
Soft link break the chain.

493
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,487
What are you, a boy or a man?

494
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm a man.

495
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,006
So what are we gonna do, man,
go have some fun?

496
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,087
OK, on this floor.
It's the second room from the rear.

497
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,286
The stairs start 30 paces from the front.
There's 24 stairs, about a foot each.

498
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,604
When you get to the top floor, it's eight
paces to the door of the dressing room

499
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,768
and another 10 to the back room.

500
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,208
80 to 110 in from the front.

501
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,925
The third floor of this building is vacant.

502
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,923
Otherwise we'd need a warrant.

503
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,762
- $15.
- Here take $10.

504
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,888
- $15.
- Motherfucker, I don't see no meter.

505
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,928
Get the fuck out of here.

506
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,922
(Whirr of drill)

507
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,923
It's 2:30 in the morning.

508
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,846
Easy now. Hole only needs
to be as big as your finger.

509
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,685
Not those sausage fingers you got.

510
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,445
You know what big hands mean.

511
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,481
You know what big hands mean, right?

512
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,683
Lieutenant, I just pulled a fresh address
for Wallace's mother.

513
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,849
We're OK here.

514
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,923
Where y'all at?

515
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,370
All right, when I find y'all, y'all gonna get it.

516
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,568
You better come out now.

517
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,689
Where y'all at?

518
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,329
Look, I'm not even playing
with y'all right about now.

519
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,526
You hear me?

520
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,650
Game over. Where the fuck y'all at?

521
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,526
When I find y'all, I'm beating your asses.
Now where y'all at?

522
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,921
Don't let me find y'all.

523
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,648
Check this, Poot.
Little Man left his player and shit.

524
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,085
Yo, man, you...

525
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,369
You a weak-ass nigger, man.

526
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,721
You should've stayed down
in the country, man.

527
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,087
Y'all my niggers, Yo-

528
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,204
You fucking brought this on yourself.

529
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,362
- We boys!
- You brought this on yourself.

530
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,962
Why it gotta be like this?

531
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,443
You my niggers from BC, remember that?

532
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,486
Come on, wetting your fucking pants,
like you a little boy.

533
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,769
Be a man!
Stand up like a motherfucking man.

534
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,722
- Y'all my niggers.
- You said you a fucking man. Stand up.

535
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,329
That's us, man.

536
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,569
<i>Do "w, goddamn“, 'fi you...</i>

537
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,524
(Wallace groaning)

538
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,609
(Soul music plays)

539
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,490
Darcia Wallace?
We're looking for your son.

540
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,002
Thought you might know his whereabouts.

541
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,689
Where-a-who? Shit, I be looking for that
smart little nigger, too. Boy took me for $10.

542
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,728
- Recently?
- (Man) What's going on?

543
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,801
Nothing.

544
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,486
Couple of police interrupting me,
while I'm trying to get my drink on.

545
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,400
- Your son might be in danger.
- He will be if he shows up.

546
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,881
Snatched that $10 out my purse.

547
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,169
- I'll slap the bright out his eyes.
- Here's my card.

548
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,167
You run into him, you call me.

549
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,648
(Footsteps over TV)

550
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,561
- 'Y'all got a tape?'
- 'Over there, man.'

551
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,727
'All right, let's see what we got here.'

552
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,325
He's packing shit up.

553
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,522
'What you scratching your head for, man?

554
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,206
'How y'all get the safe in here,
and you can't get it out?'

555
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,688
Just dial 911 and talk to whoever pick up.

556
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,444
Don't say your name or nothing.

557
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,362
Just say there's been an animal hurt inside
the house and then you hang up.

558
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,291
'What up? So what do you need from me?'

559
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,883
'I need you to run up to NYC
to pick up a little something.'

560
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,809
'Look, I know we tapped and all.

561
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,884
'Everybody waiting on the re-up,
but I never made that run before.'

562
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,769
I feel like I don't have that many people
around me I could really trust.

563
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,201
Not like I can kin. You follow me?

564
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,562
- All right?
- How much is it?

565
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,009
We just need to maintain.

566
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,209
<i>Put out enough
so we can keep hem of them towers.</i>

567
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,127
- When?
- Tonight.

568
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,010
All right.

569
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,400
- 'What am I driving?'
- 'A rental, nothing flash.'

570
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,521
'Where from?'

571
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,286
'I don't know where from, man,
one of those places by the airport.'

572
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,208
- 'Yeah.'
- We got something real.

573
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,448
- 'I'm on my way.'
- All right.

574
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,724
Shit!

575
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,087
- Which one?
- The rental there, the Taurus.

576
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,006
I gotta say, Lieutenant,
you got mad suction with the federales.

577
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,202
(Phone)

578
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,010
Yeah, Daniels.

579
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,201
Yeah.

580
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,446
Where?

581
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,691
Wallace?

582
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,410
Poor fucking kid.

583
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,686
With Wallace gone,
that's Stringer out of the box.

584
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,006
He was in there changing his fucking clothes.

585
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,644
You believe that?

586
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,250
Boy had to get himself correct.

587
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,208
We're on. No need for an eyeball.
Let the satellite do the work.

588
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,286
How about I call my lawyer, have him explain
that whole profiling thing to you?

589
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,965
Mr. Barksdale, our tollbooth cameras
have you on the GW Bridge at 23:10 hours,

590
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,840
then re-entering the turnpike
at the same exit 35 minutes later.

591
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,483
Why did you drive all the way
to New York for half an hour?

592
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,645
Step out of the car, sir.
Keep your hands where I can see them.

593
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,766
Turn around, face the car, hands on the roof.

594
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,446
- Are you carrying any weapons, sir?
- No.

595
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,170
- Knives, any needles?
- No.

596
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,050
Any illegal substances I should know about?

597
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,771
OK. Spread your legs back.

598
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,962
Spread your legs back more.

599
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,084
OK, slowly bring
your right arm around your back.

600
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,930
Now bring the other one.

601
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,249
- Remember me?
- Lawyer.

602
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,727
Easy. We're just getting started.

603
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,840
- Lawyer, motherfucker.
- OK, so you're hard, but guess what?

604
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,442
- I could give a fuck.
- You? I'm tired of your games.

605
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,000
You want me to write a letter,
or some shit like that?

606
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,568
No game we need to run.
You're popped with a kilo of uncut.

607
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,966
Not that you messed up.
You did everything right.

608
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,611
Speed limit, turn signals, working tail-lights.

609
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,287
Question you gotta ask is
how'd those troopers know to pull you over?

610
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,931
Someone else fucked up.
You following me?

611
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,530
But it's you they're gonna blame
and you who's gonna do the jolt.

612
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,849
- Lawyer.
- That'd be Levy, right?

613
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,251
He's getting paid by your uncle, is that right?

614
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,281
He's looking out for your interests.

615
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,765
More than you.

616
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,045
Listen.

617
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,726
I ain't saying another damn thing

618
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,241
to nobody but my lawyer.

619
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,722
Oh, by the way, your boy Wallace,
shot dead in the low-rises.

620
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,282
That's how y'all take care of your own, right?

621
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,764
You're a lying motherfucker.

622
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,167
So what?
You want me to write a letter to his mom, too?

623
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,970
Get the fuck out of here.

624
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,122
(Woman) You didn't have
to send him the way you did.

625
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,723
In one car?
He should've been trailing a mule.

626
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,040
95 or on the train, it don't make no difference.
He shouldn't have been alone.

627
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,805
- Look here, Brianna.
- Ain't you ever heard of a trap-car?

628
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,929
You send my son to New York
in a motherfucking rental

629
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,002
and let him ride
with that package in the trunk?

630
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,044
- I'm sorry.
- That won't bring him out of prison.

631
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,647
Better make sure that Jew lawyer of yours
earns his money, huh, eh?

632
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,966
- D'Angelo has to do his part.
- Meaning what?

633
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,482
You like the car you driving in, right?

634
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,170
You like this crib?
I put you in this crib. You like it?

635
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,202
We all got a lot to protect here.
You need to remind him of that.

636
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,160
So when it come down to it,
he can stand up tall.

637
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,287
You ain't gotta worry about my child.

638
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,529
I raised that boy, and I raised him right.

639
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,363
It wasn't me who fucked up.

640
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,763
Really? So who did?
Why the fuck are we here?

641
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,283
All you need to do is
keep your head through the bail hearing.

642
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,684
- We've got a shot at bringing you home.
- Then what? Huh?

643
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,361
Who gonna take the weight
for all the shit in the trunk of that car?

644
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,610
Where's Wallace at?

645
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,490
Where's the boy, String?

646
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,003
D'Angelo, shut your mouth.

647
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,685
Where's Wallace?

648
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,364
That's all I want to know.

649
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,722
Kid, you'd better think.

650
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,970
Where the fuck is Wallace?

651
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,481
Huh, String? String?

652
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,688
Look at me. Look at me!

653
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,205
Where the fuck is Wallace?

654
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,648
I don't want
this motherfucker representing me.

655
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,524
I'm gonna get my own man.

656
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,045
So just get back in your car

657
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,327
and get the fuck back down south.

658
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,369
All right, you stupid motherfucker.
You made your decision.

659
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,687
I made my decision. Where's Wallace at?

660
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,764
Where the fuck is Wallace? Where's Wallace?

661
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,922
String! Where the fuck is Wallace?

662
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,886
(D'Angelo) God damn!

663
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,849
Bring him in, you're done.

664
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,921
Why?

665
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,682
We have the charge whenever we want it.

666
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,967
Why not stay up on the bug in his office?

667
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,441
The bug you didn't brief me about.

668
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,447
I thought your little bird told you everything
we did a minute after we did it.

669
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,441
One of ours got hurt.
That should mean something.

670
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,881
We're hunting her shooters and
by the grace of God and your good work,

671
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,361
we've got a viable case on our main target.

672
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,367
Just charge Barksdale
with the attempt purchase from New York

673
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,169
and bring it all home.

674
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,006
What about Stringer?
He slipped off the hook when we lost the boy.

675
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,128
We've done all we can.

676
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,485
Are you hearing me?

677
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,130
These are the people responsible

678
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,611
for dropping a police.

679
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,041
Not just the shooters,

680
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,849
but ones who make the dirt happen.

681
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,530
I'm trying to put them down for real,

682
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,840
not for some short-time bit.

683
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,129
That all you trying to do?

684
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,891
If it is, how is it you have people pulling

685
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,571
campaign records and finance reports?

686
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,721
The fuck has that

687
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,370
got to do with anything?

688
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,563
The money is part of my case.

689
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,920
I was willing to say otherwise,

690
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,083
to let your friends
hide some of that dirt, but not now.

691
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,640
You want to talk about dirt? Have at it.

692
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,209
Talk about your Eastern district days.

693
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,362
Talk about what was going on

694
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,482
when you ran wild in the DEU.

695
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,050
That's just talk.

696
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,966
Just talk?

697
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,528
FBI field reports.

698
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,841
You came into a lot of money, quick.

699
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,931
And you can go to jail just as quick
if I start asking the right questions.

700
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,881
This case ends, or you are done.

701
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,323
Hell, I don't even need you
to lock up Barksdale.

702
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,450
I'll have your major debrief your detectives
and type the warrants himself.

703
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,569
This case is done.

704
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,205
You do what you feel.

705
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,964
You wanna pull Avon in on half a case?
You go ahead.

706
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,284
You wanna put my shit in the street?

707
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,361
Feel free.

708
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,889
But the Eastern had a lot of stories.

709
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,644
Mine ain't the only one.

710
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,087
A lot of people came through that district.

711
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,281
If you were gonna do me,

712
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,044
I'd already be done.

713
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,009
But there ain't nothing you fear more

714
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,481
than a bad headline now, is there?

715
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,880
You'd rather live in shit

716
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,327
than let the world see you work a shovel.

717
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,006
You can order warrants, and I'll serve them.

718
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,844
But as long as I have days left

719
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,810
on those dead wires, this case goes on.

720
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,002
Yo, look at these Delta Force
motherfuckers, man.

721
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,128
- Look at them.
- All right.

722
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,129
- What's up with Levy?
- He said he gonna meet us down there.

723
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,443
I still didn't get this safe out of here yet, man.
How much money in it?

724
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,321
- $150,000.
- $150,000.

725
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,523
Open it up, man.
No sense in ruining a good safe.

726
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,120
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

727
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,368
The SWAT love to break out their toys.

728
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,683
Do they think it's Tony Montana?
They probably haven't touched a gun in years.

729
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,800
Fuck this shit.

730
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,604
You and me, Lieutenant.

731
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,602
(Man) What units are in the alley?

732
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,122
Any sightline to the rear door?

733
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,682
10-4, who has the roof?

734
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,609
We're gonna move in on my command.
Everyone stand by.

735
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,244
We're not gonna need your men today.

736
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,210
- Now wait a minute.
- My case. Back your men off.

737
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,044
Catch you later.

738
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,244
It's good.

739
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,567
Barksdale's wearing bracelets.

740
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,921
Still no Wee-Bey, no Little Man?

741
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,283
No, nothing there.

742
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,851
This is the best work I ever did. I never
did a case like this. But it's not enough.

743
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,249
I gotta go back to Auto
tomorrow morning and...

744
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,410
- I just feel like this just ain't finished.
- Detective.
