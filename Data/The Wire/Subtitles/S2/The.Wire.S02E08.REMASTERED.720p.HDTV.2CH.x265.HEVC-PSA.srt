00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,400
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:16,478
Hi, we're not here. Leave a message.

3
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:18,675
Elena, you gotta talk to me.

4
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:21,379
Last call.

5
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,993
Why is she such a pain in the ass?

6
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,125
- Excuse me.
- Hey, pal.

7
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:37,202
It's all right. One more, please.

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,601
- Save some for the other customers, okay?
- Pour it!

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,008
- You ain't getting behind the wheel, right?
- There's a cab picking me up.

10
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:57,017
I'm looking you in the eye, Gus.
I'm telling you, I'm not driving a car tonight.

11
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,089
Bite me.

12
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,035
Yeah, coffee.

13
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:05,380
- What's with the hand?
- Just a scratch.

14
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,554
Get me some eggs, will you?

15
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,061
- Can I get a scrapple with that?
- You can get anything you want.

16
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,197
Oh, God!

17
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,514
Look at him, all high and mighty.

18
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,054
You ain't gonna let that shit ride, are you?
After what he did?

19
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,418
I'd truck his ass, if it was me.

20
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,589
He's built kind of solid, though.

21
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:05,857
Maui ain't all that.
It's the clothes that give him size, Zig.

22
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,396
- You think?
- His ass is candy, Zig.

23
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:12,128
You, you're the legend of the docks.

24
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,575
Truck him with your best punch
and then just walk the fuck away.

25
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,974
Officially, I've put us on the hook
for 14 open homicides.

26
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,242
So either we bring in a hell of a case...

27
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,875
or I'm as big a fool
as Col. Rawls thinks I am.

28
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,284
That sounded a little desperate.

29
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,489
Not entirely.

30
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:37,022
Lester, enlighten Miss Pearlman
as to the status of our investigation.

31
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,996
You said this case needed a drug connect
for a wiretap, right?

32
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,226
Come take a look at this.

33
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,167
That's the DNR log
on the phone listed to the warehouse...

34
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,370
where we tracked the suspect container.

35
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,915
It shows outgoing calls to numbers
that connect to Petey Dixon...

36
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,416
Proposition Joe Stewart,
and "White Mike" McArdle...

37
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,350
among other traffickers on the East Side.

38
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:06,618
Which supports surveillance of known
dealers coming and leaving the warehouse.

39
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,489
Also, some surveillance shots
and matching mug shot photos...

40
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:13,530
from Southeast DEU,
which tie White Mike to street dealers...

41
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,759
that we've already
made controlled buys from.

42
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,836
Assuming exhaustion,
that's one tap on the warehouse phone.

43
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:21,770
- What's your PC on the truck driver?
- Sergei Malatov:

44
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:25,934
resident alien, Ukrainian origin.
No criminal history here.

45
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,174
We ID'd him from the contract
on the DAC truck rental.

46
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,375
He was nice enough to give
the truck rental people his cell number.

47
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,146
And phone records show
a call placed to the warehouse...

48
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,620
at the time Kima observed him on the docks
using the cell phone.

49
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,453
Checking the DNR log's history...

50
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,925
we matched seven other calls
from that cell phone...

51
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:46,293
to dates and times when
a container disappeared from a Talco ship.

52
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:49,333
Anything else? Tap 2 feels a bit thin.

53
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:53,131
How about Nicholas Sobotka
of the 1400th block on Reynolds Street?

54
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,003
On a Cl's information,
Herc and Carver followed him...

55
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,342
from a drug meet
along the Fayette Street strip...

56
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,642
back to his parents'
South Baltimore row home.

57
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,048
When we ran that phone number
from that address...

58
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,848
through the DNR at our warehouse,
we got nothing.

59
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:14,187
But when we checked it against
the cell phone of our friend, Sergei...

60
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,887
- we got a couple of hits.
- Sobotka's your stated target, right?

61
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,260
This is a nephew, and from the look of it...

62
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:23,300
he's involved in street dealing
as much as smuggling.

63
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,632
But right now, this case feels like
a lot more than Frank Sobotka.

64
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:29,502
- No offense to Stan Valchek.
- Okay.

65
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:33,134
I admit, you've got PC.

66
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,914
On the warehouse phone
and on the trucker's cell phone, too.

67
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,210
Now what have you got for exhaustion?

68
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:40,682
Any possible informants?

69
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,584
- Nothing on the docks.
- No one we can buy weight with.

70
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:46,486
- Surveillance?
- That got us to the front door...

71
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,651
but it's not gonna get us
inside that warehouse.

72
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,191
Start typing. I'll call the judge.

73
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:04,701
Ham and cheese sandwich,
and one of them Frappuccino drinks.

74
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,742
- I hear Charles lost his leg.
- What?

75
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,986
Frappuccino? What the fuck is that?

76
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,954
He's all pussy, Zig. Cold cock him.

77
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,424
Take him, Zig. Now's the time.

78
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:37,139
What do you know?
The pissant's got some grapes on him.

79
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,607
Banana, too.

80
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,656
Fucking shit!

81
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:58,988
- Take us up.
- Son of a bitch! God damn it!

82
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,593
Fuck you!

83
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,563
You big, stupid, fucking oaf!
Fuck you, Maui.

84
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,502
You're the fucking wimp.

85
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,666
No, fuck you, Maui!

86
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:16,043
- Stay there.
- Fuck you!

87
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,885
God damn it!

88
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:29,653
Any of you fucks try to help him down,
you'll be up there with him.

89
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:34,493
Bad advice!
You motherfuckers gave me bad advice!

90
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,968
Shit.

91
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:51,014
- What the hell are you wearing?
- No one mentioned all the perks.

92
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,411
Lacrosse?

93
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:56,209
What, a brother can't run with a stick?

94
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,721
Jim Brown was an all-American midfielder
at Syracuse.

95
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:01,189
You putting yourself beside Jim Brown?

96
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,853
Lester, I'm just saying...

97
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,827
I thought you were born in pinstripes.

98
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,561
Lieutenant, I was under the impression
that when detailed against his will...

99
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,536
to some backwards-ass,
no-count, out-in-the-districts...

100
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,607
lost-ball-in-tall-grass drug investigation...

101
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:18,402
a veteran police of means and talent...

102
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,569
can wear whatever the fuck
he damn well pleases.

103
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,146
Up to a point.

104
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,944
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

105
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,487
It's a hell of a thing to take a downtown
police and lose him in a cross-town world.

106
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,555
Take that one over there.

107
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,419
I'm homesick already.

108
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:38,323
I don't know what you're laughing at.
You can kiss my ass.

109
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,701
You should see
what your boy tried to pull today.

110
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,274
Fucking Ziggy.

111
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,541
- What are you looking for?
- Can't find the fucking bills.

112
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:59,014
- End of the month, everything's hanging.
- We got anything for the Greeks?

113
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:03,644
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

114
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:07,983
No wonder I couldn't find them.
You use them as bookmarks.

115
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:16,133
Let me ask you something important.

116
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:20,030
You like fake tits? I can't decide.

117
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,365
Thus far, I'm undecided on fake tits.

118
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,407
I thought I knew what paperwork was.

119
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:36,886
But what you all go through,
to listen to someone else's phone calls...

120
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,268
You all cannot spell for shit.

121
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:00,911
Would we be police if we could?

122
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,708
- Who's the duty judge this week?
- Vanderwal.

123
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:04,839
You think he'll sign?

124
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,147
No problem, if you clean his garage first.
Or wash his windows, maybe.

125
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,115
Fucking Vanderwal.

126
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:14,257
Wash windows?

127
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:28,496
- Are these the affiants, Miss Pearlman?
- Yes, Your Honor.

128
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,801
Are you willing to affirm that
the information offered in this affidavit...

129
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:34,970
is entirely true
to the best of your knowledge?

130
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,638
Yes, Your Honor.

131
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:40,043
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Absolutely.

132
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,382
Upstairs, gentlemen.
Third floor, back bedroom.

133
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,682
Sash installation.

134
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:49,493
And then if you can give
the windows a wash... Thank you.

135
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:55,330
It's a good thing I took the Sergeant's test.

136
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,765
- Fuck, my knee.
- Sorry.

137
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,230
- First name?
- First name: Francis.

138
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,169
Spell the last name on the account.

139
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:05,140
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.

140
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,212
Yeah, that's it. It's a business address.

141
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:11,578
- You've been flagged.
- Flagged?

142
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,350
It says right here on the computer.

143
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:15,283
Yeah? You're kidding me.

144
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:17,411
I don't have any more information
on that now.

145
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,285
Whatever, okay.

146
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,628
The check's on its way tomorrow.
Cross my heart.

147
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,172
Horse, if you don't pay your phone bill
for three months, what happens?

148
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:37,502
No phone.

149
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,469
Okay, so I'm 90 days late on my cell phone,
but they let me go...

150
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,573
even before I mail the check in.

151
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:48,743
I ask the nice lady in the billing department
why that is. You know what she says?

152
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:50,946
- I've been flagged.
- Flagged?

153
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,782
She says it's on the computer
when my account comes on:

154
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,383
"Do not disconnect for non-payment."

155
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,860
"Flagged," what the fuck is that?
What am I, special?

156
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,101
Maybe you been touched by an angel.

157
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,705
Told you, B.

158
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:13,640
Tumbleweeds be blowing
through this motherfucker.

159
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:17,875
- Like the fiends all cleaned themselves up.
- No, that ain't it, man.

160
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:22,276
Word is out,
we just selling dog shit up in here, man.

161
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:25,480
Damn.

162
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:37,231
- Pud, how we doing?
- Slow as a white man in slippers.

163
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:40,226
All right, later.

164
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:45,905
We dying 'cause these dusty-ass fiends
done found the real someplace else.

165
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,944
It's that bullshit, man.

166
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,507
You two got a reason to be here?

167
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:54,847
- We're just going about our business.
- Keep moving.

168
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,888
Fake-ass police.
Where he get that uniform at? Kmart?

169
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:05,122
He wouldn't even be all chest-out
if we had some people up in this bitch.

170
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,695
Shit is fucked up, man.

171
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,264
Damn, junior, you had a night.

172
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,465
Even for a legendary motherfucker
like yourself...

173
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:17,768
Drop it.

174
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,070
What is wrong with you, man?

175
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:26,013
'Cause Elena didn't open up the door
for your ass...

176
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,881
you just gonna let all this shit fly out?

177
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:33,246
Come on, Jimmy. Lighten up.

178
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,925
Come and get me.

179
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,661
So, you guys going for a wiretap
on that port case?

180
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:54,767
They got every swinging dick with a shield
on that detail but me.

181
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:57,237
You jealous, bitch?

182
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:00,146
I'd rather be back in Homicide.

183
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:04,454
I'd take your place in a heartbeat.

184
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:07,348
Why?

185
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:17,266
- That floater showing up in your dreams?
- No, it's not just her.

186
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:24,004
I mean, who am I, Captain Chesapeake?
I need to get off that boat, Bunk.

187
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,837
I need to do a case.

188
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,873
I mean, if I'm not gonna...

189
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:35,816
If I'm no good for...

190
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,132
If that's all you want, just go and ask Rawls.

191
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:54,301
- He'll put you on this straightaway.
- Yeah, why wouldn't he?

192
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,181
...after which I tell Horse
to go down the southeast lot...

193
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:12,984
and steal the most expensive thing
he can drive, which he does.

194
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:16,356
And we box it up
and ship it to every port you can name.

195
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:17,860
Where is it now?

196
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:20,795
Somewhere between New Orleans
and the West Coast.

197
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,923
How's that for your kid brother?

198
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,935
You said you were gonna
bring something over?

199
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,368
Just this.

200
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,303
Read it.

201
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,574
- What is it?
- A confirmation letter, like.

202
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:40,350
You know that labor position
on the port advisory board I told you about?

203
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:42,715
I put you up for it. You're on.

204
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:44,247
I'm on?

205
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:48,750
I ain't been union since they closed
the dry dock. How come I'm on?

206
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,318
The board chair and me,
we got a relationship.

207
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,398
You mean, you greased it.

208
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:59,660
The chairman,
he thought you'd be right for it, is all.

209
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,298
There's a stipend comes with it.
$200 a month, Lou.

210
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:08,311
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

211
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,314
I'm not up to go to no meetings or anything.

212
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:14,676
Christ, Lou,
you don't gotta go to all the meetings.

213
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,313
Just show up once in a while,
let them know you're alive.

214
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:21,651
That's not for me.

215
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:24,884
What's for you?

216
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,558
That shitwagon parked out front
needs a battery.

217
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,427
Or this kitchen here
has been rigged the same way for 25 years.

218
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,732
Whatever I got comes straight.

219
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,673
That's real noble, big brother.

220
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:43,371
Not noble. Right.

221
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,480
The shipbuilders' local goes belly-up,
and that makes you some kind of martyr?

222
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,419
The only difference between me and you...

223
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:55,686
- is you picked the wrong union.
- That ain't the only difference.

224
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,387
- If you were in my position...
- I'm not.

225
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:06,427
To tell you the truth, I'm glad
I don't have to make those kind of choices.

226
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:11,672
Come on, kid.

227
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:14,372
Sit down.

228
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,557
You really used to race pigeons
with my PePop?

229
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:36,428
We all did back then.

230
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:40,761
I gave one to a seaman
on a Dutch tanker one time.

231
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,238
He set her loose in the middle of the ocean.

232
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:46,333
Damned if she didn't find her way
back to Hull Street.

233
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:49,572
Which, by the way, is more than I can say
about your grandfather...

234
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,545
when he was in the bag.

235
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,079
How come they don't fly away?

236
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,753
His wings are clipped.

237
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,557
How much for this one, Mr. Diz?

238
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,898
Why don't you start out with pigeons, Zig?
You can train pigeons.

239
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,767
Them things got lice.

240
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,833
They bring the plague, for Christ's sake.

241
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:27,074
Thanks, Mr. Diz.

242
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,346
I tried. Rawls hates his guts.

243
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:36,793
- With reasons.
- But the thing of it is, Jimmy's dying inside.

244
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:40,060
He's a train wreck
unless he catches a real case.

245
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:42,132
- But good police.
- Always.

246
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,461
The thing of it is, Lieutenant...

247
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:48,230
Jimmy McNulty, when he ain't policing...

248
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:53,175
he's a picture postcard
of a drunken, self-destructive fuck-up.

249
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,468
And when he is policing...

250
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:57,908
he's pretty much the same motherfucker.

251
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:01,678
But on a good case,
he's running in front of the pack.

252
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:06,114
That's as close as the man comes
to being right.

253
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,417
Go back to Rawls.

254
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:15,693
So I get paid?

255
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,894
Yeah, you get paid, but you don't get paid.
We get paid.

256
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,528
Why don't they give you the money
and leave me out of it?

257
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:24,665
'Cause we need someone to be
Confidential lnformant Number 238...

258
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:28,871
registered with the department.
We get you registered, we get paid.

259
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:32,846
- So you're gonna send my picture...
- And your social security number.

260
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,851
And they give me money which you keep,
and I don't get nothing.

261
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,922
Cuz, did you do anything
to deserve the money?

262
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:40,617
Did you?

263
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,393
Yeah, we cracked a fucking case wide open.

264
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:45,553
We brought back
very significant information...

265
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:48,826
about a major drug trafficker.
That's what we did.

266
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,296
But that's your fucking job, right?
You get paid a salary for that.

267
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,439
Bernard, you're upsetting my partner, man.
What are you doing?

268
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:00,535
10%.

269
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:03,910
10% goes to me and I don't tell.

270
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,143
You don't tell
because your ma and my ma are sisters.

271
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:10,584
- That's why you don't tell.
- We're not even gonna use your real name.

272
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:13,020
You'll be registered as Fuzzy Dunlop,
a street name.

273
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,291
10%.

274
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:24,164
Wonderful, now I'm in business
with the whole fucking family.

275
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,561
It's payday, Zig. Once again.

276
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:35,606
All that?

277
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:40,450
We're rolling out there.
I can't hand this shit off fast enough.

278
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:43,279
Nice sled you got.

279
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:47,080
Zero percent interest. Money's cheap.

280
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:49,557
"Money's cheap"?
What the fuck does that mean?

281
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,356
It means I got a good deal, you peckerhead.

282
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,922
You should think of getting
some new wheels yourself.

283
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,898
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

284
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:01,130
You gonna get a car,
you're gonna need some jack.

285
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:03,335
Worry about yourself.

286
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,845
I heard you took on Maui.

287
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:14,345
- Boy needed to get schooled.
- What are you, some kind of badass now?

288
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:21,756
- Yeah, it's me.
- Niko, things okay?

289
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:25,354
- Things are going great.
- If you need more, talk to Sergei.

290
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,990
I gotta see you soon.
I'll call you back in a few, all right?

291
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,395
Is that the man?

292
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:34,630
- You don't have to concern yourself...
- I wanna meet him.

293
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,368
Let me handle the business.
I mean, you're getting paid, right?

294
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,843
Fuck you! I'll play the game for myself.

295
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:45,481
- Take the money, Zig.
- You don't think I can do it?

296
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,949
Pick up the fucking money, Ziggy.

297
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,779
- I don't want it. You pick it up.
- You.

298
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:53,884
Fuck you.

299
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:08,171
I was wondering about the La-Z-Boy chairs
I ordered. They come in yet?

300
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:09,967
- How many you ordered?
- That'd be three.

301
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,473
Your order's in.

302
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:16,102
- Yes?
- It's Nick.

303
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:17,609
How's it going?

304
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:21,048
I'm ready to talk about more, okay?
Youjust say where and when.

305
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,847
I'll call you back.

306
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:30,223
- Not as careful as Barksdale's people were.
- This ain't West Baltimore.

307
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:34,888
They are on their phones
because they don't expect us to be on them.

308
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:39,734
Let me shorten this conversation for you:
It's never gonna happen.

309
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:42,704
McNulty goes after it.
I could use someone like him.

310
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,766
And I could use three more inches of meat.
It ain't gonna happen.

311
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:54,540
You ever see how a dog gets
when he smells a bone buried in the yard?

312
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:57,883
Yeah, and I seen one
take a shit on my carpet, too.

313
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:02,851
And don't give me that he's-got-that-fire-
in-the-belly garbage, either.

314
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,556
The answer is no.

315
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:08,022
What I need from you, I get.

316
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:11,257
- No bullshit, no arguments.
- What?

317
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:16,539
When I agreed to take these murders
for you, I made my terms clear, remember?

318
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,070
I need McNulty on this detail.

319
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:26,141
Jesus, Lieutenant. When I said "anything,"
I meant I'd let you have a kiss...

320
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:30,284
feel my tits or something, you know?
But not this.

321
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:34,022
You want me to clear those bodies?

322
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,729
See that you do.

323
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:57,541
Who they?

324
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:01,514
They might be some CBS boys
drifting from down south...

325
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,611
or might be some of Tavon's crew
from over on Edmondson.

326
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,189
This far over?

327
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,892
I know one thing, though.

328
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,460
- What?
- They're serving our customers.

329
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:20,594
- Marine unit, Diggins.
- I'm looking for McNulty.

330
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,497
McNulty, for you.

331
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:32,916
It's Daniels...

332
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:35,975
Get back to your office.

333
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,586
Thanks, Lieutenant.

334
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:59,375
This new generation with the names...

335
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,448
$150? Jesus.

336
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,286
He turned us onto
the Sobotka kid, Lieutenant.

337
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,392
This is the other half of the case, right here.

338
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:23,955
Three apartments on the sixth floor,
all leased out to Pyramid, lnc...

339
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:26,332
the same people
who own the drug warehouse.

340
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:28,905
Is this where the girls are staying?
Or something more?

341
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,372
No, the building's too nice
for room and board.

342
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:33,670
A building this nice is for the johns.

343
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:36,803
- Makes them feel safer.
- How do they bring them in? The lobby?

344
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:40,247
- Garage, probably.
- Either they have a garage card...

345
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,581
or they're being shuttled in
by someone who does.

346
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:45,849
You get that piece and you're in.
If the people running the girls...

347
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,947
are connected
to the ones running the drugs...

348
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:52,017
you can knock off the brothel
and then listen in on your wiretaps.

349
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,654
Tickle the wire like that.

350
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,860
Exactly.

351
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,199
Pleasure boats, topless women.

352
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,167
I'm telling you, now the weather's turned,
I gotta roll, Diggsy.

353
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,238
Thanks.

354
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:23,054
- We ain't be been paid since yesterday.
- And the day before that.

355
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,993
What the fuck?
Come on, dawg, are we back up or what?

356
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:28,155
We up, but we ain't in it.

357
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:31,496
What we got can't stand up
to what they moving down the way, so...

358
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:34,571
Boy, we about to dry up and blow away,
and shit.

359
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:36,969
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing for you.

360
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:38,837
How you gonna act like that?

361
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:42,275
Look, I feel you,
but I still gotta let you go so...

362
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:48,480
At least we get
some of that separation pay though, right?

363
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:52,521
Man, you better go on
before I lose my composure out this bitch.

364
00:29:56,693 --> 00:30:00,459
These motherfuckers. Separation pay.

365
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,225
Separate your ass.

366
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:08,432
Assumption number one
is the people running the girls...

367
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:11,269
and the people running the drugs
are the same crew.

368
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:14,173
Assumption number two
is that the apartments in that condo...

369
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,508
are working as a cathouse
with those Russian girls.

370
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:20,413
Which means you have to get someone
in there undercover to make a case.

371
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:24,587
I'm thinking we need
a more subtle touch here.

372
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:28,191
I'd march into hell for you, Lieutenant.
You know that.

373
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:30,952
He doesn't look like he'd have to pay.

374
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:37,799
- Sorry, no. Domestic issues at home.
- Same for me.

375
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:40,897
Nadine would have them in a jar
by the side of the bed...

376
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:43,165
if she even heard tell of it.

377
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,907
What?

378
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,514
Takes a whore to catch a whore.

379
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:59,583
What the fuck did I do?

380
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,859
Give me a couple beers, Dolores.
Look at this.

381
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,624
I say, look at this.

382
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:10,528
Dolores, is that you?

383
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:16,833
Dolores, I'd like you to meet my attorney.
This is Steven L. Miles.

384
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,870
I may not be able to see through
all the bullshit in here...

385
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,880
but he can. So, if you will...

386
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:28,509
I'd like a stiff one for myself
and one for my counselor.

387
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,514
- Tell me he's a fake.
- That'd be lying, hon.

388
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:33,556
Is they real diamonds around its neck?

389
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:35,921
You sick, boy. You just sick.

390
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:38,324
Like I'm the only guy in South Baltimore...

391
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:41,864
that ever tried to win the affections
of a farm animal?

392
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:46,765
Enough talk. Now chop-chop.

393
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:52,674
I'd like one for the house and don't forget
to water my fine, feathered friend here.

394
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:57,003
If it's for the duck, the next round is on me.

395
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:58,372
Easy, there.

396
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:01,076
We're gonna need a saucer, hon.
Put some beer in it.

397
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,618
He needs a chaser.

398
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,710
Put it on my tab, Dolores.

399
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,324
Pace yourself. You're drinking
with the longshoremen tonight.

400
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:22,204
That look right to you?

401
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,537
Same truck as carried the girls,
same mope driving.

402
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:27,810
What about the passenger?

403
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:29,941
Looks the part to me.

404
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:40,820
Container ship on the Talco line,
name of Caspia, docks tomorrow a.m.

405
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:42,858
Our man Horseface on it?

406
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:48,324
I better call the Lieutenant,
let him know we gotta set up on this.

407
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:53,933
This time, though, we got the wire up.
Eyes and ears both.

408
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:23,530
There goes the shuttle.

409
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:31,942
What's he waiting on?

410
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:35,205
Getting himself all steeled up
to tell some tales.

411
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,037
Lying to the wife's easy.

412
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,584
It's looking your kid in the eye
that's the hard part.

413
00:33:58,568 --> 00:33:59,762
Police!

414
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:09,042
Let's see your license.

415
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:16,383
"Robert Johnson." You believe that?

416
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,283
Bob, I'm very disappointed in you.
Wanna go home, Bob?

417
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:27,423
Okay, suppose a lonely fellow wants to meet
a nice young lady in this town.

418
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,499
How does he go about it?

419
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,796
He'd dial that phone number.

420
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:40,501
Dial the number. What else?

421
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,968
Punch in those four numbers there.

422
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,413
- And?
- Ask for Eve.

423
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:49,448
- What?
- Ask for Eve.

424
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:01,021
Go on, go home.

425
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:06,602
Godspeed, Bob.

426
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:09,864
- Johnson.
- My ticket to the dance.

427
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:24,180
Here we go. We got one.

428
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,485
12-14, Kima.

429
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,059
We got a disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

430
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,287
Affirmative. I'll eyeball it to the gate.

431
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,057
- Raise our boys.
- Right.

432
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:36,894
- What's Kima rolling as?
- Gas and electric.

433
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,121
- Yes?
- Everything's good.

434
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,688
- You coming in now?
- Yes.

435
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:56,069
White DAC truck coming at you
pulling a red can.

436
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,012
Serial Number: X-W-B, as in "boy"...

437
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:02,346
C-1-5-7-7-2-6-8.

438
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:06,487
- Driver: white male with brown hair. Copy?
- Copy.

439
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:09,349
I'm out of this as soon as he clears the gate.

440
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:12,053
The van has too much profile on it
right now.

441
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,130
Copy that, too. We're up.

442
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:22,728
- Broken seal?
- Hey, Frank.

443
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,265
What's missing?

444
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:28,037
Nothing so as we can tell.
Can's full of diapers.

445
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:30,203
- Diapers?
- Disposables, yeah.

446
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:34,775
I'm thinking not even your crew
would steal Pampers off the dock, right?

447
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,477
I'm not so sure.

448
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:39,817
Customs seal probably just broke
on the offload, is all.

449
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,422
When's Bea Russell coming back
from the Fairfield piers?

450
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,263
Who, Beadie? She's not down Fairfield.

451
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:55,065
Don't you worry, Frank.
Your girl will be back soon enough.

452
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,729
- Yeah?
- She's detailed.

453
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,206
Something to do with city police.

454
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,381
All right, we're up.

455
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:15,418
I'm out. You have the eyeball.

456
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,351
12-08, copy that.

457
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,694
First I got this thing on my phone bill.

458
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:28,794
Now I hear Bea Russell's doing some shit
with real police.

459
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:30,202
You're paranoid, Frank.

460
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:32,798
- Why would she lie?
- Shit if I know.

461
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:38,813
- The Greek has two today, right?
- Boris comes back in an hour.

462
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:42,874
The second can's in a lower bay
ready to offload when I get to it.

463
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:46,379
Check that can through straight up.
You got it?

464
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:48,354
Enter it on the computer, like any other.

465
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:51,052
The next can after it,
make that one disappear.

466
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,492
You want me to lose a clean can?

467
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:56,088
- And give it to the Russian, yeah.
- You gonna tell them?

468
00:38:56,366 --> 00:39:00,166
If I'm going nuts, I'll calm down tomorrow.
We'll slip the hot can off the pier.

469
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,068
If I'm right about this, they'll thank me.

470
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,539
And, Horse, make sure nobody's living
in that can when you stack it.

471
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:09,077
I know.

472
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,084
We got something here.

473
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:22,490
Another disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

474
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,893
They're running them out in tandem.

475
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,930
- That means "one after the other," Jimmy.
- I know what it means.

476
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,293
12-08.

477
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:31,295
Carver, what's the status of your truck?

478
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:33,868
Left the can at the warehouse
and rolled out.

479
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,262
- You want us on the truck or the can?
- The can.

480
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:38,532
Copy.

481
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,070
- I got no eyes at the port.
- Kima?

482
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:45,147
- She pulled up.
- I got it.

483
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:49,082
But the truck already left. You won't make it.

484
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,653
I'll call the MPA, delay the truck.

485
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,857
Do it. You're still here?

486
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,457
Good call.

487
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:30,015
License and registration, please.
You were doing 24 mph in a 20 mph zone.

488
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,986
- You stop for 24 mph?
- License and registration.

489
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,507
Christ, I wish we had a tap
on the port office phone.

490
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:01,616
I just wanted to give you a heads up.

491
00:42:01,718 --> 00:42:04,482
That last little item we sent out, it's wrong.

492
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:06,646
I knew it was wrong when I let it go.

493
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:09,157
Not on the phone, Frank.

494
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,157
Okay, but this time he needs to be there.

495
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:18,191
In fact, he wants to be there
to hear this shit.

496
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:54,129
Go ahead, open it.

497
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:24,432
Bobbie Dolls.

498
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:44,414
What the fuck is this bullshit?

499
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:49,480
I am waiting for Russian vodka
and you bring me trash from Taiwan.

500
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:52,220
Give me your phone. Fucking Polacks.

501
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:55,286
Are they thieves or are they stupid?

502
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:02,664
He's dialing the same number.

503
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:06,732
It came, but it's nothing.

504
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,877
It's bullshit.

505
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:15,278
I was expecting this. Just get rid of it.

506
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,352
Get rid of it where?

507
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,117
Drop it in the fucking street.

508
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:27,690
- This is sweet.
- The boss man.

509
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:30,490
And we're on him.

510
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,468
- 7 a.m.?
- Man, what the fuck do you think?

511
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:36,003
We gotta be there, in place,
when they come on.

512
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:37,470
Shit is early.

513
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:39,439
Y'all down for this?

514
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:43,103
'Cause I can find me some motherfuckers
to swing bats for me if I have to.

515
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:45,737
You didn't say nothing about no bats.
All right.

516
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:49,375
That's the fuck I'm talking about.
Bring your boys, too. 7:00.

517
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,248
- Hey, Poot.
- Yo, Poot.

518
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:54,883
Come on, man.

519
00:44:57,126 --> 00:44:59,822
God damn,
you're a pussy-crazed motherfucker.

520
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:02,227
A nigger can't look at a female?

521
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:04,923
Yeah, but you be getting dizzy
behind that shit.

522
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:07,901
- At least I be getting some.
- Well, I be getting some, too.

523
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:10,404
But I don't make it my everything.

524
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:15,511
Lieutenant, you still up?

525
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:17,740
I'm here.

526
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,743
I'm still on this second can,
but it doesn't make sense.

527
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:24,115
He went to ground
at an appliance store off Eastern.

528
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,149
Now he's dumping it.

529
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:29,014
10-4. Come home.

530
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:34,692
- You don't wanna sit on the can?
- Negative. The can is clean.

531
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:55,507
I don't know, Uncle Frank.

532
00:45:55,618 --> 00:45:58,587
Putting two and two together,
and coming up with six, maybe.

533
00:45:58,688 --> 00:45:59,814
Maybe.

534
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,854
You called Spiros still, right?

535
00:46:05,194 --> 00:46:07,185
Spiros will know what to do.

536
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:12,928
Come past early tomorrow.
I wanna get down the diner first thing.

537
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,333
All right.

538
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:21,342
I can't keep up with him.

539
00:46:21,444 --> 00:46:23,207
What's with the duck?

540
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:25,973
Ziggy.

541
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,423
Is Daniels around?

542
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:39,290
- No.
- What's the deal with can number two?

543
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,096
No contraband.

544
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:45,228
Heard them complaining about it
on the wire. Somebody fucked up.

545
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:50,296
The fact is, they even called the boss man
about it.

546
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:56,976
That's a good day.
You guys going for a taste?

547
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,480
No, I'm gonna chase the paperwork.

548
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:04,748
I gotta spring the sitter.
But for a ride home, I'll go for a quick beer.

549
00:47:04,854 --> 00:47:08,312
- But more than one, I get sleepy.
- Yeah, me, too.

550
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:12,886
- What, you short a car?
- Need new brake pads.

551
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,110
Two. Boys.

552
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:31,646
How about you?

553
00:47:32,548 --> 00:47:34,038
Boy and a girl.

554
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:36,009
And your husband, he...

555
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,418
None of my business, I know,
but did he die or something?

556
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:43,720
You mean 'cause no one would leave
a beauty like me unless he kicked?

557
00:47:43,926 --> 00:47:45,553
I was just asking.

558
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:47,560
He left me.

559
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,692
Left us.

560
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,965
Picked up, moved south.

561
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,936
Said it was either my job or him.

562
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:01,540
That I was neglecting my duties
around the house, all that.

563
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:05,273
Said that he didn't get married
in order to cook his own dinner.

564
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:08,077
Anyway, he's cooking his own dinner now.

565
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:16,188
What about with you and your wife?
What happened?

566
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:20,256
She died.

567
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:28,831
- Not now, Gus. I'm good.
- Whatever you say, Jimmy.

568
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:33,438
So, you about ready to go?

569
00:48:33,843 --> 00:48:36,744
- Sure.
- Be right back. I just gotta make a call.

570
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:01,327
Please enter your code now.

571
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:07,765
- Hi, may I help you?
- Yeah, let me talk to Eve.

572
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:12,939
- This is Eve.
- I'm looking to connect.

573
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:14,573
Would you like a date tonight?

574
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:18,176
No, not tonight.
I'm back in town in a couple of nights.

575
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:22,490
- Have you been entertained by us before?
- No, first time for me.

576
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,288
We can arrange whatever you like,
whenever you like.

577
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:27,862
What kind of a girl are you looking for?

578
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:31,491
We have a variety for you to choose from
when you arrive.

579
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:33,626
When are you thinking of coming?

580
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:09,734
Just give me a minute.

581
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,973
Stop! Move away from the cookiejar.

582
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:34,183
Long day.

583
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,155
Yeah, me, too.

584
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:52,502
Thanks for the beer.

585
00:51:53,442 --> 00:51:54,636
Goodbye.

586
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:15,087
Hey, y'all, they coming.

587
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:18,395
What these motherfuckers think
they looking at?

588
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:21,463
Nigger, you've lost
your motherfucking mind.

589
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,368
- You're standing on my real estate.
- Mine now.

590
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:29,138
- Took it while you was resting.
- Y'all too late.

591
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:37,909
Look, I'm gonna let you walk off right now,
or we could do it the other way.

592
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,984
Who you got to do it the other way? Them?

593
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:48,921
- You gonna see me in your sleep.
- Yeah, I know.

594
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:55,802
That's right. Keep walking, bitch.

595
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,502
They gonna come back.

596
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:02,777
Yeah. The way we just punked them,
they got to.

597
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:13,985
- Where is he?
- You can talk to me, Frank.

598
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:16,956
- This is bigger than you.
- I'll tell him what you say.

599
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:18,993
Bullshit. Come on, Nick.

600
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:31,231
That's the Greek? That old guy?
I seen him in here before.

601
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:34,841
Have a seat.

602
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:54,260
A long time since we talk, Frank.

603
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:57,361
- Coffee, something?
- We're good.

604
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:01,998
What's on your mind?

605
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:05,068
Every goddamn thing.

606
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:08,305
For one,
I think my cell phone's being tapped.

607
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:12,039
All of a sudden, the phone company
don't care if I pay my bills anymore.

608
00:54:12,147 --> 00:54:15,708
Meantime, I hear that our regular port cop,
the one that found your girls...

609
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:19,049
got pulled off to work some special thing
with the city police.

610
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:21,588
- So you switched the can.
- I ran a test.

611
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,284
I gave you that clean one,
put yours in the stacks.

612
00:54:24,393 --> 00:54:27,021
Straight away,
the MPA cops stop that Russian's truck...

613
00:54:27,129 --> 00:54:29,222
right after he picked it up.

614
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:31,962
I think someone's got a line
into our computer.

615
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:33,091
Very smart.

616
00:54:33,202 --> 00:54:36,330
As soon as you called,
I shut down the warehouse.

617
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:40,070
That's fine. But now we're going to
have to open the warehouse again.

618
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:43,201
Lose a few more clean cans,
deliver them there.

619
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:47,342
If someone's watching,
show them we have nothing to hide.

620
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:50,009
Our cut stays the same though, right?

621
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:51,817
You kidding?

622
00:54:52,254 --> 00:54:53,846
What's your name?

623
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:55,954
- Nick.
- Sobotka.

624
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:01,422
That's a fair question, Niko.

625
00:55:01,797 --> 00:55:05,233
But it has to be the same for everyone:
no work, no pay.

626
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:08,531
Doesn't matter what's in the cans.
We still gotta check them through.

627
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:12,164
- That's work, isn't it?
- We take gas, so do you.

628
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:14,435
- You don't understand...
- I understand completely.

629
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:16,602
No one is in this for love.

630
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,881
It ain't just the money.

631
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:23,883
I got things happening right now.
Things with my union. Right now!

632
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,948
Not a fucking month from now,
when the legislative session is history. Now!

633
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:38,133
Okay. We pay you still.

634
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:42,370
I'm thinking of all the business we do
in the future...

635
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:45,169
and I want you should be happy.

636
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:48,002
Thanks.

637
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:55,349
It's a new world, Frank.

638
00:55:56,585 --> 00:55:58,712
You should go out
and spend some of the money...

639
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:02,917
on something you can touch:
a new car, a new coat.

640
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:06,656
It's why we get up in the morning, right?
