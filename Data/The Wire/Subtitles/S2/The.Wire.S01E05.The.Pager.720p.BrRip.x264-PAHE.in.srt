1
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,441
...the big fat morning show.

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,976
Now, you wanna play
the brand new big fat game:

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,875
big fat match game, call us now....

4
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:17,429
Hello?

5
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,433
Hello?

6
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:23,805
Who was that?

7
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:28,410
-They hung up without saying.
-They hung up without saying?

8
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:35,283
What you care?

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,881
You never use the damn phone
in here no how.

10
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:26,840
What's up, baby?

11
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,671
I need you to get
them phone lines up out that house.

12
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:31,769
Out of the apartment? Why?

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,314
I'm saying, what Chantay gonna say...

14
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,680
about not havin' no line in her own place?

15
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:40,047
All right. Got you.

16
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:43,415
What's up, baby, you got a problem?

17
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:45,356
-Good.
-I'm just sayin' though, man...

18
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,587
it seem we just goin' past careful, man...

19
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:48,993
with all of this, man.

20
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:52,396
Like we buggin' out or something.
You know, like we paranoid and shit.

21
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:02,770
Naw, I don't wanna use this phone.
We used this phone yesterday.

22
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:06,472
What you blowing out your mouth for, man?

23
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:07,741
You act like....

24
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,943
Ain't nobody out to get me, man.
I got no motherfuckin' enemies.

25
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,108
Naw, man.

26
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:14,622
We all right.

27
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,078
All right, this gonna be so easy...

28
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,091
them Eastside chumps,
they ain't nothing like Avon's people.

29
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:00,058
Watch, y'all gonna see.

30
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:03,126
All right, now y'all gonna be here, right?

31
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,160
Hold up.

32
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,059
Yo, Boo!

33
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:09,534
I'm gonna slide up through here.

34
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:12,401
Bailey, you gonna cover the alley.

35
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,707
Yo!

36
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:22,445
Yo, Maurice short, man.

37
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,177
-How short?
-Three.

38
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,150
Tell him to grow a couple of inches.

39
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,223
Where you gonna be at?

40
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,128
That be the trap right there, homes.

41
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:41,225
You figure they roll
through the alley for sure?

42
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:45,101
Man, rats always run
to holes in times of danger.

43
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:47,098
And you him, ain't you?

44
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,199
-Who?
-Danger.

45
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:52,512
Naw, man, I'm just a nigger
with a plan, that all.

46
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,104
And a shotgun.

47
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:56,211
For sure.

48
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,117
Sorry I'm late.

49
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:02,689
Got myself lost down the other hallway.

50
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:07,325
-That leads to the loading dock.
-Yeah, and deep storage.

51
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,564
So, this is where they put you?

52
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,428
Quite a message they're sending.

53
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:15,559
-Yeah, and that message is....
-Out of sight, out of mind.

54
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,729
Spoken like a true troglodyte.

55
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,873
Whole lot of dead trees
behind this nonsense.

56
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:24,968
The foundation of your case, Detective.

57
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,274
You lay it in right, you can build on it.

58
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:29,976
You lay it in wrong,
everything on top falls.

59
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,346
We ready?

60
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:35,279
Do you solemnly swear and affirm
that the affidavit is true...

61
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,517
and accurate to the best of your knowledge?

62
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,614
-I do.
-I do.

63
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,718
Then by the power vested in me,
I now declare you man and wife.

64
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:45,294
-Did he swear already?
-The state's attorney?

65
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,389
Yeah.

66
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,490
I see it.

67
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:51,398
Second copy is sealed for the court,
and the police get the others.

68
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,734
How's this work?

69
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,533
Same frequency as the one
carried by D'Angelo Barksdale.

70
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,975
He gets a page, we get a page.

71
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:02,714
-So, we up now?
-It's official.

72
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,645
-You're up.
-Then let the game begin.

73
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:15,319
Celebrities always seem much smaller
when you meet them in person.

74
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:24,829
Yo!

75
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,128
Yo!

76
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,075
Check it out, here he come.

77
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:36,140
-Somethin' ain't right, yo.
-Watch out, man, he got that boom.

78
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,615
-He's packing.
-Here he come.

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,518
Yo, come on, Omar's coming, man!

80
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:44,115
Oh, shit!

81
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:07,307
Yeah...

82
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:10,548
the cheese stands alone.

83
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:15,720
-How you know?
-'Cause if you could, I'd have been had.

84
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:19,216
Yo, he saying you can't catch the bug...

85
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,056
just by getting your dick sucked.

86
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:24,325
Dumb-ass, you gotta be
in some pussy to get it, all right?

87
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:28,300
Man, wear a coat if you want,
don't nobody like suckin' on a rubber.

88
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:30,098
How would you know?

89
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,176
Who you trying to fuck anyway?

90
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,943
Arletta Mouzone. Treenee's cousin.

91
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,682
Damn, man, in that case
use a big-ass condom, all right?

92
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,118
You need a trash bag. Fuck that.

93
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:50,918
I wouldn't run up in that bitch
with D'Angelo's dick....

94
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,117
It's triflin'.

95
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:15,380
Easy to see why niggers come
around here stealing our shit!

96
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,417
Yo, you know what, nigger?

97
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:20,888
What?

98
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,357
Forget it.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,764
142 isn't a working telephone exchange.

100
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,930
Six intercepts so far,
and five aren't working numbers?

101
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,405
Something wrong with the recorder?

102
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,945
We're getting what you'd expect,
seven digits of a telephone number...

103
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:48,413
and a two-digit add-on to identify
the caller, like here, 13.

104
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,781
McNulty, line one.

105
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:54,913
-Yeah.
-Did youjust get a 142 exchange?

106
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:56,580
Yeah, that's what we got, too.

107
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:58,682
-That's fucked up.
-All right, later.

108
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:04,592
He's got the same numbers
on the readout of the cloned pagers.

109
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,132
So it's not the recorder.

110
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,725
These mopes are using a code
to cover their calls?

111
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:11,703
-That's pretty damn sophisticated.
-What is?

112
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:16,275
They've coded the telephone numbers
in their pager messages.

113
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:17,435
How do you know?

114
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:19,877
Every time the Barksdale kid's pager
goes off...

115
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,074
this machine gives us a message and time.

116
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:25,209
McNulty's carrying a cloned pager,
but this is what we use in court.

117
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,718
Same with those pen registers.

118
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,790
Every time a pay phone
in the low-rise court is used...

119
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:33,486
we get the telephone number,
the time and the duration of the call.

120
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:34,888
Incoming calls, too.

121
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,862
Spy shit. Very cool.

122
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:40,525
You say they're using some kind of code?

123
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:43,933
Yeah, they got to be.
These numbers don't make no fuckin' sense.

124
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,234
-You rang?
-Omar's ride.

125
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:52,573
Bubbles spotted it.

126
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,548
Different tags, no stolen report,
these come back right for the van...

127
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:59,017
but Bubs makes it
by the cargo rack on the roof.

128
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,317
Good scope. You wanna take him?

129
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,783
Can't hurt to try.

130
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:07,320
We pop Omar, get a gun,
he might let us work him.

131
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,363
Anything coming through on the pager?

132
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:15,897
Eight hits so far,
most of them in some kind of code.

133
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,369
These ain't Baltimore exchanges,
that's for sure.

134
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:23,932
Three weeks to get Daniels to agree,
a week to write out the affidavit...

135
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,342
and then this bullshit.

136
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:29,113
How complex a code can it be
if these knuckleheads are using it?

137
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:33,385
Then again, what does it say
about us if we can't break it?

138
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:38,021
You wanna run Bubs back downtown,
I'll sit here and wait for you.

139
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,319
All right.

140
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:46,659
-What'd I miss, girlfriend?
-Not a goddamn thing.

141
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,996
Yeah, boring, ain't we?

142
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:52,600
How y'all do what you do every day
and not wanna get high?

143
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:54,599
That's what I be asking.

144
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,941
It's been a little hectic down here,
right, cuz?

145
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,748
String, man, I can't lie.

146
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:11,057
Them stick-up boys,
they caught us dead up.

147
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:14,786
And the knockos, shit,
I don't know what the fuck that was.

148
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,589
5-0. Comin' up!

149
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:19,461
-5-0 comin' up, y'all.
-Time-out.

150
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:22,661
-C'mon, man, what is that?
-What?

151
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,931
You gotta get your crew
to understand that...

152
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,166
it's the stick-up crews and the creepers...

153
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,833
that give us the most trouble.

154
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,843
When they start thinking like that...

155
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,470
you're not gonna have any more surprises,
you feel me?

156
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,776
'Cause you know, your uncle and me...

157
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:38,716
we think you got a snitch up in the shop.

158
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,879
-What?
-Someone who tips off the stick-up crew.

159
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:46,716
And you gotta be on that, right?
You gotta be on that.

160
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,888
I'm gonna tell you what you do.

161
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:51,362
What day is it today, Friday?

162
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:52,989
What happen on Friday?

163
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:56,098
-Payday.
-Not this Friday.

164
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:57,192
Why not?

165
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,102
No, what you gonna do
is you gonna call 'em...

166
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:01,902
Iike you gonna pay 'em
and then you crack 'em.

167
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,533
You tell 'em you're not happy...

168
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:05,874
with what they fuckin' pass
as work down here.

169
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,245
And when you're not happy,
they ain't gettin' paid. You feel me?

170
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,877
Yeah, but String, you don't pay a nigger,
he ain't gonna work for you.

171
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:15,251
What, you think a nigger's gonna get a job?

172
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:17,790
You think these niggers
gonna be like, "Fuck it...

173
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,087
"Iet me quit this game here
and go to college"?

174
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:23,755
Naw, they gonna buck a little,
but they not gonna walk.

175
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:27,457
-And in the end, you gonna get respect.
-Yeah.

176
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,770
And when that money run out,
they'll come up to you and roll on you...

177
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,034
And when that money run out,
they'll come up to you and roll on you...

178
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:36,269
and ask you for an advance and shit,
when they flat-ass broke.

179
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:39,578
Them the niggers
that you strike off your list.

180
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:42,342
But that nigger that stay eatin'...

181
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,219
the nigger that steady rollin',
ain't askin' you for shit...

182
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:50,947
that's the nigger I want
to hear about. Understand?

183
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:57,025
Yeah, man, shit, you know how
to play a nigger into a corner, String.

184
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:00,430
-Yo, take care of this right here.
-You my favorite girl.

185
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:03,167
Shit, let me handle this, man.

186
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,603
-Yo, Poot.
-Yeah, l--

187
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,676
-Come here, man.
-What's happening?

188
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:12,509
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?

189
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:14,376
You know the fuckin' rules.

190
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:42,306
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Copying.

191
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:46,079
A telephone.

192
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:49,606
This fucking detail is too much for me.

193
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:00,818
It's after 3:00.

194
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:03,086
So, where are the boys at?

195
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:05,756
Maybe they only come out at night.

196
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:10,464
I used to have a guy
like Omar working for me.

197
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,539
Guy named Reuben Terry.

198
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:15,200
Is he good?

199
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,607
Saw the street like we wish we could.

200
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:20,746
Ain't nothing like a good Cl.

201
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:25,546
School's out.

202
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,455
Can I use your cell phone?

203
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:46,535
Yeah, I got that. I did.

204
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,169
I know.

205
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,712
I don't know about this....

206
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,715
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-How can I trust you....

207
00:14:56,817 --> 00:15:00,776
For chrissakes, Elena, I'm their father.
You think I'd let 'em sleep on the floor?

208
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:02,980
Yes, I got them.

209
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:06,754
Sheets, pillows, comforters, pillowcases.

210
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:07,987
I fuckin' got them.

211
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:09,255
What color are they?

212
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:12,264
Color, what the fuck do you care
what color they are? Hello?

213
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:20,732
-Lost her.
-I bet.

214
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,272
You know something?

215
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:26,576
My ex-wife, the way she acts sometimes,
the way she deals with shit...

216
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:33,876
you would think a less enlightened man
than myself, cruder man than myself...

217
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:37,890
a man less sensitized to the qualities
and charms and value of women...

218
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:41,587
a man like that, not me, but a man like
that, he just might call her a cunt.

219
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:45,164
You just called the mother
of your children a cunt.

220
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,733
No, I did not call her that.

221
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,768
-Yes, you fuckin' did.
-No, I did not.

222
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:51,337
Let's just leave this, okay?
I got some stuff to do.

223
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:58,774
5-0, gotta go.
Whoa, man, get out the way!

224
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:07,342
Shit.

225
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:10,423
Not much fighting this time.
You getting tired, asshole?

226
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:12,856
Still dragging from
the whupping Kima put on him.

227
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,053
Fucked you up like
a cop should, didn't she?

228
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:18,654
That's one thing about Kima,
she put a hurtin' on you like a man.

229
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,629
Get your monkey ass up.

230
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:26,533
You're gonna want your
business card back, right?

231
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:28,234
Come on.

232
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:37,440
From Bantry Bay to the Derry Quay

233
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:40,951
And from Galway to Dublin town

234
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:44,113
Well, I've never seen

235
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,116
My brown Colleen

236
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,726
That I met in the County Down

237
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,197
There's a man in the County Down

238
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:06,909
There's a man in the County Down

239
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:08,845
First, I go in, play nice.

240
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,680
-Then you come in, play bad.
-I ain't gonna be playin'.

241
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,092
Bracelet too tight?

242
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,718
You rackin' up all kinds
of points, ain't you?

243
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:51,848
First, you put a cop in the hospital,
damn near kill his ass with that punch.

244
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,923
Now, you on the wing from Boys' Village.

245
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:59,088
Man, I'm 16, all right?
What the fuck they gonna do to me?

246
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,162
That's the least of your
worries, my friend.

247
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:06,103
I got a partner outside who can't wait
to get in here and fuck you up.

248
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:08,973
Cop you banged was Herc's uncle.

249
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:12,403
Herc wants off the leash on this one.

250
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:17,348
And I suppose you
at the other end of that leash?

251
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:25,657
See, I don't want to play it that way.

252
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,824
I know about comin' up hard and all.

253
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,926
Why, you came up hard?

254
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,604
Flag House projects. Eastside.

255
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,906
Yeah, Flag House?

256
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,010
You know, you remind me of me.

257
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:56,020
I'm thinking we should work something out.

258
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:00,854
What do I get?

259
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,696
What you want?

260
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,967
I want....

261
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:21,772
for you to suck my dick.

262
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:32,155
I'll beat your fuckin' monkey ass.

263
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,824
You supposed to be the good cop,
dumb motherfucker.

264
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,260
What?

265
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:51,111
-Hello, may I help you?
-Yeah, we'd like a table.

266
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:52,872
And you have reservations?

267
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,439
Naw, I thought, you know,
we could just walk in....

268
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:59,382
Let me see what I got.

269
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:02,247
That's two?

270
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:08,385
Follow me, please.

271
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:20,305
Your coat, ma'am?

272
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:25,343
-Can we get that one, over there?
-It's Friday night...

273
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,470
those are for patrons
who made reservations.

274
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,515
Let me get your chair for you, ma'am.

275
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,550
-It's okay, man, all right.
-Here you are.

276
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,557
Here you are, sir.

277
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:43,095
Your waiter will be with you shortly.

278
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,360
You shoulda pushed him, Dee.

279
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:13,186
Bastards.

280
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:34,805
Sarge, nobody answers at juvenile intake
and we been calling.

281
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:38,043
Clearly, they're not
as dedicated as you two detectives.

282
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:41,052
So what time does
the duty intake consultant get here?

283
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:44,453
You missed the 8:00.
You got another one around midnight.

284
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:48,927
-Midnight?
-You think maybe if we left you...

285
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:52,226
the paperwork, you could put him
in the box 'til intake gets here?

286
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:06,243
Hemorrhoid.

287
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,195
For the crumbs.

288
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:25,230
Yeah, right.

289
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:31,594
-You like your dinner?
-Yeah.

290
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:35,404
-That shrimp was right.
-Yeah, it was good, right?

291
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,514
Think they know?

292
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:45,683
Do they know what?

293
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:48,345
You know. What I'm about.

294
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:51,284
What you mean, Dee?

295
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:54,954
Come on, you know, it's like...

296
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:57,762
we get all dressed up, right?

297
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:00,765
Come all the way across town.
Fancy place like this.

298
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:03,563
After we finished, we gonna
go down to the harbor.

299
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,467
Walk around a little bit, you know?

300
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:08,166
Acting like we belong down here,
know what I'm saying?

301
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:10,937
So? Your money good, right?

302
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,375
Dee, we ain't the only
black people in here.

303
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:20,681
It ain't what I'm talking about.
It's about where we.... Come on, you know.

304
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:25,323
I'm just saying, you know,
I feel like some shit just stay with you...

305
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:28,788
you know what I'm saying,
like, hard as you try...

306
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:31,420
you still can't go nowhere,
you know what I'm saying?

307
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:35,262
-Can I interest you in dessert?
-Yes, thank you.

308
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:39,238
-Can I have some chocolate cake?
-I'll bring the cart.

309
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:46,035
Boy, don't nobody give a damn
about you and your story.

310
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:49,377
You got money,
you get to be whatever you say you are.

311
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:51,246
That's the way it is.

312
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:58,481
Sir, I'm sorry. These are the samples.

313
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:08,224
And for you, sir? Very good.

314
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:18,677
Don't be a bitch, admit it.

315
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:22,710
Go ahead.

316
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:28,481
-Admit you're wrong, be a man.
-Yeah, I gotta confess...

317
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:32,282
this sub beats chink-ass Bob's by a mile.

318
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:32,826
'Course, you might be all that when
it comes to thumpin' on niggers...

319
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:35,920
'Course, you might be all that when
it comes to thumpin' on niggers...

320
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,657
but you can't do shit with that stick, man.

321
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,661
-You'd do better.
-I play.

322
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:43,502
Says he plays.

323
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,063
He might.

324
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,472
I'm even better with two hands.

325
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:53,478
I checked it out, man.
Stinkum true on this one.

326
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,542
Except for that nigger, Scar,
from New York...

327
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,875
Edmondson gully is wide open.

328
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:00,350
What about Tee-Tee's crew?

329
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:03,423
Naw, them niggers dried up
when they took that federal charge.

330
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:06,048
Most of 'em laid up somewhere,
gettin' high and shit.

331
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,651
I'll tell you what. You
holler at the boy Scar.

332
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:12,391
Let him know, man, it's time
for him to take a stroll.

333
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:15,559
If he give you any beef at all,
we'll put Wee-Bey and Bird on it.

334
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:18,069
-All right.
-And then once we got him outta there...

335
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:22,039
we'll send in the smokers to run out
all the little poop-butt locals and shit.

336
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:24,940
Or, if you think
there's some cats in there who got game...

337
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:28,276
-then we put 'em on our team.
-All right, who you want to run it?

338
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:30,144
-Send Stinkum up here.
-All right.

339
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,276
He the one who saw the shot.
So, he gets a shot.

340
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:45,661
All right, okay, not bad.

341
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:48,099
Can't let the duty officer see that.

342
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:50,863
You wanna give it a rest, man?
You down $60.

343
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:54,566
That might be your whole damn salary,
but I clock that shit in minutes.

344
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:58,235
-Rack 'em and break 'em, man.
-You the guys waiting for juvenile intake?

345
00:25:58,345 --> 00:26:00,108
He's in the squad room.

346
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:04,016
If I had more time, I'd run you.

347
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:08,553
Give you a tip, Preston.

348
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:12,081
You gonna run a hustle,
you best stay with what you know.

349
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:15,987
Man, fuck you and your
tired-ass advice, all right?

350
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:22,596
But that sandwich was good.

351
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:36,240
You gonna move our little thing
down to Edmondson Avenue.

352
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:37,941
Take the gully.

353
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,978
What about Scar?

354
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,313
Who?

355
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:48,352
Listen, I'm giving you points
on the package...

356
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:51,663
so, you make a go of it, you hear me?

357
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:56,296
You working for yourself, too,
so you gonna put out the strong product...

358
00:26:56,403 --> 00:26:58,598
and you gonna get the locals behind it.

359
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:01,765
It's as simple as that.
You get your team together, you feel me?

360
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,333
Go and wait for me downstairs.
I'll be down in a minute, man.

361
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:10,280
-We gonna make this money run in a few.
-Smile or something, nigger.

362
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:14,951
-Made that nigger's night.
-Yeah, he deserved it, though.

363
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:16,215
He deserved it.

364
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,552
It's Wee-Bey. We got one.

365
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,028
-You think it's Omar?
-Nah.

366
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:29,760
-It's one of the young 'uns, I think.
-One down, two to go, right?

367
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:33,561
Yeah, motherfuckers. Try to rob me, baby.

368
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:24,348
One, two, three.

369
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,716
-A winner.
-A match? Which case?

370
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:59,451
The one you just brought me, Bunk.
Casing in that girl shot up in Northeast.

371
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,527
-Kresson?
-Diedre Kresson, right, yeah.

372
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:04,358
She matches up with two other cases,
both from last year.

373
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:07,729
-Which ones?
-Toreen Boyle....

374
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:11,736
-Someone named Ligget. It's in the report.
-It's Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

375
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:12,964
Yeah, them.

376
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:17,305
Casings from all three killings go
to a .45, probably Colt Classic.

377
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:21,841
-That fucker Landsman. How's he do it?
-You like Landsman for these three?

378
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:23,210
I don't know, Bunk.

379
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:28,015
As sergeants go, Jay's a sociopath and all,
but I'd have to go with an actual gangster.

380
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,654
Jimmy, you sitting down?

381
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,421
I said it was hot, but ifyou
got these barbecue gloves.

382
00:29:35,795 --> 00:29:37,387
You got a Johnny Weeks up in here?

383
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:39,124
-Who?
-Johnny Weeks.

384
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:41,666
-Over in the game room.
-Obliged.

385
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:44,259
-Any smokes?
-I'm out.

386
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:47,272
How long have you been here?
You gotta give the medication...

387
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:49,274
a chance to work in your system, man.

388
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,279
Brought you something.

389
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,351
Yeah, some chicken pieces and some fries.

390
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:11,128
Bought you a shake,
but I dropped it on the bus.

391
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:17,469
It comes in a bag, goes out in a bag.

392
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,373
How long you have that for?

393
00:30:28,515 --> 00:30:31,351
-I fucked up, man.
-Yeah, I saw.

394
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:32,318
-I fucked up, man.
-Yeah, I saw.

395
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,651
There was nothing I could do, you know?

396
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:40,958
It's like first I got beat,
right, then I get this.

397
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:45,892
What are these for?

398
00:30:49,903 --> 00:30:51,495
They say I got the bug.

399
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:57,403
The bug?

400
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,375
They checked me when
I was in the hospital--

401
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,707
Are they sure?

402
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:11,656
Where you been at?

403
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:15,886
Here and there, I'm at it.

404
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:18,793
I'd have come past sooner,
but I been on kinda like a mission.

405
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:21,560
-A mission?
-Yeah. Them hoppers that beat you down...

406
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:22,930
they got problems now.

407
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:25,197
Them and the people they sling for, even.

408
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:26,294
What?

409
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:29,574
I put the police on their ass.

410
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,977
Police?

411
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:34,376
-What, you get locked up or something?
-No, come on.

412
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,348
No, I'm not working for them.
I'm working with them.

413
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:41,244
They don't give me the badge soon enough,
I keep doing like I do.

414
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:43,453
Why?

415
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:48,591
What do you mean why?
How can you ask me why?

416
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:52,928
Why the fuck are you in here, man,
with all these falling-down motherfuckers?

417
00:31:53,032 --> 00:31:55,159
Why you passing shit through a bag?

418
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:57,294
Why they beat you down?

419
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:00,098
Why I couldn't do nothing about it?

420
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,165
It's all part of the game, right?

421
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:05,506
I mean, you taught me that.

422
00:32:18,157 --> 00:32:19,954
What you up to in here, man?

423
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:25,263
-Doing the meetings.
-N.A.?

424
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:28,760
Yeah. Twice a day.

425
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:33,428
That's good, man. It's good,
you give the body comfort, you know.

426
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,839
-Yeah.
-No, you needed a change.

427
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:38,901
Guess so.

428
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:43,275
I'll be getting out of here
the end of the month.

429
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,510
It's all right. They got
meetings everywhere.

430
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:47,643
You ain't gotta worry about that.

431
00:32:50,557 --> 00:32:51,546
Bubs.

432
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:57,029
Who's got the best package now?

433
00:32:57,196 --> 00:33:00,256
-Get the fuck out of here, man.
-I'm coming home, right?

434
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:06,728
Shit is weak all over, you know?

435
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,570
Got some boys up in Baker
and Calhoun, though.

436
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,803
They had a smoker out
the other day though.

437
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:14,243
-Yeah?
-Knocked a couple of niggers out.

438
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:16,879
Ain't you a trip?

439
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,614
Beat down, bagged up,
still ready to rip and run, huh?

440
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:24,618
I'm a Viking, homes.

441
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:26,923
"I'm a Viking, homes."

442
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,461
McNulty.

443
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:39,697
There's something here that needs kissing.

444
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:42,772
Speak again, toothless one.

445
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:46,242
I guess you know now why I wear
the stripes in the family.

446
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:49,440
Good call, Jay. Of course, if Keeley
hadn't fucked the scene up...

447
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,449
you'd have had that casing
months ago, right?

448
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:53,781
Keeley. Let Keeley be Keeley.

449
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:56,582
We all can't be princes
of the city, now can we?

450
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:58,256
Speaking of which...

451
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:00,615
sit down.

452
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:06,424
May I ask you a question
that is essential to your career?

453
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:08,523
-What?
-Who do you serve?

454
00:34:10,236 --> 00:34:14,002
I am asking you to identify for the record
your commanding officer.

455
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:15,802
-Major Rawls.
-Excellent.

456
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:18,089
And with that thought
in mind, I advise you

457
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:20,275
to go immediately into
the Major's office...

458
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,871
carrying the break
I've given you in the Kresson case...

459
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:24,711
and kiss the man's ring. Because...

460
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:27,411
I have talked you right
out of the shithouse.

461
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,151
Here's the deal.

462
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:31,950
You wrap up this thing
with Narcotics in two weeks.

463
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:35,186
You put yourself back in the rotation
when we go back to night work.

464
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:37,990
You do that and you're back in the fold.

465
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:41,796
-Thanks, Jay.
-No problem.

466
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,760
Shit ain't right.

467
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:47,806
You work, you get paid.

468
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:49,407
That's what I'm saying.

469
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:51,306
I'm gonna say something to him, all right?

470
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:53,641
-You should.
-Truth.

471
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:59,674
-What's up, Dee?
-What's up, Shorty?

472
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:05,521
$530, the count is right, man.

473
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:09,752
Okay, re-ups on the way down.

474
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:11,796
Go tell Sterling to be ready for it.

475
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:13,559
All right. Yo, Dee, man.

476
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:17,866
You know, me and Poot,
we been steady working it, you know?

477
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,097
Nothing sloppy, no troubles, right?

478
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:21,530
No.

479
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:26,271
And we was wondering if, maybe you could
let a little something go...

480
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:30,281
until payday, 'cause you know, right now,
we some broke-ass niggers, man.

481
00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:45,696
Right now, whoever did our girl...

482
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:47,789
also did Boyd and Leggett a month earlier.

483
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,198
-Leggett.
-And those two are definitely...

484
00:35:50,303 --> 00:35:52,237
straight-up drug executions.

485
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:54,435
No mention of Dee in either file.

486
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,872
But I did get a fresh number...

487
00:35:57,376 --> 00:35:59,867
-on Tywanda.
-Who?

488
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:02,113
The girl who called in on Kresson.

489
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:03,614
-Right.
-She put Dee in for that.

490
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:05,149
Have you seen this?

491
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:09,481
Jaybird.

492
00:36:09,655 --> 00:36:13,284
And the bear said, "You didn't
really come here to hunt now, did you?"

493
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:18,789
-You see Saturday's 24s?
-Sunday morning.

494
00:36:18,898 --> 00:36:21,025
Did you see the one Worden
got on the Westside?

495
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:24,661
John Bailey, in a Kevlar vest,
lit up by three separate shooters.

496
00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:26,597
Carey Street.

497
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,298
You made the Kresson connection...

498
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:30,841
you didn't think Bailey might tie in
with Barksdale?

499
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:35,744
Worden's on the other shift. I'm trying
to work my murders, Jesus Christ.

500
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,047
Tony, Line 3.

501
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:40,013
What took you so long?

502
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:42,883
You might've heard, we get a few murders
here in Baltimore...

503
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:44,320
sometimes we just get backed up.

504
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:47,415
-You weren't followed here?
-Why would we be followed?

505
00:36:47,894 --> 00:36:50,124
Diedre was playing with scary people.

506
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,095
Who might that be?

507
00:36:56,602 --> 00:37:00,197
You called this in after the murder
and you told the detective...

508
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:02,740
that you talked to her
the night she was killed.

509
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,639
She called. It was late.

510
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:08,805
She didn't talk long, she said she
had to go. Dee was at the door.

511
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:11,076
And that was the last time
you spoke with her?

512
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:14,984
-Yeah, she was killed that night.
-Dee was her boyfriend?

513
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:19,053
No, Dee was his nephew or something.

514
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:21,557
Dee would be D'Angelo Barksdale.

515
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:21,894
And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?

516
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:23,885
And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?

517
00:37:24,664 --> 00:37:25,995
You know Avon?

518
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,299
The question is how do you know him?

519
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:30,869
You out there running
the street with the players?

520
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,494
I used to be...

521
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:36,639
but not after this thing with Diedre.
I mean, damn.

522
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:40,471
We used to go to Odell's
for ladies' nights...

523
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,081
and one time he was there with all
his people in one of the big booths...

524
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:47,209
ordering drinks,
acting like he was king of everything.

525
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,717
And Diedre ate that shit up.

526
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:53,081
-And you?
-I ain't gonna lie.

527
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,394
I did the club thing for a while, but...

528
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:02,265
some of those places,
everybody in there's on some kind of game.

529
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:04,063
But Diedre went with Avon?

530
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,263
She was with Avon for like a year...

531
00:38:06,372 --> 00:38:10,502
and something happened. Toward the end,
she started getting real possessive...

532
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,545
and that didn't sit with Avon,
'cause he has other girls, too.

533
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:15,511
She started bitching on him one minute...

534
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:18,448
crying the next minute,
threatening to do all kinds of things.

535
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:21,782
-She threatened Avon Barksdale?
-The girl was off the hook.

536
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:25,053
One time, she threatened
to write a letter on him.

537
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:28,854
-A letter.
-A letter to the state's attorney.

538
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:31,660
Supposed to be some sort of kin to her.

539
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:34,530
She said that if he dumped her...

540
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:36,761
she was gonna tell about the drugs.

541
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:39,603
-Did she write this letter?
-I don't know.

542
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,232
I tried talking to her about the way she
was acting, but she wouldn't let it go.

543
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:48,109
She even had it out with him in his club
one night in front of all the people.

544
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:49,511
What, Avon has a club?

545
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:51,913
Orlando's, titty bar.

546
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:54,619
-Does he own it?
-That's what Diedre said.

547
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:57,387
She said he owned a whole mess of stuff.

548
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:15,903
-Tell me something, man.
-What's that?

549
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:19,645
How can you run this place
and not just OD on pussy?

550
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:20,734
Shit.

551
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:24,715
You try dealing with all these bitches
and their problems for a few days.

552
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:28,947
Get so you'd rather be running a goddamn
laundromat out this fucker.

553
00:39:29,488 --> 00:39:31,649
Heard you're doing okay in the Pit.

554
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:35,926
-Yeah, well.
-What, you ain't getting it like that?

555
00:39:37,196 --> 00:39:39,357
Man, my uncle
still got me working on salary.

556
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:40,693
Damn, boy.

557
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,394
You ain't the only one
your uncle keeps close.

558
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:44,591
What?

559
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:47,164
Come on, man, you ain't making no ends?

560
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:49,241
I know you getting
something on this by now.

561
00:39:49,342 --> 00:39:50,331
No, man.

562
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,702
I'm just the front,
clean name for the liquor board.

563
00:39:53,813 --> 00:39:55,576
-I'm saying--
-What the fuck?

564
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:58,514
Is there a problem?
That was for the drink before.

565
00:39:58,617 --> 00:39:59,549
It was for this one.

566
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:02,485
It ain't like I'm calling your uncle out
or nothing...

567
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:05,921
but give a nigger a chance.
Plenty of pie out there for everybody.

568
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:06,992
Believe.

569
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:10,722
You heard Stinkum gonna be coming off
the clock, right? Getting a percentage.

570
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,162
-What?
-Open up fresh territory.

571
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:16,132
Take over the corners
down near Edmondson and Brice.

572
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:19,627
So, my uncle gave that to Stink?

573
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:21,837
Figured you knew.

574
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:24,536
Orlando!

575
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:28,171
Excuse me, Orlando,
can you help me down here, please?

576
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,477
-I already paid for that last drink.
-That was for the drink before.

577
00:40:31,584 --> 00:40:33,848
-Hell, no, that was for this one.
-What's up here?

578
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:37,150
Look, he ain't paid for that drink
and I took $20 off the bar.

579
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:40,282
-Look she took $20, then $20 more.
-Hell I did.

580
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:42,961
Come on, now, why you
gonna do me like this?

581
00:40:43,062 --> 00:40:45,587
I been with you for an hour and a half
buying drinks.

582
00:40:45,698 --> 00:40:49,862
Look, man, this ain't right.
I just spent $1 20 in drinks, $40 in tips.

583
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:53,264
Now, you gonna take all that
and still try to sneak into my pocket?

584
00:40:53,372 --> 00:40:54,102
Shit, girl!

585
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:56,341
You got to go, get him
the fuck outta here.

586
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:58,672
I ain't done so much as touch your kneecap.

587
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:02,475
Trying to treat her with a little respect,
and this is the way you do me?

588
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:03,946
Wait, wait!

589
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:19,155
Why you do that?

590
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,102
-Did you take his money?
-No, I didn't take his money.

591
00:41:37,283 --> 00:41:38,841
You buying me a drink?

592
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,711
Can I see you sometime?

593
00:41:42,254 --> 00:41:44,381
Like, you know, not in here.

594
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,534
I don't usually see men
that I meet in here.

595
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,738
Usually.

596
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:13,781
What kind of strip joint has
a video camera looking out?

597
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,979
More to it than the girls, maybe.

598
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:20,787
So, he's got the club,
he's got the warehouse...

599
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:23,555
he's got the apartment building
by Druid Hill Lake...

600
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:25,493
he's got the tow truck company...

601
00:42:25,598 --> 00:42:29,557
and that's just what she knew from
what he bragged about to the dead girl.

602
00:42:30,035 --> 00:42:32,902
-Major likes assets.
-The Deputy, too, I imagine.

603
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:37,203
Nothing like a few property forfeitures
to swell the departmental operation budget.

604
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:39,641
Check city assessments to see
who owns the club.

605
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:43,010
Run the company name through
the state corporate charter office.

606
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:46,676
Also, Homicide picked up one
Saturday night. Might be one of ours.

607
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:50,821
John Bailey, he's a stick-up artist
I used to know from the Murphy homes.

608
00:42:50,923 --> 00:42:52,914
He was wearing Kevlar, but it didn't help.

609
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:55,858
39 casings on the scene,
from three different guns.

610
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:58,219
Overkill for a burn bag...

611
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:01,029
but about right if he
was running with Omar.

612
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:02,760
Lookit, our buddy.

613
00:43:15,648 --> 00:43:18,242
Just once, I wish they'd use
the right number.

614
00:43:23,822 --> 00:43:26,017
Ain't like him to be late.

615
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:36,761
Bailey, you fucking dope fiend.
I'm telling you...

616
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:39,971
them fucking people ain't to be relied on.

617
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:42,503
Why you always gotta talk like that, man?

618
00:43:42,608 --> 00:43:45,076
-What?
-"F" this and "f" that.

619
00:43:46,212 --> 00:43:50,842
If I give it up,
I lose half of what I mean to say.

620
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:54,380
Don't nobody want
to hear them dirty words, man.

621
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:58,682
Especially coming from
such a beautiful mouth.

622
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,002
Wait for Bailey?

623
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:19,500
Early bird catches the worm, dog.

624
00:44:44,236 --> 00:44:47,137
-I beeped you.
-I didn't get it.

625
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,206
-Let me see.
-You want to see my pager?

626
00:44:52,911 --> 00:44:55,141
Sure, Prez, you want to see my pager?

627
00:44:56,915 --> 00:44:59,247
-I beeped you too.
-You all right, Prez?

628
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:01,717
714-3432?

629
00:45:03,188 --> 00:45:05,179
I got that. That was you?

630
00:45:05,724 --> 00:45:06,782
You try it?

631
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:09,054
Yeah, I tried it. Twice.

632
00:45:09,461 --> 00:45:10,860
Non-working number.

633
00:45:11,563 --> 00:45:13,929
It would've worked if you knew the code.

634
00:45:18,504 --> 00:45:20,734
Shit, I'm as surprised as you.

635
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:25,138
I like word-search puzzles.

636
00:45:25,644 --> 00:45:28,044
You know, where you gotta
find the hidden words?

637
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:31,548
So, I thought I could do the same thing
with the numbers.

638
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,848
Take the number I sent you.

639
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:38,683
Now, take the seven
and jump it over the five.

640
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:41,248
You get three.

641
00:45:41,527 --> 00:45:43,392
Jump the one over the five...

642
00:45:43,862 --> 00:45:45,022
you get nine.

643
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,323
With four you get six.

644
00:45:48,033 --> 00:45:51,366
Three, that's seven, four is six...

645
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,960
a three again...

646
00:45:53,706 --> 00:45:56,266
and two is eight.

647
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:58,138
Zero switches with the five.

648
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,212
So 714-3432 is...

649
00:46:02,314 --> 00:46:06,683
396-7678.

650
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:08,784
Our number.

651
00:46:10,656 --> 00:46:12,123
And that's the code?

652
00:46:12,491 --> 00:46:16,222
And it works, because it's all about
where the buttons are on a phone.

653
00:46:17,129 --> 00:46:19,393
If it was a code that involved math...

654
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:21,192
or algebra or whatever...

655
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,861
these little yos in the projects
wouldn't be able to follow along.

656
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:28,603
But with this, all you gotta do
is jump the five button.

657
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:30,766
Ain't no math to it. It's just...

658
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,307
how a phone looks when you look at it.

659
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:35,903
Prez, you little genius!

660
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:40,282
-Jesus.
-I could kill you, that's so good.

661
00:46:44,356 --> 00:46:45,721
Your mother keep ragging at me...

662
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:49,157
to take him outta here and put him
in a private nursing home.

663
00:46:50,896 --> 00:46:52,796
You know, she ain't never
gonna let that go.

664
00:46:52,898 --> 00:46:56,356
I keep telling her, man, we can't show
this legit money yet, man...

665
00:46:56,468 --> 00:46:58,766
especially since he ain't got no insurance.

666
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:00,202
Soon, though.

667
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:04,573
So, you ain't big on coming here, right?

668
00:47:05,177 --> 00:47:06,201
No.

669
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,142
Tell you something, man...

670
00:47:09,248 --> 00:47:11,375
you about to see your uncle,
you understand me?

671
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:13,610
-This is family.
-I know.

672
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:16,483
Family is what counts,
family is what it's about.

673
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:19,283
Family gonna always be there
'cause it's blood.

674
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:34,661
Man.

675
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:46,343
You never figured on this, did you?

676
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:53,856
Live the life, lead the life.
Ain't no big thing.

677
00:47:54,226 --> 00:47:58,253
He used to talk that shit all the time and
he believed it, you know what I'm saying?

678
00:47:58,363 --> 00:48:00,524
What's up, baby, talk that shit now.

679
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:07,671
You know, you're right.
It's kind of hard to be in here right now.

680
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:11,036
He scare you, don't he?

681
00:48:12,177 --> 00:48:15,010
-You know, I'm just saying--
-He scares me.

682
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:25,383
See, if he dead, you know,
I could carry it better.

683
00:48:25,491 --> 00:48:28,289
Coming up the way we did,
you kind of expect that.

684
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:30,456
Waiting on it.

685
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:32,652
See...

686
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:36,566
the thing is, you only got to fuck up once.

687
00:48:38,237 --> 00:48:42,537
Be a little slow, be a little late.
Just once.

688
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:47,409
And how you ain't gonna never be slow...

689
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:49,675
never be late?

690
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,285
You can't plan for no shit like this, man.

691
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:56,011
It's life.

692
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:08,057
Scares me.

693
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,614
They're still using it.
I was by on Saturday night and it was gone.

694
00:49:26,151 --> 00:49:27,482
On your own time?

695
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:31,612
You still getting your boys?

696
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:34,191
Yeah, tonight for a sleep-over.

697
00:49:35,027 --> 00:49:36,289
Omar's rolling.

698
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:52,771
What the hell?

699
00:49:54,046 --> 00:49:55,343
Call for backup?

700
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:57,248
Not yet.

701
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,779
Let's see how it plays out.

702
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:19,297
An invitation.

703
00:50:20,138 --> 00:50:21,935
Feel a little lonesome for backup.

704
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,268
Yeah, me, too.

705
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:26,309
That's nice.

706
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:29,014
-I'll check the rear.
-I'll watch the boys.

707
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:42,326
Afternoon, gentlemen.

708
00:50:42,828 --> 00:50:46,764
Saying, if you were gonna use that
you would've been done using it by now.

709
00:50:50,502 --> 00:50:51,696
It's clean.

710
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:53,894
Got to keep it clean.

711
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:58,475
We having one of our little parlays
like this, got to keep it clean, right?

712
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:01,671
Omar with no gun on the street?
Must be a first.

713
00:51:02,547 --> 00:51:04,538
Yeah, sometimes
who you are is enough, dog.

714
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,518
But being as y'all sitting on my ride so
long, I thought I'd save y'all some time.

715
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,110
Come straight on out.

716
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:13,515
I ain't taking no charge.
You ain't putting me back in no cage.

717
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,559
We're not here to bury you, Omar.

718
00:51:15,661 --> 00:51:18,061
We're pulling you up 'cause
we got a problem in common.

719
00:51:18,163 --> 00:51:20,063
-Problem?
-Barksdale.

720
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:23,229
-No, he ain't no problem.
-I don't know.

721
00:51:23,502 --> 00:51:26,869
Avon's been chalking up a lot of bodies.
And you being you....

722
00:51:27,372 --> 00:51:30,398
Put it that way,
I guess he could be a little problem...

723
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:32,739
but I just can't really come out
and help you all.

724
00:51:32,844 --> 00:51:33,902
You know what I mean?

725
00:51:34,012 --> 00:51:36,640
Snitchin' just rubs me wrong.

726
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:39,974
Personally, I don't think
the game is played like that.

727
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:41,549
We respect that.

728
00:51:42,154 --> 00:51:44,645
If you do happen to take a charge though...

729
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,853
I'm McNulty, that's Greggs.

730
00:51:47,092 --> 00:51:49,788
You give us a call, we'll
sort something out.

731
00:51:49,895 --> 00:51:51,021
Fair enough.

732
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:56,299
You know, I used to work the homes,
back when your brother was up there.

733
00:51:57,602 --> 00:51:59,035
You get a chance...

734
00:51:59,137 --> 00:52:01,901
Iet him know they blew up
John Bailey last night.

735
00:52:03,675 --> 00:52:04,664
Good man.

736
00:52:05,177 --> 00:52:06,439
Lot of enemies.

737
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:11,672
Saying, you trying to catch up with Bird?

738
00:52:12,517 --> 00:52:14,576
Word is he dropped a workin' man.

739
00:52:15,353 --> 00:52:18,754
Wait, hold up. Come on, don't play me.

740
00:52:19,324 --> 00:52:20,791
What workin' man, what Bird?

741
00:52:20,892 --> 00:52:23,918
Come on, now,
ain't but one working man, now, is there?

742
00:52:24,463 --> 00:52:27,796
And Bird?
I think your snitch can handle that.

743
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:30,364
Shit, Bubbles know Bird.

744
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:15,977
You working late?

745
00:53:16,148 --> 00:53:17,115
A little.

746
00:53:17,215 --> 00:53:18,409
Got a minute?

747
00:53:19,317 --> 00:53:20,682
Sure, have a seat.

748
00:53:21,353 --> 00:53:23,514
No, this is better said standing up.

749
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:27,453
You know, I've been 13 years on the shelf.
I ain't bitched.

750
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:29,556
It was me that put me there.

751
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:32,594
But I'm here now, and I gotta say a piece.

752
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:37,694
We should've had a tap
on the project pay phones by now.

753
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:41,065
A wire there will get us the drugs.

754
00:53:41,473 --> 00:53:44,271
Keep pushing,
we'll get a whiff of the money, too.

755
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,643
I know you're serious
about climbing that career ladder...

756
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:50,613
and I know how slippery
it gets the higher you go...

757
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:52,176
but for me...

758
00:53:52,918 --> 00:53:56,285
I don't want to go to no dance
unless I can rub some tit.

759
00:53:57,222 --> 00:53:58,917
I appreciate your honesty.

760
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:02,851
Good night, Lieutenant.

761
00:54:27,385 --> 00:54:29,580
So, what you say to make Dee pay out?

762
00:54:29,688 --> 00:54:32,589
I told him to give it up
or I'm taking him out of the count.

763
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:34,022
-Shit.
-Look.

764
00:54:34,292 --> 00:54:36,260
I'll pump niggers when I got to.

765
00:54:47,572 --> 00:54:49,301
-That's him.
-That's who?

766
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:52,767
One of the ones that robbed us.
That light-skinned boy.

767
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,272
That's him?

768
00:54:57,082 --> 00:54:58,515
All right, come on.

769
00:55:04,623 --> 00:55:06,318
I'm the king of this shit.

770
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:03,514
-So, you want us to wait?
-Yeah.

771
00:56:04,115 --> 00:56:06,345
-All right, we on it, man.
-All right.

772
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:23,964
There goes Scar right there.

773
00:56:24,536 --> 00:56:25,730
Right there in the blue?

774
00:56:25,837 --> 00:56:28,135
-Number 80?
-Yeah, I'm on him.

775
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:46,017
All right, you got him?

776
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:49,257
-Find a phone real quick.
-What's wrong?

777
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:51,621
It looks like my man Dee
got himself an emergency.

778
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,254
What, he been stuck up again?

779
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,207
What's up, what do you need?

780
00:57:07,645 --> 00:57:10,546
My people are onto one of Omar's
boys down at Greek's.

781
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:13,708
Word? All right, sit tight.
I'm gonna take care of it.

782
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:14,876
All right.

783
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:25,896
Ain't nobody coming.

784
00:57:26,598 --> 00:57:28,065
Dee said wait.

785
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:30,023
Dee said wait.

786
00:57:42,781 --> 00:57:44,043
Told you.

787
00:57:52,023 --> 00:57:54,992
-He still in there?
-Yeah, he's playing the games.

788
00:57:55,427 --> 00:57:57,952
All right.
You are sharp, son. What's your name?

789
00:57:58,063 --> 00:58:00,623
-Wallace.
-Wallace, all right.

790
00:58:01,232 --> 00:58:03,996
This nigger's gonna
point him out to us, all right?

791
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:22,508
Yeah.

792
00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:25,450
It's done. Nice work, cuz.

793
00:58:25,957 --> 00:58:27,015
All right.
