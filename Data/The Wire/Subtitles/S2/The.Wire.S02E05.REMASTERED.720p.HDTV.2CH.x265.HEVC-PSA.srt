Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:13,837
My man.

3
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,046
Ain't but $290 here.

4
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,749
Goddamn it, Frog,
when you work a g-pack for a guy...

5
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:55,649
a kickback's supposed to be $500.

6
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:57,153
Stash got hit, yo.

7
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,089
I ain't hearing that shit!
I want my fucking money!

8
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,153
You'd best know
I ain't playing, motherfucker.

9
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:09,431
Okay, that's how you want it? Fine!

10
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:14,603
But when I roll back past here tomorrow,
money gonna be right, or you gonna see.

11
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,204
You gonna see who you're fucking with!

12
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,644
Do I look like a fucking punk?

13
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,539
Yo, shorty.

14
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:28,848
Get me a Snapple
and a bag of crab chips from the corner.

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,492
What the fuck is your problem, asshole?

16
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,592
Fuck, this is bad shit!

17
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,794
Fuck, this is really bad.

18
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:47,830
Shit.

19
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:50,269
Get your ass out that car.

20
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,370
All right!

21
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:54,579
Shut up.

22
00:01:56,882 --> 00:02:00,374
Where the money at? Check his socks.

23
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:03,180
You got something for me here, Zig?

24
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,587
You got some dough for me, man?

25
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,255
Jesus, jackpot.

26
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:11,622
Man, hold up, man.

27
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,790
Ain't enough here to really
call this shit money, man.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,461
Cheese, take it easy, I'm working on it.
But my people, you know...

29
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,800
What the fuck you think this is, man?

30
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,503
What, you think this supposed
to get played some other way?

31
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,874
Is that what you think, man?

32
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:34,515
Damn it, son of a bitch, that hurt.

33
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,884
Yeah, I know it did.

34
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,321
All right, look, how about the coat?

35
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,017
Take the coat, all right?

36
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,961
I paid two large for it...

37
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,000
so that, plus the cash I gave you...

38
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,468
and then I can get $700 more
by the end of the week.

39
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,231
You know I will!

40
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,706
You know right there, you can fix that.

41
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:00,108
$2,000?

42
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:01,880
For this?

43
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,207
Not even a black man could style that shit.

44
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:08,218
You know what I'm saying, man?

45
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,551
What you laughing at, man?

46
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,360
Chill, be cool about it.
I'll get your money by Friday.

47
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:20,228
Then you'll see there's no need
to get all fucking dramatic out here!

48
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:24,702
Look, man, if I ain't paid by Friday,
you dead by Saturday, man.

49
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,364
Yo, take my man's ride.

50
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,539
Fuck, I need that! I fucking need that!

51
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,491
Fuck you!

52
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,356
Why me?

53
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,432
You don't want the posting,
I'll take someone else.

54
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,542
Valchek gave me the pick of his district.

55
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,279
I'm not saying I don't want it.

56
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:53,214
I'm asking why you would choose me
after what happened last go around.

57
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,720
Yeah, I thought about that, too.

58
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:00,419
Looking at the list of names
on the southeastern roster...

59
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,118
I'm saying to myself:

60
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,091
"Why take a man
who already burned you once...

61
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:09,429
"who already proved himself disloyal?"

62
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,030
Now, why would I do that?

63
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,801
I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.

64
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:23,643
Because if I caught him once...

65
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,947
he might be the last
son of a bitch to try it twice.

66
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,583
I'm guessing you got enough
shame from the last time...

67
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,590
so that it won't happen again.

68
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,291
No, sir, it won't.

69
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,622
One other thing...

70
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:43,229
as far as I'm concerned,
those stripes on your sleeve aren't earned.

71
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:46,634
Your paycheck may say "sergeant,"
but on this detail...

72
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:48,706
Det. Greggs runs your team.

73
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,078
Same as it ever was.

74
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,998
Well?

75
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:28,179
I'm in.

76
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,671
Come here, you sweet bitch.

77
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:31,749
Motherfu...

78
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,052
Don't be grabbing my dick, faggot.

79
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:42,123
I raised him on the radio.
He's on his way in right now.

80
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,727
Appreciate that, Officer. Nice day.

81
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,327
Summit Silver 450.

82
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,065
Top of the line, right here.

83
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:56,766
Over there?

84
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,246
Yo, Bubs.

85
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:13,080
McNulty, the sailor man? Watch the front.

86
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:19,222
Here. Stick that on that thing there,
will you?

87
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:22,458
The cleat? Ain't you know nothing?

88
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:27,265
Look at you, I don't know,
maybe it's just me...

89
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:31,006
but something's way the fuck
wrong with this picture.

90
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,936
What the hell is that?

91
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:37,145
A Baltimore knot.

92
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,985
What the hell is a Baltimore knot?

93
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:43,884
I don't know, but it's never
the same thing twice.

94
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,085
What can I tell you?
My detecting days are over.

95
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,325
What the fuck you have me
hunt up Omar then for?

96
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,358
That's old business. You remember Bird?

97
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:56,696
His trial's up next week.
Omar's got some witnessing to do.

98
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,297
He said you can reach him
here at this number.

99
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:01,963
You can leave a message.

100
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,775
Good work, Bubs.

101
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,311
As always. Here.

102
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:13,808
Cab fare.

103
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:23,850
You say tit-for-tat,
and we let slide on a little county caper.

104
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:27,322
I got to think that, you know,
you need to think about...

105
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:29,866
what you had me
endeavoring to accomplish.

106
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,430
I mean, what the fuck, man?

107
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:35,267
I'm not out there asking about
no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.

108
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:39,166
No, sir. I'm making inquiries in your behalf...

109
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,509
in regards to that fucking unforgiving,
motherfucking Omar, man.

110
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,974
Why? He play you hard?

111
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:49,210
I go at him respectable...

112
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,812
he put that goddamn
shotgun in my face, man.

113
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:54,050
I'm looking at two tubes
of the harbor tunnel...

114
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,684
staring right at me, each one about yea-big.

115
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,154
I damn near pissed in my pants...

116
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,391
and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.

117
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,762
It ain't funny.

118
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,801
McNulty, I know I'm paying
taxes on some things...

119
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,666
I got to believe this
is more aggregation than:

120
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,265
"Good work, bubs," and a little bit of this.

121
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,441
For your pains.

122
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,081
Where are we at with the Jane Does?

123
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:21,914
Taking a hard look at the port,
we're gonna drop a grand jury summons...

124
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,955
on every stevedore who worked the ship,
keep rattling cages.

125
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,718
How's the port police broad
working out for us?

126
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,358
She knows the docks okay.

127
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,985
No detective, though.

128
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:35,132
In that case, you need someone fresh.
Cole, maybe, Massy or whoever's up.

129
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,762
You need to get over
to the southeastern today.

130
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:39,666
You're detailed temporarily.

131
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,140
Colonel, respectfully,
did you just fuck me over...

132
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,337
without giving me even half
a chance to clear this case?

133
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:53,606
Let's be clear, Det. Freamon.
When I fuck you over, you'll know it.

134
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:57,347
You'll be so goddamn certain,
you won't need to ask the question.

135
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:02,687
And you, Det. Moreland,
are now all alone with 14 red names.

136
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,558
How's it feel?

137
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:14,336
And the parking pad in the rear
is invaluable for Federal Hill.

138
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,032
The deck has a harbor view?

139
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,733
Yes, in two directions.

140
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,505
Go on up, take a look. I think you'll love it.

141
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:25,282
- This ain't Federal Hill.
- Excuse me?

142
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,180
This is the Point, Locust Point.

143
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:31,984
As far as real estate goes,
anything that is below Montgomery Street...

144
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,752
and above the water
is now called Federal Hill.

145
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,422
Are you two house hunting?

146
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:37,722
We just started.

147
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:41,424
If you're interested in this area,
I could run some listings for you.

148
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,093
- This particular house...
- Is my aunt Treesey's.

149
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:48,104
Really, your aunt?
Is she a relation to the McDonalds?

150
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,801
Nope. She's a relation to me.

151
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:56,043
She died, like, four years ago.
The family sold the house right after.

152
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,973
Is that the price?

153
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,018
That's the listing, yes.

154
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,989
They ain't gonna get that much, right?

155
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,962
I can't say for certain, but one just like it...

156
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,589
in the 1200 block
sold for $340,000 last week.

157
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:17,692
$340,000?

158
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,864
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

159
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:31,338
Maybe we should rent.

160
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,251
We're here because Valchek wants us here...

161
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:47,525
because he believes this man
and his down-at-the-heels union local...

162
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:48,860
has too much money.

163
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,697
To start with, you and Freamon
are gonna put some DNRs...

164
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,270
on the union hall phones.

165
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:56,670
Also, run what you can on the
union finances and on Sobotka personally.

166
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,938
We put that together, copy it to the major
to show him we're on it...

167
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,842
and buy ourselves a little time.

168
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,211
Meanwhile, you three, do what you do best.

169
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,944
Find out where port folks like to cop
on a Friday night...

170
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,247
set up some hand-to-hands,
maybe a reverse or two.

171
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:11,447
A lot of these port guys are white,
aren't they?

172
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,956
I mean, some of the southeast
street dealers, too.

173
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,027
So that means
you're gonna need a white boy...

174
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:19,028
to go down to some of these
southeastern corners, right?

175
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,089
So Kima, Carv on the rooftops.
It's my time to front.

176
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,695
I'll show you how it's done, homes.

177
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,768
Cool Lester smooth.

178
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,306
What's happening?

179
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,002
Same fuck-ups in the same shit detail...

180
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,980
working out of the same
shithouse kind of office.

181
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,551
You people lack for personal growth,
you know that?

182
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,883
It's a temporary posting.
Rawls gets you back at the end of the run.

183
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,753
If he wants me.
Last I looked, I was high on his shit list.

184
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,691
- Then we did you a favor.
- I wouldn't go that far.

185
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:51,691
But fuck it. Who we chasing?

186
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,464
Frank Sobotka?

187
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:59,600
- How fucking good is he?
- You know the man?

188
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:02,172
Me and Bunk Moreland
were fucking with this guy last week...

189
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,366
working that case about
dead girls in the container.

190
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,465
He a suspect?

191
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:08,671
No, just someone who know what's
getting done on the port terminals.

192
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,180
- Why are you on him?
- My father-in-law hates his guts.

193
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,580
Which, in the southeastern,
goes for probable cause.

194
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,846
Valchek thinks he has too much cash.

195
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,249
So you're thinking drugs?

196
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,686
In this fucking town,
what other crime is there?

197
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:26,388
You know I would've been
down here sooner, it's just...

198
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,625
with Terrell being sick and all...

199
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:33,365
But, Dee, I got everything we need paid for.

200
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:37,172
When you come home, Stringer's
saying they gonna hook you up...

201
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,175
with something out of the mix.

202
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,804
Like running a club,
or straight business, like.

203
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,175
String say they gonna
keep you apart from it...

204
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:48,411
and give back some time for family.

205
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,117
For you and me and Terrell.

206
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,048
Family?

207
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,116
They thinking about
how they can do for you.

208
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:58,558
They making all these plans...

209
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:01,461
even though you been
playing cold with your uncle.

210
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,037
Stringer says so, anyhow.

211
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:09,230
Why you be like that?

212
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,372
Throwing them off
when they looking to do for you?

213
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,804
They playing you with that
"We're family, and it's all about love."

214
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,074
That's how they do.

215
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,083
When they got no more use for you,
that family shit disappears.

216
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,278
It's just about business, Donette.

217
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:26,320
Dee, they gonna be there for us.

218
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,627
What's up, man? You got that Death Grip.

219
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:36,097
- You know Stony got that check.
- Slow down, fool.

220
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,135
I'm saying you need to spend that shit here.

221
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:41,205
- Death Grip be the fucking bomb, yo.
- I ain't got no ends.

222
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,671
Motherfucker said it ain't shit.

223
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,435
No, I ain't say that.

224
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,845
That's enough, yo, let that shit be.

225
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,543
- Fuck you all.
- Yeah, motherfucker?

226
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:09,356
Yo, B.

227
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,768
Shit jumping off in the Pit, yo.

228
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:19,632
Damn.

229
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,646
What the fuck was that?

230
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:34,623
Fiend badmouthing our shit,
saying Death Grip ain't all that.

231
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:36,956
Now we're beating niggers
over speaking the truth?

232
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:40,827
I ain't hit him, the young'uns, yo.
You can't tell these fools nothing.

233
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,600
We stomping niggers over bullshit, man.

234
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,807
Somebody got to pull Stringer up on this.

235
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,355
Zig, what's up?

236
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,558
Jesus, Zig, what the fuck happened?

237
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,432
Fucking niggers got me.

238
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,534
What?

239
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:20,103
Took my money, and they got Princess, too.

240
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,498
You hear me? They got my fucking car.

241
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,438
If I had a gun, I swear to God...

242
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,010
I would've capped every one
of those motherfuckers.

243
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,136
- You call the cops?
- Can't.

244
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,072
It was over some dope.

245
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,210
You bought a fucking package, didn't you?

246
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,180
Serves you right, you stupid fuck.

247
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,259
From who? White Mike?

248
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,994
This nigger Cheese,
up on Wolfe and Ashland.

249
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,796
- A few ounces, you know?
- Why not White Mike?

250
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,536
Fuck Mike, you know how he be.

251
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:58,398
Why the fuck would I know how he be?

252
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:04,274
Nicky, it ain't my fault, all right? It ain't.

253
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,950
Look, business has been slow,
package ain't turned around yet.

254
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:12,420
But the fucking hoodleheads ain't hearing it,
so I get jumped.

255
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,526
They got Princess, man.
They're holding her for fucking ransom.

256
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,061
And now they're telling me...

257
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:21,359
if I don't have the money by Friday,
they're going to kill me.

258
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,795
I need $2,700.

259
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:28,839
So?

260
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,271
You're a drug dealer,
go sell some fucking drugs.

261
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,006
You fucked up the package, didn't you, Zig?

262
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,789
I ain't giving you the money.

263
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,354
They're gonna kill me.

264
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,463
I gave my money to Aimee for an apartment.

265
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,463
Security deposit and some
furniture over at Littlepages.

266
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:04,904
I ain't got it for you, Zig.

267
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,080
You cocksuckers.

268
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:55,658
- Major in?
- Yeah, just knock.

269
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:57,852
Yeah?

270
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,656
We're about to make some
hand-to-hands around the port.

271
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,930
Lt. Daniels said I should see you about
a surveillance van.

272
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,004
The van?
The van's on loan to the southwest.

273
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:12,901
Okay.

274
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,014
Fuck with my ass, will you?

275
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:26,916
Bringing us back to our old friends,
supply and demand.

276
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,459
All right, your research papers are here.

277
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,694
Remember Friday, take-home test.

278
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,926
Well done, Mr. Bell.

279
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:44,964
- Mr. Lucas, you got five minutes?
- Absolutely.

280
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,601
There's something
maybe you can help me out with.

281
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:48,701
I'll try.

282
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:55,041
What are the options
when you got an inferior product...

283
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,144
in an aggressive marketplace?

284
00:20:57,655 --> 00:21:01,523
If you have a large share of the market,
you can buy up the competition.

285
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,957
And if you don't?

286
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,925
Reduce price to increase market share.

287
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,622
That assumes low overhead.

288
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:10,223
Of course, otherwise,
you operate at a loss...

289
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,098
and worse, as your prices drop...

290
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,564
your product eventually
loses consumer credibility.

291
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:21,444
You know, the new CEO of WorldCom
was faced with this very problem.

292
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,812
The company was linked
to one of the largest fraud cases in history.

293
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,608
- So he proposed...
- To change the name?

294
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,176
Exactly.

295
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:45,797
Which one?

296
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,728
He's got a weenie in his hand.

297
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,000
On this case, ain't that you?

298
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:58,445
Thomas Pakusa, come on down.

299
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,977
What the fuck is that?

300
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,518
Grand jury summons.

301
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,014
Grand jury?

302
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,850
You lie to us, you hurt our feelings.

303
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,152
You lie to them, it's perjury.

304
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:13,858
And one more I just dropped
on your barbecue chef outside.

305
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:19,997
You used to be a lot more fun,
you know that, Bea?

306
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:22,838
That's John Spamanato right there.

307
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,643
Johnny Fifty. How you doing, Officer?

308
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,539
Johnny Fifty?

309
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,039
What the fuck is that?

310
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:35,447
Son of a bitch drinks 53 beers
on his 25th birthday.

311
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:39,816
So as to be, what do you call it,
poetical, we rounded it off.

312
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:44,525
"Grand jury for the circuit
court of Baltimore City."

313
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:46,892
You worked the Atlantic Light, right?

314
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,061
Everybody on that ship testifies.

315
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,292
About what?

316
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:52,231
About them girls in the can.

317
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,365
The detective here thinks
we know something about that mess.

318
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,499
He thinks we'd leave them there
on the dock...

319
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:01,271
in a box, dying there in the dark because...

320
00:23:03,814 --> 00:23:06,009
Because why, Detective?

321
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:10,946
What reason would we have
to want girls to die like that?

322
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:15,121
Why would any of us leave them in there
if we knew anything about it?

323
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,420
I got a wife and three sisters.

324
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,422
And they got daughters.

325
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:25,130
And I got too much respect for women
not to be pissed off...

326
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,726
at what's in your heads right now.

327
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:30,136
Of all the cans on the terminal,
that's the one you lose in the stacks.

328
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,004
We didn't know shit, goddamn it!

329
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,805
You want us to dance
with a grand jury, we will!

330
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,846
What do you say, Johnny?
What do you say to any question?

331
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,246
I take the fifth commandment.

332
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,649
And if they offer you immunity
to testify against your union brothers?

333
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:44,687
- I don't remember.
- Don't remember what?

334
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:45,813
Nothing.

335
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:50,318
What you're forgetting
is that every I.B.S. local on the East Coast...

336
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,829
has had its ass in front of a federal
grand jury two or three times already.

337
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,126
You want to throw your summonses?
Throw them.

338
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:59,361
You want to subpoena our records?
You don't need a subpoena no more.

339
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,268
Our books were open
to the Justice Department for eight years.

340
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,807
We're here through
Bobby Kennedy, Tricky Dick Nixon...

341
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,640
Ronnie "The Union Buster" Reagan,
and half a dozen other sons of bitches.

342
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:11,681
We'll be here
through your weak bullshit, no problem!

343
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,826
These four ain't working today.

344
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:25,862
You wanna leave the papers here...

345
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:28,898
I'll make sure they get them
and go downtown on them.

346
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:32,463
Come on.

347
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,632
- Today?
- Now!

348
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:51,348
You described the weapon
used to kill Mr. Gant...

349
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:53,389
as a .380 semi-automatic.

350
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:57,058
You provided the size,
and even suggested the manufacturer:

351
00:24:57,361 --> 00:25:00,489
"Australian, or one of those 'A' countries."

352
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,326
Is that correct?

353
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:03,593
Indeed.

354
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:07,136
And you were approximately
50 feet from the shooter?

355
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:09,706
Yes, ma'am, you know, give or take.

356
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:13,574
Mr. Little, at that distance
how were you able to determine...

357
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,975
who manufactured the weapon?

358
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,507
I wasn't.

359
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,581
Then how were you able
to relate that information...

360
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,049
to the detectives?

361
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,709
Bird showed it to me.

362
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:26,312
He showed you the weapon
before the murder?

363
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,289
Which murder we talking?

364
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:35,361
Bird committed more than one murder?

365
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:39,102
Fish got to swim,
you know what I'm saying?

366
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:42,431
Like I said before, Bird was
showing that thing to everybody...

367
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,804
talking about this deed and the next.

368
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,668
I didn't pay him no mind until you all came
and showed him some interest.

369
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:53,408
Mr. Little,
if you wouldn't mind waiting outside...

370
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:56,077
I'd like a few words with Officer McNulty.

371
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:08,431
I thought he did good.

372
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:10,693
Imagine the mileage
Maury Levy gets out of me...

373
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,962
putting that sociopath on the stand.

374
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,231
You got to admit, it'll be different.

375
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:16,772
Dress him up at least.

376
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:19,570
I can't have him on the stand
looking like that.

377
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,603
Here's a voucher for court clothes.

378
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,745
Anything with a tie.

379
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:44,395
I'm saying, Dirt...

380
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,027
you wanna be my nigger,
you got to be with me for real.

381
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,072
You see what I'm saying, yo?

382
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:50,606
Well, I'll be.

383
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:53,505
All the time I be telling you, be on post.

384
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,910
But damn, homes,
you all the time up in some damn crib...

385
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:59,380
trying to play house with them bitches.

386
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,577
I'm saying, you all be seriously
fucked up because I'm out here...

387
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:05,052
getting done what needs done.
Feel me, nigga?

388
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:08,355
Thieving motherfuckers
take everything, don't they?

389
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,949
You know what I'm saying, Dirt.

390
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,392
You wanna be my nigger,
you gots to deliver for real.

391
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,338
How'd we do, Charlie?

392
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:25,499
I've almost got one of them ready to swear
that the docks are actually near the water.

393
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:28,608
They don't scare, them guys.

394
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,409
What now?

395
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:36,785
You telling me you never had
a CI down there, right?

396
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:38,481
A Cl?

397
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:41,386
An informant.

398
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:44,893
You ain't got no informants on the dock?

399
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:49,121
Someone you could go to on this?
Someone you got a history with?

400
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:56,802
They say a police is only
as good as his informants.

401
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,676
Meaning, we ain't about much.

402
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,182
The voucher says $150.

403
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,350
Look on the clearance rack.

404
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,485
- It's a look.
- No, it ain't.

405
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:24,893
You figure it out for yourself. I'm going
across the street to the federal building.

406
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,799
I'll see you in about a half-hour.

407
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:31,365
Look, man, if I ain't here, I'm round
the way on Howard Street, Liddell's.

408
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:38,742
Either that, or I'll be with Muffy at the club.

409
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,787
Where's he at?

410
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,816
Said he had to go get his props.

411
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,891
12-08.

412
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:00,325
12-08.

413
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:02,663
Request lateral with 12-10.

414
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,135
KGA, he can meet me on 6.

415
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:06,504
Do you copy, 12-08?

416
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,305
10-4, on 6.

417
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,805
Yo, dickhead, where you been at?

418
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,579
When you're working deep cover, Carv,
you got to get into the part.

419
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,458
What's up? You need a little help?

420
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,129
Maybe, bro. You got any raw up in here?

421
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,599
- You got it to spend?
- For sure.

422
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,909
All right, then we good.
Go and holler at my niggers round back.

423
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:47,412
Yo, Carv. You copy this?
It's all in the props, baby.

424
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,179
All in the props.

425
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,170
Feel any different? Me neither.

426
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,444
- Special Agent Cleary.
- Jim McNulty, from the city.

427
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,071
How can I help you?

428
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:20,047
Found floating off the Key Bridge.

429
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,745
We think she's linked to the dead girls
found in the container at Patapsco.

430
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:26,652
Your people were just here,
asking for a trace on the can.

431
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:30,215
- Homicide fellows.
- Black guys, Moreland, Freamon?

432
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:33,194
- Yeah, you working with them?
- Sort of, I fished her out.

433
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:35,993
I kind of feel like it's on me
to find her people.

434
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,997
You're kidding, right?

435
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,902
No, I thought maybe
if you guys have, you know...

436
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,906
been pulling in any women who've
been over here on the circuit.

437
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,169
Step into my world, Virginia.

438
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:52,981
A grand jury?

439
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,882
They snatched up some of our guys,
drove them downtown.

440
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:59,683
But you know nothing.

441
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,621
Yeah, no shit, we know nothing.

442
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:05,286
The only guy they got that even knows
you had a can that day was Horse...

443
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,796
and he ain't gonna say shit to nobody.

444
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,562
You sure?

445
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,434
Horse is a rock.

446
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:17,640
Don't ever worry about him.
My uncle neither.

447
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:23,312
But you say he wants to stop.

448
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,843
Yeah, for a little while.

449
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,483
He wants you to stop moving
cans through our docks...

450
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:30,576
at least until this shit chills.

451
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:32,922
These were local police, right?

452
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,057
Yeah.

453
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,015
Their interest is in the girls.

454
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,560
That happened on the ship,
the ship is gone.

455
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:39,856
A dead end.

456
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,190
The malaka they want,
we already got to in Philly.

457
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:44,960
Another dead end.

458
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,934
The police are going nowhere.

459
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:53,306
But, more important,
we address Frank's concerns.

460
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,204
You tell your uncle I will meet with him.

461
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:59,680
He says he wants to meet with the Greek.

462
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,049
Anything he can say to the Greek,
he can say to me.

463
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:07,223
Says he wants the Greek.

464
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:09,717
Says you tell him when and where.

465
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,218
Niko.

466
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,895
About that other business, the chemicals...

467
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,166
What do you need them for?

468
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:26,231
It's just business.
Everything is just business with us.

469
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,277
Buy for a nickel, you sell for a dime.

470
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,081
Yeah?

471
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:35,251
Who wants a dime's worth
of fucking chemicals?

472
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,184
So these are undocumenteds
from just this field office?

473
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,691
Maryland and Delaware only.

474
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:45,819
Any of them still in your custody?

475
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:48,489
I'd love the chance to show
some photos, maybe get lucky.

476
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,191
Everyone in that book was deported.

477
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,461
You can guess,
some of them are already back.

478
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:54,833
Any field office have anything active?

479
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:56,902
That's what I'm looking at right here.

480
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,443
You got some girls in custody
in San Diego, also Seattle.

481
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:01,943
Anything I can drive to?

482
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:04,775
Closest is a case up in Jersey,
Hudson County.

483
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,283
Raid on a couple clubs up there
put 12 in their bullpen four days ago.

484
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:09,545
That'll work.

485
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:14,522
So you really gonna go up there
on your own time?

486
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,092
I'll take a day, yeah.

487
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:18,252
What's between you and this girl?

488
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:22,962
You seen what happens down
at the morgue, when they can't ID a body?

489
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,190
I have.

490
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,206
Mau. How you been?

491
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,844
- Same old.
- Yeah?

492
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,314
You getting some days?

493
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:43,879
Pretty much.

494
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,917
I'm in the tower now, working the lanes.

495
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:51,591
You want to come in?

496
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:55,491
I got, I don't know, some beers,
maybe some Bacardi around.

497
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:59,233
Maybe we could just go
for a cup of coffee and talk, you know?

498
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,436
Let me get my jacket.

499
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,713
So I tell him,
"Dee, why you acting like that?"

500
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,188
He just sit there
like I didn't say a damn thing.

501
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,753
He off the damn hook.

502
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,791
You tell him about the plans, right?

503
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:30,965
I told him you all was gonna
set him up and everything.

504
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,060
And he know how you all been
doing for me while he away.

505
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,506
He knows some.

506
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:42,000
I mean, damn, he don't need
to know about it all, right?

507
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:50,580
Anyway, I'm saying I'll
get down there next weekend...

508
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:54,016
and he look at me like I ain't saying shit.

509
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:56,285
He say just leave him alone.

510
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:03,091
Got to turn that roast.
You gonna see, String, for real.

511
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,498
Little Donette know how to burn.

512
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,837
Your father bucking us, little man.

513
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,774
What you think about that?

514
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:22,808
Yeah. I think you're right.

515
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,091
What you looking at?

516
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,258
Fucking Ziggy, man.

517
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:36,764
I'm about to get my ass
shot behind his bullshit?

518
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,767
We're reasonable, they're reasonable.

519
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,133
Fuck that, maybe on your side of town.

520
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,136
What's up?

521
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,179
Came to see a man about a car.

522
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,051
Maybe tell Cheese we're here.

523
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,479
Yo, Cheese. White boy.

524
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:05,527
Yo, you got my money, man?

525
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,523
That's what we came to talk about.

526
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,660
Yo, you got to a lot of heart...

527
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:12,894
coming up in here
without my fucking money.

528
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,301
We thought maybe
we can work something out...

529
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:17,032
so you can get what's yours.

530
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,664
How you plan to do that?

531
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:21,437
You give the car back,
I'll get him to sell it off.

532
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:24,878
Camaro with a 350 in it,
it's got to be worth more than $3,000.

533
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:28,382
That's right clever. Right clever, I got to say.

534
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:32,547
And I appreciate you all
coming all this way so much...

535
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,920
I'll give the boy another week to pay.

536
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,890
Of course, that ride ain't
worth nothing near $3,000.

537
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,691
You don't believe me?

538
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:47,935
Have a look.

539
00:37:13,196 --> 00:37:16,688
You show up at my door,
I'm thinking better thoughts than this.

540
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,404
And you counted on that?

541
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,063
Who else am I gonna ask?

542
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:24,868
I ain't no snitch, Beadie.

543
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,310
Not even for you am I a snitch.

544
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,945
I'm not thinking about it like that.

545
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:35,042
I'm thinking, here's a guy,
and we had some times together...

546
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:38,713
and even though, you know, it didn't
get to where he might have wanted it...

547
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:40,119
he's still a good guy...

548
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:42,282
someone I can talk to about this.

549
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,557
How come it didn't go nowhere?

550
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:53,602
You did good. Who knows?

551
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:57,129
I don't know, you never know.

552
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:05,237
I could show you pictures of how they died.
Broken fingernails, blood on the walls.

553
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:07,248
All of a sudden, you're a cop.

554
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:10,717
Help me with this, Mau.

555
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,415
You didn't get shit from grabbing up
Horseface and them, did you?

556
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:21,595
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

557
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,758
I mean, you running around
like your head's all chopped off...

558
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,995
looking for someone to clue you in...

559
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,635
when a lot of what you're asking about...

560
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:33,206
is right there for the taking.

561
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,470
How so?

562
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:40,077
Used to be us checkers did
everything with paper and a pencil, right?

563
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:43,710
Every move on a ship, we wrote it down.

564
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:47,751
When that ship sails,
and there ain't no problems...

565
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,951
then that paper gets tossed.

566
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:54,059
That don't happen today, right?

567
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,432
Nothing gets tossed anymore.

568
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,103
The computer.

569
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:08,141
Thanks, Mau.

570
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:32,659
Well?

571
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,404
Good news and bad, Zig.

572
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,637
Those fucking niggers.

573
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,539
Give me the bad.

574
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,706
They're still gonna kill you.
They're gonna wait a week.

575
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:50,109
What the fuck can be good?

576
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:54,655
You can cancel your car insurance.

577
00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:08,864
Let me get two red tops.

578
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,733
There we go.

579
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:22,275
I hope you guys are taking notes.

580
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:50,905
Shit.

581
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:05,292
One-and-one.

582
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:18,571
One more time with that toothpick,
I'm going to stab his eye with it.

583
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:36,959
Ashamed he should be to be Greek
and call this a diner.

584
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:43,859
A talk would ease his mind.

585
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:46,031
Ease my mind first.

586
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:49,430
This business with the grand jury.

587
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:52,873
We checked the courthouse.
There is nothing special.

588
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:55,143
Just the regular panels.

589
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,804
They're trying to scare
the men on the docks.

590
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,207
- And?
- Nobody talks.

591
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:04,082
But Sobotka, as I said, he's upset.

592
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:07,719
It is more attention than he expected.

593
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:10,354
He will need money for his lawyers.

594
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:14,829
Double his fee.
But I don't need to meet with him.

595
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:17,299
Let the money talk.

596
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:23,005
Everything we get from
Atlanta been walked on.

597
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:24,664
Each one weaker than the other.

598
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:27,504
And this nigger Roberto
is on the shelf to us right now.

599
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,942
I mean, it's getting hard
to hold onto the Towers...

600
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:33,174
without our name all over
the product is what I'm saying.

601
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,308
Who got the good shit?

602
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:36,542
Eastside.

603
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:38,450
Eastside, who?

604
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:42,089
This nigger Milton got a small cut,
Prop Joe...

605
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,161
this Jamaican cat who got
the strip off Gay Street.

606
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,855
You talking about Petey, Petey Dixon.

607
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,864
You go over to the expressway
at lunchtime...

608
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,298
you can watch the fiends
traveling from west to east.

609
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:53,369
Damn!

610
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:57,970
I mean, I'm cutting shit with shit right now,
trying to cheat, but sooner or later.

611
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,073
I hear you, man, I'm on it.

612
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:06,878
You working it out with Dee?

613
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:11,182
Boy got to find his own way.

614
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,051
I'm saying, you know...

615
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:16,284
I think we should keep
reaching out to this kid.

616
00:43:16,392 --> 00:43:20,158
Give something to him and his girl.
I don't know, show them we got a plan.

617
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,754
Take some real estate, put it in Dee's name.

618
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,225
He has something to come home to.

619
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:26,634
Do it.

620
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:31,864
Thing is, String, what happened happened,
you know what I mean?

621
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:35,572
Push come to shove,
I've been fair to him, ain't I?

622
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:39,773
You've been fair.

623
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,978
Too fair.

624
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,028
- Where's the Greek?
- He sent me.

625
00:43:56,499 --> 00:43:57,989
Fuck you, and fuck him.

626
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:02,260
Frank, he sent me to tell you
that we're doubling your fee...

627
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:03,896
to help with any legal troubles.

628
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:05,872
He also told me to tell you he regrets...

629
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:09,035
that you're still having problems
on our behalf.

630
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,779
They're throwing my people
in back of police cars...

631
00:44:13,883 --> 00:44:16,909
and this asshole can't even talk
face to face?

632
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:19,549
I'm done. I'm out.

633
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,453
I need nothing more to do with you people.

634
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:25,255
I don't need the trouble or the money.
I got a union to run.

635
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,900
They used to make steel there, no?

636
00:44:38,374 --> 00:44:40,205
Smoke from the stacks.

637
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:42,511
But inside...

638
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:07,101
Potassium permanganate.

639
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:10,500
Spell "permanganate."

640
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,167
F-U-C-K.

641
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,647
You even know what the fuck
you're doing there, Zig?

642
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:24,151
I'm in the checker's local, right?

643
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:26,482
You know, while you Local 47 boys...

644
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:28,853
were having bulk cargo
dropped on your heads...

645
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:31,859
we was out grabbing the future by the balls.

646
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,066
So you just type that shit in there
and ask it for an answer?

647
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:44,829
Let me ask you:

648
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:47,342
Why do we give a fuck what the shit is for?

649
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:49,001
If they want it, they want it.

650
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,512
I mean, besides,
if I don't get some money soon...

651
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:53,343
I'm fucking toasted.

652
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:06,894
I don't know who you've been talking to...

653
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:10,159
but we don't have
that kind of stealing going on down here.

654
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:12,564
- It's not like the old days.
- No?

655
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:16,970
A little here and there,
but for the most part...

656
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:19,837
the new technology
has changed everything.

657
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,607
Look, see this little box right here?

658
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:26,773
You fucking mind?

659
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:28,851
Ring's a little stressed right now...

660
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,046
having misplaced a frozen can
full of Japanese tuna steaks...

661
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:35,283
supposed to be at the Jessup
wholesale market by yesterday.

662
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:36,415
Bite me.

663
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:39,324
- Frank, these officers are...
- I know who they are.

664
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,158
Frank here helped set this system up.

665
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:44,256
He probably can explain it better than I can,
if he doesn't mind.

666
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:45,994
No problem, chief.

667
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:51,162
In a nutshell, what this shows...

668
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:53,435
is the Aqua Verde at Berth 4.

669
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,678
The plan calls for 85 moves.

670
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:00,146
That's cans, containers, coming off the ship,
and others going back on.

671
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:01,375
Now, look at the screen.

672
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:04,681
Every time a can goes on or off,
the computer creates a record...

673
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:07,255
and puts it in the permanent database.

674
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,520
He was saying the computer makes it
hard to steal off the docks.

675
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:12,719
Did our port manager tell you
that right now...

676
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,356
we got 160 boxes missing
off the Patapsco terminal alone?

677
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,165
Or that last time
we inventoried the truck chassis...

678
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:21,031
we came up 300 light?

679
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:23,731
No, I suppose not.
That's management for you.

680
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,966
160?

681
00:47:25,074 --> 00:47:26,405
Not that all of them are stolen.

682
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:28,500
You can lose a can by accident, no problem.

683
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:33,344
For one thing,
these hand-helds use radio waves.

684
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:35,940
With all the equipment
and container stacks out there...

685
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:37,451
sometimes waves get knocked down.

686
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,248
That happens, a can don't get entered.

687
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:41,915
Or, just as easy,
a checker makes the wrong entry.

688
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:46,860
Either 'cause he's lazy, he's sloppy,
or he's still shitfaced from the night before.

689
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:51,089
Or, simpler than that, you got fat fingers.
No offense.

690
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,528
So imagine February on the docks.

691
00:47:53,636 --> 00:47:56,799
You're wearing Gortex gloves,
trying to punch numbers on that thing.

692
00:47:56,906 --> 00:47:58,965
You're saying
that's what happened to the can...

693
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:00,633
with the girls in it?

694
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:03,769
Beadie, darling,
I don't know what happened there.

695
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,814
I'm just saying, if you go by the computer...

696
00:48:05,915 --> 00:48:08,110
it might look like
there's some dirt going down...

697
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:10,310
when it's really just a glitch in the system.

698
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,516
The customs seal was broke on that box.
Shouldn't that get noticed?

699
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:18,188
You're offloading a ship
the size of a small town.

700
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:21,329
You might notice a broke seal,
you might not.

701
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,459
Look, you wanna keep
pulling our chain, you can.

702
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:28,696
But it ain't like it's just
that one box that went missing.

703
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,399
We lose them sons of bitches all the time.

704
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:39,145
- Frank give you everything you need?
- He did, thanks.

705
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,778
They're playing us.

706
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:51,054
You drove all the way from Baltimore
on a hope and a prayer?

707
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,889
Yeah, I'm dead-ended on this.

708
00:48:52,995 --> 00:48:55,657
Is there anything we can offer
any of them for cooperation?

709
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:58,563
You could marry one of them,
make her an American housewife.

710
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:01,330
Short of that, they're going back the fuck
where they came from.

711
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:03,337
- Where do you hold them?
- County detention.

712
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:06,135
We keep the undocumenteds
out of gen pop.

713
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,478
You all heard of WorldCom?

714
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,748
All right, let's try this.

715
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,349
You all get jacked by some knockos.

716
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:17,144
But you all clean.

717
00:49:17,253 --> 00:49:20,017
You all got an outstanding warrant,
like everybody in here.

718
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,613
What do you do?

719
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,119
Give another name.

720
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,254
Why?

721
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:32,291
Because your real name ain't no good.

722
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:35,268
All right, it ain't good and...
Follow through.

723
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:40,805
All right, Death Grip ain't shit?

724
00:49:42,578 --> 00:49:44,205
Then change up the name.

725
00:49:44,313 --> 00:49:45,575
What else?

726
00:49:45,681 --> 00:49:49,082
Yo, I got it, change the caps
from red to blue, right?

727
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:52,478
Make it look like we got
some fresh shit, boom.

728
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,853
You know what else we might could do?
Give each tower its own name, right?

729
00:49:56,959 --> 00:49:59,427
And then we do, like, some fake competing.

730
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:03,465
So, a fiend gets some bad shit from one,
he'd go back to the other.

731
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,431
There's a thinking man, right there.

732
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,698
See, nigger,
ain't that what the fuck I just said?

733
00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:12,537
You and my uncle talk?

734
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:15,108
How'd it go?

735
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:17,009
No problem.

736
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:24,617
Three boxes.

737
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:28,688
All of them on the Wilhelmina.
And you should tell your uncle...

738
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:32,420
that it's three times the usual fee for each.

739
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:40,165
We checked on those chemicals.

740
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:42,764
We looked into that.

741
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:44,806
I was worried, you know?

742
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,843
Before I deliver, I wanna know
what you need it for.

743
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:54,144
A bomb or some shit?

744
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:57,382
I ain't down for that.

745
00:50:58,988 --> 00:51:01,957
You use that shit
to process drugs, don't you?

746
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:04,119
Cocaine.

747
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:12,194
You still want it,
I got it on the Fairfield piers.

748
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:13,632
No problem.

749
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:14,794
When?

750
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,062
End of the week.

751
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:23,906
Maryska.

752
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:27,615
She's good with English.

753
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,113
They're dead.

754
00:51:34,223 --> 00:51:37,351
All I'm trying to do is
get word to the families.

755
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:07,480
What did she say?

756
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:11,853
She wants to know,
if she knows a girl, does she get to stay?

757
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:47,192
You want a good restaurant for dinner,
or are you headed right back?

758
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:55,028
A computer?

759
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:59,369
To run a trace on the missing containers
in the port administration's database.

760
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:00,533
You're looking for what?

761
00:53:00,643 --> 00:53:04,602
A pattern for our case. We need to know
who left those girls on the dock and why.

762
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:07,740
We're supposed to be on Sobotka
and the checkers union anyway...

763
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,478
so folding one investigation
into the other makes sense.

764
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:12,349
Not to me, it doesn't.

765
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:14,280
I'm not bringing your open murders...

766
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,824
anywhere near this detail,
that's a loser for us.

767
00:53:16,926 --> 00:53:17,984
Lieutenant!

768
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:21,757
We bring in a few drug rips,
and show that we gave Sobotka...

769
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:25,095
and his union a quick, fair look,
it's more than enough for Burrell.

770
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,431
He returns the favor,
and I'm out of the basement...

771
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:29,333
and running an investigative unit again.

772
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:32,566
You dirty me up with murders I can't solve.
It doesn't play like that.

773
00:53:32,675 --> 00:53:36,076
Homicide's not the place
to sprawl a case, Lieutenant.

774
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:38,179
Rawls, Landsman...

775
00:53:39,014 --> 00:53:42,313
they have no patience for anything
but a quick shake.

776
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:45,447
We got enough room for it here, anyway.

777
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:59,599
You can set up here at the off-site...

778
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:01,135
and we can share information.

779
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,705
But the murders stay with Homicide.

780
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:09,269
Unless, of course, you find a suspect.

781
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:42,236
Three ROIROs, four containers.

782
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:44,835
I got all my cards up,
including long numbers...

783
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:46,244
and we're still short.

784
00:54:46,348 --> 00:54:48,316
- A good day.
- That it is.

785
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:55,322
Everybody works today,
even you, my little j-series wonders.

786
00:54:55,424 --> 00:54:56,652
Even you.

787
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:04,658
Is Horse working the Wilhelmina today?

788
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:08,265
I told that motherfucker we were done.
I told him!

789
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:12,763
He said he talked to you.
He said it's triple-rate for every can.

790
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,469
Triple?

791
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:27,386
Call Horse in the tower.
Tell him he's working the Wilhelmina.

792
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:30,785
It's now or never for us, I got no choice.

793
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:33,760
Today we got ships, Uncle Frank. Today.

794
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:37,691
But the writing's on the fucking wall.

795
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,705
Fuck the wall.
