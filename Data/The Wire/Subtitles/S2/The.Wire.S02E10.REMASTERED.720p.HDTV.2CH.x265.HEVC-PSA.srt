00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,300
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,311
Fucking-A.

3
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,375
Yeah, shit is good.

4
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,643
Here. Next time we re-up, though...

5
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,118
tell Moe man we need about 700,
800 more of them dimes, all right?

6
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,418
I ain't even seen shit like this
since I don't know when.

7
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,221
- Same with the jumbos?
- Yeah, better get more of those, too.

8
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,269
What the fuck is up now?
String, what's up, man?

9
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,238
What up? Can't call it.

10
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,870
- How's our package?
- How's it look? Shit is good.

11
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,879
See these Eastside motherfuckers
over here?

12
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,080
I want you to extend
to these motherfuckers...

13
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,748
all the hospitality that
West Baltimore is famous for.

14
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,486
- You heard?
- You want us to fuck them up?

15
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:27,788
No, dawg.

16
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:32,097
We're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.

17
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,028
We keep the rest. If anybody start any shit...

18
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:39,899
they'll have to answer to me,
all right? Directly.

19
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,204
You heard me, right?

20
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,307
All right.

21
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,743
What are these off-brand niggers gonna do
with a project tower?

22
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,183
Fall back, young 'un.

23
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:57,018
We're gonna show y'all motherfuckers
how to grind out here, all right?

24
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,792
Hey, String.

25
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,889
I heard you, man, I did.

26
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,728
But this shit right here,
it don't make no sense.

27
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,371
You like the new product we selling?

28
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,967
It make sense now?

29
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,408
- Where are we at with our Boss Man?
- We should be up on his phone soon.

30
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,422
- The PC is there, no question.
- We get up on his cell phone, he's done.

31
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,889
We'll ID him, no problem.

32
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,428
I don't know. They came down on that
warehouse phone when we spooked them.

33
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,965
Sobotka's cell phone, too.
We might be going up on a dead line.

34
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,159
This is the other way to go.

35
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,393
Compared to the wiretap,
it's the longer way around.

36
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,531
But still, if he's changing up
on his cell phone...

37
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,099
Over the last week or so...

38
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,738
we've not only confirmed the identities
of some of the key players...

39
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:56,476
we've also got GPS trackers
on all their cars.

40
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,108
First of all...

41
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:03,581
Eton Ben-Eleazer.
He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.

42
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,682
- E-ton.
- Whatever.

43
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,657
Our madam, Miss llona Petrovna.

44
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,860
George Glekas, who runs
the appliance store over in Highlandtown...

45
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:16,926
and the probable fence for the organization.
We followed some of them in real time.

46
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:20,598
With this little toy here,
there's something else we can do.

47
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,972
That's seven days
of where our targets have been, sped up.

48
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,947
And lookit. Two locations only...

49
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,645
where three or four cars stopped
at the same time for more than five minutes.

50
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,188
One "X" is a dive of a diner
down on South Clinton.

51
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,657
The other is on the western shore
of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.

52
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,355
We get up on these locations,
maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man.

53
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,261
- Or a tag number.
- It's totally cool.

54
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:48,893
- Where did you even get this stuff?
- DEA for the trackers.

55
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,764
McNulty pulled the software
from his pals at the FBI field office.

56
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,434
We can pull Herc and Carver
off the warehouse and give them the diner.

57
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,479
McNulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.

58
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,546
What the fuck, Frank?

59
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,653
You might as well
start posting them things, right?

60
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:46,984
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run,
you might as well come out and say so.

61
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,764
It ain't personal, Ott.

62
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,735
I want to finish what I started
with the dredging issue.

63
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,705
And you don't think I'm good enough
to handle it.

64
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,069
It ain't about that, kiddo.

65
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,780
Ott, listen to me!

66
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:18,418
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Tell him where the money comes from?

67
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,653
I.B.S.?

68
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:26,259
Not to brag, but union racketeering
is one thing the Bureau does well.

69
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:31,134
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.
This case needs closure, boys.

70
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,500
And in my heart of hearts...

71
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:38,306
I know you're the kind of bastards
to put Sobotka where he needs to be.

72
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,849
One other thing
you Federals can help me with.

73
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,516
And if you don't mind,
a little discretion is called for.

74
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,656
That, right there,
is the district surveillance van...

75
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,630
which was fully equipped
when it disappeared.

76
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,892
A surveillance van?

77
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,026
Sobotka stole it.
Now it's I-don't-know-where.

78
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:05,571
The last picture was from Seattle...

79
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,141
but I got prints...

80
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,502
from two other places, see?

81
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,445
You reported the van stolen, right?

82
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:19,145
It was my feeling that the theft
of a vehicle from a departmental lot...

83
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,813
would reflect poorly on the department.

84
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,892
The thing is, I know you boys
have got enough reach...

85
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,690
to maybe get the van back
without no big dustup.

86
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:35,398
As a favor for me
having brought you the whole case.

87
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,100
Motherfucking Eastside
need to get their asses...

88
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,367
back across town where they belong.

89
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,142
Yo, man, we run them off,
we run off the good dope so...

90
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,271
I'm just saying
they all the time hustling around...

91
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:51,146
cutting prices and doing shit. It ain't right.

92
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,155
Walk, nigger.

93
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,694
Yo, what's up, soldier?

94
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:06,531
- Looking maybe to do something here.
- With him? This motherfucker?

95
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,363
I saw him over on Ashland last week
selling burns.

96
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,665
- Fuck y'all, nigger.
- Look, what did he say?

97
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,933
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.

98
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,408
I'll give you two dimes for $15,
plus the ice on top for free. What?

99
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,910
That'll work.

100
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,873
Take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.

101
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,416
That's what's up, see?

102
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,147
The game now is that we gotta sell
more of this good shit than they do.

103
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,552
What? Get the fuck out of here!

104
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,783
You mean to tell me
there's a Westside nigger...

105
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:35,293
who knows how to sell shit
without sticking a pistol in a fiend's face?

106
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,387
Yeah, dawg. And you better get used to it...

107
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:40,695
'cause y'all ain't selling shit
until we bone-ass dry.

108
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,827
- Believe that.
- All right, nigger. Whatever, man.

109
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:47,132
All right, cottage-cheese,
chest-ass motherfucker.

110
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:57,112
- Where do you want it?
- There's good.

111
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,649
Easy.

112
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:08,617
- We could help you set it up.
- You have a surveillance to cover?

113
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,136
- I got that feeling again.
- Like they don't think we're potty trained.

114
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,105
- Can I help you?
- FBI. Lt. Daniels?

115
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,176
He's in his office.

116
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,609
Without that billboard in my face,
I wouldn't have known.

117
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,415
How could you have known?

118
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,817
- There was the wingtips.
- And the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.

119
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,895
- Tight asses.
- Definitely.

120
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,634
Lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.

121
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,232
Maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.

122
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,003
You listening to this fool?

123
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,309
Saying that the Eastside
is wilder than Westside...

124
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,681
'cause of some shit
about Eastside folks drinking port wine...

125
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,879
while the Westside do sherry?

126
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:11,924
Port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.

127
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:16,291
- Butchie, talk to this fool.
- For me, leastways...

128
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,729
the difference between East and West
goes back to one man:

129
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,097
- Frank Matthews.
- Pee Wee Matthews?

130
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:26,195
Yeah, the brother went up New York
and got in bed with them ltalians.

131
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,537
The only one from this town
got a piece of that French Connection.

132
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,634
What the hell Pee Wee
got to do with anything?

133
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:35,943
'Cause Frank was Westside. How do you
like that? The dope flowed West.

134
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:40,110
When you got a steady supply,
you run shit like a business.

135
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,850
Somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
Not like this foolishness we got today.

136
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,259
Excuse me.

137
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,659
What say, Omar?

138
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,025
Ain't no thing.

139
00:13:55,636 --> 00:14:00,300
You know I got something for you, right?
Wouldn't come around unless I did.

140
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,837
What up, Butch?
How you holding up, baby?

141
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,540
Except for fretting on you, I'm good.

142
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,251
It's for my people.

143
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,021
A little something for a rainy day.

144
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,103
You built up a right nice-size nest
these past couple of years.

145
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,141
Might be time you maybe think
about backing off some?

146
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,772
Back off to what?

147
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,337
Later, Butch.

148
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:44,981
Stay, boy.

149
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,589
Damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.

150
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,092
And turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.

151
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,288
Nicely done.

152
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,416
Like I always say,
it pays to go with a union card every time.

153
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:03,394
- Turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
- Will you get in the goddamn car already?

154
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:06,557
For Christ's sake,
we ain't got all night. Jesus!

155
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,233
You could drive a tank through there,
it wouldn't take a scratch.

156
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,710
Where the fuck you going with this?

157
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,250
Greece. Athens, Greece.

158
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,721
The hole is so they don't think
it's an inside job.

159
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,383
So they don't look at the union.

160
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,255
Welcome aboard, chief.

161
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,312
Is that you?

162
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,155
I thought you were gonna go shopping.

163
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,990
- Me?
- Yeah.

164
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,764
We round-the-clock with surveillance.

165
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,069
When do we get to the part
where you do all kind of shit for me?

166
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,300
When do we get to that part?

167
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,303
So you past the point
of lifting a grocery bag or two?

168
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:03,281
You try being me like this.

169
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,659
Something wrong?

170
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,410
The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?

171
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,933
- Almost $4,000.
- I know it is.

172
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,076
The Greek guy, the one with the warehouse,
pays me in cash.

173
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,772
Keeps it off the books,
so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.

174
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,681
- And you saved all that?
- He gave me a bump, too.

175
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,145
I'm pulling down $700 a week.

176
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,585
You don't believe me?

177
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:22,021
Christ.

178
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:27,189
I was saving that up to give to you
for the new apartment.

179
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,960
You know what I'm saying, dawg?

180
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,436
But I don't understand how these hoes
be acting sometimes and shit.

181
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,373
If I tell a bitch, I'm like,
"Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."

182
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,810
- Gentlemen.
- What's up, my brother?

183
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,373
Are you slinging bean pies up in here?
You know what I mean?

184
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,054
You with the nation, homey?
'Cause either you're a Muslim...

185
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,989
or your momma need to stop
laying your clothes out in the morning.

186
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,188
I'm here to represent the interests
of a Mr. Barksdale.

187
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:34,734
- Are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
- That name ring out, but so do mine.

188
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,402
And you are?

189
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,528
Cheese, man.

190
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,573
Mr. Cheese. I see.

191
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,004
- And who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
- Who do I work for?

192
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:49,570
Am I correct in assuming that
you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?

193
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:50,741
Hell, yeah.

194
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,445
If that is the case,
then I have to insist that you leave.

195
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,985
- This nigger serious?
- Let me be emphatic.

196
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,492
You need to take your black ass
across Charles Street to where it belong.

197
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,357
- What?
- Hold on now.

198
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:08,429
He don't know what this is. It ain't
what he think, you know what I'm saying?

199
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:12,835
First of all, we got permission
to grind in these here towers.

200
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,503
Second of all, I don't give a fuck...

201
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:22,441
Get off me, get off!

202
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:26,885
Pellets in plastic. Rat shot.

203
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:32,190
What you need to be concerned about
is what's seated in the chamber now:

204
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,816
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...

205
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:37,226
120-grain hot street load
of my own creation.

206
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,494
So you need to think for just a moment
and ask yourself:

207
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:46,734
What do I have to do
before this man raise up his gun again?

208
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,406
Let's go.

209
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,813
Good day to you, sir.

210
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,348
I'm in agreement
with the agents' assessment.

211
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,790
As far as I can see...

212
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:10,522
this case is an ideal candidate
for RICO prosecution.

213
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,067
My agency agrees RICO is the way to go,
so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.

214
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,863
But I want one thing on record.

215
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,531
As of 9I11,
the Bureau has one priority in this case:

216
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,401
it's waterfront corruption.

217
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,171
It's a new world
and the ports are vulnerable.

218
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:26,768
This case is bigger than the union.

219
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,371
We're agreeing to take on
the whole case, Lieutenant.

220
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:32,474
But the union is why
we're in the room with you.

221
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:36,021
If you're okay with that,
we can work the case together.

222
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,923
We'll copy all the Bureau's 302s
to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.

223
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,001
Your paperwork should CC Squad 6
and my office, as well.

224
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,666
I'll start pumping your casework
into our system.

225
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,263
See what leads that might generate.

226
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:03,545
Oughtn't you be laid up resting?

227
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,477
A gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.

228
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,578
Shoulder do hurt.

229
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,689
But this here work just fine.

230
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,524
Tell Stack to polish it up good
and put $7.50 on it.

231
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:23,562
Shame to let a good toaster get away
over a frayed cord.

232
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,367
First off, ain't nobody running
up in them projects.

233
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:33,810
Them Westside boys are hurting over this
more than even you.

234
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,576
Trust me,
soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.

235
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:41,617
Second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters...

236
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:45,487
took a go at Brother Mouzone,
and ain't lived to say shit about it.

237
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,459
We go at the boy,
no telling what might get stirred up.

238
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:52,292
If Stringer takes a shot,
he crosses Avon on it.

239
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,797
Put a bounty on him.

240
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,425
Let some bushwacking fiend
back-shoot his ass.

241
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:59,471
I pin money on him,
and first thing he come at me?

242
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:03,665
Shit. Might as well just shoot myself now
and get it over.

243
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:11,840
There is one boy
who might could just pull this off.

244
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:14,452
Only, he won't take contract money.

245
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:47,945
Aim for center mass.
Make sure the man goes down.

246
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,454
No problem.

247
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,251
I got the three on the left.

248
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,258
Fuck you, assholes.

249
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:04,133
- How you doing?
- How you doing, buddy?

250
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:06,499
The Samsung S221 . You got that?

251
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,964
I don't see it.

252
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,042
Doing the old inventory, are we?

253
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,119
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.

254
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,046
Not like the problem we got
down at the docks.

255
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:27,024
- You get the cars off?
- Sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.

256
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,095
Listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here.

257
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,527
Not here.

258
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,364
In my office.

259
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,197
Forgive me, but how am I to know...

260
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,868
you did not ship them empty?

261
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:47,071
I just don't know. Let me see.

262
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,117
Maybe if I had a 4.0 Megapix,
three time optical, fully digitalized camera...

263
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:56,284
I could've taken some quality photos
of them Benzes in those cans.

264
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,954
But oops. I forgot my camera got busted.

265
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,993
Or you know what I could do?

266
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:04,893
I could get old Boris
to skulk around them docks...

267
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,228
keep the old commie red eye
on them containers.

268
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,563
Make sure the dock boys
are playing me straight.

269
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,261
- They are what I order?
- Yes.

270
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:14,272
I got you the S series
in the colors that you wanted.

271
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,467
I even got one parked outside.
You wanna see?

272
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,544
Outside? Now?

273
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:22,911
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.

274
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,296
Wait one.

275
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,703
Them cars list out
at better than $60,000 each.

276
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:50,469
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.

277
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:55,005
Still, it's good money for a few hours' work.

278
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,843
No!

279
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:01,784
No fucking way!
We had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.

280
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,120
You listen to me.

281
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,953
It was my fucking ass out there
on the line. Mine.

282
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,427
This piddling shit
is the best that you come up with?

283
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,030
You don't play me like that. You don't.

284
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,913
Fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.

285
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,209
Malaka!

286
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,920
You don't know that one, chief.
But you know "malaka, " yes?

287
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,325
Now you know malaka with dress.

288
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,499
Please.

289
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,770
Malaka.

290
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,380
Can you hear me?

291
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,021
If you can talk, please stay on the line.

292
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,356
Get in the boat first,
then put the preserver on.

293
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,618
- It's easier that way.
- Yeah?

294
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,989
Y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.

295
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,095
- Come on.
- Don't push me, man.

296
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,242
Rod.

297
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:23,771
Got it.

298
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,618
Here. Hold on to that.

299
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,453
I know this one.

300
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,732
Stringer Bell will come at me with this.

301
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:52,607
Says he's got something with Omar
he need to make straight.

302
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,707
Didn't say what that might be?

303
00:31:56,248 --> 00:32:00,344
Wouldn't tell me.
And to be truthful, I didn't want to know.

304
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,691
No. It don't feel right.

305
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,660
You know them Barksdale people
ain't to be trusted.

306
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:15,200
No denying all you say is true.
But Stringer talking parley.

307
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:18,668
So your boy needs to think
long and hard on this.

308
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:22,207
'Cause if Omar is living his day-to-day
in the street...

309
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:26,301
there ain't no telling what their next step
might be if there ain't no sit-down.

310
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,404
- "Parley"?
- That's all he says he's looking for.

311
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,211
I'll talk to him.

312
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,486
But if it feels funny to him
the way it does to me...

313
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:43,187
I got a better chance
of putting a leash to the wind, you know?

314
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:47,761
If you think it might help,
I can go protection.

315
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:52,327
- They're the one got hurt the last time.
- Then there was a reason to meet.

316
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:57,473
- This time feel different.
- I hear you.

317
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,336
Maybe Stringer's still trying
to settle that beef...

318
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,314
behind the fact
that he got to live in this city, too...

319
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:07,212
Omar being Omar.

320
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,712
If it ain't putting you out none...

321
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,726
I'd feel a powerful lot better
if my nephew took over protection.

322
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:20,026
Hayward.

323
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:34,106
Typed and ready for your John Hancock.

324
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,446
- Thanks.
- Sure.

325
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:07,473
You just have to initial each page
and then sign at the end.

326
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:13,551
I'm just checking.
This is the official record, right, chief?

327
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,653
It's what's gonna play in court.

328
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,118
Can I change something?

329
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,489
Yeah.

330
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:35,370
Just put your initials next to your changes.
It's no problem.

331
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:37,909
Yeah, it's only one.

332
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,470
- You know, you typed "said" here, see?
- "Said"?

333
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:53,356
He wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."

334
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,992
It was more begging.

335
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:04,032
You know? Double G, he's begging me.

336
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:08,768
But that's not gonna mess you up,
though, right?

337
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:15,213
No, it's more descriptive like that.
It's good. Thanks.

338
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,538
Quiet. No one in or out of there.

339
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:02,390
It's kind of nice out here.
Moonlight on the water.

340
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,027
Waves lapping gently against the boat.

341
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:13,797
I'm working my regular eight.
I can handle it, you know?

342
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,332
But a detail like this...

343
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,375
That's what I'm asking.

344
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:24,074
If something comes up on the job,
how would you handle it?

345
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:27,179
I mean, at home with the kids.

346
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,381
Until now, not much came up.

347
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,858
But now, say something comes up.

348
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:38,688
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
What would you do?

349
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,063
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.

350
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,762
Maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.

351
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,532
You know how it is with kids.
You gotta be there.

352
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,834
But you wouldn't miss it?

353
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:56,574
I mean, with everybody rolling out
and you having to head home?

354
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:02,881
If it keeps going like this,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

355
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,218
- Thanks.
- It's no problem.

356
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:13,329
You wanna make a phone call to someone?

357
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:17,701
If you get over to Madison,
it might be some time before you can.

358
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,327
Ain't a chance I get a bail, right?

359
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,007
How about family?

360
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:43,760
All right, to bring you up to speed,
we've got agents in Le Havre...

361
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:47,798
shagging leads from the manifest
of the Talco ship due here in a few days.

362
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,960
To see if we can't pinpoint the origin
for the illegal containers.

363
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,799
That's a lot of cans.

364
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:55,339
A hundred and ten, actually.

365
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:59,602
How many agents you need to track back
to where all those cans came from?

366
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:01,407
As many as it takes.

367
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:07,578
We may be assholes, but on the upside,
there's an awful lot of us.

368
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:12,546
Let me get this into the computer
for the boys overseas.

369
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,722
Anything from that shithole of a diner?

370
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:22,495
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.

371
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,764
The feds took over this morning
and it's still quiet.

372
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,964
I'm going back on the water.

373
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,768
One meet and we're on this guy.

374
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:13,816
The Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.

375
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,085
- The Greeks again?
- Who else?

376
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:20,520
They sure do stir up the shit,
them Greeks do.

377
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:26,993
- Uncle Frank.
- Nicky boy, just in time.

378
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,932
- Uncle Frank.
- What? What happened?

379
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:34,602
- What the fuck is it this time?
- He shot...

380
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,670
They're saying he shot two of the Greeks.

381
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:41,379
- Last night, they're saying.
- Shot?

382
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:44,472
- He shot?
- Fucking Christ!

383
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:48,519
He's locked up.
He's fucking charged with murder.

384
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,850
- The Greeks?
- Double G.

385
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,691
And one of the kids that works
down the store on the avenue with him.

386
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,920
They're saying he walked in there.

387
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:59,395
- He went in.
- Why was he there?

388
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:02,463
- Where the fuck were you?
- Uncle Frank, I didn't know.

389
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,058
What didn't you know?

390
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:07,400
- What is Ziggy doing near the Greeks?
- I don't know.

391
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:11,201
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

392
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,502
You're his father.

393
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,349
1,125 kilograms.

394
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,191
Not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...

395
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,752
but I'm told
it was the largest crack seizure on record.

396
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,965
I just wish I had good news for you.

397
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,362
You told me this was a local effort.

398
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:45,910
It's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
We're looking hard at the port unions.

399
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,672
My hands are tied.

400
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,311
They're on you with wiretaps.

401
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,153
Several phones, several addresses.

402
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:15,337
Stefanos.

403
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,049
Have the boy go to Eton.

404
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,414
Tell him to come right away
to the other place.

405
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,784
- You're not calling?
- No phones. No more phones.

406
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:34,857
Adieu, my friend.

407
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,935
They forgot your fries.

408
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:50,468
No, they forgot your fries.

409
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,807
- My fries are right in here.
- Those are my fries.

410
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:58,439
Bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
The fries are mine, boy.

411
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,348
Go ahead.

412
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:05,480
Eat the fries, you fat fuck.
See if I fucking care.

413
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:08,355
What? You think I'm fat?

414
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,162
There's our boy.

415
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,531
- Lester, Eton's on the move.
- We got it.

416
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:27,835
- No need for an eyeball follow, right?
- No need.

417
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,575
A fine fucking kettle of fish.

418
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:34,311
I heard it,
but I had to come see it for myself.

419
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:37,211
- And sure enough...
- Major?

420
00:42:38,257 --> 00:42:41,317
You know,
I put my faith in you fucking feds.

421
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:43,988
You let me down.

422
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:47,594
- Major, we can talk in my office.
- Lieutenant.

423
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,631
It's Lieutenant, right?

424
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,433
I gave you a simple assignment:

425
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,665
that fellow, the one in the corner.

426
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:00,544
And to make it happen, I gave you all this.

427
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:04,247
Good digs, people...

428
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,850
everything you needed.

429
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,219
And what did you give me?

430
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:12,946
Right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.

431
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,555
- Major, you're going to get...
- Roland, get your shit.

432
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:18,988
You want to do it your way, fine.

433
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:22,099
But you ain't gonna use my people
to fuck me.

434
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:29,096
- Get your gear. I'm pulling you.
- I got... There's work...

435
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:32,974
- You said...
- Get your narrow ass back to the district...

436
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,808
before I slap you with insubordination.

437
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,144
Move, shitbird!

438
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:44,050
Jesus!

439
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:07,672
Detective, my office.

440
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:53,691
Base to 11-34.
Target number two is coming at your 20.

441
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:56,086
Copy that. We're on it good.

442
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,032
We're on the Boss.

443
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,269
My God.

444
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:15,111
- He shoots both?
- He kills George, right there in the store.

445
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:18,750
- Leaves the boy to bleed.
- For what?

446
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:22,913
An argument over a few cars?

447
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:26,418
- That little Polack?
- He's crazy, that one.

448
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,393
The police have him now.

449
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:35,697
The police still there?

450
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,094
Go to the store.

451
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,365
Whatever the police did not take,
papers, pictures, everything...

452
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:45,102
you clean it up.

453
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:49,737
The warehouse, too.
Everything gets clean now.

454
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:53,916
Everything.

455
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:57,422
And the phones are dead.

456
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:06,129
Did you see that?
They just threw the phones.

457
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,791
11-34 to Surveillance.

458
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,667
- Standing by.
- We got our man.

459
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:16,400
Target number one
is a white male, 40s, short...

460
00:46:16,508 --> 00:46:19,375
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.

461
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,010
Copy your description.

462
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:26,043
11-34 to Surveillance,
both targets are on the move.

463
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:28,779
We can't make the vehicle from here,
but you sure can.

464
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:29,876
Copy.

465
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,582
What was he doing
with that thing in his hand?

466
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,392
Same thing you always do.

467
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:39,593
Probably sending a text message.
My kids are crazy over that.

468
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:57,879
That's our guy, right?

469
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,542
What's his face Sobotka
from the drug corner?

470
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:12,287
I need to get with Vondas.

471
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:14,229
Who's that?

472
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:22,707
Spiros. Where is he?

473
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:25,776
I don't know no Spiros.

474
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,827
- No shit.
- He just up and clocked him?

475
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:49,264
- Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
- Even us suits.

476
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,494
That was smart. Daniels is sharp.

477
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:54,230
- Where's Prez now?
- Daniels took him home.

478
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:57,467
- I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
- You never know.

479
00:47:57,576 --> 00:48:01,034
He might have one of those psychological
bullshit things in his jacket...

480
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:03,410
gives him immunity or something.

481
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:07,315
Valchek gave him immunity,
and he just put Valchek on his ass.

482
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:15,090
- Nothing since the Fort Howard meet.
- They're definitely dumping phones.

483
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:24,361
When you use a cell phone and
press "send," where does the call go to?

484
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:27,131
- Why are you asking?
- The Boss Man at Fort Howard.

485
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,570
He tosses the cell phone we're up on, right?

486
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:33,405
Then he pulls out another thingamajig,
and he types a message.

487
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,035
Text messaging.

488
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:40,314
It starts at one of those towers
they got up all over the place, right?

489
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,182
And ends up in a computer
at a wireless provider.

490
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:47,588
If you knew when the call was made,
could you trace the call back to that tower?

491
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:50,293
'Cause if you could,
mightn't you get a phone number?

492
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,886
You get that,
then you got the billing details, right?

493
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:56,024
Fool, do you have any idea
how many people use cell phones?

494
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:59,626
There must be thousands,
hundreds of thousands at any time.

495
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:02,036
What you need is another variable.

496
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,304
Another bit of data that's gonna help you
isolate your call from all the others.

497
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:10,643
What if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.

498
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:15,249
We were out in the middle of nowhere.
Does that help narrow it down?

499
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:19,653
The Fort Howard sea wall. It ain't exactly
Charles and Baltimore Streets.

500
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:22,989
You've got another problem.
Which wireless company?

501
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:27,121
There must be Verizon, MCl, AT&T, Sprint...

502
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,466
Shit, tin cans and a string.
You got dozens of them.

503
00:49:38,877 --> 00:49:40,242
Lamar?

504
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:43,578
- Where's my Harper's?
- Say what?

505
00:49:43,682 --> 00:49:45,240
Harper's. The new issue.

506
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,444
You didn't say that one.
You said The New Republic and Atlantic...

507
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:51,613
- and a new something else.
- I did not forget to tell you Harper's.

508
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:56,217
Every week I tell you the same shit,
and every week you forget half of what I say.

509
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,956
Tomorrow, first thing, you go
to the newsstand and you get Harper's.

510
00:50:00,065 --> 00:50:03,523
And The Nation, too,
which you also managed to forget.

511
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,794
You know what the most dangerous thing
in America is, right?

512
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,935
A nigger with a library card.

513
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,972
All damn day, he just sit there reading.

514
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:23,049
And damned if them Eastside bitches
don't stay away.

515
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:25,987
- That's real muscle, right there.
- True that.

516
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:30,617
What are we gonna do
when we start running out of good product?

517
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:33,054
That's what we need to ask ourselves.

518
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:36,622
Yo, Bodie,
if Stringer want the Eastside up in here...

519
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,970
then why Barksdale got a man
running them off?

520
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:54,147
This is getting us nowhere.
We got nothing under Pyramid lnc...

521
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,880
or any of the targets
at any other cellular company.

522
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:58,478
It's on McNulty then.

523
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:01,384
11-35, you got the 20?

524
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:04,360
- I'm on the spot right now.
- Go.

525
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:09,432
10-4. Latitude first:
North, 39 degrees. 11 .727.

526
00:51:09,868 --> 00:51:14,066
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26.628.

527
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:20,470
Now, this was a neat trick.
No one ever did it before.

528
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:23,642
Identified a cell phone using time and GPS.

529
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,512
We got everything on the phone
that was text messaging...

530
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:29,553
from those coordinates at 04:45 p.m. today.

531
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:36,524
Just a subpoena?

532
00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:40,394
With this, you can get account information
and a phone number.

533
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:42,022
With a search warrant...

534
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:45,762
you can get two months of text messages.

535
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:49,401
You got two months of text messages
in this file?

536
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:51,634
I do, if you've got a warrant.

537
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,968
Tell you what, friend.

538
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,276
We're gonna go back and
start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.

539
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:00,783
But right now,
we wouldn't mind taking a peek...

540
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:03,217
at what my man's been up to
in the last 24 hours.

541
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,118
Exigent circumstances.

542
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,018
Thanks, brother.

543
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,397
Fuck me.

544
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,529
Nothing's easy.

545
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:27,937
- What's up?
- They've dumped their phones.

546
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:31,841
We're trying to get onto
the Boss Man's text messaging.

547
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,748
They sent that Greek mess over as email.

548
00:52:35,854 --> 00:52:38,448
After he inputs,
the computer will translate it.

549
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:39,580
Got it.

550
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:44,056
Shit.

551
00:52:58,343 --> 00:52:59,810
Hey, Prissy.

552
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,411
Thought you'd be here.

553
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,362
Fucking Ziggy.

554
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,368
When didn't he do dumb shit?

555
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:36,674
Remember when he forged
that Age of Majority card?

556
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,083
We all pooled our money.

557
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:43,946
You drove us over Brooklyn Park
to the cut-rate.

558
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,148
My mom's puke-yellow Chevy.

559
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,226
We told him specifically:

560
00:53:49,494 --> 00:53:51,826
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and...

561
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,533
Southern Comfort for me.

562
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:03,437
What did fucknuts get?

563
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,310
Fucking Boone's Farm.

564
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:14,814
He said that's what the college kids drank.

565
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,350
But we did it up. Right here.

566
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:28,387
He stood up there, a bottle in each hand...

567
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,563
screaming loud enough to wake the nuns.

568
00:54:34,806 --> 00:54:36,774
What the fuck did he say?

569
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:51,315
"College kids ain't shit!"

570
00:55:18,216 --> 00:55:19,706
Goddamn, Zig.

571
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,530
- Yeah?
- Beadie, it's Kima.

572
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,965
We're gonna take the Boss out.

573
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:49,069
- Raids? Tonight?
- You got somewhere to drop the kids off?

574
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,672
No, no problem.
I can take them over to my parents'.

575
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:56,043
All right, we'll see you soon.

576
00:55:56,154 --> 00:55:59,317
Kima, thanks for the call. Bye.

577
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,963
The judge wants to know how much longer.

578
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:15,266
We're close.

579
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:26,181
Dump this row. Dump the computer.
Dump this.
