00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,300
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,500
WAYE news time, 8:05.

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:14,274
It's gonna be partly cloudy, breezy
and warm today with highs around 80.

4
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,475
Right now in Baltimore, sunny skies.

5
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:19,246
And here's one of my morning favorites.

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,860
Yo, Ott. Santo Rey's late?

7
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:36,797
Squall last night off of Hampton Roads.

8
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,860
76-72 KGA.

9
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,635
KGA, go ahead, 76-72.

10
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,074
Notify Homicide and the OCME.
We got a floater at Patapsco Terminal.

11
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,668
Copy that.

12
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,355
Nothing at Vondopoulos's house?

13
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,120
He's not going back.

14
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,890
He's dumped his Benz and our GPS device
in the downtown garage.

15
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,625
He's off the cell phones.

16
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,894
And there's no text messaging
in Greek either.

17
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:10,800
The raids, the follow,
one or both sent him underground.

18
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:15,365
This guy, Stephen Rados? What's he?

19
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,101
He rented the hotel room
for the meet with Vondopoulos.

20
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,770
But checked out right after.

21
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,939
Fitzhugh's running him
through every database.

22
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,517
So far, nothing but a driver's license in D.C.

23
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,086
Lester. Homicide for you, line 2.

24
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,056
Maybe Sobotka knows him.

25
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:34,253
When Sobotka comes in today, maybe
he gives us a line on every last Greek.

26
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,787
Freamon here.

27
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,964
Thirteen or so coming across the fax
from VICAP.

28
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,360
All of them John Does.

29
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,532
And that's just headless and handless
in the mid-Atlantic region.

30
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,201
If you wanna go nationwide,
you'll be up over four dozen.

31
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,711
- Fuck me.
- What can I tell you, kiddo?

32
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,782
We are policing a culture in moral decline.
So, you want to come get these?

33
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,284
Or should I have a uniform
run them over to Southeast?

34
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,752
- Run them over to Southeast.
- Okay.

35
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,604
- Have a seat.
- I can't.

36
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,810
Gotta get back out there,
take care of business.

37
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,350
Just wanted to make sure
they were treating you right.

38
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,286
Making the most of it.
I'm catching up on my reading at least.

39
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,953
I just want to let you know
that we got your back.

40
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,596
You know, whoever did this, we'll find them.

41
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,629
We got you, you understand?

42
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,667
I appreciate the offer,
but that won't be necessary.

43
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,269
Inform Mr. Barksdale that any obligation...

44
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,931
he feels he might have
with regards to this incident...

45
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,271
it's absolved, along with our agreement.

46
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,309
All I'm saying is...

47
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,472
I understand perfectly well
what you're saying.

48
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:06,212
What I am saying to you is:
I will take care of them myself.

49
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,317
Them?

50
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,950
Who came at you?

51
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,126
Thank you for your concern.

52
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,913
Easy, Nick. Easy.

53
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:44,118
I'm gonna kill them.
Fucking Greek bastards.

54
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,356
Get out of my fucking way!

55
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,519
Get off of me! Fuck all of you!

56
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:52,194
He was there for all of you,
and now you're nowhere for him.

57
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,392
What the fuck you gonna do?

58
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,469
Get a gun? Go play gangster?

59
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,334
Like your fucking cousin?

60
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,966
Let's go.

61
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,269
What was she firing, yo?

62
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,138
Dirty Bomb, with a red-top chaser.

63
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,604
Damn, yo. The bomb is the bomb.

64
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,589
Opportunity knocking. Keep a lookout.

65
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,813
He just boosted the whole fucking truck.

66
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,723
Good looking out, Johnny.

67
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,640
At least I remembered to call.

68
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,747
Stabbed repeatedly.

69
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:24,818
Torso, abdomen,
and they cut his throat to be sure.

70
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,753
Single-edge blade. He fought, too.

71
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,154
Defense wounds on both hands.

72
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,089
Ligature on both legs.

73
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:36,852
Weighed him down with something,
but it slipped off in the drink.

74
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,955
One, two, three.

75
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,417
Fuck it.
This Sobotka kid knows there's a warrant.

76
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,423
He either turns himself in or not.
Who gives a fuck?

77
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:08,484
Either we get to him now and roll him,
or he comes into the district with a lawyer.

78
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,190
He comes in with a lawyer, he's less likely
to go for something in the box.

79
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,392
You sound like McNulty now.

80
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:19,936
We stay with these guys on their cases,
we ain't never gonna get no respect.

81
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,530
You know this.

82
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,607
I figure when the detail's over,
I go back to straight narcotics.

83
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,943
Try to get over to Dawson's shift,
find a new rabbi.

84
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,107
What about you?

85
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,784
Don't know.

86
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,419
I mean, you gotta admit,
Daniels has been okay for us.

87
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,995
I mean, he's there for his troops.

88
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,662
- You gotta be shitting me.
- I just came from the crime scene.

89
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,296
He was coming in as a cooperator.

90
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:56,535
Offering up the drug-and-prostitution ring
he'd been smuggling for.

91
00:12:56,643 --> 00:13:00,170
The guy lays down with gangsters,
gets up with his throat cut.

92
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,645
Almost feel sorry for the son of a bitch.

93
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,111
You were right about Sobotka.

94
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,589
Case had enough legs on it
that I've got Burrell committed...

95
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:15,890
to keeping my crew together
as a major case squad working out of CID.

96
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,164
If you are gonna charge him...

97
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,394
I'm gonna charge his narrow ass.

98
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,165
You're gonna do your son-in-law?

99
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:29,641
You don't think I didn't tell her
not to marry that brain-dead son of a bitch?

100
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:35,747
I'll tell you the truth, Major.
Everyone who saw the punch wrote on it.

101
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,583
And they've all got Prez
throwing the punch, no question.

102
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,952
But they've also got you addressing
a subordinate officer as a...

103
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,287
What was it? A shitbird?

104
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,321
Fuck you.

105
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,657
This is the Baltimore Police Department,
not the Roland Park Ladies' Tea.

106
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,426
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

107
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,265
the FBI agents,
they gotta write it the way it happened.

108
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:05,471
I mean, I could probably get my own people
to cheat it for you, but the FBI...

109
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,911
You know how tight-assed they are.

110
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:15,184
Roland Pryzbylewski rides
the Southeastern desk...

111
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,484
on midnight shift for two months.

112
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:21,524
During which time he writes
a personal letter of apology...

113
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,028
to everyone seen that punch throwed.

114
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:29,066
In which he makes it absolutely clear
that it was a penny-cheap sucker punch...

115
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,067
that would've got his ass kicked in
by a real police...

116
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,938
except for the fact that I have
my daughter's feelings to consider.

117
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,206
And then he can come up here
and say the same to my face...

118
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:43,340
and after that, if he wants
to piss his career away in your unit...

119
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,680
I could give a hairy-ass fuck.

120
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,645
Lieutenant.

121
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,088
Rod, that shit goes into a supplemental.

122
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:59,029
- You don't put witnesses on a face sheet.
- Officer.

123
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,764
You got something for Freamon?
Homicide sent it over.

124
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:09,333
Officer, my son wants
to turn himself in on a warrant.

125
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,375
Everybody talks, nobody listens.

126
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:16,078
Mike, that asshole calls back,
I'm in the shitter.

127
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:21,684
- Now what can I do for you, gents?
- You got a warrant on me for drugs.

128
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,020
- I'm turning myself in.
- A Southeastern warrant?

129
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:29,322
He's surrendering.
He's gonna cooperate in any way he can.

130
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,999
- What name am I looking for?
- Sobotka. Nicholas Sobotka.

131
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,868
Morphine? From a city ambo?

132
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,505
You should be ashamed
to be calling me on this one.

133
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,991
- The body came up.
- I saw, on the television.

134
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,258
We weighted him down
pretty goddamn good...

135
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,834
but the water just coughed him back up.

136
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,732
Bad luck, that's all.

137
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,099
Sergei would've done better, I admit.

138
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,142
Niko, the nephew. By now he knows.

139
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,771
Our people wait for him,
but so do the police.

140
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,909
I am thinking...

141
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,850
there's nothing to be done at this point.

142
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,352
What he says, he says.

143
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:34,653
He knows my name.
But my name is not my name.

144
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,890
And you?

145
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,056
To them, you're only "The Greek."

146
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,568
And, of course, I'm not even Greek.

147
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,738
So we go.

148
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,674
But there's a little business to do first.

149
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,481
There's a shipment on the docks this week.

150
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,247
- One hundred and fifty kilograms.
- And no one to pick it up.

151
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,182
Not just Sergei, I miss Frank, too.

152
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,388
We can't disappear the can.
But maybe we send someone.

153
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,967
Bring it off the docks, legitimate.

154
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,730
Everywhere we go these days,
we seem to be walking into police.

155
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,801
This is telling us something.

156
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:28,681
You're going to leave 15 million tholaria
to rot on the pier?

157
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,814
Lambs go to slaughter.
A man, he learns when to walk away.

158
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,253
No, we go.

159
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,089
Call the others in.

160
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,996
Let them know there is no longer any point.

161
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,102
We don't wait?

162
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,976
Our friends are still there, no?

163
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,107
- Still here.
- Then go.

164
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,860
Sobotka was a cooperator?

165
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,506
We had preliminary discussions
with him yesterday.

166
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,371
He agreed to post today
with a lawyer, but instead...

167
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,138
So what's left of the case?

168
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,976
We've pulled in everyone caught up
in the wiretaps, save for a couple bodies.

169
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,949
We left the man we think is the number two
for the operation...

170
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,247
on the street,
hoping he'd lead us to number one.

171
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,219
We have people on him?

172
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,891
He's out of pocket at the moment.

173
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,951
Last seen leaving a downtown hotel,
but we expect he'll resurface.

174
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,754
And the union people?

175
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:56,427
With Sobotka dead, the case right now
is limited to a subordinate or two.

176
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,164
But the important thing for us is the union.

177
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,433
Either they jettison
their current leadership...

178
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,941
or we have enough
to get that local decertified.

179
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,945
Leaving only me and my 14 bodies.

180
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,814
When do we get to that bit of business?

181
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:15,147
Lt. Daniels? Line 2. Det. Freamon
insisted I put him through.

182
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,957
In all likelihood, Frank Sobotka
was going to speak to that.

183
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:24,656
Now, we're a step back, sorry to say.

184
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,658
- Sobotka came in.
- The nephew?

185
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,394
Yeah, he flipped.

186
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,533
Come on, Bubs. You gotta do better
if you wanna walk on this.

187
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,665
- How about some murders?
- How about them?

188
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,471
They're not killing people
in West Baltimore these days?

189
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,602
Been quiet.

190
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,238
Except for that mess
with that young boy who got hit...

191
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,874
with the stray through the window,
ain't been nothing.

192
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,453
- How about that?
- I ain't got nothing on that one.

193
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,522
It's just two crews beefing over a corner.

194
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:52,285
You know what, Bubs? You going to jail.

195
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,684
How you gonna talk about going to jail?

196
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,261
You hearing this, Johnny?

197
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,764
Like we ain't got history in this room.
Like we ain't friends or nothing.

198
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,801
When you was up in that hospital,
all I did was worry.

199
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:05,963
"What about Kima? What's up with my girl?"

200
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,803
I'm just happy to see you're up in the mix...

201
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,401
and you talking about jail and shit.

202
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,639
That's too cold, girl, damn.

203
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,981
Remember that Eastsider
got shot in the high-rises, right?

204
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,487
You remember that shit, right?

205
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,058
I mean, you were right there, Bubbles.

206
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,287
That wasn't shit.
Boy got hit with a rat shot, that all.

207
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,762
- Who you talking about?
- Boy named Cheese.

208
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:35,164
Him and the other Eastsiders
moved into the Terrace...

209
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,964
took over a couple towers
from the Stringer Bell's boys.

210
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,905
Then some crazy-ass bow-tie nigger
came in and chased his ass home.

211
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,498
And what happened?

212
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,805
Mr. Bow Tie, he ran them off.

213
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,572
He told them Eastsider fools,
"Them towers belong to Avon."

214
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,275
But then he ain't come back no more.

215
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,046
Now them Eastsiders
are back up in there steady slinging.

216
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,145
I mean, it ain't like a war or nothing.

217
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,248
It's like Stringer Bell and them are sharing.

218
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,087
Sharing?

219
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,556
You guys are on all of it?

220
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,737
You have a public defender
sitting next to you, Mr. Sobotka.

221
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,467
If there's anything about this deal
you don't understand...

222
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,338
They killed my uncle.

223
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,878
I don't need to talk to no one
but you people.

224
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,073
How do you know they did it?

225
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:30,119
I told...

226
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,828
Spiros calls me
after everybody's getting arrested, right?

227
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,899
Tells me he wants us
to keep our mouths shut...

228
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,107
but Uncle Frank, he says he ain't gonna.

229
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,073
Says he's gonna go talk to the police.

230
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,815
Spiros says that if we keep quiet...

231
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,981
they can help my cousin, Zig, you know?

232
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,687
And now Spiros is saying that...

233
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:08,760
I don't know, the kid,
the one that didn't die...

234
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:10,762
the one that got shot...

235
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:14,698
he's gonna say that the gun, it wasn't Zig's.

236
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:19,202
That Glekas pulled the gun,
and it wasn't really Zig's fault.

237
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:23,972
So your uncle went to meet them
and talk about that?

238
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:25,840
Under the Key Bridge.

239
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:31,416
I seen his car was still there this morning.

240
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,779
I seen that, I fucking knew.

241
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:38,353
If they killed your uncle to shut him up,
they probably...

242
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,153
Wanna kill me, too?

243
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,954
Shit!

244
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:48,331
I was gonna go down with him
to the bridge.

245
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,793
I was gonna go down there with him.

246
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,096
He wouldn't...

247
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,603
You were involved in the smuggling?

248
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,049
We didn't know about the girls.

249
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,112
Them girls that got found?

250
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:12,487
- We didn't know there were girls in there.
- You thought it was drugs?

251
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,958
Drugs, stolen shit, whatever.

252
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,460
We got paid by the can
to creep shit off the docks. That's all.

253
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:23,696
That and selling the drugs
that you got from The Greek, too, right?

254
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,304
That's your cousin's signed statement.

255
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,400
He put himself in,
talked about buying the gun.

256
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,173
The bill of sale
from the pawn shop is in there, too.

257
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,376
It wouldn't have mattered if the
second victim had backed up on his story.

258
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,476
Your cousin was locked in.

259
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:47,623
Your uncle was sitting yesterday
right where you're sitting now...

260
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:51,720
ready to give us everything, if we made
the drug charges go away for you.

261
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:55,790
And maybe got your cousin
to a better lock-up than Eager Street.

262
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:59,003
As you can see,
we're willing to honor that deal...

263
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,801
even if it didn't happen for your uncle.

264
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,417
Spiros was the main guy.

265
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,948
He told me and Frank
which cans to disappear...

266
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:19,047
and then when it came to me and the drugs,
he was the one that hooked that up, too.

267
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,186
The lsraeli, he was their drug guy.
I went through him for all my re-ups...

268
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,130
until they passed me off
to White Mike McArdle. You know Mike?

269
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:29,902
Guess you do.

270
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,903
Double G was in charge of stolen shit.

271
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:35,168
Anything we could lift from the docks
went straight to his store...

272
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:38,369
but he's dead,
so why am I wasting your time, right?

273
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:39,570
Her, I don't know.

274
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,847
My uncle, you know about him.

275
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,147
I don't know
why you got Horse's picture up there.

276
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,190
Horse don't know shit. I'll testify to that.

277
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,082
What about the Russian?

278
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,718
He drove for them.

279
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:59,423
Anything that had to come off the docks,
he was their guy.

280
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:03,298
But I also got the feeling
that if somebody had to get hurt...

281
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:06,201
he was probably going to be around
for that part of it, too.

282
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,035
Why did you think that?

283
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:10,735
Sergei, he just carried it like that.

284
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,403
And also, after them girls died in the can...

285
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,412
they told me that whoever fucked that up...

286
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,251
they had already got to in Philly.

287
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,790
They said that
whoever did that to them girls was dead.

288
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,992
And how did they say it?

289
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:31,161
They just said, I don't know...

290
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:35,065
that the guy that you all was looking for...

291
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:36,829
he was a dead end.

292
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,169
- A dead end?
- Yeah.

293
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:43,072
In Philly, they said.

294
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,537
Who's the suit?

295
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:55,749
You sure?

296
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,357
We know that someone
is above your man Spiros.

297
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:02,053
Someone he was in communication with.

298
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,052
Yeah, The Greek.

299
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:08,190
Sure, I know who you mean.
I mean, I don't have a name or nothing.

300
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:09,961
The man in the suit...

301
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,196
the man with Vondopoulos
in the photograph.

302
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,068
That's not The Greek?

303
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,144
That's The Greek right there.

304
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,724
That the guy?

305
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,456
He picked out an Eastsider, all right.

306
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,865
Cheese runs with Proposition Joe's mob.

307
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,632
Had a few corners off of Ashland,
last I heard.

308
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,435
- What's the verdict?
- He did good for us.

309
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:52,409
- So I'm out the stat?
- I owe you one, Sanny.

310
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,489
- Both of them?
- Yeah, that one's his valet.

311
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,693
Can I use your bathroom?

312
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,762
Fuck, no. Get out of here.

313
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:13,729
Bubs, one last question.
How's product in the Towers?

314
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,693
It was shit, now it's right.

315
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:31,311
Found this guy.
Federal court computer down in D.C.

316
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,681
But not in a bad way.

317
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,414
He's a K Street lawyer down there.

318
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,615
So the suit was only a suit?

319
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,691
On the other hand, my friend,
this is from overseas.

320
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:47,495
A can on the Adriatica, which docks
the day after tomorrow at Patapsco.

321
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,768
Fake manifest out of Le Havre.

322
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,564
You people got reach.

323
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,731
That's about $300,000 in man-hours
we're holding here.

324
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,306
What's the plan for him?

325
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,607
You gotta call the US Attorney
about witness protection.

326
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,147
We're rounding up his girl and kid.

327
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:07,709
It's best we keep this as quiet as we can.
We already lost one cooperator.

328
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,540
It's for you.

329
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,212
Daniels.

330
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,518
Lieutenant, Fitzhugh's calling for WITSEC,
and we're pulling in the girlfriend and kid.

331
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,422
Okay, thanks.

332
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,227
FBI.

333
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,602
This is Special Agent Terrence Fitzhugh,
Baltimore field office.

334
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:37,175
- May I speak with Agent Koutris, please?
- Who?

335
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,766
Agent Koutris.

336
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,870
He's no longer
with the San Diego field office.

337
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,380
Where's he at?

338
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:47,180
You could try headquarters in Washington.
Counterterrorism.

339
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,354
Counterterrorism? For how long?

340
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:57,919
I'd have to check, but I'm sure
he's been gone from here more than a year.

341
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:15,411
Either he comes home
in the next five minutes, or I eat my gun.

342
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,778
I'm just saying, this is not the way...

343
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,116
me and you learned how to do it
in West Baltimore.

344
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,246
Not by a fucking long shot!

345
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:44,633
Either your son surrenders within the hour...

346
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:47,975
or all the police will come
crashing through this door twice a day...

347
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,174
for as long as it takes you people
to get the message. You hear me?

348
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:55,243
We will take this door once in the morning
and once at night, and toss your house...

349
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,551
until there isn't any furniture
with more than three legs left on it.

350
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:02,719
Officer, my son turned himself in
to the police last night.

351
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:06,957
At Southeastern.
A detective was there at the time.

352
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:18,008
- A detective?
- Motherfucker. Come on.

353
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,646
Don't use the phone.

354
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:30,984
There'll be an agent posted outside.
If you go anywhere, go with him.

355
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,597
What a dump.

356
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,560
You wanted us to get a place, right?

357
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:53,972
If they got to him in Philly...

358
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,605
then they probably dumped
the body in that area, right?

359
00:31:56,716 --> 00:32:00,618
No use in dragging a headless torso around
further than you need.

360
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,982
Good God.

361
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,820
I bet you there's a police detective
somewhere else...

362
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,291
looking at a table full of heads right now.

363
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:12,330
In that stuff that we took off the ship,
did we keep any photos?

364
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,161
Couple of pictures of one guy
that left his gear, yeah.

365
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,791
They're at ECU.

366
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,838
You two should get on the road.
Get up there before the offices close.

367
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:30,546
Where y'all been at?

368
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,752
I'm saying, though, Butchie,
something just ain't feel right.

369
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:40,121
The man didn't even know
what I was saying.

370
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:41,955
So I just eased off.

371
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,729
- You think brother played me?
- No.

372
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:49,197
Y'all can't read lying eyes
after all these years...

373
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,701
then I'd be talking to a dead man.

374
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,406
You saying Stringer told you...

375
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:59,004
the brother had something to do
with your boy Brandon?

376
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,169
Yeah.

377
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,874
Near as I know, Brother Mouzone
spends most of his time up north.

378
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,712
New York and Philly.

379
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:10,350
If Avon contracted him to get at you...

380
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,616
the brother wouldn't have stop coming
until you two were bumped.

381
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,490
It's my fault.

382
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,394
I should've said no to Prop Joe
from the get-go.

383
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,798
Avon's father was plain evil,
and the son ain't no better.

384
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,928
Neither is Stringer,
now that we making a list.

385
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,233
I'm going hard after Stringer.

386
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:32,574
No point in trying
to talk you back down, I suppose.

387
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,945
You been my bank for how long
and gonna ask me something like that?

388
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,983
How you gonna get at him?

389
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,345
I don't even know, Butch.

390
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,620
Take some time and think on it.

391
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,694
One thing for sure, though,
the man got to be got, you feel me?

392
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,399
What you see, Butch?

393
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,109
Too much, boy.

394
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,368
Too damn much.

395
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,480
A lot happened overnight.

396
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,852
Not to us.

397
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,324
- Look, this isn't personal...
- Fucking-A, right.

398
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:24,453
We're not even people in this unit.
We're your goddamn pack mules.

399
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,760
"Sit on this house,
transport this mope, wait for that one."

400
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,061
That's part of the job.

401
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,695
The job had a little more rip-and-run to it,
the way I remember it.

402
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,103
These cases are more than that.

403
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:38,142
We're putting people in jail
with phone taps and typewriters.

404
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,712
So you're saying we ain't up to it.

405
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,216
I saw on the postings that Major Colvin
needs a sergeant in the Western.

406
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,755
Flex squad.
And the last time I checked, I had stripes.

407
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,393
Eastside, Westside.

408
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,901
Cats and dogs, sleeping together.

409
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,736
Shit. I'm late for something.

410
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:37,259
You say you want everybody
that came on the port that day?

411
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,037
No, we're looking for anything
out of the ordinary. Probably at night.

412
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,768
Oh, unusual. You should've said so.

413
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:47,103
- What you asked for before...
- That's what we...

414
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:51,574
You're right, sir, absolutely right.
Just see if there's anything like that.

415
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:01,525
Nope, all I got is usual.

416
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,686
All right.
Any way you could give us the name...

417
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:06,356
of the security officer
that was on this pier that night?

418
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,433
What was that date again?

419
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,401
February 5.

420
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,903
You had the Atlantic Light on that pier
from 6:00 p.m.

421
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:21,140
That was Walt. Walt Stokes.

422
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:22,976
Is he working tonight?

423
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:25,949
It's Tuesday. Walt's off on Tuesdays.

424
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:27,650
What do you want Walt for?

425
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:30,051
See if he can make any of these.

426
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,749
Wouldn't do much good.

427
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,124
Afraid Walt's not as up to speed
as the rest of us.

428
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,168
Seeing as you've come
all this way, though...

429
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:49,537
you might want to have a look-see
at the videotapes.

430
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,984
$300 for a stroller?

431
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:06,121
I know, I know.
Cost more than your first car, right?

432
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,255
A hooptie, no doubt?

433
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:12,529
We're so gonna need one of these.

434
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:17,732
Look at this, Kima.

435
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,099
Blue's Clues juice box holder.

436
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:26,435
If the kid can't hold on to a little old box
without no help, we got problems.

437
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,455
Okay, listen.

438
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:44,527
This baby is gonna come out of my belly
and need both of us, forever.

439
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,921
You understand?

440
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,029
I mean, it may not be real for you yet.

441
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,401
But, goddamn it, it's real for me.

442
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,326
Nick.

443
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:32,001
What's gonna happen, Nicky?

444
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,147
That can on the fifth wheel there.

445
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:44,620
By the plan, it's a hot box,
but there's no one on a pick-up.

446
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:47,817
- Where's it from?
- Le Havre, France.

447
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,794
Fuck it, then. Dump her.

448
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:05,707
Lester, the drug talk coming
from Proposition Joe's people...

449
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,642
before the warehouse phone came down.

450
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,680
Those were for steady re-ups, right?

451
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:13,274
We weren't up on that wire long,
but, yeah, three weeks in a row.

452
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:17,151
- How much?
- Five or six La-Z-Boys at a clip, to start.

453
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:21,055
Last call to Eton's cell phone,
the re-up went to 12.

454
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:24,126
He doubles his re-up to 12 kilos?

455
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,635
That's her right there.

456
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:35,338
They ain't doing the dirt, though.

457
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:38,239
Team leader,
keep an eye on that can till we post.

458
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,537
Copy.

459
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,385
Sorry to hear about my boy Sergei.

460
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:51,353
Eton, too.

461
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,415
You lost some good people.

462
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,393
There'll be some new faces soon.

463
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,930
A week or so. They'll find you.

464
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,836
Just as they'll find the others
that work with us.

465
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:08,099
A week?

466
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:13,272
I ain't got enough of your good shit
to last much past that.

467
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,480
You got anything to lay off
before you leave?

468
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,541
The last shipment is lost.

469
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,887
Lost? How you mean?

470
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:27,458
The police may be sitting on it.

471
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,049
You ain't sure?

472
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,895
There's more where that came from.

473
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:34,228
Always, there is more.

474
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,959
All right, then.

475
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:41,031
I'm gonna let your new people find me.

476
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,400
Have a safe trip.

477
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,308
Where you say you off to again?

478
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:03,324
There's 12 in this, 15 in that.

479
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:06,694
And if the rest of them
holds this same pattern...

480
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,494
Maybe 200 kilos of raw left on the pier.

481
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,429
The Greeks are definitely in the wind.

482
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,438
And we are in the dark.

483
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,265
You want us to take it down
to the customs shed, or what?

484
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,207
No, you're gonna seal it up and sit on it.

485
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,836
If we're lucky, someone will come
calling in a day or so.

486
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:22,971
You that lucky?

487
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:27,541
If they didn't get onto us when they did,
this might've been a hell of a case.

488
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:29,953
It's on you.

489
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:37,618
Ambushed? In his own goddamn room?

490
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,721
Yeah, he gonna be all right, but he...

491
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,858
I don't give a fuck
about how he gonna be, man.

492
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:46,501
You put on out-of-town talent
at a high price...

493
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:49,039
you expect them
to get the motherfucking job done.

494
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:51,507
He said that thing between us is...

495
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,010
How did he put it? Absolved.

496
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:57,409
Absolved? What the fuck do that mean?

497
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:01,352
Mouzone booked out,
we worse off than when he came.

498
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,978
If word gets out on the street
that we weak like this...

499
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,023
how the fuck we supposed
to maintain our shit?

500
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,786
I know, but we gotta hit right back,
make a statement.

501
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,794
But Mouzone not saying who did this.

502
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,989
- You asked him who it was?
- Yeah, I asked him.

503
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:14,622
- Why?
- Why what?

504
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:20,733
How you gonna ask a soldier like Mouzone
a question like that?

505
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:23,399
Either he gonna say,
or he gonna go and work it out.

506
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,568
Either way,
you ain't got to be asking him shit.

507
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:38,052
Man, every market-based business
runs in cycles...

508
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,386
and we going
through a down-cycle right now.

509
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:44,519
String, this ain't about
your motherfucking business class either.

510
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:48,800
It ain't that part of it. It's that other thing.

511
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:53,199
The street is the street. Always.

512
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:02,936
Man, we gonna get through
this bullshit anyway.

513
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:05,881
No doubt.
You just need to hold tight till I get uptown.

514
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:07,815
And that day gonna come, but until then...

515
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,888
we gotta do what we can do,
when we can do it.

516
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:15,024
Yeah, you need to go to Prop Joe.

517
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,719
I ain't gonna argue with you.

518
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,854
You run it as you see fit.

519
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:22,496
At least until I get home, you do.

520
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,829
No doubt.

521
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,301
Us, man.

522
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:34,968
Us.

523
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:49,250
- Tape is fucked up.
- It's multiplexed.

524
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,587
It's a way to save money.

525
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,688
Instead of one camera, one VCR...

526
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,858
it's 10 cameras playing on one VCR tape.

527
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,868
- Can you make sense of it?
- Not a problem, with this software.

528
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,461
- We just de-plex it.
- De-plex?

529
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:03,700
Let me show you the highlight reel.

530
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,341
- Is he flashing a badge?
- Looks like it.

531
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:15,477
That's something you don't see too often...

532
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:17,282
John Law in a Mercedes-Benz.

533
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,118
That could be our boy.

534
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,215
Head still on.

535
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:26,230
Tell me we got cameras inside.

536
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,561
Jesus, my pants are wet.

537
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,829
Yeah. C'mon, baby.

538
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:33,638
Yeah.

539
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,290
Re-up gonna be about a week or so late.

540
00:44:54,393 --> 00:44:56,953
My people are having to readjust
to some shit.

541
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,029
A week?

542
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,291
No later than that, they say.

543
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,124
How it go with Avon today?

544
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,036
It's all good.

545
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:21,947
Our old friend.

546
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,389
What's the news?

547
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:30,552
Port cops are sitting on a can
that came off the Adriatica.

548
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:32,994
Word around the customs shed,
it's full of dope.

549
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:34,565
I mean, about Frank.

550
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:37,362
- What's the district council saying?
- Gentlemen.

551
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:42,501
Mr. Pakusa, in light
of your pending indictment...

552
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:45,633
I'd think you'd stay as far away
from this hall as possible.

553
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,541
Ain't y'all got some place to go?

554
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:49,273
Just came to make it clear...

555
00:45:49,381 --> 00:45:51,281
that if there's no cleaning up in here...

556
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:52,975
this local will be decertified.

557
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,450
Instead of your union
running out of this office...

558
00:45:55,554 --> 00:45:59,081
it'll be a federal magistrate
down the courthouse deciding things.

559
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:01,659
Take the opportunity to elect new officers...

560
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,024
or the US Attorney will padlock the door.

561
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,529
And you'll be outside, looking in.

562
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:24,042
One man, one vote.

563
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:44,424
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

564
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:47,595
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

565
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:53,173
You don't think that had anything to do...

566
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:55,602
with this mope?

567
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:06,349
You gotta do better than that, Lester.

568
00:47:06,525 --> 00:47:08,789
This poor guy ain't got a face.

569
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:24,804
Did I mention the DNA matches?

570
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:29,413
This has nothing to do with me.

571
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,123
Is that the security guard?

572
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,893
Walt Stokes. A good man.

573
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,806
Keeps meticulous records.

574
00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:01,001
Bunk, they tell me
you can enhance each frame...

575
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,841
to get a clear look.

576
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,614
Yeah? Show it to me.

577
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:13,018
I'll be damned. Maryland tags.

578
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:15,857
Juliet-Lima-Yankee...

579
00:48:16,795 --> 00:48:18,285
5-4-5.

580
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:21,331
That comes back to a BWI rental.

581
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,432
I wonder who rented it.

582
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:28,906
This is aggravated murder and kidnapping.

583
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:32,733
In this state, it's a death penalty case.

584
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:37,708
I didn't kill him.

585
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:44,186
I was there, but I didn't kill him.

586
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,792
Vondas did.

587
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,657
He cut his throat.

588
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,965
The shepherd was supposed
to watch over the women.

589
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:02,739
Instead, he used them to make money.

590
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:07,238
One of the women, she fought.
She was killed.

591
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:12,315
And this idiot kills the rest
to make no witnesses.

592
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:13,907
He had to die.

593
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,091
You want a coffee? Soda?

594
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:25,958
Vodka.

595
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:28,726
Coffee.

596
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:44,480
They're down. All 14 of them.

597
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:48,110
Abated by the untimely death
of a known suspect.

598
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:52,016
Plus another clearance
on a John Doe case, just for laughs.

599
00:49:52,457 --> 00:49:55,483
You wanna tell Rawls?

600
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:58,354
Let him stew a while longer.

601
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:01,165
One thing, though,
we should do right away.

602
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:14,202
Who's the man above Vondas?

603
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,810
The Greek.

604
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,073
What's his name?

605
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:26,351
You want a chance at anything
less than death row...

606
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,982
you're gonna tell me right now...

607
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:31,790
whatever it is you know
about where those bastards might be.

608
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:35,599
A hotel at the harbor.

609
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,228
This one?

610
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,364
Another.

611
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,862
I can show you.

612
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:01,214
Go.

613
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:06,820
Clear!

614
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,547
Business or pleasure for you?

615
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,543
Business. Always business.

616
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,096
- What did you forget?
- Nothing important.

617
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,316
You come to the bar without me?

618
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,821
Kiss my black cat's sister's ass.

619
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:10,189
- What happened?
- Case hit the wall.

620
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:11,455
How so?

621
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:14,191
The Sobotka nephew breaks for
the smuggling and the drugs.

622
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:17,496
The Russian breaks for the murder
that fucking killed my girls.

623
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,036
We were late on Vondopoulos
and The Greek.

624
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,231
- How late?
- They skipped.

625
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,003
We got interstate flight warrants out,
but from what the Sobotka kid says...

626
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,407
these guys collect passports.

627
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:30,310
We ain't even got a name
for The Greek yet, right?

628
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:32,908
What're we doing
with the drug end of the case?

629
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:36,009
I guess we could offer up Dixon
and Prop Joe to Narcotics.

630
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,554
See if they want
to follow through on their end.

631
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,884
I don't know.

632
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:43,051
I wouldn't be so quick
to throw Joe back into the pond.

633
00:52:44,062 --> 00:52:47,896
A major case squad could have some fun
with that mess, don't you think?

634
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,578
Lieutenant.

635
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:09,883
I never told you this.

636
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,680
In fact, if you tell anyone
I ever told you this...

637
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,056
I'll finish my career
in fucking Montana or some shit.

638
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:19,962
Excuse me, sorry.

639
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:25,928
The leak wasn't your people.

640
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:29,831
When I called around
looking for info on your targets...

641
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,466
I used the FedCom software, you know?

642
00:53:32,844 --> 00:53:36,007
I thought I was talking
to some fuck in San Diego.

643
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:38,306
The 9/11 boys in D.C.

644
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:42,445
I'm guessing Vondopoulos
or The Greek was an asset to them.

645
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,249
Hooked up like, I don't know,
who knows what?

646
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:54,090
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

647
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,406
World just keeps turning, right?

648
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:10,712
You guys move on to something new.
No one looks back.

649
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:18,751
It's on me this time.

650
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,719
Anyone?

651
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,343
Where are you going?

652
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:47,342
Work.

653
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,908
Frank, you cocksucker.

654
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,800
- I can take it from here.
- You sure?

655
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:39,535
No one fucks with us on our turf.

656
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:06,321
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?
How's it looking?

657
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:09,992
One ROIRO at North Point.
Graybeards grabbed that.

658
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:12,560
Nothing else today, really.

659
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:14,462
Seniority sucks.

660
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,768
If you ain't senior.

661
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,533
All right, man.

662
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:19,021
This is a great day for Baltimore.
