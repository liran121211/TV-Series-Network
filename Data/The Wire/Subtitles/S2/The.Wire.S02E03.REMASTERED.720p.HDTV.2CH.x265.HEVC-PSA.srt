1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,200
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,401
Yo, J, what up, son, where you been?

3
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:13,540
I ain't been nowhere, T.
Just laying low, man.

4
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:16,478
Now watch, you gonna see
Darnell's little brother...

5
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:18,743
come on out with that laundry basket.

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:22,753
- And the take's in the basket?
- Once in the afternoon, and one at night.

7
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:25,153
Always the same laundry basket.

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,591
How you know?

9
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,389
That money got to come out somehow, man.

10
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,327
So, we ain't got to blast our way
to the top floor.

11
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:36,799
We just wait till they're in the street
with their shit.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,370
We gonna do them tonight, you heard?
After it get dark.

13
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,774
Just like you say.

14
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,642
Put the basket down now, put it down!

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,117
- Fuck, I said put the basket down!
- Easy girl, chill.

16
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,382
You all niggers, you got caught slipping.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,482
Sorry it had to go down like this, baby,
because your ass is cute.

18
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,220
But you got got.

19
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:04,294
Nice, very nice.

20
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:12,631
Bitches!

21
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,968
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

22
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,648
No English.

23
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,191
Kunta Kinte...

24
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,959
yabba dabba dabba doo.

25
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,834
Mishy gishy gushy gushy
mishy meshy mushy, motherfucker.

26
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,181
Negro, you cannot travel
halfway around the world...

27
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,307
and not speak any motherfucking English.

28
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,145
English, motherfucker!

29
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,024
Two missing, and the rest
ain't saying shit we can understand.

30
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,459
I tried to tell you,
with the questions you all are asking.

31
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:53,497
We step off ship,
English is once again heard, right?

32
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,260
Pretty much, yeah.

33
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,399
Here's what's left of Osman.
He was with us since Trieste.

34
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,839
Choksey took all his gear when he jumped.

35
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,279
- You get a lot of guys jumping ship?
- Some.

36
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,349
Usually after a pay,
which we made in Norfolk.

37
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,886
Choksey actually asked for an advance,
which we did using ship's scrip.

38
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:20,315
Nothing here in the way of ID papers
or money. He grabbed that at least.

39
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,627
Anybody else ask for any advances
while you were at sea?

40
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,323
- More than usual.
- Yeah?

41
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,698
A few of them were coming back
day after day, scripting more and more cash.

42
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,237
We figured they were
gambling down in the holds.

43
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,136
And maybe not, right?

44
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,337
The can with the girls was in Bay 9
on the bottom, outside.

45
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,609
- Did you check that bay?
- I did.

46
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,345
It's full of cans for export,
loaded in Hampton Roads.

47
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,887
No sign of anything
except a fresh stack of containers.

48
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:53,856
I'm not gonna lie to you. If you hold us
another day and bring in interpreters...

49
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,756
they're still not gonna say a thing.

50
00:04:55,861 --> 00:05:00,127
The unwritten rule is that what happens
below decks stays below decks.

51
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,033
Sit up, Nicky,
we got paying customers waiting.

52
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:15,873
Ashley, sit down.

53
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,412
You think I cut it too short?

54
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,583
Just don't make me look funny.

55
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,323
Ashley's preschool called.

56
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:31,396
- They want more money?
- Just what we owe them.

57
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,290
- And her teacher says that...
- Teacher?

58
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,634
- They ain't nothing but baby-sitters.
- Whatever.

59
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:41,194
Ashley's been talking in class
about how Mom and Dad don't live together.

60
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,796
Who asks her about that?

61
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,043
No one asks, she just talks.

62
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,978
Kids notice stuff like that.
They talk, you know?

63
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,709
By the time she's in elementary school,
it's going to be an issue.

64
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,650
Time she gets that far,
we'll be under the same roof.

65
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,715
You said that last Christmas.

66
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,916
Christ, Aimee!
You pulling it out or cutting it?

67
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,116
Listen, Nicky.

68
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,028
You want to go get to someplace better,
I'm with you.

69
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:10,832
You wanna keep on like this,
then I got to rethink stuff.

70
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,566
Do what you feel.

71
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,343
As soon as I start getting more hours,
the first thing I do is get my own place.

72
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,847
You wanna move in with me, great.

73
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,146
You don't want to,
at least I did my goddamn best.

74
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,460
You want a streak or something?
I could put a little purple in it.

75
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,767
Yeah, and right after that...

76
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,431
I'll just go ahead
and stick my tongue up some guy's ass.

77
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,137
Got you good, huh?

78
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,037
You think?

79
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:28,135
No, I mean, not really.

80
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,444
Not if Evidence Control
is the posting you want.

81
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,152
- Sorry, Lieutenant.
- Fuck it, right?

82
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:40,317
We brought in the case at least.
Heard you were on the boat.

83
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,193
Ain't so bad.

84
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,421
How's Kima?

85
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,700
She's inside.

86
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:53,098
Asset Forfeiture.
And she's second year pre-law.

87
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:56,306
Housecat. That ain't her.

88
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,808
- This coming back?
- Yeah.

89
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,541
It's the Gant case right there.

90
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,378
Nathan looked over our weak shit...

91
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,918
told me to go find Omar this week
or she drops charges.

92
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,215
- You got a line on him lately?
- I haven't a clue.

93
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:13,519
Last thing I did
was put him on a bus to New York.

94
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,061
You keep your head low, Lieutenant.

95
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,634
A year or two,
you'll be back in their favor, right?

96
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,101
Year or two, and I'll be a lawyer.

97
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:29,974
I got 22 years in.
I'm putting the papers in this week.

98
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:31,874
You're gone?

99
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:36,642
What the hell am I doing down here
with a law degree, right?

100
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,181
You take care, McNulty.

101
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,116
You, too.

102
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:11,275
Kimmy, all I'm trying to say is,
if you'd stop lighting up all the damn time...

103
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,113
- maybe you'd understand...
- I'm gonna light up regardless.

104
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,052
- It took us too long.
- You know I love you, but if your ass...

105
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,988
don't get to finishing counting
all my motherfucking money...

106
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,721
- Shit, you know I love you, but damn.
- Almost five.

107
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,093
We got them motherfuckers good.

108
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,201
Let's see them motherfuckers slip next time.

109
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,964
Who the fuck is you?

110
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:36,632
- Omar come a-calling.
- Omar? Shit.

111
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,178
Ain't that nigger dead?
I heard them project niggers lit him up.

112
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,179
No, I heard they ran his ass up
out of this town.

113
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,215
Spread the word, darling, Omar back.

114
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,925
Look at the way
Crutchfield spelled "prostrate."

115
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,224
Look at it.

116
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:02,631
"The above referenced victim
was prostate on the floor."

117
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,137
"Prostate on the floor."
That's a victim, all right.

118
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,730
That hurts bad.

119
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:13,577
I love this job, I do.

120
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,614
- You want to hear about Philly, Sarge?
- Just the dirty parts.

121
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:19,946
The ship's a dead end.
The cargo bay that held our container...

122
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,384
is full of new boxes,
nothing to recover there.

123
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:26,183
And all them sailors, they lied to us
in every language past English.

124
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,519
Gibbering motherfuckers.

125
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,787
Sailing up the coast right now,
laughing at us.

126
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:31,888
Is that it?

127
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:34,659
Two guys jumped ship.
We'll put out teletypes...

128
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,859
in case that has
anything to do with anything.

129
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:38,993
One of them left his gear, and we kept that.

130
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:42,573
- Sounds like some weak-ass shit to me.
- Because it is.

131
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,877
But your suspect
had to be on the boat, right?

132
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,444
And your boat has sailed.

133
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,777
Jay, what the fuck were we supposed to do?

134
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:54,409
Hold the ship while we chat up
a crew of 40 in 53 dialects? Come on.

135
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,585
If that isn't the plan, what is?

136
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,360
- Officer...
- Russell.

137
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,703
I am informed that you are detailed
to this case...

138
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,240
as a liaison with the port police.

139
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:23,145
I also understand
that you are the only help...

140
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:24,715
that your department is sending.

141
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:25,908
That so?

142
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:29,919
Although there is some small charm
to a woman in uniform...

143
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:33,184
the fact remains
we work plainclothes in Homicide.

144
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,160
Which is not to say
that the clothes need be plain.

145
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:40,129
For you, I would suggest some pantsuits,
perhaps muted in color.

146
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:44,259
Something to offset Det. Moreland's
pinstriped lawyerly affectations...

147
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,896
and the brash, tweedy impertinence
of Det. Freamon.

148
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,004
Rawls is watching on this one.

149
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,136
Let's at least pretend we got a fucking clue.

150
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,345
Tweedy impertinence?

151
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,949
- I like that.
- You know what I'm saying?

152
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,854
- It's not here, Major.
- I can see that. Where is it?

153
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,256
The Flex Squad used it last Tuesday.

154
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,458
The vehicle log says
they parked it at 22:00 hours...

155
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,398
returning the keys to the OIC.

156
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,697
- And?
- We have the keys.

157
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,131
But not the van?

158
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,909
Are you telling me that a fully equipped...

159
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,539
$120,000 surveillance van...

160
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,176
assigned to the southeastern district
cannot be located?

161
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,835
- Around the world...
- In 880 days.

162
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:15,583
- Do we have a plan?
- A plan?

163
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:19,452
- For targeting this guy, Sobotka.
- I don't know.

164
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:23,664
Maybe find out where his union hangs...

165
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:26,828
go down there with a CI or two,
make some hand-to-hands.

166
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:29,930
- How about some DNRs on his phones?
- DNRs?

167
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,942
See who he's calling,
and look for any kind of pattern.

168
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:35,342
Hand-to-hands for now, I think.

169
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,271
600 series, and that's it.

170
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,216
That's right.

171
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,244
This is too nice a block for a prison guard.

172
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:19,414
Shit, you couldn't pay me enough
to work in no prison, man.

173
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,357
Yeah, right, no.
I want you to drop all the cellular joints.

174
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:27,363
- Yeah, all of them, Nokia, Motorola.
- Listen to Stringer play Wall Street.

175
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,930
All right, so call me, yeah.

176
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,698
String, why you so down
on the phone companies, man?

177
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:37,000
While back, I took a stroll through the Pit.

178
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:40,236
I saw that kid
we got running things down there, Poot.

179
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,840
He got the cell phone I gave him
for the business, right there on his hip...

180
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,080
but the nigger got another cell phone
that only ring when the pussy called.

181
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,621
Now, if this no-count nigger
got two cell phones...

182
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:55,352
how the fuck you gonna sell
any more of them motherfuckers?

183
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,718
That's market saturation.

184
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,926
Look here.

185
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,338
That Tilghman right there.

186
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,875
- Dressed like a prison guard and all.
- Yeah, I see him.

187
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:18,178
Steel door.
The boy on the step is all, though.

188
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:21,980
Stump is sitting in the front room window,
staring at the damn television.

189
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,148
- You all could see that from the step?
- There in his damn drawers.

190
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,796
Shut up, dog!

191
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:39,435
Rat make that trash, he home free.

192
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:43,202
Junk better get in closer
if he want a shot at him.

193
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:50,377
I got $20 on Mr. Rat. Anyone fade me?

194
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:54,512
Move along. Come on, get there.

195
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,089
$100 says it ain't over.

196
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:00,487
Shit, I got to take easy money.

197
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,617
What the fuck?

198
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,427
- Motherfucker.
- Sounds about over now, though.

199
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,233
How the hell you know
what the rat gonna do?

200
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,329
Junk do know his varmints.

201
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,782
Yeah.

202
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:39,319
What's wrong with you, boy?

203
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,462
Look, I done told you before, man.
Those two babies don't move me that way.

204
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,369
If I come up with a plan
to do Stump without them...

205
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,101
you cut them loose?

206
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,803
Now you gone and got strategic on me?

207
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:57,475
We do like last time,
and wait for him to come out.

208
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:01,485
Only problem is,
Stump live in that rat hole, baby.

209
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:07,686
So, he ain't got to bring the cash out.
See what I'm saying?

210
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:11,252
Then we charge in, guns a-blazing.

211
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,824
Steel door, right?

212
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:19,059
What's it gonna take
for you to be convinced, man?

213
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,070
I don't bag no babies.

214
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,468
What you think?

215
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:52,428
You gonna have to do better than that.

216
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:54,999
Indeed.

217
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,477
Thinking, maybe do a quarter this time,
if it's not too much.

218
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,819
That a problem?

219
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,579
No.

220
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:15,090
I'm just saying, you back right quick with it.

221
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:20,692
It ain't like them motherfuckers
got anything else to do up in there, right?

222
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,757
- The shit is everyday, man.
- Sounds right. It count right, too?

223
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:29,235
Boy'll bring it to you outside.

224
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,907
There's Tilghman.

225
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,285
So, his shit coming from Butchie then?

226
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,864
- All right.
- Lying Butchie.

227
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,903
- Santa's elves are short.
- Santa's elves aren't real.

228
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,496
The elves in Lord of the Rings
are, like, real elves.

229
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,236
- Real elves?
- They should be short, then.

230
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:11,111
Dwarves are short, hobbits are short.
Elves are tall and immortal.

231
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:15,118
If you weren't too scared to watch the movie
then you'd know all about it, doofus.

232
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,448
Bite me, dickbreath.

233
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:19,455
- Sean, knock it off.
- He started it.

234
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,486
Okay, upstairs right away,
brush your teeth, pajamas.

235
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,586
It's a school night, Sean.

236
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,426
Can I tuck them in?

237
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:35,227
My lawyer's gonna be
sending you something in the mail.

238
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,002
- You're kidding.
- It's not a divorce, it's an agreement.

239
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:41,044
- A separation agreement.
- A separation agreement?

240
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:44,637
Just read it. Okay? It's for the both of us.

241
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,273
It's to protect the both of us.

242
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:47,874
This is about what?

243
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,884
It's just...

244
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,419
You should just read it, okay?

245
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,628
Okay.

246
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,511
Another goddamn day we put our cards up
and get nothing.

247
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,377
- Zig, I don't know why I fucking bother.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

248
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,312
One ship today, nothing yesterday.

249
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,756
Wait for Thursday,
a couple ROIROs hit the berth...

250
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,488
and congratu-fucking-lations,
you grab a day.

251
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,359
Friday's quiet again.

252
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:36,763
Look at it this way, you know,
at least you get the day off.

253
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,359
Days off is the fucking point, Zig.

254
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,509
I can't keep waking up in the morning
not knowing if I'm gonna get paid.

255
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:49,043
I got a kid, right? I got a fucking kid...

256
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,116
and a girl that wants
to get married, for Christ's sake.

257
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,912
What the fuck you wanna get married for?

258
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,846
Not saying I do.

259
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:01,420
But fuck if I even could,
without no pot to piss in.

260
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,088
Aimee is like, "What's the plan," you know?

261
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:09,792
And I'm down here
wondering if I'm gonna get a day or two.

262
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,836
Aimee's sister broke up with Petie, right?

263
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,768
That's your problem, Zig,
one of them, anyway.

264
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:22,107
You let that thing of yours lead you around.

265
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,113
You know me, whiskey, cock, and 5:00.

266
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:26,206
- Just get off me.
- Nicky, look.

267
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,944
If it's money that you're worried about, shit.

268
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,086
Let's pool a few dollars together.

269
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,285
I'll get us hooked up
with a little llello, you know...

270
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,295
turn it around this morning,
we make more money before lunch...

271
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:41,160
than we can down here all week.

272
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,600
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...

273
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:47,227
so that I get popped for pocket change.

274
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,933
Fuck that shit, Zig. Seriously.

275
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:55,036
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll think of something.

276
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:03,083
11900 on that one.

277
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:06,747
We're looking for 14580, by the manifest.

278
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,149
Can't be, the numbers don't go that high.

279
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,990
You had to figure it'd be this way,
the way the port works.

280
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,085
Yeah?

281
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,222
Why have anything
other than fake companies...

282
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,598
and addresses on the manifest
if you're moving a can with contraband?

283
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:21,069
And on the other end, too, right?

284
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,771
You can work it back through customs,
but chances are...

285
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,836
this box wasn't picked up anywhere
near this Rue de Rivoli address...

286
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:32,108
in Le Havre, France.

287
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:35,879
Hell, there might not even
be a Rue de Rivoli in that town.

288
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:43,085
A can full of dead girls,
sent to nowhere from nowhere.

289
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:12,722
- He been good business for me, though.
- Yeah?

290
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,724
Two, three quarters a week.

291
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,317
Mr. Tilghman's money always right,
always on time.

292
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:20,124
That's why we coming to you for the setup.

293
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,290
- You the man to him.
- I'm just saying.

294
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,733
I know, the money, and you know
we gonna find a way to make that right.

295
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,738
But like I said, I'm not asking for myself.

296
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,633
Now I'm asking for my man.

297
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:36,505
- Avon's call?
- Wouldn't be here otherwise.

298
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,411
- Avon is Avon.
- Always.

299
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,354
He probably gonna roll past tomorrow.

300
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:53,863
That'll work.

301
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,970
You see what I'm saying, right?

302
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,872
It makes no sense to bring the girls
all this way and then kill them.

303
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,811
You go all that way to dump it on your boss,
and now you're worrying yourself.

304
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:13,111
- It's got me thinking is all.
- It's a little late for that, McNulty.

305
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:16,744
What connects the one girl in the water
with all the other ones in the can?

306
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:20,651
- If you're right and she isn't local, then...
- She's definitely not local.

307
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:22,419
The low level of mercury viscosity...

308
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,360
in the amalgam restorations
says Eastern Europe.

309
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,330
- If you say so.
- Trust me, she's not from Dundalk.

310
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:31,663
Eastern Europe?
Can you narrow it down some?

311
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:36,837
How's this? Three of the dead girls were
in Budapest, Hungary sometime last year.

312
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,932
How'd you know that?

313
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,108
They bought tits there.

314
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:45,643
Three of the girls had breast enhancements.
We looked at the bags during the post.

315
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,377
We pulled the lot and serial numbers...

316
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:51,649
and they trace back to an outpatient
plastic surgery clinic in Budapest.

317
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,782
Would you call them?
Might pull an ID from patient records.

318
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:58,384
The best they could tell me is the implants
were used some time this fall.

319
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,329
Three girls, three surgeries,
same clinic, right?

320
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:03,525
- What else?
- What else?

321
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,398
- Fuck you, Jimmy McNulty.
- Okay, you're a fucking god.

322
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:10,065
There's no one in the game
who can stand in your light, Dr. Frazier, sir.

323
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:13,632
You have to admit that whole
Budapest thing was a hell of a pull.

324
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:17,236
- Where's the paperwork on this cat?
- I got it over here.

325
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:18,877
So go on, what else?

326
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:22,680
Not much, except the swabs show
that at least seven of the girls in the box...

327
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,688
had vaginal intercourse
within 24 hours of death.

328
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,588
Two had anal and six came back positive
on the oral.

329
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:32,286
You tell Cole about all this?

330
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:35,832
I sent the findings off to Homicide,
but Cole ain't on the case, brother.

331
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,798
- No, who is?
- It's your man, Bunk.

332
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,894
And that older guy, his partner, they ate it.

333
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:45,502
Thanks.

334
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:58,549
I told you, I brought you a soda.

335
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,055
That better?

336
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:04,391
Now, look at me.
Don't let those mean boys see you crying.

337
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:06,620
- Okay?
- Okay.

338
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,162
I'll take care of you.

339
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,517
Mr. Stump!

340
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,659
Them boys been teasing Chantelle again.

341
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,175
You know it.

342
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,344
- Morning.
- Morning.

343
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:14,185
- Bobby, how you been?
- Not bad.

344
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,358
- Working the tier today?
- Yeah, on J.

345
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,666
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, you, too.

346
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:28,769
You happy now, bitch?

347
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,239
How was I gonna know
Landsman would pull Cole...

348
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,775
and stick you guys?

349
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,606
You right here with them?

350
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,112
- What did he call Cole?
- "Collateral damage."

351
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:40,115
I'm feeling pretty damn collateral myself,
I got to say.

352
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:43,880
Which is why I went to see Dr. Frazier
and work some things out in my head.

353
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:47,253
Officer McNulty could've
paid this thing no mind, but no.

354
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,849
When his friends are suffering,
he bleeds, too.

355
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,053
Did you see the preliminary?

356
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,131
Positives for oral, vaginal, anal.

357
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:58,258
No IDs, no passports, no visas,
no real money.

358
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,394
And they're coming
across the water like that.

359
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:02,631
- Yeah.
- McNulty has a theory.

360
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:06,743
- Does he now?
- You deductive motherfucker, you.

361
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:10,211
So he's gonna wander in here
with some Johnny-come-lately bullshit...

362
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:13,408
about how these girls
are all coming over here as prostitutes...

363
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:17,681
talking about how if they ain't got the cash
to travel better than a container ship...

364
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:20,416
then they sure don't have the money
for a plastic surgeon.

365
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:23,493
Then he's gonna say something
about that one in the water...

366
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:27,121
being tossed off the ship
after she's already dead from a beat-down.

367
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:30,997
But why she got beat?
He's gonna ask us that, like we don't know.

368
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:35,128
He's gonna answer his own question,
saying her swabs are negative, right?

369
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:38,572
Fuck or fight with all them sailor boys,
and she fought.

370
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,473
So, it got a little rough.

371
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,741
She gets banged around,
she comes up dead.

372
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,783
And then somebody panics,
tosses her in the harbor overnight...

373
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:48,010
before the ship ties up.

374
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:49,415
But the other girls saw.

375
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,887
So now, the other girls,
they get told to get back in that can.

376
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,458
And our man, to cover this shit up...

377
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,460
he gets up on top
and bangs down the air pipe.

378
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,458
- Anything else you want to tell us?
- When did you guys get there?

379
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:09,437
Yesterday, when the ship's first mate
told us that while the ship was at sea...

380
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,304
half the crew came to him
for advances on their salary.

381
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,037
They had one hell of a dice game
going on below deck...

382
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:17,079
or the boys popped them girls
out of that can.

383
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,478
You talk to the crew?

384
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,675
- In what language?
- Crime scene?

385
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,718
- Nope.
- Anybody missing?

386
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,653
Two guys jumped ship.
One in Philly, one in Norfolk.

387
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,623
But that shit happens all the time,
apparently.

388
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,487
- Got yourself a hell of a case.
- Fuck you very much.

389
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,033
You know what happens to all the girls
if you don't ID them?

390
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:40,262
Anatomy Board as medical cadavers.
Then a crematorium.

391
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,464
Then that mass grave out at Crownsville.

392
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:44,040
That bothers you?

393
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:45,706
Yeah, a little.

394
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,138
Me, too.

395
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:57,982
- Thanks for hosting this, Father.
- Hope it helps.

396
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:00,522
You guys have really done
the background on this.

397
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:03,684
This is more presence
than the port unions have shown in years.

398
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:07,230
- Is the governor listening?
- It's now or never for us.

399
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:10,066
And not just the grain pier,
but with the dredging.

400
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,658
I don't care
what the Corps of Engineers' study says.

401
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,397
- The fact remains...
- Excuse me, Bobby.

402
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,168
I just need him to work
the other side of the room on something.

403
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,468
You're wasting time here.

404
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:25,271
Bobby's District 7, which is middle river...

405
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:28,647
which means every vote he gets
is somebody with some port connection.

406
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,720
He's a good vote, no matter what we do.

407
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,016
The guys you need to be working
are the guys...

408
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:35,751
who wouldn't have come
if we hadn't been throwing money at them.

409
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:38,760
- Like who?
- Like John Carney, from Anne Arundel.

410
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:42,059
Liz Tobin, from Montgomery.
Clay Davis, from over Westside.

411
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,964
Keep hold of them,
some of your stuff stays in the budgets.

412
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,697
- And they're with us?
- Carney is pretty firm.

413
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,797
Liz will stay solid if the environmentalists
don't get to her.

414
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:55,072
Clay Davis... that guy, you wanna make sure
you're the last man out of the room.

415
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,544
What do you mean?

416
00:31:56,647 --> 00:32:00,014
I mean, we've given forty large
to the Westside Democratic Organization...

417
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:02,284
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.

418
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,013
We spent $40,000 on that guy?

419
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:07,716
Worth it, if he lets your projects
sail through the conference committee.

420
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:11,693
- Forty fuckin' thousand?
- Am I your lobbyist? Are you paying me?

421
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:14,193
Trust me. With the players in this room...

422
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:17,392
the presiding officers and a little help
from the governor's office...

423
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:19,969
we might squeeze some things out
this session.

424
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,765
Now, go make nice.

425
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,705
- Senator Davis.
- Excuse me.

426
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:31,937
Hey, partner.

427
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:36,215
People tell me
it just might be a good year for the port.

428
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,617
Might be.

429
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:40,415
You all have been stepping up
in a lot of ways.

430
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:45,154
Hope it continues like that.
You all making friends in a lot of places?

431
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:47,092
We're friendly guys.

432
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,602
So they came back murders?

433
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,975
I admit, I didn't see that coming at all.

434
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:05,247
Who could've seen that?

435
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,274
For whoever was having
these girls brought over...

436
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:10,819
- the net loss is in the millions.
- That much?

437
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:14,584
One of these girls on the circuit,
going club-to-club on the East Coast...

438
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:17,159
can bring in half a million
over the next two years.

439
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,627
And that's just
for club work and prostitution.

440
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,324
- So somebody messed up.
- In a big way.

441
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,727
You guys called it.
No such address in Le Havre.

442
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,530
Or for that matter, anywhere in Brittany.

443
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,733
The name and ID of the driver
who signed the bill of lading...

444
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,367
doesn't correspond
to their motor vehicle database.

445
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:36,275
Dead ends either way.

446
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,344
The girls, they know
what they're coming over for?

447
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,542
Some do.

448
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,211
Some get told they're gonna dance,
or be secretaries.

449
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,721
You gotta understand, they're coming
from places that don't have much.

450
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,156
Romania, Moldavia, Russia, Albania.

451
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:52,558
40,000 or 50,000 undocumented women
working in the US alone.

452
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,654
50,000? Jesus.

453
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:57,900
They need a whole new agency
just to police them.

454
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,060
What they need is a union.

455
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:05,437
- To Stan and Kate.
- Stan and Kate.

456
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,539
Happy anniversary!

457
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,648
Thanks a lot.

458
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:17,851
- Good time here?
- Yeah.

459
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,923
How is my detail coming?

460
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,122
Lt. Grayson is on top of things, right?

461
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:27,493
Burrell recommended him.
Said he was really good at property crimes.

462
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:31,894
- It's gonna take a while.
- You think?

463
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,993
Why? What are you doing?

464
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,268
Not much.

465
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,976
We got no DNRs up.
We're not looking at any union assets.

466
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,479
We're not collecting tag numbers
or anything.

467
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:47,414
We're not looking for patterns at all.
And that's the thing.

468
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,782
I'm trying to tell you
about the Barksdale thing.

469
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,879
If you go in with the idea
you're gonna eat around the edges...

470
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,287
you never get a meal.

471
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:57,690
With Barksdale, Daniels and Freamon
had us pulling all kinds of stuff.

472
00:34:57,794 --> 00:35:00,354
DMV records, phone logs,
corporate charter stuff...

473
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:02,193
political campaign contributions.

474
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:04,426
If Burrell didn't
break the case down so fast...

475
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:08,232
we would've brought back $3 or $4 million
in downtown real estate...

476
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:11,398
not to mention the money
those guys gave to political campaigns.

477
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:16,036
We were deep, really deep.
I've been trying to tell you.

478
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,244
If it wasn't for Burrell,
that would've been a major case.

479
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:35,729
- String.
- You know, I just came to check up on you.

480
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:39,525
- See how you holding it down.
- I'm all right.

481
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:42,997
- Where the little man at?
- I just put him down.

482
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,705
You want something to drink?

483
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,710
Do D'Angelo know what he's missing?

484
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,677
I'm sure he do.

485
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,285
You just reminded me about something.

486
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,532
Tag's still on it.

487
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,773
He bought it
before he got stopped in Jersey.

488
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,738
Never been worn.

489
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,211
You know,
it's a shame to let things go to waste.

490
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,821
You know,
you can give away the man's clothes...

491
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:38,417
but that don't make him gone, right?

492
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,756
I ain't forget him.

493
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:41,888
You ain't been to see him
much neither, though.

494
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,160
- It's been hard.
- It's been hard?

495
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,758
It's been hard on him, too.

496
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:47,962
A lot of bad things
caught up in a man's head...

497
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:51,006
when he's on lock-down.
Man need to see his baby mama.

498
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,575
Need to see his child, too.

499
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:55,668
Only one thing he needs to be secure about,
and if not...

500
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,847
then he might start thinking
he can't do that time...

501
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,145
and then we all got problems.

502
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,280
You understand me?

503
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,086
How you set here?

504
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,284
The apartment, the car,
the money's all right?

505
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,421
- It's good.
- It's good?

506
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:16,924
I know it's good.

507
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:20,833
But you know what I'm talking about, right?

508
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:25,067
We all got a job to do, and your job
is to let D'Angelo know we still family.

509
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,068
It's important.

510
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,219
I'm an XL.

511
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,423
No doubt.

512
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:46,483
- Your round, Jimmy.
- Jesus.

513
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,785
I'm gonna owe the baby-sitter
half my salary...

514
00:38:48,892 --> 00:38:50,985
if I don't throw myself out of here right now.

515
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:53,028
- You got kids?
- Two.

516
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,691
- Daddy working late, too?
- Not a day in his goddamn life.

517
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:00,800
You barely made a dent.

518
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,002
Good night, gents.

519
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:06,973
- Good night.
- Good night.

520
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,202
- What's that about?
- I don't know.

521
00:39:13,683 --> 00:39:15,412
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

522
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,010
- Solve the fucking case?
- Not a shot.

523
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,021
- I'm gonna give this one a name.
- A name?

524
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,359
She's not going
out to Crownsville, this one.

525
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:31,559
- Not on me, she's not.
- So what are you gonna do with her?

526
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:35,502
Pay for a box and a mortician
and ship her back to Bumfuck, Europe?

527
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:37,903
No, I'm gonna find where her people at.

528
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:42,206
How does that matter?
You see, this is that Catholic shit, Jimmy.

529
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,848
This is that little altar-boy-guilt talking.

530
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:49,076
What the fuck I got to feel guilty about?

531
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,017
Let me count the ways.

532
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,354
Good morning, Major.

533
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,677
What the...

534
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:28,686
Wilmington? Son of a bitch!

535
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:38,295
- Frank?
- Ring, how's it hanging?

536
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,771
Not so good.

537
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,896
- Not right now.
- Yeah?

538
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,975
I'm late on my dues. You know that, right?

539
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,445
You're late, yeah.

540
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,480
And I'm parking that piece-of-shit Buick
two blocks from the house...

541
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:57,644
hoping for a lazy repo man.

542
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,383
That bad?

543
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:03,422
I know you ain't been getting hours,
it's been slow.

544
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,818
Five days last month.

545
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,829
- That's all.
- Is that all?

546
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,533
Look, I got to shit or get off the pot here.

547
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:15,097
- I'm gonna go with 47.
- Do me a favor.

548
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,837
Frank, you been fair,
I ain't saying otherwise.

549
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:22,344
It's just there's 60 checkers above me
with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.

550
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:24,879
Do me a favor.
Go down Clement Street tonight...

551
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:28,883
give this to Dolores,
tell her you need a beer and a shot on me.

552
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:32,582
Just do that much.
You have a round on me, you go home.

553
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:36,682
You wanna come in tomorrow, tell me
you're going with 47, I'm with you on it.

554
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,756
Thanks.

555
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,414
Lane 4, you got a trucker's code and tag.

556
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,294
Pick me a winner, Johnny.

557
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,902
- You're ugly enough to be a teamster.
- Lick me, you whore.

558
00:42:32,515 --> 00:42:36,178
It'll be up on wheels. K-row, slot 122.

559
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:38,885
Roger that.

560
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:56,068
Look, misdelivery.

561
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:58,706
Can was supposed to go ashore at Norfolk.

562
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:03,341
- Yeah, where you want it?
- I'm gonna need it on wheels at K-122.

563
00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:06,074
My man'll pick it up there. Thanks, Horse.

564
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:07,169
Wrong box, misdelivery.

565
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:18,380
No need to count, Butch.

566
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,683
- My shit always right.
- Hearing.

567
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,289
Hearing is believing.

568
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,829
Boy'll meet you outside
when you ready to roll.

569
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,458
I'm ready now.

570
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:39,331
No, dog. Not from me you don't.

571
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:43,535
Later, Butchie.

572
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:51,213
Your man Avon ain't got no flex.

573
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:53,053
Afraid not.

574
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:07,069
Who you like better?
Ultimate Spiderman or regular Spiderman?

575
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:11,571
- What's the difference?
- See, I'll have to teach you everything.

576
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,377
Excuse me, gents.

577
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,192
What's up, man? How you liking the library?

578
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:32,556
It'll do.

579
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:36,790
It's easy on you.

580
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,859
I know a lot of people put in for the gig,
but the gig go to you.

581
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:42,898
Funny how that go.

582
00:45:43,773 --> 00:45:46,071
So you want me to say thanks?

583
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:48,040
You ain't got to say shit.

584
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:50,669
But you need to take heed
of what can be done for you...

585
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,407
if you keep your head straight.

586
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:54,983
You're just full of favors, ain't you?

587
00:45:56,152 --> 00:45:59,781
You shut your mouth and open your mind...

588
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:03,589
and you ain't gonna be doing
but a small piece of this 20.

589
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:06,753
Just like I'm only gonna do
a year or two on this seven.

590
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:09,491
- Feel me?
- I got priors.

591
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,263
Best I can do is half.
That's 10. I can count to 10.

592
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:18,871
Some shit is coming down, Dee, okay?
You need to think.

593
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:23,078
You need to trust,
and you need to get your head right.

594
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,440
Man, my head is where I want it.

595
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:27,982
- You look dusty lately.
- So what?

596
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:31,010
What, you my mom up in here now?

597
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:35,449
That's the weak man's road you're taking.

598
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,590
I ain't never seen you as weak.

599
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:44,491
Look, I'm just, you know,
every now and again.

600
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:48,197
That's all I got
to get my head up out of this shithole.

601
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:50,829
Ain't no more than that?
Because if that's all it is...

602
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,272
you should be able
to give it a rest for a few days.

603
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:57,073
- Because it ain't no thing, right?
- Yeah, it ain't no thing.

604
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,180
Then you gonna do that?

605
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:05,983
I'm asking you, man, out of love.

606
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:09,892
There's always love, Dee.

607
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:17,797
All right. Yeah.

608
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:21,396
A few days. Sure, a few days.

609
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,166
Right.

610
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,853
All right, what have you got?

611
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:18,316
All digital. Four megapix,
16 megs of memory...

612
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:22,023
3X optical, 4X digital zoom.
That's brand new on the market.

613
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:24,065
That's the Cadillac of cameras right there.

614
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,657
- How many?
- 400.

615
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:30,768
- You are talking a big number.
- That's showtime. This ain't the WNBA.

616
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,975
I'm thinking with these features,
this brand...

617
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,171
I can get, maybe, $350 each at retail.

618
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,840
- All right, cool.
- Nope, not cool.

619
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:40,973
$500.

620
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,716
Yeah, I've been calling
some of the local chain stores.

621
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,755
You know, Best Buy, Circuit City.

622
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:50,451
This model goes for $550,
$500 when they're on sale.

623
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:54,060
Okay, $500.

624
00:48:54,697 --> 00:48:57,962
- Times 400 units, that comes to...
- That's $200,000.

625
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,694
What are you looking for?

626
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:04,432
Twenty percent. There's three of us.

627
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:07,205
I want a woman with thin ankles.

628
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,609
But I'm going to go home tonight,
and there's going to be my wife.

629
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:13,944
Eight percent. $16,000.

630
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,482
That's over $5,000 apiece
for you and your friends.

631
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:21,949
$20,000. Upfront.

632
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:27,457
Because I like you.

633
00:49:28,097 --> 00:49:31,066
Look at that.
It's a Kodak moment in the house.

634
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,406
I got to run this by my people.

635
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,068
They okay it, I'm going to give you a call.

636
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:43,578
All right, cool.

637
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,754
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

638
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,885
You gonna insult my ace,
you check-and-raise piece of shit?

639
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:01,930
- Fuck you, Augie, see it or fold.
- I'll see it and raise you back.

640
00:50:02,732 --> 00:50:04,927
- Talk to me, Augie.
- Ten-hut.

641
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,299
Where's the lieutenant?

642
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:14,602
He's on the street.

643
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:35,186
I'm not a politician.
I wouldn't even know how to count votes.

644
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:37,928
Maybe they know it's our time.

645
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,395
Tony.

646
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:46,173
Too soon to call you Commissioner?

647
00:50:47,343 --> 00:50:49,004
Excuse me one sec.

648
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,949
- You sent me humps.
- Major?

649
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,610
You sent me a detail of humps, Ervin.

650
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,553
- We can discuss this tomorrow.
- No, I think we discuss it now...

651
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:03,917
or I'm gonna walk in there and tell Santoni...

652
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:06,620
to vote against this goddamn coronation.

653
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:10,187
And more than that, I'm gonna talk
some shit to some of my friends...

654
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:12,927
about what happened
at the end of the Barksdale case.

655
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:14,024
You hear me on that?

656
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:17,368
The Barksdale case
was a successful prosecution.

657
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:20,271
Up until our people
tried to chase the cash, maybe.

658
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:24,403
We have a quorum, I believe.
Council members can take their seats now.

659
00:51:27,683 --> 00:51:31,346
Tell you what, Deputy.
You probably still got enough votes...

660
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:33,854
but I can make it uglier than you want it.

661
00:51:33,956 --> 00:51:35,253
What do you want, Stan?

662
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,818
I want a real detail,
with real police and a real unit commander.

663
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:41,487
Fine, done.

664
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:43,758
Give me that black lieutenant
that did Barksdale.

665
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:47,165
Daniels put in his papers.
He's gone, out the door.

666
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,764
Did he meet the pension board yet?
I suggest you talk to the man.

667
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:54,636
- I'll do what I can.
- Don't fuck with me, Erv.

668
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,235
I got as many friends
here in the hall as you do.

669
00:51:57,346 --> 00:52:00,543
And with what I'm learning
about the Barksdale case...

670
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,141
I got all kinds of shit I can throw.

671
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:21,192
- Lock-down in 20.
- All right.

672
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:07,078
What's up, lce?

673
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:13,383
- You done with that Green Lantern?
- You can read it, but I want it back.

674
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,550
- You hit Dee?
- Dee ain't up.

675
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:22,462
Four hundred good cameras, Spiros.

676
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,666
Who brought them in?

677
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:31,468
The young stevedore, Niko,
and that idiot cousin of his.

678
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,648
And I think he uses, too.

679
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,581
Stefanos.

680
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:48,115
I don't give a damn nothing about him.

681
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:51,557
Listen, I'm paying 10 cents
on the dollar for the cameras.

682
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:54,027
We're going to clear $180,000.

683
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,264
- What about Niko?
- He's smart.

684
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,459
Make the deal.

685
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:10,509
What the hell's wrong with you tonight?

686
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:12,877
- What?
- You're acting normal.

687
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:18,382
You know what, Dolores?
I made money today.

688
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:20,455
Yeah? What ship was in?

689
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,384
Hey, Zig.

690
00:54:27,396 --> 00:54:29,364
Shot and a beer, Dolores.

691
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,731
Frank Sobotka says I needed it.

692
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,637
Thanks.

693
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,785
- What's this?
- Your change. Or so says Frank Sobotka.

694
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:03,029
- Sure?
- It ain't mine, for Christ's sake.

695
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:06,067
If you don't take it, someone else is gonna.

696
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,772
Your pop's a good man, Zig.

697
00:56:01,957 --> 00:56:03,754
Yo, up here!

698
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:22,568
T.C., what's up?

699
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,907
What's going on?

700
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:30,281
- They falling out, four that I seen.
- What?

701
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:37,582
What the fuck is going on?

702
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:40,127
Bad package. Hot shots.
