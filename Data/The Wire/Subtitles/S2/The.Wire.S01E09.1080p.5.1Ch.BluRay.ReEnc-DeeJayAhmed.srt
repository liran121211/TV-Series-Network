1
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,727
Him on the ball, from Dunbar.

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,284
He junior college now, but he going
to bigger places if he can make them grades.

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,522
He our edge, right there.

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,122
- Where he going?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,524
Uh, Terps, Hoyas, Missouri, Kansas,
they all want this cat.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,241
So we in the mix too now.
You know what I'm talking about?

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,050
Proposition Joe
ain't got nobody balling like this.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,487
He better not have one motherfucker like this.

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,767
I'm tired of losing to these Eastside bitches.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,129
It's been three years running now, man.
Fucking with my morale, for real.

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,848
What happened to the faggot?

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,766
Omar?

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,686
- That nigger in the wind, man.
- What you mean he in the wind, man?

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,762
This city ain't that big.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,803
You know what that nigger do
when he holed up somewhere?

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,202
He peel off one or two packages,
roll around the neighborhood

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,362
giving away free vials and shit.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,729
On some real Robin Hood type shit.
If we try and get at him,

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,724
we gonna have two dozen niggers
saying that we on our way.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,770
If you want us to hunt that nigger,
we gonna hunt.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,482
But the smart play, I think, we call a truce,

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,770
put this thing on hold for a hot second,
let the faggot get comfortable,

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,730
and when he do, he'll pop up his head -
boom, we got him.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,124
What motherfuckers gonna be saying
while we waiting? Hmm?

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,524
What people gonna say when they see
this cocksucking faggot out in the sunshine?

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,331
Like it ain't no thing to take my shit.

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,489
- Kid's everything I said he was, huh?
- Yeah, he's straight.

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,488
Don't know what we're gonna do
without him.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,643
- How come you ain't signed?
- Lot of schools looking at me.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,803
- I'm listening.
- Ten large, though, that ain't bad.

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,329
- It ain't.
- Well, ten for the kid, plus five.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,449
Uh, donation for the program.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,488
Done.

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,803
Good. Give me 30 from the line
and get out of here.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,481
- Yo, man, good job, baby.
- All right.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,169
And I assume there's another five right here,
for making this happen?

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,687
Ain't shit for free, right?

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,807

Can't live without it, right?

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,445
You still fucked up
behind that stick-up, man?

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,363
Shit ain't on you. lt ain't on me neither.

He gonna get got

63

L just don't wanna play.
I don't wanna play no more. All right?

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,968
I was thinking about going to school,
over at Edmondson,

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,963
ask if they'll let me back in.

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,566
- What grade?
- Ninth.

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,565
- Ninth? Shit, you how old?
- 16.

68
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,883
Damn, man, you supposed
to be a junior by now.

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,722
- I heard Stinkum got killed.
- (Distant sirens)

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,850
Yeah.

71
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,721
Damn.

72
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,531
(Men talking)

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,846
- Yo, I said I don't wanna play.
- I heard you.

74
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,485
And you ain't got to do nothing.

75
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,767
I heard you. Take it.

76
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,482
Hurry up, nigger. People looking.

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,689
Look here, man,
you a smart little motherfucker.

78
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,321
You start back up at Edmondson,

79
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,450
you likely to finish up at Harvard
or some shit like that. Believe, B.

80
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,530
And you - you got a good heart in there too.

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,603
Not like the rest of these niggers.

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,725
(Phone)

83
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,285
(2nd phone rings)

84
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,531
- Yeah?
- 'Ronnie Mo on Tower Phone 2.'

85
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,966
Right.

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,606
(Ronnie) 'Yo, you coming to get this shit?'

87
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,489
(Man) 'Keep cool. We making rounds.'

88
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,281
- 'You know I ain't moving like I used to.'
- (Ronnie) 'Couple of hours, we be at you.'

89
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,691
'All right.'

90
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,728
Wee-Bey picking up at the towers?

91
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,964
- In a couple hours, give or take.
- Time enough for us to make a play.

92
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,604
- What's up with Wallace?
- Nothing.

93
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,689
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,728
It's all good, just leave him be.

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,848
(Man shouting in distance)

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,763

(Melodic ring tone)

98
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,560
Damn.

99
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,731
Fuck.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,361
I'm tired of not having
a phone up in this joint.

101
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,727
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
- Have a nice hike.
- (D'Angelo) Yeah.

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,209
(Phone)

104
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,605
- (Chinese accent) You make order?
- Who this?

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,047
You make order? Good yakame.

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,248
- What?'
- Or no delivery.

107
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,842
You make order, you come get.
Good yakame, good noodle.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,445
Extra ketchup.

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,205
(Camera shutter clicks)

110
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,886
What the fuck was that?

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,406
That was my Korean counterman.

112
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,005
Sounded Chinese.

113
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,888
Like you can fucking tell the difference.

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,726
It's a brave new world for you, boys.

115
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,648
(Greggs) 12-14.
(Man) '12-14.'

116
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,485
- Request a lateral with 12-08.
- (Man) 'Go ahead, 14.'

117
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,882
- 08, can you go to Channel 3?
- 12-08, I got that.

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,202
- (Greggs) 'Where you at?'
- McCullough above Preston.

119
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,051
On a good pay phone
that the Pit boys are now using.

120
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,767
'I'm up on the church. Hang close, boys.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,810
'Might have a nice jack-up for you two.'

122
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,565
<i>( Hip-hop playing )</i>

123
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,801
I can't believe you boys still in business.

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,242
- Testers coming in five.
- What's the new package, man?

125
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,527
Yellow tops. This shit is the bomb.

126
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,449
- Shit is the bomb.
- Check it.

127
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,205
A man who wants to get high more than clean.

128
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,170
- (Bubbles) He was doing good, too.
- That shit was bullshit.

129
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,926
- Them meetings were just fronts.
- (Bubbles) The man sounded strong.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,411
Whatever.

131
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,369
It's about that time.

132
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,488
- Shit.
- What happened?

133
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,962
- (Dog barking)
- That's the boy who beat me down, man.

134
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,601
Hey, yo. The shits right here
is yellow tops and they right,

135
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,049
so remember where you caught this blast
and tell your fiend-ass friends.

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,202
(Man) Line the fuck up.

137
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,645
Back up.

138
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,964
Get in line, what the fuck? Line the fuck up.

139
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,641
(Anxious) Get the fuck out of here. Fuck y'all.

140
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,489
(Man) There you go!

141
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,530
(Woman) Hurry up. Over here.

142
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,322
Get one, girl, over here. I got one, I got one.

143
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,769
(Man) You get one?
(Woman) I got one.

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,640
Yo, hold up. Hey. Hey. You catch one?

145
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,246
You know, I got three if you need.

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,966
You was at the meeting
over at Samuel Morse.

147
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,921
- Mr. One-Day Man. It wasn't even that.
- Stood up, though.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,082
Why you at the tester line
if you ain't chasing?

149
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,288
Trying to get my nephew off the corner.

150
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,003
His mama sent him up to Cumberland.
Try to keep him clean at my grandma's.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,962
He ain't anywhere near his bottom.
Got to see that bottom coming up at him.

152
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,771
Hard too, cos he's young, 24.

153
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,003
Most people don't get tired till they're 35, 40.

154
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,771
- How old are you?
- Young at heart.

155
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,564
Waylon, man.

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,886
Bubs.

157
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,401
(Car horn blaring in distance)

158
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,680
Give them a long rope. The farther away
from the projects, the less risk to the wire.

159
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,565
- (Herc) Hell with the wire.
- Excuse me?

160
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,405
(Herc) 'Gotcha, McNulty, you're too easy.'

161
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,084
(Freamon) You can come at this a few ways.

162
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,444
First thing is we need the names
of all front companies,

163
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,921
limited partnerships, LLCs, and all that mess.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,765
- LLCs?
- Limited liability corporations.

165
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,081
Start with the nightclub Barksdale owns.

166
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,882
Look up Orlando's, by address, you match it,
and you see it's owned by who?

167
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,168
It's on Baltimore Street, right?

168
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,282
(Marker pen squeaking)

169
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,648
Got it. D & B enterprises.

170
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,007
Hand it over to Prez
who's gonna get off his ass

171
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,004
and walk over to
the state office buildings on Preston Street.

172
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,367
- Preston Street?
- Corporate charter office.

173
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,090
Corporate who?

174
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,370
(Freamon) 'They have the paperwork
on every corporation and LLC

175
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,363
'licensed to do business in the state.

176
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,923
'Look up D & B Enterprises on the computer.
You're going to get a little reel of microfilm.

177
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,844
'Pull the corporate charter papers that way.
Write down every name you see.

178
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,481
'Corporate officers, shareholders
or, more importantly,

179
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,326
'the resident agent on the filing
who is usually a lawyer.

180
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,609
'While they use front names
as corporate officers,

181
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,650
'they usually use the same lawyer
to do the charter filing.

182
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,451
'Find that agent's name,

183
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,524
'find out what other corporations

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,568
'and that way we find other front companies.'

185
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,888
(Sydnor) While he's doing that, what do I do?

186
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,486
Keep your head in this assessment book.

187
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,769
Look up any properties
that you can connect to Barksdale.

188
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,888
How do you know it connects to Barksdale?

189
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,885
'You work off what Prez gets you
from the corporate charter documents.

190
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,567
'Whatever companies he links to Barksdale
or people connected to him,

191
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,927
'look for those companies
in the city land records.'

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,207
- Huh?
- For example,

193
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,330
McNulty said
that he heard that Barksdale owned

194
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,971
an apartment building up on Druid Park Lake.

195
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,486
'Look up all the blocks on Reservoir Hill.

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,370
'See if there's anything
owned by D & B Enterprises

197
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,968
'or any other company that Prez finds
through corporate charter or anything similar.

198
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,965
'If you find something that fits,
you write down the folio number,

199
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,441
'so you can look it up later at the courthouse.

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,090
'You don't find anything,

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,324
'take the names of all the corporate listings

'You call that list over to Prez,

203
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,209
'and he'll look for connections.'

204
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,251
- This is like a scavenger hunt.
- But what if Barksdale is careful?

205
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,130
What if we can't find his name on anything?

206
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,205
In this country, somebody's name
has got to be on a piece of paper.

207
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,608
A cousin, a girlfriend,
a grandmother, a lieutenant he can trust.

208
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,366
Somebody's name is on a piece of paper.
And here's the rub.

209
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,481
You follow drugs,
you get drug addicts and drug dealers.

210
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,642
But you start to follow the money

211
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,769
and you don't know where
the fuck it's gonna take you.

212
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,010
While we're running around on this,
what are you gonna do?

213
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,367
- You need something?
- Yeah.

214
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,481
Let me get the campaign financial reports
for the western districts

215
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,642
and, actually, any citywide race.

216
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,564
Quarterly reports or individual donor lists?

217
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,326
- Both, please.
- It'll be a couple of hundred pages.

218
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,687
Really? I'll take all of it.

219
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,730
(Siren whoops)

220
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,245
What the fuck, man?

221
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,043
With your right hand,
reach for the window and open the door.

222
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,124
- (Herc) Hurry up, man.
- Step out of the car.

223
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,248
Drop the cane, toss the cane.
Come around to the back.

224
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,241
Turn around.

225
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,685
Sir, is there anything in the vehicle
we should know about?

226
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,921
Nope.

227
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,606
No guns, drugs?

228
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,082
Me ain't got shit.

229
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,122
This money right here,
I didn't just pull this out of your truck?

230
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,005
What money?

231
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,364
- We'll be counting this limp-dick cash all day.
- Where you guys going with this?

232
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,126
Like the man said, it ain't ours.

233
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,125
It ain't yours? So, you don't mind
if we just take it off your hands?

234
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,124
Do what you feel.
You pretending to take money.

235
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,807
- I didn't even know it was there.
- I know how that shit is.

236
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,202
The other day,
I took up the sofa cushions off my couch

237
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,971
and found $1.40 I didn't even know was there.

238
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,371
You all ain't got no charge, right?

239
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,251
No, fucker, we do not have a charge.
We just got your money.

240
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,530
You want it back, you can explain it
to the state's attorney where you got it.

241
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,802
Y'all enjoy your day now, you hear?

242
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,451
<i>(Man rapping) As I wake up in the morning
and get out of my bed</i>

243
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,530

244
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,444

long dead</i>

248
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,047

249

253

(Car alarm, dog barking)

254
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,686
Yo, motherfucker, trying to steal our shit.

255
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,085
Motherfucker!

256
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,362
Fished your wish, Bubs?

257
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,329
Oh, yeah.

258
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,922
And you should've seen
the one that got away. (Chuckles)

259
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,687
<i>(The Specials: Ghost Town
playing, muffled)</i>

260
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,882
You know, I nearly got killed

261
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,083
It's all in the game, Bubs.

262
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,845
Yeah?

263
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,808
(Baby crying in the building)

264
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,962
(Man ranting, indistinct)

265
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,970
(Baby crying)

266
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,690
Yo, Bub...

267
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,322
This ain't shit.

268
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,362
I'm not high, neither.

269
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,089
It's fucking Arm & Hammer.
We just been firing baking soda.

270
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,366
Fuck. It's all right.
I'll just come up with another plan.

271
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,647
- I did it once, right?
- Shh.

272
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,725
(Distant siren)

273
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,530

(Police radio, indistinct)

275
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,010
Fuck me.

276
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,441
(Herc muttering)

277
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,483
Carv, you go to a restaurant,

278
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,650
and say the waitress gives you
good, decent service.

279
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,650
- How much do you tip?
- How much do I tip?

280
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,926
- For good service.
- I don't know, 15%.

281
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,008
- Some people tip 20.
- Some people got money.

282
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,883
How much you think Wee-Bey would tip?

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,641
You'd be a clever motherfucker
if there wasn't a wiretap running.

284
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,722
What do you mean?

285
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,051
Say we turn in 20, and this afternoon
the bosses are listening to the wiretap

286
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,521
and they hear we took 30 out of that car.

287
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,444
Didn't think of that, did you?

288
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,764
(Freamon) We're finding stuff
on the west side of downtown

289
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,889
that might be his
over by that Howard Street corridor.

290
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,602
- What kind of property?
- Low-rent commercials. A lot of vacants.

291
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,168
What does Avon Barksdale want
with a string of empty storefronts?

292
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,084
- This feels premature.
- What does?

293
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,448
Chasing up assets. We're not close
to putting a charge to the man.

294
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,205
- That should be the priority.
- We put a charge to him,

295
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,886
the deputy shuts us down,
tells us to go home.

296
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,203
You want the money side of this case,
it's now or never.

297
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,645
Whoop-whoop!

298
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,760
- I'm working here.
- (Carver) Whoop-whoop!

299
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,764
- Maybe 20 or 30.
- Dollars for donuts.

300
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,330
You should've seen the looks on their faces.

301
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,607
- What did Wee-Bey say?
- "What money?"

302
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,846
The only hassle is we need to count this shit.

303
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,891
- Do the ECU Submissions.
- (Carver) It's all limp-dick, dime-vial money.

304
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,361
Dirty bills right off the corner.

305
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,841
You all got the Pit boys on a fresh payphone?

306
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,968
- On McCullough.
- You take pictures?

307
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,362
We're gonna need an additional affidavit
to get up on that phone.

308
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,642
Another 30 days, McNulty?

309
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,927
- (Door slams)
- What the fuck did I do?

310
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,401
One day he fights, next he's ready to roll over.

311
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,042
- Does he want this fucking case or not?
- (Freamon) Give him some slack.

312
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,164
He's wrestling with the angels on this one.

313
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,290
Where's my lucky pen?

314
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,802
(D'Angelo) 'You ready, bitch?'
(Woman) 'I'm ready.

315
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,963
'I wanna get on my knees
and suck you like a big lollipop.'

316
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,850
- (Man) 'Suck it.'
- 'I know that's your favorite.'

317
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,651
-(Laughs)
- 'Let me lick that. You like that?'

318
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,326
(Laughter drowns out tape)

319
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,323
(Woman) 'I want you to butt-fuck me...'

320
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,927
(Prez) We're supposed to turn off the tap
when it's non-pertinent.

321
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,809
Fuck, no, this is too good.

322
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,441
- 'Fuck me.'
- 'Ooh, Daddy, yeah. Oh! Oh!'

323
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,807
There's no way I'm transcribing this stuff.

324
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,321
- '(Woman moaning)'
- Touch yourself.

325
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,610
- 'Oh, yeah. My pussy is so wet right now.'
- Phone sex?

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,082
Shit was hilarious.

327
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,324
You're supposed to shut down
if it's non-pertinent.

328
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,004
- 'You're gonna look like a glazed donut.'
- (Woman) 'ls that right?'

329
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,924
'I'm gonna get there and fuck you
in all three holes.'

330
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,129
'(Woman moaning)'

331
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,046
- (Woman) 'You're gonna come past?'
- 'Tomorrow, yeah.

332
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,920
'But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight,
check in with Wallace.

333
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,962
'He off the hook since we helped
the tower crew get that stick-up boy.

334
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,449
'Wallace is bugging. Don't hardly even
come out of that room no more.'

335
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,445
- (Woman) 'Why he be like that?'
- 'I think he might be getting high.'

336
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,524
- 'Boy is scaring me.'
- 'You holler at me later.'

337
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,602
- 'That'll work.'
- (Beep)

338
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,606
Pertinent now, right?

339
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,850
It is if you can explain why we're on the line
after 10 minutes jerking off.

340
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,922
You gotta justify that.

341
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,084
Maybe three holes was the code
for three stash houses.

342
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,847
(Laughs)

343
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,649
Omar!

344
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,491
Yo!

345
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,002
(Men) Omar coming, Omar coming!

346
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,084
- Did you hear me? Omar coming.
- Let's get out of here.

347
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,563
(Man) Close that shit down
(Man) I said, Omar coming through.

348
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,927
(2nd man) Somebody in trouble now. Let's go.

349
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,684
<i>Ew-yo.</i>

350
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,243
<i>Ew-yo.</i>

351
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,723
<i>Ew-yo.</i>

352
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,082
Y'all need to open this door, man,
before I huff and puff.

353
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,366
By the hairs of your chinny-chin-chin.

354
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,171
(Man) You best roll out.
We up in here with a MAC-10.

355
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,402
I thinks not, Terrell, I thinks not.

356
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,727
Y'all might need to think this through
and stop wasting my time.

357
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,647
Because Omar can come back tomorrow.

358
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,722
And the next day.

359
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,369
And the next day.

360
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,843
And I will put a bullet in all y'all behind,
what happen right now, you heard?

361
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,326
- Fair enough.
- (Bell tolls in distance, dog barks)

362
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,806
Here you go, keep it.

363
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,082
(Greggs) How do you wanna play it?

364
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,006
Hard and tight, like she's got no choice.

365
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,525
- (Greggs) Shardene Ennis.
- Miss, we need to talk.

366
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,967
- About what?
- It's a downtown talk.

367
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,725
This way. Come on. Come on.

368
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,962
(Man) Two at a time! Two at a time!

369
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,447
(Young man) Give me a two and two.

370
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,048
- Yo, what's up?
- What you got?

371
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,487
Family affair, two-for-one, you up?

372
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,610
- Nah, not me.
- All right.

373
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,286
How you figure all these little pebbles
get up on top of the roof?

374
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,927
(Carver) Where's everybody at?

375
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,607
Maybe the whole thing is over
and no one bothered to tell us.

376
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,682
Maybe we won.

377
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,404
- Something ain't right.
- (Bell tolling)

378
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,608
Come on, let's take a ride.

379
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,124
<i>- ( Gospel music)
- (Shardene) I like these.</i>

380
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,486
Yeah?

381
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,447
- The toy furniture is great.
- Doll house miniatures.

382
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,084
It's a hobby.

383
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,925
My sister had a doll house when we were
young, but nothing as nice as these. Can I?

384
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,843
Sure, babe.

385
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,686
That's a walnut marble-top vanity.

386
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,171
Renaissance revival, late 19th century.

387
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,966
Do you have a house for them?

388
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,646
No, I just make them and sell them.

389
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,208
That seems kind of sad.

390
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,362
You should have a house for them.

391
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,487
We can use the Lieutenant's office.

392
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,047
(Children shouting)

393
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,731
(Distant thunder)

394
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,443
(Doorbell)

395
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,161
- No.
- I ain't asked for nothing.

396
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,971
Oh. What's up, Tasha?
You got too pretty, girl.

397
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,082
Go inside, Tash.

398
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,922
I'm thinking, um...

399
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,130
Thinking about getting clean...again.

400
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,286
(Thunder rumbles)

401
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,648
I was thinking I ain't got
no other place to go, maybe...

402
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,002
That's wrong, right?

403
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,607
That ain't right, right? Sorry.

404
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,725
I'm sorry.

405
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,000
Wait.

406
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,282
Back door only.

407
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,767
There's an old sofa in the basement.
I'll throw you down some blankets.

408
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,047
You try to come up those stairs,
and I'm gonna call the police. I swear I will.

409
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,283
West fucking Baltimore is on vacation.

410
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,284
No crews slinging in the
low-rises, the towers.

411
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,885
(Skidding)

412
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,007
(Cheering)

413
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,966
What the fuck?

414
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,404
- Who's playing who?
- West against East.

415
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,881
- Baltimore?
- The projects, man.

416
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,008
The bragging rights to the projects.

417
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,842
The projects got a ball team?

418
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,249
How long you been working at Orlando's?

419
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,448
- Four or five months.
- You like it?

420
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,729
- Pays the rent.
- You must see a lot there, I imagine.

421
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,761
- What do you mean?
- There's a lot of game being played.

422
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,882
I just work for tips.

423
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,288
- For tips?
- Tips, drinks.

424
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,569
I'm just a b-girl.
I don't mess with nothing beyond that.

425
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,725
Some of the girls in there, they're into drugs.

426
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,684
Some of them turn tricks in the rooms
upstairs but I mostly just stay at the bar.

427
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,046
(Freamon) Hmm.

428
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,848
It's rare when we ask somebody
to come downtown with us, with no charge,

429
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,481
we don't tell them what we're gonna talk
about, and they come without complaining.

430
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,564
- That hardly ever happens.
- Rarely, if ever.

431
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,000
- I figure you got your reasons.
- The crew that runs Orlando's.

432
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,401
They've dropped about a dozen bodies
over the last year.

433
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,681
They're running the drugs in every housing
project west of the Martin Luther King.

434
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,525
I don't know anything about that.
I just work for tips.

435
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,927
Now you do know, because we're telling you.

436
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,560
You know a girl named Keisha Michaels?

437
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,601
- She dances with me.
- How's she doing?

438
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,162
All right, I guess.

439
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,888
Will you excuse us a moment?

440
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,765
- So, what do you think?
- I think she's a sweetheart.

441
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,807
If we push her hard, she'll tumble.
You want to show her the pictures?

442
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,764
I want to do better than that.

443
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,842
(Cheering and shouting)

444
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,449
(Whistle)

445
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,722
(Cheering)

446
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,928
Come on, man, play defense.

447
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,809
- Let's go!
- D-up, B.

448
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,885
- Who is he?
- That's Marcus Rivera, man.

449
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,925
He out of Lake Clifton.
That nigger played in Italy and shit.

450
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,046
Yo, Slim. What's up, man? You got to go
all the way to Europe to get you a ringer?

451
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,167
He home now. But I see you
pulling boys out the junior colleges.

452
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,169
He from Eastside, went to Dunbar.

453
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,925
Playboy, how come you wearing that suit?

454
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,004
It's 85 fucking degrees
and you trying to be like Pat Riley.

455
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,208
Look the part, be the part, motherfucker.

456
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,001
You got a fake fucking clipboard.
You can't even read a playbook.

457
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,447
Be for real. Bunch of bitches.

458
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,968
(Cheering)

459
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,128
Yeah!

460
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,847
- Let's go.
- That was nice.

461
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,122
That boy was talking to God, right?

462
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,726
Oh!

463
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,328
(Poot) Ain't y'all on the clock?

464
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,961
- Ain't you?
- We on a break.

465
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,881
Then we on a break too.
What's up with this game?

466
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,885
Just something we do every year.
Eastside versus Westside niggers.

467
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,043
Loser gotta throw a big-ass party
at Druid Hill next week.

468
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,488
- Who's favored?
- Eastside won the last two years.

469
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,210
My boys.

470
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,563
(Man) Found nude Monday morning,
in a dumpster off Reisterstown Road.

471
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,884
Toxicology is positive for heroin and cocaine.

472
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,604
- In a dumpster?
- (Freamon) Rolled up in a rug.

473
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,005
She overdosed and whoever was with her
just rolled her up and threw her away.

474
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,526
That's how they do.

475
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,730
Positive for semen in vaginal,
anal and oral cavities.

476
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,927
- Three different blood types, all secretors.
- They fucked her and threw her away.

477
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,049
The only reason we knew who she was
or what she was about

478
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,726
or what she might mean to someone like you

479
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,931
is because we've been keeping an eye
on the people who run Orlando's.

480
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,402
We got ways of knowing
what they're saying, thinking.

481
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,561
- You know what they said about this one?
- Bitch didn't know how good the snort was.

482
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,366
That it was her own fault. That's how they do.

483
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,770
They use people, and when they throw them
away, they find a way to say it ain't on them.

484
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,846
Lying motherfucker.
He said they took her to a hospital.

485
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,128
(Cheering)

486
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,243
- Now get back on D.
- Check out Avon. He's freaking.

487
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,811
(Poot) Shit, man, we got to win this one.

488
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,087
Yo, I think Avon's here.

489
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,050
- Where?
- Like I know what he looks like.

490
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,481
He's a black guy rooting for Westside.

491
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,641
(Phone)

492
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,362
We might have a visual on Avon.
Street ball game up at Cloverdale.

493
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,411
- Where's Greggs and Freamon?
- Pressing the stripper they picked up.

494
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,005
You and Carver stay on the radio.

495
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,808
- We should follow him.
- Why?

496
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,880
He ain't gonna touch drugs or money
anywhere you can see him, Lieutenant.

497
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,921
In Narcotics we follow guys.
We do it well, we make cases on it.

498
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,090
Mount up.

499
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,165
We been on this guy three months.
Don't you even wanna get a look at him?

500
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,691
I wouldn't know Avon Barksdale
if I fell over him in the street.

501
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,725
I don't need to. We get him by voice alone
or we don't get him.

502
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,883
Yeah, baby!

503
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,084
(Whistle peeps)

504
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,844
Half-time.

505
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,210
You got yourself a fine ringer.

506
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,527
Yeah, baby, it's not your year.

507
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,286
- It look that way, but you never know.
- I know, man, we up 12.

508
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,604
You is, but I got a proposition for you.

509
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,166
- Okay.
- Double down?

510
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,811
Let's give this wager a clean six figures.

511
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,962
You serious? I don't give a fuck.
It's your money. You can waste it if you want.

512
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,882
(Daniels) Anyone got him?
(Woman) '64-Charlie to central K.'

513
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,166
12-10.

514
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,685
'12-10.'

515
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,411
12-10.

516
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,404
You have him?

517
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,524
Lieutenant, I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

518
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,723
(Cheering)

519
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,085
(Whistle peeps)

520
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,327
(Man) Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.

521
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,331
Got him marked. On the sideline, red shirt,
white visor. I think he's coaching.

522
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,445
Yo, who this fucking midget, yo?

523
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,483
(Crowd gasp)

524
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,204
(Cheering)

525
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,329
Get that midget out of here, B.

526
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,171
(Computer whirring and beeping)

527
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,523
<i>HEY-</i>

528
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,530
(Beep)

529
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,645
(Man) 'Why you holler at me?'
(2nd man) 'We getting down to it.'

530
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,645
- (1 st man) 'I get to you when I get to you.'
- That's it, we're on the stash.

531
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,482
- We are?
- Mmm-hmm.

532
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,490
How can you put that down
when Sydnor wasn't on the roof?

533
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,370
Yes, he was.

534
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,923
No, he's not, he's with Daniels.

535
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,531
No, he isn't.

536
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,129
(Crowd) Oooh!

537
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,403
(Cheering)

538
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,291
(Grunting)

539
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,684
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Ref, what the fuck?

540
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,650
(Cheering)

541
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,682
(Whistling)

542
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,000
What the fuck?

543
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,647
Ref! Ref, what the fuck?

544
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,850
The boy was fouled. Clear, straight up!

545
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,922
How you gonna not call that?

546
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,601
I can put time back on the clock and replay it.

547
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,929
You talking about a do-over?
A fucking do-over?

548
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,447
That's not how the game is played!
You can't do that!

549
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,284
Nigger talking about doing it again.

550
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,291
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't gonna be no trouble over no ball.

551
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,162
Man, you supposed to be the ref.

552
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,884
Why don't you stand up
for your fucking self? You pussy.

553
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,240
You can't let any old motherfucking nigger
get in your face, understand?

554
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,164
Walk away. Walk away!

555
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,561
Turn around and walk the fuck away.

556
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,209
Ignorant motherfucker.

557
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,407
- We cool?
- We cool, baby.

558
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,484
Tell your people to come to the park
Saturday at noon.

559
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,487
You come on the Westside again,
without a ball, I'm gonna light your ass up.

560
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,927
- D'Angelo, huh?
- (Sniffs) You know him?

561
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,480
At this point, it feels like I do.

562
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,565
(Sniffs)

563
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,563
We sort of moved in together.

564
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,840
He seemed like he was different.

565
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,923
- I have to quit the club.
- Yes, you do. But not just yet.

566
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,369
We need your help.
Which is why we came to you.

567
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,011
- I don't know what else...
- Keisha was not the first.

568
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,369
Unless somebody steps up a little bit,
she's not gonna be the last neither.

569
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,682
You like that one?

570
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,482
Why don't you keep it?

571
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,202
(Whispers) Thank you.

572
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,204
- He's getting into a black Ford Excursion.
- (Man) 'Copy that.'

573
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,489
<i>- ( Hip-hop blaring)
- He's pulling out, north on Collington.</i>

574
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,082
(Car starting)

575
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,566
<i>- ( Hip-hop)
- (Daniels) '11-71.'</i>

576
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,160
You got the parallel on the north,
I got him on the south.

577
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,562
11-71, I got him.
Looks like he's going east on Oliver.

578
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,724
<i>( Hip-hop continues)

<i>But you can't pass

582
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,242
(Herc) He just parked. East of Oliver.

583
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,442
12-10, you keep the eyeball.

584
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,520
11-71, take up a position on Federal,
west of Montford.

585
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,602
I'm coming up from the south.

586
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,606
11-71, I copy that.

587
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,089
He's just sitting there.

588
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,645
<i>...television and radio stations...</i>

589
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,967
- He's doubling back.
- 'Copy.'

590
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,288
He's south on Montford.

591
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,124
He jumped the light at Preston and Milton
and is south on Milton.

592
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,846
Be advised that he didn't make it to Chase.

593
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,527
11-71, what's your status?

594
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,842
(McNulty) 'He couldn't have gone past us.'

595
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,605
(Carver) '11-71, nothing on this side.'

596
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,689
(Herc) 'Must have went to ground.'

597
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,806
Hold your positions. I'll take a look.

598
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,891

599
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,883

<i>To be, for you and for me, the people
over there and the ones in between...</i>

604
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,404
- He called again, same payphone.
- Same voice?

605
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,370
Main stash house, it's got to be.
The pattern fits.

606
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,166
- Who took the call at the projects?
- Who knows?

607
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,246
There was no one on the roof. Sydnor was
off with Daniels, chasing Avon in the street.

608
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,886
We had a good day too. Kima turned
one of the dancers over at Avon's club.

609
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,043
The one who's fucking D'Angelo.

610
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,122
(TV blaring, muffled)

611
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,771
(Running footsteps on floorboards)

612
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,685
(Laughs)

613
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,566
This guy's good.
We threw everything we had at him.

614
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,450
You know what they say,
stupid criminals make stupid cops.

615
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,365
I'm proud to be chasing this guy.

616
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,445
We got four front companies so far,
buying up all kinds of shit.

617
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,530
A club, an apartment building, a funeral home

618
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,400
and real estate on the west side
of downtown by the Howard Street corridor.

619
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,642
Shop fronts and warehouses.

620
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,851
- Barksdale's name on it?
- Fronts, mostly. Relatives, some.

621
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,722
Mind if I have a seat?

622
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,928
He's had the projects for more than a year
and it's a money factory.

623
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,487
We popped Wee-Bey coming out
the other day with 22,000.

624
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,644
The boys on the wire were saying
it wasn't much of a loss.

625
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,131
22?

626
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,931
One morning from the towers and the Pit.

627
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,571
Add the avenue corners, you're up near 30.

628
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,321
Another take for the evening, 60,000.

629
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,889
- A day?
- That's 25 million a year, conservatively.

630
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,204
Take out 20%
for running expenses and spillage

631
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,568
and you are still clearing
a million dollars a month.

632
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,169
- So, where does it all go?
- He shows no flash.

633
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,444
He's got no, uh, no house, no car in his name,

634
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,523
no jewelry, no clothes.

635
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,082
Just front companies and the property.

636
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,209
And political contributions.

637
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,610
75,000 last month alone, all from
his front companies or their listed officers.

638
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,967
And that's just at a quick glance.

639
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,845
I'm just totaling up the legal contributions.

640
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,124
You've got the likes of Damien Price,
aide to a state senator,

641
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,922
driving out 20,000 in cash from the projects
whenever he feels it.

642
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,366
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but the money is real and it's everywhere.

643
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,566
And more than the drugs,
it's the money that matters.

644
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,527
I ain't fucked nobody else
if that's what you thinking.

645
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,766
All right. I mean, fuck it.
If you wanna go, then go!

646
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,571
But you could give me a goddamn reason.

647
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,084
- What do I look like to you?
- What you mean?

648
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,851
- What do I look like to you?
- You look like a girl, a woman.

649
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,968
A beautiful woman. You fine. What?

650
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,443
I don't look like trash to you?

651
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,201
Baby, this ain't about what you do.

652
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,970
I don't look like something you could
roll up in a rug and throw in the trash?

653
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,971
Shardene.

654
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,610
Shardene.

655
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,405
Shardene!

656
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,290
Lieutenant, you paged us?
We were almost home.

657
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,611
Sit.

658
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,770
(Man 1) 'Hey, checked my count again.'
(Man 2) 'How bad?'

659
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,320
(Man 1) 'Not too bad, man.

660
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,968
- 'We got hit about 22.'
- (Man 2) '22? That's all?

661
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,489
'All right.'

662
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,651
I got towers two, three, five and six
and another one labelled "P" for the Pit.

663
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,642
Where's one and four? It's on the wire
that we took them for 22.

664
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,970
You shitheads turned in 15. Where's the rest?

665
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,401
Lieutenant, we ain't got...

666
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,441
You have till roll call tomorrow to crawl back
to whatever rock you hid it under.

667
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,530
It comes back and it goes to ECU.

668
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,921
This doesn't happen.

669
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,843
Not with me. Not with my unit.

670
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,643
(Door slams)

671
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,841
I wouldn't steal and not tell you about it.

672
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,682
This some of Avon's shit.

673
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,963
You got Avon Barksdale chasing
your ass all around town

674
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,441
and you still find time to take his shit.

675
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,000
- It's your shit now.
- What I want with that?

676
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,243
What anybody want with that, man?

677
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,564
- How much you asking?
- We free.

678
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,491
Free?

679
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,725
I'm saying, I got a little proposition for you.

680
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,530
Proposition is, you get four G-packs for free,

681
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,325
you give me some better idea
on how I can reach Avon.

682
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,723
- How to contact him?
- You all just had a game, right?

683
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,929
How you get a hold of him to parley?

684
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,964
We talk now and then.

685
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,088
I page his ass.

686
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,010
Okay. Okay.

687
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,687
- That all you need? A number?
- I could make do with it.

688
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,728
And a code for one of his peoples.

689
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,364
What Wee-Bey use, 07?

690
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,810
O7.

691
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,811
What makes you think I ain't gonna take this
and throw your ass up outta here?

692
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,885
Avon goes down, the projects
be open market again, right?

693
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,648
Let me understand.

694
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,601
Avon loses 100 large to me on a bet,

695
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,649
then you bring me some of his shit so that
I can put your predatory self on his ass.

696
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,129
Not his day, is it?

697
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,962
(Clattering)

698
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,970
(Carver) Fuck it.

699
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,722
Fuck. Fuck.

700
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,684
Ah!

701
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,327
(Signs)

702
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,084
Fuck it.

703
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,122
- Where was it?
- The wheel well.

704
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,406
You remember when the bag broke?

705
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,082
Think Daniels will believe it?

706
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,604
Would you?

707
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,168
You didn't believe me.

708
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,162
I'm sorry.

709
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,526
(Avon) Savino late. I'm ready to make
this money-run, get the fuck out here.

710
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,371
- You tired?
- I'm tired, man, I'm hungry.

711
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,727
Me, too. Want something to eat
from the diner?

712
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,326
You going over there?
Get me a cheese steak.

713
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,921
- You hungry too?
- I could do a burger.

714
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,361
Let me get onions on that, man.

715
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,087
You organizing it right? My 50s with my 50s,
and my 100s with my 100s?

716
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,811
All right, ladies, good night.

717
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,690

720
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,129
Count this money, baby.

(Beeping)

722
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,808
- What the fuck?
- Who's that?

723
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,611
Wee-Bey swinging me an emergency call.

724

No,no,no,no.

733
