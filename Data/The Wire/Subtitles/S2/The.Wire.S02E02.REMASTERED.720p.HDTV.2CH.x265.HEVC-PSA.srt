1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,300
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,804
Thirteen bodies, all female...

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,276
eleven White, two Asian-looking.

4
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:17,440
All between the ages of maybe 20, 30.
All very dead.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,245
From Eastern Europe probably.

6
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,546
So this is, what, an accident?

7
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:25,055
Your air pipe's up top, crushed.
Probably during the off-load.

8
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:27,421
So, yeah, accidental probably.

9
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:29,921
But that's his call, right?

10
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:34,525
- Doctor.
- Frazier.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,294
How're we doing here?

12
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:42,062
- How are we doing?
- I mean, what are we doing?

13
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:44,599
What's the plan with all this?

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,804
Is this your first
death investigation, Officer?

15
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:50,814
Russell. Yeah, first and onliest.

16
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,615
You got 13 for the price of one.

17
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:56,149
We're gonna start cutting this afternoon.

18
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:59,782
Anything you got by way of identifications
should come through my office.

19
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,052
What identification?

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,993
So far, we don't have
a passport or visa in the bunch.

21
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,259
Whatever you find in this luggage,
send it over...

22
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:10,824
or they're all going to the Anatomy Board
as Jane Does.

23
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,601
Who's the investigating agency?

24
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,180
If they were alive, they'd be illegals,
and that would mean lmmigration.

25
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:25,182
- But they're dead, so they're cargo.
- Cargo, but no contraband.

26
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:27,582
There's nothing to be seized
as a customs violation.

27
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,745
They're dead
on Port Authority property, right?

28
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,720
- Yeah.
- That's a state thing.

29
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,655
We'll eat it.

30
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,923
If it's accidental, then it's just about IDs
on these stowaways, right?

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,098
Good enough for me, brother.

32
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,258
No reason to open a full case folder
that I can see.

33
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,202
Wait a minute.
You CID guys are rolling out on this?

34
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,432
No crime, no investigation.

35
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:52,635
All you've got right here, Officer Russell,
is a lot of paperwork.

36
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,713
And then there was one.

37
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,123
- You don't have to do this.
- No?

38
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,488
Anything you're gonna say
I already said to Spiros.

39
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,754
You called him a Greek asshole?

40
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:29,932
You think we wanted this?

41
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:33,436
I don't know what the fuck
you people want and don't want.

42
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:38,135
All I know is, I got a can full of young girls
suffocating to death on my docks.

43
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,842
- This was a mistake.
- A mistake?

44
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:44,112
They fucking died in that can...

45
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:47,447
while this stupid son of a bitch sat there
with his dick in his hands.

46
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,918
You know nothing.

47
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:53,287
We understand you're upset, Frank.
We are upset, too, okay?

48
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:56,452
Sergei was supposed to wait
for our friend to come off the boat.

49
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,157
Our friend was supposed to tell us
that there was no problem...

50
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:01,926
you know, no Customs.

51
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:04,696
- He did not come off the boat.
- Why the fuck not?

52
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,271
This is what we're trying to find out.
We don't know.

53
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:10,933
Because you don't get the right message,
these girls are dying on my docks?

54
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,273
This is how it goes?
On my docks, this happened!

55
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:15,141
I understand how you feel...

56
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:18,307
but we're upset, too.
Everybody, we're all upset.

57
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,212
Nobody here wanted this.

58
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,447
Uncle Frank,
they're saying it wasn't on purpose.

59
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,753
You could've told me
there were girls in that fucking can.

60
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,387
You could've told me,
so I didn't just shove them back...

61
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,829
in the stacks like I did, right?

62
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:36,730
Why didn't you tell me
what was in that motherfucking can?

63
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,269
Now you want to know what's in the cans?

64
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,303
Before, you wanted to know nothing.
Now, you ask.

65
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,533
Guns, okay?

66
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:49,804
Drugs, whores, vodka, BMWs...

67
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,816
beluga caviar or bombs, maybe.

68
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:57,146
- Bad terrorists with big nuclear bombs.
- Boom.

69
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,525
I am kidding you, Frank, it's a joke.

70
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,356
But you don't ask...

71
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,293
because you don't want to know.

72
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,931
Tell the Greek that next time
he's got something breathing...

73
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:14,369
in one of them cans, I need to know it.

74
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,609
Give him a couple of days, you know?

75
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,411
So Roberto been caught?

76
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,249
Yep, DEA got him in New York.

77
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,890
Now the shit makes some sense.

78
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:09,552
The money we sent for the last go-round
came back. All of it.

79
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,959
Damn, they ain't gonna touch us now?

80
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,261
Goddamn Dominicans running around
scared acting like we the problem.

81
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:19,167
Roberto won't even see us.
Stringer had to go to the lawyer up there.

82
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,570
They saying they have to be sure
before they get back with us.

83
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:26,337
- They saying you only got seven years, so...
- So I'm a motherfucking snitch?

84
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,743
They ain't saying they think it.

85
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,677
They just don't know how
the Feds got to Roberto.

86
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,910
- So we on the outside.
- Yep.

87
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:35,920
Look...

88
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:39,580
we hanging on to them projects with scraps.

89
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:42,251
Avon, you gotta have somebody for us.

90
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,826
A friend in Atlanta...

91
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,495
owns a rim shop, name of Vargus.

92
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,535
Have Stringer fly down there tomorrow
and meet him.

93
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,176
You seen D'Angelo lately?

94
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,942
He on the J-tier, you know what I mean?

95
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:04,482
It's very difficult for me to get over there,
you know?

96
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:08,279
So you ain't checking on him,
and Donette's out and about.

97
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:12,513
- I don't know what's what anymore.
- Now, what's up with Donette?

98
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,615
I leave messages, she ain't call back.

99
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:17,320
She ain't had her ass down here
regular neither.

100
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,761
We need to tighten shit up, Avon.

101
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,992
She should be bringing his son by
every week.

102
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,897
Yeah, I'm gonna put Stringer on that, too.

103
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,470
After all he has done for us...

104
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,971
Dee needs to be cared for, Avon.

105
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,598
- Promises were made.
- I know.

106
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,337
He took the 20, he ain't complaining.

107
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,772
He is carrying a lot of weight for this family.

108
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:39,009
And we keeping him close.
Dee being cold toward me right now.

109
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:41,677
He in this motherfucker trying
to make adjustments and shit.

110
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,118
Adjustments?

111
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:44,986
Brianna...

112
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:49,125
you know damn well I ain't gonna let shit
happen to him, right?

113
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,370
- You got these off the boat?
- What, in winter?

114
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:03,239
In a couple of months. Fringe benefit.

115
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,736
Can't catch crabs in Homicide, right?

116
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,276
Except maybe
the occasional emergency room nurse...

117
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,939
every now and again.

118
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,749
- Need some air in here.
- Leave it.

119
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,288
I don't need the hassle if Rawls comes past.

120
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:27,024
You're not the run-of-the-mill
kind of asshole, are you?

121
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:30,568
- You're the special kind of asshole.
- I'm special, all right.

122
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,166
How long did it take you
to figure out the tide...

123
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,068
took that girl over the county line?

124
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,505
- Three hours.
- Three hours...

125
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,239
with your little harbor maps...

126
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:43,644
and your tide tables
just to stick Rawls with an extra body.

127
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,583
Never mind that you just fucked Cole
with a stone whodunit.

128
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:50,154
- That's collateral damage.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,924
Are you gonna waste that crab gut?

130
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,427
You're a pussy, besides, Jimmy.

131
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:19,809
- We need Omar, Jimmy.
- You see this.

132
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:23,520
- Thirteen girls?
- Yeah, I heard about it.

133
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,823
- Who caught it?
- It ain't ours.

134
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,325
Port police has jurisdiction over Patapsco.

135
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:33,659
Ain't gonna be a murder either,
so who gives a fuck?

136
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:36,734
Listen, Jimmy, I ain't got no case on Bird...

137
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:40,532
unless that crazy motherfucker
Omar testifies. You hear me?

138
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,039
It's time you show Bunk the love.

139
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,336
- You want love, you come and sit on my lap.
- Shit.

140
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,250
This pretty motherfucker
comes over and tells me...

141
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,017
the customs seal got broke on the dock
and I'm responsible.

142
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,558
Can you fucking believe that?

143
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,823
I seen the goddamn thing on the crane,
the seal's already broke.

144
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,261
Who got to it?

145
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:09,458
The crew probably.
Some goddamn ordinary seamen.

146
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,059
- What was it?
- Vodka, I think.

147
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,401
I ain't saying
we didn't squeeze a case or two...

148
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,104
but fuck it, Frank, the can was already open.

149
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:24,443
I didn't come to the union hall today
on the back of no bread truck.

150
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,985
I swear, Frank,
we grabbed a couple cases at the end...

151
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,016
after everyone of them
sailor boys damn near raped it.

152
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:34,922
- A couple of cases?
- Yeah, it was four.

153
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:41,527
- What the fuck is up with the police?
- What?

154
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,530
They're stroking tickets
on every fucking car.

155
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,515
"Rear tag not entirely visible?"

156
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,281
You got the tow bar set high.

157
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,922
"Emergency access blocked."
Are you kidding me?

158
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:11,962
We've been parking this side of the building
since the fucking ships had sails.

159
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:14,156
Come on, pal, what the fuck?

160
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,498
- It ain't me, it's my boss.
- Who's your boss?

161
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:21,731
- Valchek, Southeast district.
- Stan Valchek?

162
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,933
The district commander, yeah.

163
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:27,239
That sawed-off piece of shit.
Why the hell is he fucking with us?

164
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:30,246
Whatever it's about,
you definitely got the man's attention...

165
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:33,249
'cause word comes down
this morning from my shift lieutenant...

166
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,514
we're to ride past your union hall
twice a day and paper cars.

167
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:39,613
- You work for a gaping asshole.
- More than one actually.

168
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:42,955
We're not gonna put up with this shit,
we're gonna go downtown on it.

169
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:47,589
Take it all the way to the mayor's office,
I can't blame you, but leave me out of it.

170
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,865
It's chain of command.

171
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:54,697
I mean, I gotta live
with the son of a bitch, too, right?

172
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,482
- You can't tell me this place ain't clean.
- You talk when I say you can.

173
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:22,864
Who told you to decorate, nigger?

174
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,839
Cell look pretty fucked up to me.
What you calling clean?

175
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:33,240
- Man, I ain't done shit.
- Don't say that to me, motherfucker!

176
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,014
Pets, too?

177
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,943
No, you see, they plastic,
they got little motors and all, man.

178
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,656
Clean this shit before lock-down.

179
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,719
That's four in a row, bitch!

180
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:08,609
Wait here, this won't take long.

181
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:13,678
What do you want from me?
He's an E-rate and you're a "G."

182
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:16,845
He wants the ship, he gets the ship.
Seniority, Mims, seniority.

183
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:20,482
- There ain't no union without it, brother.
- Your sweetheart's out there.

184
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:21,718
Who?

185
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:26,590
I gotta go, Mims, I got to.

186
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:37,139
- Kind of empty in here.
- Everyone's working.

187
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,570
- You getting the message?
- The message?

188
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:44,944
I had people working on a window
for the nave up St. Casmir's since Easter...

189
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,278
you know that?

190
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,852
I took money from half a dozen
different people...

191
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,887
told them where it was gonna go.

192
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:54,356
- You tell Father Lewandowski?
- I was gonna surprise him.

193
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,486
Yeah, you surprised everybody.
Now there's one window too many, right?

194
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,962
Here's the thing, Father Lew says...

195
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,934
he could take another window
in the rectory on the second floor.

196
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:08,265
- Good for you.
- No, good for you, Frank.

197
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:12,973
You don't want my finger in your eye,
you better do what's right here.

198
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:15,445
What's right?

199
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:20,682
What's right would be for you
to come down here to my house...

200
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,686
like a decent human being
and ask a common courtesy.

201
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,382
But that's not you, it's not your way.

202
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,153
My old man always said
you were a half-ass punk...

203
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,852
over at Holy Redeemer as a kid.

204
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:34,523
My sister said you were a pain in the ass
pest at all them CYO dances...

205
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,759
where none of the girls
would even look at you.

206
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:39,837
Damn near everyone at the Point said
when you got your badge...

207
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:43,101
it was too much for anybody named Valchek
to have a patrolman's drag.

208
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,735
And sure enough, you've been
an official asshole every day since.

209
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,816
Fuck you! And your window!

210
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,698
Where are you gonna be?

211
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,795
I'm gonna go find some lunch
somewhere, maybe.

212
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,067
- Give me an hour, yeah?
- Yeah.

213
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:24,076
- What the fuck is this?
- A knot.

214
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,282
Why don't you just do bunny ears?

215
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,649
So what else we got?

216
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:35,385
Medics, clothes, bedrolls, that's it.

217
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:39,024
- Here's a letter, though.
- A letter? What language?

218
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,156
Who knows?
Same backwards-ass writing, though.

219
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,327
That's like Russian or something,
I'm telling you.

220
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,231
Can't figure the name or the address...

221
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,934
but the stamp says "Magyar" on it.

222
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:55,376
- Where's Magyar?
- What the hell do I look like, Rand McNally?

223
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,441
Which one of your detectives caught
all the dead girls?

224
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,781
Detectives? They're at the bar already.

225
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,046
These yours?

226
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:07,022
They chalked it up as an accidental
and dumped the paperwork on us.

227
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,491
She found them, she writes on it.

228
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,355
- I'm McNulty, City Marine Unit.
- Beatrice Russell.

229
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:17,491
- You got any IDs yet?
- No visas or passports.

230
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,334
A few scraps of paper,
but nothing to make sense of.

231
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:25,766
Russian alphabet on most of it.
You just curious?

232
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,276
- Yeah.
- Why?

233
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:31,806
Day before yesterday I fished out a Jane Doe
from near the bridge.

234
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,350
There's no missing person report on file.

235
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,155
We got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies.

236
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,688
- Mine was a murder.
- A murder, you're kidding me?

237
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,694
We got some photos,
if you wanna take a look.

238
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,358
I called the morgue this morning...

239
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:54,165
the only thing they can say
is the dental work isn't local.

240
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,761
Overseas, they think.

241
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,167
- Is that your girl?
- Think so.

242
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,537
Looks better here.

243
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:04,077
You got her in the water,
day before yesterday, out by the bridge?

244
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:06,844
0900 hours, by the Fort Armistead dock.

245
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,880
Why would you have a murdered girl
in the water...

246
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,616
and the rest of them are suffocating
in a can at Patapsco?

247
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,818
- What went wrong?
- Air pipe up top got crushed.

248
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,987
Happened when cargo shifted around,
most likely.

249
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:26,767
They had cargo up front of the container
with a false back after about 25 feet.

250
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:28,463
You had cartons stacked in front...

251
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:31,770
but a tight passage to a small door
in the false wall...

252
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,741
opens from the outside only.

253
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:40,116
- They're in here the whole trip?
- Probably not.

254
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,914
Once they're at sea,
there's usually someone in the crew...

255
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,012
who's in on it, you know, a shepherd.

256
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:48,957
He let's them out to eat, move around,
use the bathroom, whatever.

257
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:52,755
They were clawing at the wall for air.

258
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,389
That's what the medical examiner
said anyway.

259
00:18:56,267 --> 00:19:00,397
- Where's the air pipe?
- That's the hole. Pipe's up top.

260
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:04,540
You get a lot of stowaways?

261
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:08,043
Some. Usually it's Customs
or INS that finds them.

262
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:12,982
Most are Dominicans or Haitians,
or from that part of the world, anyway.

263
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:18,487
- Not so much from Europe?
- A bit more since 9I11, actually.

264
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,290
I think because people can't get in
on visas anymore...

265
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:23,622
like they used to. There you go.

266
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,596
Usually, if the shepherd is doing his job...

267
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,223
he tries to put a can like this
on bottom of the stack...

268
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,770
so they can pop it and the girls
just walk out on the floor of the hold.

269
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,633
Where was this one?

270
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,403
- Look.
- What?

271
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,877
- That look right to you?
- What do you mean?

272
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,910
- You said you were with the Marine Unit?
- Yeah.

273
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:53,684
What does the Marine Unit have to do
with a bunch of dead girls in a can?

274
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,019
Not a thing.

275
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,262
What do you want me to do?

276
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,767
You can go to Father Lew,
ask him to give Sobotka back his money.

277
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,335
Switch the windows, maybe.

278
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:08,735
You ever in your life
seen a priest give money back?

279
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,638
The guy pays for a window,
he gets a window.

280
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,210
I thought you had suction.

281
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,973
At City Hall, I got suction.
Down Annapolis, I got suction.

282
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,914
But who but the Pope has any drag
with the cardinal? Get over it.

283
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,042
How the fuck's he get
that kind of money anyway?

284
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:24,246
Now, that's a good question.

285
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,458
I mean, the whole I.B.S.
can't have 1,500 guys left in this town...

286
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,051
and there ain't 100 checkers.

287
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:34,393
They got the car ships coming in...

288
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,525
the roll-onlroll-off cargo
is keeping them afloat.

289
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,862
- That's all they got?
- Pretty much.

290
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,874
Past six months,
I.B.S. hired Bruce Dibiago's people...

291
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:47,001
to lobby for them down in Annapolis.

292
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:49,602
They've been good
with the political contributions.

293
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,409
They're throwing around a lot of cash.

294
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,450
- How can they?
- You tell me.

295
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:57,749
Dibiago does not come cheap.
This is real money we're talking.

296
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,324
You know what I think?

297
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,689
I think Francis Sobotka's into some dirt.

298
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:07,129
You're the cop, not me.

299
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,727
The Grainery?

300
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:20,169
So I hear Burrell's gonna be
the next police commissioner.

301
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,069
Yeah, I've seen worse.

302
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:35,214
See, if it's crushed by another container,
it should've been one single movement...

303
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,920
maybe two if something shifts,
and then shifts back again.

304
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:41,362
This looks like someone has been pounding
on it in a bunch of spots.

305
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,558
See?

306
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,627
Before I rule it, I wanna go down
with a metallurgist to be sure.

307
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:49,768
But yeah, from the look of it...

308
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:54,641
you just bought yourself 13 homicides.
Congratulations.

309
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,010
If the commissioner
goes down to Washington, it's you, right?

310
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,987
That's for the mayor to decide.
I'd have to clear the council, too.

311
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,650
If the mayor wants you,
that's not much of a problem.

312
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,251
You been around as long as me,
you make a few enemies.

313
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:15,594
What, the First District guys?
They're not gonna start nothing.

314
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,897
- They're pushing Shipley.
- See, that's racist.

315
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:23,362
You know, it personally offends me
that anybody would reach down past you...

316
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:27,171
to elevate some colonel
just because he happens to be white.

317
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:29,459
You know what I'm gonna do?

318
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:32,311
I'm gonna get on the phone
and call my friends at the Hall.

319
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,941
That'll bring the First District in line.

320
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:36,451
That's very kind.

321
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:40,490
And what if anything is there
that I can do for you, Maj. Valchek?

322
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:44,490
Funny you should ask. I need a detail.

323
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:49,157
CID people mostly, though I can spare
some bodies out of my district, too.

324
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,291
What for?

325
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:54,201
I got some guys in the Southeast
that are showing a lot of money.

326
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,569
- Port guys, longshoremen.
- I.B.S.?

327
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:59,199
I'm not talking about going after
the whole union.

328
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,710
Just a couple of guys in one local
that look fat.

329
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:04,212
Drugs, maybe, or the usual thieving.

330
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:07,611
- Frank Sobotka, you heard the name?
- No.

331
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:11,315
And I'm not saying the problem
even goes past him.

332
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:14,850
- What's he to you?
- To me?

333
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,185
He's an asshole.

334
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,725
Six men for six weeks.

335
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,999
Rawls will pick them.

336
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,265
You ordered more than you ate.

337
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,576
It's cold out here.

338
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:45,552
Cedric, I shouldn't have brought it up again,
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:55,157
You're right. You're always right.

340
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,896
I'm just saying you have to be realistic.

341
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:02,234
You did what you did,
and now you are where you are.

342
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,939
In the basement.

343
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:11,179
If they buried you any deeper,
you'd be under the damn building.

344
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:12,579
Burrell won't be there forever.

345
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:16,710
Burrell is going to be the next
police commissioner, and you know it.

346
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,182
But you've got the law degree.

347
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,624
With your police experience, half a dozen
firms would think you're a prize.

348
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,423
You've got options.

349
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,597
- Just because they don't...
- You're right.

350
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,602
I'll put in my papers.

351
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,259
- Who wants breakfast?
- Christ, it's about time.

352
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,885
Lucky's was closed.
I had to go to the metro.

353
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:03,190
I thought Mutt be working North Point
today. He like them Ro-ro ships.

354
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,031
No, his wife is having some kind of
operation, so he gave back his hours.

355
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,936
- Who got them?
- New Charles works for Mutt.

356
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:12,567
Yo, Zig. You working today?

357
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,408
No, came down here to have breakfast
with you duper-faced fucks.

358
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,278
Most important goddamn meal
of the goddamn day, right?

359
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:23,444
- Set them up, Dolores, Zig is thirsty.
- That's right, I'm thirsty.

360
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:28,415
You know what?
Bottoms up, you ugly whores.

361
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,404
- Nick.
- What's up?

362
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:46,906
Come here.

363
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:54,111
- I got a line on something.
- Oh, yeah?

364
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:57,014
You know White Mike
from down Curtis Bay?

365
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:01,557
- He's gonna stake me to a package.
- A package?

366
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,389
Dope, Nicky, dope.

367
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:09,627
I got work today, Zig.

368
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,534
Yeah, and I'm gonna make as much money
not working. You see what I'm saying?

369
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:17,437
- So why the fuck you coming to me?
- I want you to come in on it with me.

370
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,204
You bring a little cash as money down,
my man might give us a bigger package.

371
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,212
We turn it around, we both get paid.

372
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:25,680
All right, ship's in, gentlemen.

373
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:28,651
- Fuck that shit, Zig.
- Time to work!

374
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,388
- Nicky, come on, man.
- Can I ride with you?

375
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:36,092
Will you think about it?

376
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:41,294
Dolores, can I get another shot?

377
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,284
- What's up?
- DWI checkpoint.

378
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:13,727
Step out of the car for a Breathalyzer.

379
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,292
It's 8:00 in the goddamn morning.

380
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:23,133
Who the fuck gets drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?

381
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:32,112
Bill, I'm not arguing
that the jurisdiction's not technically ours.

382
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:36,448
Patapsco's definitely Port Authority property
and the Port Police have the jurisdiction.

383
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,112
- That's not in dispute here.
- Good.

384
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,520
But they're not equipped
for a death investigation.

385
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:43,957
You dump 13 bodies on them,
you're dumping them on us.

386
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:47,360
MSP is gonna have to pick up that slack,
overburdened as we are.

387
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:51,127
Robbie, I have fought and scratched
and clawed for four months...

388
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:53,567
to get my clearance rate up above 50%...

389
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,697
and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%.

390
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:59,241
Do you happen to know
what my clearance rate will be...

391
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,106
if I take 13 whodunits off your hands?

392
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,648
- 39.4%.
- Bill, like I told you...

393
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:09,183
We did not get to be colonels
by being complete fucking idiots, right?

394
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:15,247
Robbie, you poor bastard,
you look like you need a cup of coffee.

395
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:06,639
The man is a god.

396
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,880
Big chief.

397
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:25,323
I gotta get him back to maximum security
by 6:00, all right?

398
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:27,329
Yeah. Come on in, man.

399
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,867
Here, sit down.
Fix yourself something to eat, man.

400
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,564
- No, man, I ain't hungry, I ate.
- What?

401
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:38,340
You crazy, this is good shit, man.

402
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:40,535
- Better get in this.
- No.

403
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,215
Look, man...

404
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:49,049
if he tearing your room down, man...

405
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:51,121
we keep bringing more stuff in.

406
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:54,554
It's gonna get so he can't tear it down
fast enough. You feel me?

407
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:56,523
He fucked with my fish though, I don't...

408
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,788
He ain't have to go there, man.

409
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:02,491
- What's up with this motherfucker?
- You remember Ladontay?

410
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,664
Burner from over the Poe Homes?

411
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:07,293
Caught him over at Carver parking lot
after school?

412
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:08,928
We did that?

413
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,906
Tilghman was Ladontay's cousin
or some such.

414
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,501
He found out I ate the charge,
he busting my chops.

415
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:18,809
Ladontay? I can't even remember that one.

416
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,112
You need a scorecard
to keep up with your lethal ass.

417
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:24,619
Avon, he fixing to stay in my shit.

418
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:27,919
Listen. I'm gonna talk to him, all right?

419
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:31,153
I'm gonna set it straight. All right?

420
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:35,589
- What's his name again?
- Tilghman, he work the dayshift on J-tier.

421
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:38,100
I seen him around.

422
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:41,000
Man, all these CO's are fronting and shit.

423
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,471
You got the guards bringing your meals in.

424
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:46,771
This punk motherfucker Tilghman
running around acting righteous...

425
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:50,040
but he bringing shit in here,
steady slinging on the side.

426
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:52,411
Don't fret. All right?

427
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,281
It's nothing. I'm gonna take care of it.

428
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:58,980
The city won't take it?

429
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,286
No, it's Port Authority property.
It's state jurisdiction.

430
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,293
So it's MSP out of Pikesville.

431
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,590
Case needs real murder police.

432
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:09,488
You don't give a shit.
Just wanna fuck Rawls, don't you?

433
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,534
Absolutely. What can you give me?

434
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:16,334
- This is about fucking over your boss?
- If they don't eat the cases, then you will.

435
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,341
What do you need?

436
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:21,138
First of all,
how big was the false compartment?

437
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:26,640
13 by 7 by 7.

438
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:31,853
Okay, we got 13 adult females,
breathing at a normal to elevated rate...

439
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:38,755
that's 0.25 liters of oxygen per minute...

440
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,088
per victim.

441
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:43,728
- He's a doctor?
- A State Bureau of Mines.

442
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:46,029
- Minds?
- Mines.

443
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,312
Officer Tilghman,
could I parlay with you for a moment?

444
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,081
- Barksdale, right?
- Yeah.

445
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:08,324
- Listen, I want to know if you can help me...
- No.

446
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:12,090
- Pardon me?
- I said, no, motherfucker.

447
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,733
Off the steps.

448
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:45,291
What the fuck are you up to now?

449
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:55,260
You're deep into somebody's shit, McNulty.
I can tell.

450
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:01,806
This is bullshit.

451
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,345
Those computations were checked...

452
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:05,642
and confirmed by
the medical examiner's office.

453
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:08,775
They're accurate for time of death
to within a three-hour window.

454
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,114
Yeah, so you say.

455
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,280
Your man in the Marine Unit
did the measurements on the container.

456
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,086
I happen to know my man
in the Marine Unit intimately...

457
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:18,718
and he's, without a doubt,
the most swollen asshole...

458
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:21,059
in American law enforcement.

459
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,532
I am not eating 13 murders. No, sir.

460
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,565
If they were already dead
when the container hit the dock...

461
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:30,264
then they were murdered on board ship.

462
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:31,966
That means Baltimore County...

463
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:34,305
or Anne Arundel
on the other side of the bridge...

464
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:38,575
and if they're further down the bay, then you
fellows with the Coast Guard can take it.

465
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:40,741
This is not a city problem.

466
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,618
Talk amongst yourselves.
One of you is taking this case home tonight.

467
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:47,849
No, Bill.

468
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,687
The Atlantic Light passed the Key Bridge
at 2300 hours...

469
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,762
and laid up at anchor,
2,000 yards off Patapsco...

470
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:56,491
until 0600 hours, when it docked.

471
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:01,268
- By the map, that's Baltimore city.
- And that put the ship in your jurisdiction...

472
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,431
for the three-hour window
for the time of death.

473
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,136
Bill, you look like
you could use a good cup of coffee.

474
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,487
Mikey.

475
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:00,085
- What's up?
- No.

476
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,655
No, what?

477
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,630
No way, you little rat-faced piece of shit.

478
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,929
You fucked up the last two packages
I gave you.

479
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:08,334
Mikey, look man, that wasn't me.

480
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:10,899
You got money, Zig,
you can buy a little weight.

481
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,533
You got no money, go fuck yourself.

482
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:16,675
Mike, I thought we was friends.

483
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,374
Did you fuck up the last two packages?

484
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:22,478
- Sort of.
- Are you beat to shit?

485
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:25,414
- No.
- Take a walk, my friend.

486
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,513
- What's up, man?
- What's up, playboy?

487
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,925
That thing in Atlanta, settled for now.

488
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:04,926
So we got that, you know.

489
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:07,519
Good. I ain't call you down for that, man.

490
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:10,825
Called you down here 'cause we got a CO
in here with some bullshit.

491
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,834
- Who?
- Name is Tilghman.

492
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:16,599
He kin to that boy that Wee-Bey
dusted down over in that school lot.

493
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,931
He can't let go of that shit, neither.

494
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,203
Tilghman? Right.

495
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,940
Listen, Brianna reminded me, man.
We got promises we got to keep.

496
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,607
I know, I heard.

497
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,786
You need to get with Dee's girl.

498
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:37,018
Have her bring that young one
down here regular.

499
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,425
She need to step up
and do her fucking part.

500
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:40,826
All right.

501
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,829
How's Dee taking it?

502
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:48,060
I mean, he gonna do
what need to be done, man.

503
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:51,402
You know what I'm saying?
Dee need a little help every now and again.

504
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:53,874
You're not out of reach
or nothing like that, right?

505
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:57,071
- No, nothing like that.
- You sure?

506
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:02,614
- He's carrying a lot of weight for us, man.
- Stringer, he's family, man.

507
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,520
All right? He's family.

508
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:11,589
Come on, Jimmy. Take it to the head, baby.

509
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,994
Come on. Tell her you were first in line.

510
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:18,901
That's it.

511
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,128
There it is.

512
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,703
- One more, baby, come on.
- There you go.

513
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:25,866
- That's enough.
- No.

514
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,640
You gotta do all 14 of them bad boys...

515
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:32,112
one for every member of the dear family
you gave to Cole.

516
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:37,476
Here's to Ray Cole, a fine detective,
and a goodly man.

517
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:44,783
Jimmy, the look on Jay Landsman's face.
He nearly fucking cried.

518
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,691
And Rawls!

519
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:51,960
Rawls, I swear to God,
the man stayed in his office all day.

520
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:55,799
All afternoon.
He just stayed there with the door closed.

521
00:37:56,406 --> 00:38:00,900
- Careful, you're giving me an erection.
- Come on now.

522
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:04,572
Motherfucker, you have outdone yourself
this time.

523
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,912
You ain't never coming back from this,
you know that.

524
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:11,010
Lester, what the fuck can they do to me
they haven't done?

525
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:13,089
I'm riding the goddamn boat.

526
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,424
Fuck it, I don't give a shit.
Here's to Jane Doe 13.

527
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,396
All right.

528
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,033
Eleven more years of whatever bullshit
they throw at me.

529
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:31,607
I'm gonna put in my papers,
take the pension and walk.

530
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,901
Eleven's a long time to be on the shelf.

531
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:39,277
Tell me about it, Mr. 13 years.

532
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:40,940
And four months.

533
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:45,248
Fuck it.

534
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:48,986
Chew you up, they gotta spit you back out.

535
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:56,129
- Fourteen.
- He did it.

536
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,500
Fuck.

537
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:02,432
Easy, motherfucker,
I ain't picking up that shit.

538
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:03,836
Go that way.

539
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:09,243
- Man, anybody still in there?
- They're keeping La-la.

540
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,837
He had an old warrant on him.

541
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:15,941
- For what?
- I don't know. Some traffic shit, man.

542
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,387
The bondsman's inside,
trying to get it all figured out.

543
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,390
Man, what the fuck
was this all about anyway?

544
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:26,121
- Jerking us around on the way to work.
- It's a beef I got with a police boss.

545
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,290
- Charlie Valchek's little pissant brother.
- You gotta get that taken care of, man.

546
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,927
- I mean, this shit is out of hand.
- I'm gonna take care of it.

547
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:36,605
Yeah, y'all need a lift?

548
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,702
- I'll see you.
- All right, talk to you.

549
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:44,703
That runt wants a war, he's got one.

550
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:51,352
Not supposed to be talking anyway.

551
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:55,451
- Bunk, Lester.
- Yeah.

552
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,560
You two winners are on the Jane Does.

553
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:03,722
What? We're not up, Jay.

554
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,534
We caught that double in Pimlico last week.

555
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:08,365
Cole's gonna take the double.

556
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:11,736
- You two got pussy in a can.
- Jay, that ain't right.

557
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:14,066
You know what ain't right?

558
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:18,709
Our squad has a negative clearance rate
for the year. A negative rate.

559
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:29,448
Now, I'm not saying
Ray Cole isn't a good detective.

560
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:33,495
But I need those 14 cases to go black...

561
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,861
so I got my best people on it.

562
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:38,992
Ray.

563
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:45,968
Lay it on them.

564
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:49,568
Name and number of the port cop
who processed the scene.

565
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:55,047
And the best of luck to you
in all your future endeavors, Detectives.

566
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,649
Motherfucker.

567
00:40:57,754 --> 00:41:00,416
Beatrice Russell. She pretty at least?

568
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:12,225
Last night, you're too drunk to fuck.
Today, you're too hung over.

569
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,770
What's the most useless thing on a woman?

570
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:22,401
- What?
- A drunken lrishman.

571
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:27,241
But you're not really lrish, are you?

572
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,652
I had 14 shots of Jameson.
How's that for green?

573
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,654
You're green, all right.

574
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:36,683
You're also an idiot. Who does 14 shots?

575
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:40,853
You're a child, McNulty.

576
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,905
Show up at my door at 2:00 a.m. again
without invitation...

577
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,101
- I will call the cops.
- Why would you wanna do that?

578
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:57,939
Jimmy.

579
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:06,021
Am I your girlfriend? No. Your wife? No.
Your soul mate? No.

580
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,585
What the fuck am I, Jimmy?

581
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,121
We're good together.

582
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:21,265
Answer the question.

583
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:26,965
I've been pretty honest with you.

584
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:30,979
My wife wants to put it back together again,
I'm gonna go for it, right?

585
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,513
You know, what with the kids and all...

586
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:45,420
You got any aspirin?

587
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:49,832
For Christ's sake, Ronnie, I'm dying in here.

588
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:08,235
A real police department
would have an elevator.

589
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:14,839
So you Russell? Bunk Moreland.

590
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:17,342
Lester Freamon.

591
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,451
I'm still on hold with the Coast Guard,
Delaware River Detachment.

592
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,889
What do we know?

593
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:27,088
Atlantic Light is in Philly,
heading for Port of Elizabeth tonight.

594
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,564
- I'm trying to get them to hold her.
- Anyone from your CID working this?

595
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:33,830
Nope. I heard there's a big argument
over jurisdiction...

596
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,167
and your colonel made everybody mad.

597
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:39,207
- All you get is me.
- Still on hold?

598
00:44:41,477 --> 00:44:43,877
We can call this in from the road.

599
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,715
You're with City Homicide?

600
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,017
- You must know Jimmy McNulty.
- Yeah, he's dead to us.

601
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:17,769
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.

602
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,075
I've seen worse.

603
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:22,583
It's leased by the Highway Authority,
but we can use it for an off-site.

604
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:24,812
- Furnace work?
- It does.

605
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,479
And the phone lines.

606
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:29,922
You'll need window units
if you're here come summer...

607
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:31,584
but somehow I got a feeling...

608
00:45:31,694 --> 00:45:35,289
that you gents will put together a case
quicker than that.

609
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:37,157
Now, this here...

610
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,502
is my district investigator,
Roland Pryzbylewski.

611
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:46,268
Kid's a prodigy.
Anything you need from me, you go to him.

612
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:51,203
Gentlemen, the target is Frank Sobotka...

613
00:45:51,314 --> 00:45:54,181
and anyone Frank Sobotka
does his dirt with.

614
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,815
Roland will fill you in on the details.
Good hunting.

615
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,423
So who signs the overtime slips?

616
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,301
Son of a bitch.
You are a fucking thief, aren't you?

617
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,837
- This is where our taxes go.
- I do good work, don't I?

618
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,566
Let's get it on the fucking can now.

619
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,574
Horseface, you son of a bitch.

620
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:26,243
Christ, I'm gonna bust the only nut I got left.

621
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:30,181
Ain't no heavier than the pallets
we usually handle.

622
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,153
Finishing touch, boys.

623
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,071
Bon voyage.

624
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,573
There she goes.

625
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:17,955
This area's restricted. Yes, sir, no problem.

626
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,953
- Amir, why don't we sail?
- They're holding the ship.

627
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,050
- Who?
- Coast Guard, the Americans.

628
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:46,185
Why?

629
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,474
Fuck, Sergei, you almost break my hand.

630
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,554
Bring him up!

631
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,406
- Have a good day, Officer.
- Okay, I'll see you.

632
00:49:58,728 --> 00:49:59,888
Now get up in there.

633
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,191
Last call before lock-down.

634
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,267
Make it snappy now.

635
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,972
- How you like that?
- It's good, baby, it's beautiful.

636
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,744
Nice. Smooth.

637
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:17,210
Most def, man.

638
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,042
Man, watch your back, be good, baby.

639
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:29,753
- What up, man?
- Yeah, he left that in here.

640
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:32,555
It's his.

641
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:36,322
- So how you doing?
- All right.

642
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:37,924
Yeah?

643
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:42,464
Me and you gonna need to talk.

644
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:23,545
- So who's on board?
- Thirty-eight in the crew, 14 are Yemeni.

645
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:24,943
Eight are Sri Lankan.

646
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:28,949
There are five Filipinos and the rest
are from here, there, and back again.

647
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:33,416
- Anybody speak English?
- What you're asking them about...

648
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:36,423
I'll be amazed if any of them
manages a word.

649
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:41,727
- Where's your captain?
- At the Coast Guard office.

650
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:45,129
Angry as hell because we're due
on a New Jersey pier tomorrow morning.

651
00:51:45,234 --> 00:51:46,667
You ain't gonna make it.

652
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:51,297
I gotta tell you, every day that you hold us
costs the shipping agent $100,000.

653
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:55,673
- The Atlantic Light is a huge enterprise.
- The Atlantic Light is a crime scene.

654
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:59,406
Don't try to play tough guy.

655
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,544
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

656
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:05,250
Talk to me!

657
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,487
Tell me what I need to know.

658
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:17,324
Get him up.

659
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:24,971
- Talk about the girls.
- No girls, nothing.

660
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:26,605
No English.

661
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:29,945
You no speak English,
but you know how to run?

662
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,046
Why you run from ship?

663
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,348
What the fuck that suppose to mean?

664
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:46,993
They got him in Philadelphia.

665
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:50,224
He jumped when he found out
the Coast Guard was gonna hold the ship.

666
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,201
- What is he?
- Sergei says he looks like an Arab.

667
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:07,746
He don't know nothing.

668
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:11,216
But you kept hitting him anyway.

669
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,445
Get his clothes.

670
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:26,734
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have one.

671
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:49,616
- Come on, let's talk.
- No English.

672
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,986
Tell me what happened to the girls?

673
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:58,393
No speak.

674
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,265
What then? What do you speak?

675
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,232
Come on, talk to me, friend.

676
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:24,620
Turkish?

677
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,494
You got that little hook on your nose.

678
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:31,763
Don't worry, patrioti.

679
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:36,795
I got nothing against the Turks.
That's the old world. This is the new.

680
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:43,405
Sam.

681
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,542
- I don't know nothing about...
- You know.

682
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:52,386
And you're going to tell me about it, too.
After that...

683
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:55,120
you're done, I give you my word.

684
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,630
We popped the can to let them take a bath.

685
00:55:06,368 --> 00:55:08,063
Get some fresh air.

686
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:14,732
You gotta understand, my crew,
they pulling on their pootsos for weeks.

687
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:18,638
These girls, they looked pretty good.

688
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:22,515
- Katalavenis?
- Yes.

689
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,677
The men had cash to spend.

690
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:30,258
I admit it, I saw chance for business,
but that was all.

691
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:31,826
What happened?

692
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:36,758
One of the puttanas decided
she didn't want to be a puttana no more.

693
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:40,527
This one guy got rough with her.
The whore died.

694
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:44,538
The other ones saw.
I didn't know what to do.

695
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:49,571
- You kill one, then you kill them all.
- No, that was another man.

696
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:51,509
Another man, what man?

697
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:53,938
The one girl...

698
00:55:54,783 --> 00:55:56,512
they saw, they knew.

699
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:07,490
Relax.

700
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:10,559
I gave you my word.

701
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:36,182
- Watch your shoes.
- Goddamn Turko.

702
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,754
Bleeds like a lamb.

703
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:45,696
In a year, each whore would bring
a quarter million. What is it?

704
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:47,564
$4 million.

705
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:48,894
Gone.

706
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:50,998
Malaka.

707
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,808
Anyway, there will be other girls.

708
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,209
This one...

709
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:01,339
no fingerprints.

710
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,285
- No face.
- That's not a problem.
