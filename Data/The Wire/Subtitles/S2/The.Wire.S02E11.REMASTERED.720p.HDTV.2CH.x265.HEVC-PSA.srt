Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,913
Wake up, Baltimore. It's 6:00 a.m....

3
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,219
Police!

4
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:42,867
Ready?

5
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,609
Freeze, FBI!

6
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,440
- All clear.
- Check upstairs.

7
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,379
Turn around.

8
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:58,279
Put your hands up. Behind your neck.

9
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:01,250
Keep them there.

10
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:20,936
No, nothing here. All clear.

11
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:55,040
All clear.

12
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:08,359
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.

13
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,257
Ain't got shit on me.

14
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,826
Fuck! You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you. Nothing!

15
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,366
Move, shitbird.

16
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,523
FBI, show me your hands!

17
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,466
Get down, fuck! Get down!

18
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:04,874
Nice.

19
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,057
Bingo.

20
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:27,838
- From behind your clothes washer.
- That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.

21
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,283
And on today's Chip Franklin Show
at noon...

22
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,843
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall
asking local retailers:

23
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,287
"What do you get
for the guy who has everything?"

24
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,359
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.

25
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,894
The Orioles continue to...

26
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,946
- We could take him now.
- Not enough profile.

27
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,785
Fucking feds.

28
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,914
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.

29
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,467
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?

30
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:17,433
The text message that told him to clean up,
it came from someone higher up.

31
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,805
Someone we don't know.

32
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,004
We leave him on the street
after these raids...

33
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,604
he'll probably make contact
with whoever's above him.

34
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:26,343
Either another text message or a meet.

35
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,577
What's with George Glekas?

36
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:31,417
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.

37
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:36,521
- Chester Karol Sobotka?
- It's Frank Sobotka's kid.

38
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:39,925
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?

39
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,499
Why? What for?

40
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,558
We hit the store this morning.

41
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,638
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.

42
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:49,832
So we go over to his house a half hour later
with the warrant...

43
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:54,436
and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations
looking at us like we're braindeads.

44
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,048
Homicide, Shea.

45
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,745
- This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,686
Who caught the Highlandtown murder
the night before last?

47
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,451
Jay Landsman, sir.

48
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,188
I'll be right over.

49
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,531
Go get the interviews started.

50
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,783
- Lieutenant?
- Hey, Lt.

51
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,623
What the fuck is that about?

52
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,935
How did we do this morning?

53
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,072
Eton and Sergei are in. So is the madam.

54
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,002
Glekas, I'm not sure.

55
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:01,709
- The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
- What are they waiting for?

56
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,071
You don't wanna know.

57
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,674
Jesus, Larry...

58
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:09,220
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out
to a criminal lawyer real quick.

59
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,482
If the union guys can't handle this mess...

60
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,490
he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.

61
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:16,152
- Do you have any details?
- I don't know nothing...

62
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,855
except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.

63
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:21,762
- That's the only time?
- Visiting hours, yeah.

64
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,892
Look, everything's gonna be fine.

65
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:37,338
- FBI! All of you move, now!
- What the fuck is this?

66
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,310
- FBI, move!
- Against the wall.

67
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,548
He's here.

68
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,858
Got another problem here, Larry.

69
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,003
Big man on the docks.

70
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,976
You don't look so big now, do you?

71
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:50,578
Ma.

72
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:13,868
Pop.

73
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:29,723
It's gone.

74
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:32,791
And the money, too.

75
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,794
They say you need to come in.

76
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,730
They said the warrant
is at Southeastern police district.

77
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,609
They're out there now.

78
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:51,975
Showtime, Franky.

79
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,531
- Frank.
- Sir, any comment?

80
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,358
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?

81
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,766
What's your comment
on the charges being brought against you?

82
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,440
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?

83
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:20,306
How will you answer
the charges against you?

84
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:25,608
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working
all these dead girls for?

85
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,184
The Homicide unit, right?

86
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:31,153
The same Homicide unit that can't put
two and two together and pick up a phone...

87
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,919
leaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later
in The Baltimore Sun.

88
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:45,135
- What did you take from the scene?
- Photos, latents, spent casings.

89
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,607
Fuck.

90
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,236
They cleaned everything else?

91
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,071
Even for a supremely
fucked-up police department...

92
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:58,945
this takes the prize.

93
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,122
How'd the kid play it?

94
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,852
He signed a full statement.

95
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:13,362
He said that there was an argument
about a stolen car or two.

96
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,399
Think he'll open up and talk more?

97
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,559
He's been processed and assigned a PD.

98
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:21,969
If you want to take a run at the kid,
you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.

99
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,841
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. It's my bad.

100
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,183
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?

101
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,146
What's your name?

102
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,358
State your name.

103
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,404
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.

104
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,606
There is your name.

105
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,540
State your name.

106
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,682
No name?

107
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,417
- For now, we'll just call you Boris.
- Boris.

108
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,224
Why always "Boris"?

109
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:24,033
Racketeering. Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.

110
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:27,263
Conspiracy to violate
federal customs statutes.

111
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:28,839
White slavery.

112
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,941
Today we're only charging
the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.

113
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,814
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

114
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:45,553
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.

115
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,981
Help my union?

116
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:54,298
For 25 years,
we've been dying slow down there.

117
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,500
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.

118
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,768
My friends and their kids,
like we got the cancer.

119
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:06,503
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.

120
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,071
And now you wanna help us?

121
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,376
Help me?

122
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,351
- What's your full name?
- Michael McArdle.

123
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,188
- White Mike.
- Yeah, that's right.

124
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,556
Listen to this, Mikey.

125
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:26,220
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

126
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:28,526
dropped that body on Potee Street
the other night.

127
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,193
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with a Greek-ass name...

128
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:34,066
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

129
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,606
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

130
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,676
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

131
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:43,442
We hit your suppliers.

132
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,778
They cleaned up
and left you holding the dirt.

133
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,876
- Suppliers of what?
- You discussed a drug buy on this tape.

134
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,751
We also have photographs
tying you to your stash house...

135
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:55,883
and putting you at The Greek's warehouse
over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.

136
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,726
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.

137
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,910
- What's the plan?
- This is just a detention hearing, Frank.

138
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:17,743
You're not a flight risk,
you have no meaningful priors.

139
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:20,283
And so far they've only hit you
with one count.

140
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,252
The magistrate's gonna ask us
some basic questions.

141
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,822
Barring anything unforeseen,
you're out in an hour.

142
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,586
- I said nothing to them suits.
- All the better.

143
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:33,486
- This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
- The dope.

144
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:35,924
He's what, Greek?

145
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,468
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.

146
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:43,735
- And what about the guy they call Sergei?
- Sergei's straight muscle.

147
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:48,069
- Look, I need something to eat.
- Okay, what do you want?

148
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,171
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.

149
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:54,048
I'd fuck the order up.

150
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,278
It's gotta be strawberry?

151
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,190
Hook a brother up.

152
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,833
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.

153
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,961
It's all right.

154
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,238
Been what, a year?

155
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:25,739
Boy, you don't know,
I been dreaming of running into you again.

156
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,444
You got a focus. I give you that.

157
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,555
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?

158
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,214
I think you've done enough.

159
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:36,259
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.

160
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,727
He in jail now forever and a day.

161
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:43,058
Stinkum? I mean, you closed the book
on that nigger your damn self.

162
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,865
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.

163
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,936
Leaving you.

164
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,567
- You looking for closure?
- Lookit, man, ain't no closure.

165
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,514
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave
and come up in this room right now.

166
00:16:57,615 --> 00:17:01,312
See, all I know is whoever did him that way,
they gets got.

167
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:05,681
Whoever did him that way,
they still out there right now.

168
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,415
So now you gonna play like
you had nothing to do with it.

169
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,084
No, I can't lie.

170
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,529
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.

171
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,460
Anything after that, part of the game.

172
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:20,966
Maybe. But see,
I went past that with Brandon.

173
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,105
That wasn't me. That wasn't Avon, either.

174
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,980
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:

175
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,241
all that cigarette shit...

176
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,977
all that bullshit with the eyes.

177
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:39,454
See now, this man,
he building a rep for himself...

178
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,654
and he wants you bad.

179
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:45,053
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.

180
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:49,332
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker
from out of...

181
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:50,492
NYC?

182
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:52,861
Yeah, small dude.

183
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,107
What he go by?

184
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,168
Brother Mouzone.

185
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,844
I know you heard of him, right?

186
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:08,447
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...

187
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:11,613
I might be able to point you
in that direction.

188
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,180
Why?

189
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:16,585
What happened to your boy was business.

190
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,829
But how that shit happened,
you got the right to take that to heart.

191
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,127
I figure that'll make us even.

192
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,431
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?

193
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,402
- We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
- I gotta see my son.

194
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,274
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.

195
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,541
Not now, I need to get clean.

196
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:41,945
Sergei and them...

197
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,917
they did Mau Mau Willis.

198
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,993
- Why'd they chill him?
- He was welshing on the Jew.

199
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:53,393
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.

200
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:56,932
- Who's above those two, Mike?
- I don't know.

201
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,597
- You don't know?
- Never did wanna know.

202
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,015
God in heaven, Zig,
the cops do that to you?

203
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,055
Ain't the cops.

204
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:32,834
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.

205
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,737
I'm trying.

206
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,234
You know I'm trying, right?

207
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,509
- What happened?
- I don't know.

208
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:47,849
I got tired.

209
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:54,417
I got tired of being the punchline
to every joke.

210
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:02,392
You had problems,
you could've come to me.

211
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,627
You could've said something.

212
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:07,837
You wouldn't have heard.

213
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,166
You were always too busy
dredging up the canal.

214
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:16,172
Making sure the right bum got elected.

215
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:19,616
Buying another round for the house.

216
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:29,955
I always used to think you were working
all them hours you spent away.

217
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,919
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.

218
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:37,262
For you, for your mother.

219
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:41,662
I bet you didn't even tell her
I was in here, did you?

220
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:43,740
Maybe you did...

221
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:48,011
and she already took three Nembutals,
sleeping the day away.

222
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:52,575
- Leave her out of this.
- She's out of it, don't worry.

223
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:58,655
Pop...

224
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,319
when I seen what I did
to that kid down at the store...

225
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,625
it made me sick to my stomach.

226
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,492
- That ain't you, Zig.
- It ain't?

227
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:17,670
Because the same blood
don't flow for us, Pop.

228
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,300
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.

229
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:24,046
You're more like me than you know.

230
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:29,644
You're a Sobotka.

231
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,250
Fucked is what I am.

232
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,773
What the fuck can I say?

233
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:22,204
Best progress so far
is "White Mike" McArdle.

234
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,001
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.

235
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:28,169
We're gonna get Pearlman in today
to see what she can do to step him off.

236
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,180
Also, we're still hunting
the Sobotka nephew.

237
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:32,940
Herc and Carver are on that.

238
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,917
Still, my guess is the drug players...

239
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:40,055
even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.

240
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:43,793
The case gets thin when we get up to this...

241
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,191
Spiros Vondopoulos.

242
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,664
Boy, them Greeks
and those twisted-ass names.

243
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,133
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.

244
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,067
Yeah? Ass-fucking, too.

245
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:56,906
What exactly do we know
about Vondopoulos?

246
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,909
We should stay on him, see who he really is.

247
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,577
How about it?

248
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,007
Throw us a few
of your well-equipped surveillance teams?

249
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:09,044
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant,
I'm the only fed still in the room.

250
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,951
The US attorney has what he wants
with the union guys...

251
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:15,617
which means my field office
is pretty much over this case.

252
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:18,691
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.

253
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,763
I'm sorry for him...

254
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,302
and for you.

255
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,007
We should've paid more attention
to our own.

256
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:35,506
Like I could've stopped Ziggy
from what he'd done.

257
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,240
Like anyone could ever control him.

258
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,579
I was thinking of my boy, too.

259
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,247
They're dropping the net on all the guys.

260
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:48,223
Ain't no secret
things get lost in them cans now and again.

261
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,021
He'll be all right.

262
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,822
They tossed my house, Frank.

263
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:57,126
They don't do that when there's
a couple of cases of vodka missing.

264
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:04,104
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.

265
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:08,302
Heroin, Frank. From this house.

266
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:11,973
No, that ain't right. That can't be right.

267
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:17,811
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that. Nothing like this.

268
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,150
You knew?

269
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:24,416
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff
and seeing a little money...

270
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:28,862
what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?

271
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,658
No, Frank.

272
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:34,566
Once you gave him
a taste on the house, just...

273
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,874
That was never... I mean, he knew. He knew.

274
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:41,604
Everything I did, the cans I let through...

275
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:44,340
the money we got from that
went to keeping what we had.

276
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:46,177
God damn it, Frank!

277
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:51,444
Don't let that excuse this. Not this.

278
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:57,717
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.

279
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,064
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.

280
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,625
"He can fix it."

281
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:31,786
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.

282
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:49,739
You got the new Harper's yet?

283
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,313
Now, you know stores down the way...

284
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,352
don't have nothing past Vibe
and Handguns Today.

285
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,121
Some titty mags, too, if you need.

286
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,449
All right. I got you.

287
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,590
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?

288
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:12,267
Hey, boy. Told you I had something for you.

289
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,903
There you go.

290
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,434
That's my good boy.

291
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:09,087
Good day for a ship.

292
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:13,288
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.

293
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:19,732
Big Roy, let me have your card.

294
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,263
What do you want my card for?

295
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:26,036
Not you. Little Big Roy,
let me hold your card.

296
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:29,244
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.

297
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:31,940
- I'll work it for you.
- Work it for me?

298
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,778
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.

299
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:38,081
End of the week, you get paid.

300
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,467
Hey, Phil.

301
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,032
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.

302
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,202
I don't see no resemblance.

303
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:05,712
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?

304
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:28,437
Who's gonna work for me?

305
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,677
- A different look for our boy.
- Perry Ellis or something.

306
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:38,074
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking
motherfucker like you...

307
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,809
know the designer?

308
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,547
Okay, I'm guessing.

309
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,252
It's a Joseph Abboud.

310
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:50,960
He puts dark buttons instead of brass
on his blazers.

311
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,926
That's the Abboud signature.

312
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,865
You know what they call a guy who pays
that much attention to his clothes, right?

313
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,399
A grown-up.

314
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,634
We're up.

315
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,799
- 12-14, let's go.
- Copy, 11-34.

316
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:25,223
- That's a first.
- Sweat from a checker.

317
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,528
- You all right?
- Ready.

318
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,194
Maybe you ought to set up an easel
on the sidewalk...

319
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:09,067
- and do a sketch instead.
- I'm fine.

320
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:38,695
- Anything I ought to know?
- Yeah. Use the city.

321
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:42,733
Windows, mirrors, reflections,
anything like that.

322
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,002
Stay on my frequency, hear?

323
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,746
Vondopoulos should be coming out
of the garage on foot...

324
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,979
- right about now.
- Copy that.

325
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,977
Beadie Russell. She wasn't much
when we started, you know.

326
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,952
But now she's got game.

327
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,142
Thank you.

328
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,327
12-14. I got him going into
a fifth floor room.

329
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,765
Note the number
then get down to the lobby.

330
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:31,500
- Wait on him there.
- Copy.

331
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,121
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.

332
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,819
Copy.

333
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:06,065
- All this shit's going out to chassis?
- That's what they tell me.

334
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:09,077
We need a forklift. We're almost done here.

335
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:28,554
12-14. Vondopoulos and another man,
middle-aged, blue suit...

336
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:32,101
leaving the front door of the hotel.
They'rejust behind me. Copy?

337
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:33,294
Copy.

338
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,065
11-34.

339
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:40,166
Subject and companion, blue suit,
leaving the hotel any moment now.

340
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,245
Copy, we got the eyeball.

341
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,549
The man with Vondopoulos
has got to be big.

342
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:57,125
- I mean, look at that expensive suit.
- Yeah, with them buttons and all.

343
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:17,276
We leave the Benz here?

344
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:20,277
It's hot.

345
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,759
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?

346
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,064
Negative.

347
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:36,988
- You about done?
- These nine here still got to be stripped.

348
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,426
- Harder than it looks.
- What ain't?

349
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:45,665
- You hear how Moonshot got his name?
- Yeah, and I could give a fuck.

350
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:50,139
Who was the room registered to?

351
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:54,475
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.

352
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:57,944
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.

353
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,677
We should run out the paper trail
on this guy, see what we turn up.

354
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:05,910
As to our only tangible piece of progress
from the raids...

355
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:08,786
what can we do for our friend White Mike?

356
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,720
He rolls on his suppliers,
and he can walk with a long probation.

357
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,356
- And we can move him, if he needs.
- Witness protection?

358
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:21,094
Why have the feds with you if they're
not gonna step up every now and then?

359
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:25,074
Wait a second. You're gonna give
a drug dealer a ride like that?

360
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:26,665
What about Frank Sobotka?

361
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,177
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.

362
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,644
Or so they tell me.

363
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:33,716
The way I read it, they cared more
about busting up the union...

364
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:37,548
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?

365
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:41,719
You can't make him
any kind of specific offer yourself.

366
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:45,386
Only I can do that, and only after
I get an okay from my front office.

367
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:49,090
- She could plant the seed.
- There's no better messenger, Counselor.

368
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:53,066
Take a shot.

369
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:57,531
- You going to his house?
- The Union Hall. That's his house.

370
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,569
Thanks for waiting, Brucie. Sorry I'm late.

371
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:03,771
I shouldn't even be seen with you
at this point.

372
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,144
I just wanna settle our business
while we still can.

373
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:09,377
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands
on more cash, obviously.

374
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:11,386
The grain pier is dead.

375
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:16,424
Half the votes we had lined up
are walking sideways now.

376
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:18,084
They read the paper, Frank.

377
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:22,131
So what? So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?

378
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:24,757
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!

379
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:25,994
I'm not gonna lie.

380
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:29,629
No one is gonna stand with us
now that the FBI is on you.

381
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,934
- They're scared.
- Of what?

382
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,038
They took the money, Frank.

383
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:38,103
And now if they deliver the votes,
they figure the feds will be on them, too.

384
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,807
I'm sorry, Frank.

385
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:42,977
You find a way
of putting this FBI thing to bed...

386
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:45,782
maybe we can come back the next session
with the grain pier.

387
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:50,019
You'll have a couple of people down there
knowing they owe you a vote or two.

388
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,192
I don't know what else to say. I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.

389
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:01,093
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?

390
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:07,668
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.

391
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:13,010
Now we just put our hand
in the next guy's pocket.

392
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:38,102
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something. Lamb or something.

393
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:40,099
I'm not hungry.

394
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,979
All this trouble.

395
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,647
- So, our associates, they are strong?
- Yes.

396
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,519
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.

397
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:59,754
If not, they will stand for us.

398
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:04,732
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.

399
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,830
We must make certain of this.

400
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,099
- Maybe there's another way.
- There is only one sure way.

401
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:13,468
Hear me out.

402
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,138
If I could guarantee
that Frank Sobotka and his nephew...

403
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,908
would be silent...

404
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,817
wouldn't you prefer that?

405
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,316
But you cannot guarantee this.

406
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:27,857
Frank's son,
the idiot who shot George in his store...

407
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:31,385
he is going to jail for a long time...

408
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:33,459
unless...

409
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:39,869
There was a young clerk wounded that day
in the store.

410
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,571
The prosecutors want to use him
as a witness.

411
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,334
I know his family.

412
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:49,136
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.

413
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:53,340
If a man can have this,
why would he talk to the police?

414
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,615
What about Frank's nephew?

415
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,052
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.

416
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:02,249
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.

417
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:07,788
You are fond of him, Spiros.

418
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:10,699
You should've had a son.

419
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,666
But then I would've had a wife.

420
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:28,474
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight,
I'm gonna take it personal.

421
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:35,051
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.

422
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:40,661
Where's a guy like that gonna run?

423
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,366
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha? Come on.

424
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:27,366
Nice and easy, honey.

425
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:30,105
- Come here.
- All right, come on, baby.

426
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,278
What's up, big man? Where the party at?

427
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:35,484
Ain't no party up in here, girl.

428
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:39,578
We thought Darnell and everybody
was gonna get their smoke on.

429
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:41,721
Don't you know Darnell?

430
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:44,251
What's this good boy's name?

431
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:45,821
Hey, boy.

432
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:48,221
How you doing today?

433
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:50,595
You been good? This a good boy.

434
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,665
- There it is.
- Car will be running.

435
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:01,368
What is it, Lamar?

436
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:11,654
No need to prolong this.

437
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:14,080
No, we got time.

438
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:17,188
- You kill my man?
- No, he's resting.

439
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:25,296
- I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
- Not particularly.

440
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:29,565
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got
got here in Baltimore.

441
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:32,072
Stuck and burned before he passed.

442
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:35,711
- The game is the game.
- Indeed.

443
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:38,577
See, that boy was beautiful.

444
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:41,240
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him
the way y'all did.

445
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:42,716
You feel me?

446
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:45,386
- A year, you say?
- About that.

447
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:50,925
You've got some wrong information.

448
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:53,361
Man, you lying to live.

449
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:56,165
I'm at peace with my God.

450
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,959
Do what you will.

451
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:18,451
So you know?

452
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,754
What happened to your boy,
it's not my style.

453
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:33,332
The way you bleeding out your back,
looks like that bullet bore clean through.

454
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:37,371
9 mm at close range will do that.

455
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:49,847
Emergency. Do you need police
or ambulance?

456
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,786
I wanna report a shooting
over here at the new motel.

457
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:56,154
- On North Avenue. Room 221.
- Sir?

458
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:31,651
My pal, Beatrice.

459
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,762
What, you gonna run me in again?
Isn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?

460
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:38,697
Stop it, just stop it.

461
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,102
- Talk to me.
- And say what?

462
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:52,072
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.

463
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:54,240
It didn't happen overnight.

464
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,289
I knew I was wrong.

465
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:11,430
But in my head, I thought I was wrong
for the right reasons, you know?

466
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:14,025
There are different kinds of wrong.

467
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,733
What're you doing here, Bea?

468
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:25,012
I'd like you to come in. Not in cuffs.

469
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,417
Because you want to.

470
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:32,183
I'm opening a door here, Frank.

471
00:46:41,597 --> 00:46:43,758
I can't promise you anything.

472
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:48,062
Just come in. We'll start from there.

473
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:56,744
You're better than them you got in bed with.

474
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:10,453
- Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
- Maybe he got lucky.

475
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:15,355
Maybe we didn't.

476
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:20,797
You think he ditched the Benz
because he picked up the tail?

477
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:31,339
Nicky from the docks.

478
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:37,882
If you hadn't called last night,
I'd have never found you.

479
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:39,716
Relax, Niko, come on.

480
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,458
It's like I told you on the phone.

481
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:46,720
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.

482
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:49,457
I should have never gone down the road
with you people.

483
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:53,433
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.

484
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:55,603
There's no harm in that.

485
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:58,131
And you still have friends.

486
00:47:58,474 --> 00:47:59,805
I'm busted.

487
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:05,136
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?

488
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:09,047
- Christ!
- We will be a friend to him, too.

489
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:12,519
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.

490
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:17,615
Nothing is done, Niko. Nothing.

491
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,657
Take a look.

492
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:27,531
That's not your name.

493
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:30,497
Many names, many passports.

494
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:34,773
We can do many things.

495
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,775
What can you do for Ziggy?

496
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:48,618
We ask only loyalty.

497
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:06,335
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?

498
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:11,377
She asked me straight-up to come in,
so I'm here.

499
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:14,783
First, we need to know
what you're looking for.

500
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:17,648
We don't want any misunderstandings
later on.

501
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:22,122
I'm just looking for, you know,
some help with my son.

502
00:49:23,025 --> 00:49:26,893
- He can't jail where they got him.
- We move him to a county facility.

503
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:32,023
- What about my nephew?
- He gets arrested and charged.

504
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,626
But for his cooperation and yours...

505
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:38,096
we can live with straight probation.

506
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,976
But what we can and cannot do
for you and your family...

507
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,106
- depends on the level of your cooperation.
- You mean, how much I give you?

508
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,246
I got dirt on all of them.

509
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:54,750
I'll put myself in, too. Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.

510
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:58,691
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.

511
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:01,024
I'll give you The Greek,
all them sons of bitches...

512
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,497
just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.

513
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,034
Mr. Sobotka, at this point
I have to advise you...

514
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:09,536
you need to retain
the services of an attorney.

515
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,901
We're not gonna do this now?

516
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,998
You need to have a lawyer
present in the room.

517
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,840
You have that, we can make this happen
first thing tomorrow.

518
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:28,179
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.

519
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,149
Why did you stop using your cell phone?

520
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,957
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?

521
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,342
Under the bridge?

522
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:07,117
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.

523
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:09,691
These guys,
they got a big operation to protect.

524
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:11,384
They're global-like.

525
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:14,725
- They're really something?
- You got no idea.

526
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,061
I think I got a pretty clear picture
of what they're about.

527
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:23,400
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves
rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.

528
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:24,666
Heroin?

529
00:52:25,074 --> 00:52:28,100
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!

530
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:31,642
You ain't much more than a kid.

531
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:37,651
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?

532
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:42,616
I flushed my fucking family, for what?

533
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,121
You know what that is, Nicky? Do you?

534
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:52,356
A condominium.

535
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,168
I ain't going down there.

536
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:03,767
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.

537
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:07,280
That's right. I'm gonna do
to those cocksuckers what they did to me.

538
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:09,476
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

539
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:13,519
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.

540
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:16,918
They can lean on that witness...

541
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:20,154
that kid that he shot,
the one that was there in the store.

542
00:53:20,262 --> 00:53:22,628
The kid's gonna say that
Double G had the gun.

543
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,599
That it was like self-defense or some shit.

544
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,665
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.

545
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:31,767
He could.

546
00:53:35,177 --> 00:53:37,778
- And for that they want what?
- Loyalty.

547
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:39,781
Motherfuckers!

548
00:54:11,614 --> 00:54:13,309
I'll hear them out.

549
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,714
- All right, I'll drive.
- No, it's just me.

550
00:54:19,188 --> 00:54:21,315
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.

551
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,622
- Uncle Frank, me and Spiros...
- I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!

552
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,090
Go home!

553
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,029
Your way...

554
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:45,733
it won't work.
