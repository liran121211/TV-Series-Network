00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,300
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,850
Freezing my balls off.

3
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:24,715
It ain't so bad. Loosen up.
Couple more months, it's gonna be spring.

4
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:27,192
Spring, huh?

5
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:32,125
Listen, you gotta realize the bosses
did you a favor sending you down here.

6
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:35,725
- Citywide to Marine Unit.
- 7672. Go ahead.

7
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:41,174
Distress call from a private craft.
60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead.

8
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,609
What's the location, Citywide?

9
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:48,414
In the channel near the bridge.
About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier.

10
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,517
10-4, we're responding.

11
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,904
My father used to work there.

12
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,170
- Beth Steel?
- In the shipyards there, yeah.

13
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:21,612
I had an uncle who was a supervisor there.
Got laid off in '78, though.

14
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,607
'73 for my dad.

15
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,185
- Party boat?
- Pretty one, yeah.

16
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,384
- More than one engine, right?
- Probably an electrical problem.

17
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,843
Is that a police boat?

18
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,086
How are you tonight? Good to see you.

19
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,620
Henry, how are you?

20
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,954
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

21
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,621
- You're the Captain?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,665
- Harbormaster?
- No, City Police.

23
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,970
- So you're dead in the water?
- Think it's the starter.

24
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:20,004
- You're not a mechanic, are you?
- Me? No.

25
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,268
I can't tell the aft from the stern.

26
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,878
Best I can offer you is a tow line.

27
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,645
Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.

28
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,582
- 10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's.
- That'll work.

29
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,346
Any chance you can hold off
on bringing us in?

30
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,719
Lot of partying going on now.

31
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,555
I wouldn't wanna cut it short
for a little engine trouble.

32
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,925
You're in the shipping channel.

33
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:57,634
You tow us somewhere out of the way,
and the band plays on a while longer.

34
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,834
...because you see what I'm saying, right?

35
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:05,337
I mean, three years in auto theft
and I didn't learn anything.

36
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,599
I didn't care.

37
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm telling you,
I didn't even wanna be a police anymore.

38
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,974
I honestly didn't.

39
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,214
I think that was why
I shot up my car like I did.

40
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,510
But this thing we did on Barksdale,
the wiretap and all...

41
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:22,583
that felt like something.
That felt like something I wanna do.

42
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,490
So I was thinking, you know,
narcotics, maybe.

43
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,995
Major, you want this stuff where?

44
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,997
Just in here.
Up against the wall over there.

45
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,661
If there aren't any openings
in the regular narcotics shift...

46
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,238
maybe assets forfeiture
or something like that.

47
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,637
Easy. Everything breaks.

48
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,043
I mean, with this Barksdale thing...

49
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:48,081
Lester Freamon had us deep into the money.
Real deep.

50
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:52,175
We could've seized real estate, cash,
vehicles, all kinds of stuff.

51
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:56,120
If the bosses, I mean,
if command had let that case go forward.

52
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,690
We were on it.

53
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,127
- Look at that. It's the dove.
- Right.

54
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,166
- So what do you think?
- What do I think?

55
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:13,698
I think you're gonna take
the Sergeant's Exam next month.

56
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,877
And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear...

57
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,573
and because he has City Hall's ear...

58
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,940
you're gonna make Sergeant.

59
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,021
Then you're gonna come out here
to the Southeast...

60
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:31,489
where, because I'm your father-in-law...

61
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,186
you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift
in a quiet sector.

62
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,856
Then you're gonna take the Lieutenant's
Exam where you'll also score high.

63
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,902
I don't want to make rank.

64
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,837
I want to work cases. Good cases.

65
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,067
Roland.

66
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,379
Listen to me.

67
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:58,180
You did good with the drug thing.
You buckled down, you did the work.

68
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,845
And except for that thing
with the Grand Jury...

69
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,822
you helped take
some of the stink off yourself.

70
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,087
Now if you'll just shut up and listen to me...

71
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,193
you might actually have a career
in this department.

72
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,202
- This radio ain't working that well.
- We're losing it.

73
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,543
- We're losing the station, man.
- What you mean?

74
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,581
We done gone so far from Baltimore,
we're losing the station.

75
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:32,812
- Try a Philly station or some shit like that.
- The radio in Philly is different?

76
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,013
Nigger, you gotta be fucking with me, right?

77
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,215
You never heard a station
outside of Baltimore?

78
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,260
I ain't never left Baltimore
except that Boys' Village shit one day.

79
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:44,354
And I wasn't trying to hear no radio
up in that bitch.

80
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,029
Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop.

81
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,837
It's been perfect tomato weather out there.

82
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:59,970
These wonderful hot, humid days,
and then rain at night.

83
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,913
- This a Philly station?
- How the fuck would I know?

84
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,511
Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore?
That's what I'm asking.

85
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,585
Yo, that be the exit. Take that shit.

86
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,412
So far they on it.

87
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,281
Ahoy, matey.

88
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,517
The girls always tell me
about the little man in the boat.

89
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,453
- Now I know who they talking about.
- Come on board, man.

90
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,751
- Come on, I wanna show you.
- Fuck, no.

91
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,986
- What's the matter?
- The Bunk can't swim.

92
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,324
I ain't too good at floating, either.

93
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,996
So what brings you to the water's edge?

94
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,869
Ilene Nathan called.
Gant case is coming up in four weeks.

95
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:06,063
She wants to start doing preliminaries
on our witnesses.

96
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:09,631
That means the old lady from the projects,
which is no problem.

97
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,268
And your man Omar, who's in the wind.

98
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,909
You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?

99
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:22,282
- Well, he's not to starboard.
- That's port, fool.

100
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,554
- How the fuck would you know?
- Come on.

101
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,890
Let me buy you lunch
and we can think on this shit together.

102
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,759
I leave, I gotta tell my Sergeant.

103
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,800
That reminds me. Landsman wants his $10.

104
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,334
- What for?
- For betting that you'd ride the boat.

105
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,835
You tell that motherfucker
he's not gonna see that money...

106
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,708
especially since it was probably him
told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.

107
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:48,475
- Ain't the same up there without your ass.
- No?

108
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,947
Better, actually.

109
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,483
Hey, come on, now.

110
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,417
The canal gets dredged...

111
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,458
it means we all work.
Your people, my people.

112
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,357
The canal's the key, Nat. You know this.

113
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,930
Yeah, but you know how much money
you're gonna spend...

114
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,794
to even get them talking about that shit?

115
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,027
We don't take a shot,
we might as well roll over and die right now.

116
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,297
No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier.

117
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,169
- You got a 100 ships right there.
- That's break-bulk, Nat.

118
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,334
Best you'll do is one or two
extra gangs a week on them blowers.

119
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,241
That's six or seven-man gangs at best.

120
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,180
But you try for that, you might actually
come away with something.

121
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,047
You go down to Annapolis
asking for the goddamn canal...

122
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:30,089
you gonna come back with nothing but
your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand.

123
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,990
What's more,
if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon...

124
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,655
some asshole's gonna fuck us
by building condominiums all over it.

125
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:41,223
- Nat, if the canal were 2 feet deeper...
- Fuck the canal.

126
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,495
I'm going to the District Council.

127
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,300
I'm gonna tell them
to push for the grain pier.

128
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,807
- You feel me?
- Nat, calm the fuck down.

129
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,539
Goddamn Checkers Local always acting
like you're the king of everything and shit.

130
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,905
Nat, listen to me. If we...

131
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,348
Y'all need to crawl back down
in them holds...

132
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,615
and remind yourself of who you is
and where you come from.

133
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,090
Damn, Frank.

134
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:12,557
We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson
take a shit all over you.

135
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,102
And shrivel-dick motherfucker
that you are, you take it.

136
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,227
For your information...

137
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,602
I wake up every morning
with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter.

138
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:24,234
I was gonna enlighten the president
of Local 47 on this particular point...

139
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,209
and he chose to depart.

140
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:34,511
- Blue steel, gentlemen.
- For Christ's sake.

141
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,590
Three-and-a-half inches of hard blue steel.

142
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:29,834
- Nicky boy, you working today?
- As a lasher for Big Roy's crew.

143
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,405
Attaboy. Make the family proud.

144
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,711
First day they give me in two weeks.

145
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,278
- Is Ott around?
- On his ass as usual.

146
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,515
Worthless fuck still owes me $20
for them lotto tickets.

147
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,758
Hey, Nick.

148
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,668
You need to see the Greek
and get a number. He's got one on the way.

149
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,328
- Today?
- Tomorrow.

150
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,841
The Atlantic Light over at North Point.

151
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,173
All right.

152
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,311
- Yo, Frank.
- What's up?

153
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:11,184
You gotta get with Ziggy, man.
He's all over the place.

154
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,395
I'm here since 8:00.
You know I been here since 8:00.

155
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,123
- Hold your horses.
- You fucking goose.

156
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,536
I'm gonna find it for you.
Just shut the fuck up a minute.

157
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,003
How we doing?

158
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,336
- Ain't a problem, Chief.
- The fuck it ain't.

159
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,706
I'm down here since 8:00
for crane-to-chassis...

160
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,974
- and Tweety Bird here lost the can.
- It ain't lost.

161
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,741
It's right here on the manifest as a hot box.
Where is it, Zig?

162
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:50,246
- It's either in Bay 7, or...
- Bay 7 is empty, man.

163
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,958
Or it ain't. In that case...

164
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,758
it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.

165
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:58,956
Jesus fucking Christ.

166
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,694
You're killing me here, Ziggy.
You are fucking killing me.

167
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:05,203
Get me a number for your shipping agent.
I'll call and try to square it.

168
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,533
And you.

169
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:10,299
You clock out today and leave your box,
and don't ever come the fuck back.

170
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,378
You hear me, Zig? You're fired.

171
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,310
Later for you, goofus.

172
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,442
Fucking guy.
He loses his job and he couldn't care less.

173
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,519
- He ain't fired, man.
- No?

174
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,250
That's his father.

175
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,941
How fast you need this?

176
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,739
Case goes to trial in a month.
Got to start prepping it this week.

177
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,109
Officer Burns.

178
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,287
Detective.

179
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:02,824
I heard they posted you down here.

180
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,057
But, I mean, you know, damn.

181
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,764
These motherfuckers don't play, do they?

182
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,264
So what brings you downstairs?

183
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,604
I was pulling evidence on the Gant case.

184
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,746
You know, trial date for Bird is next month
and llene Nathan wanted to be ready.

185
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,576
You give him my love.

186
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,478
- Who?
- Bird.

187
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,125
- No evidence.
- What do you mean, no evidence?

188
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:36,423
Submission slip says
"Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3...

189
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,327
"Four, Right rear." It says that.

190
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,161
- So?
- No such thing.

191
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,896
BB has 12 sections. This says 14.
You see what I'm saying?

192
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,270
No evidence.

193
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,676
Winters kill off
the weaker varieties of caterpillars.

194
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:01,610
- Fuck me.
- ...that's of an entirely different breed...

195
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:02,780
Fuck.

196
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,900
...protection against caterpillars,
they eat right through it.

197
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,937
But it is a sort of a warning system.

198
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,973
They here.

199
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,185
Franoosh, you made it.

200
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,781
Right, Father. Got you covered here.

201
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,084
Come on.

202
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,456
You wanna see your window?

203
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:28,466
Only Franoosh Sobotka would send
all the way to Esslingen for stained glass.

204
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:34,075
The Germans are hard-headed,
but you can't beat them for craft.

205
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,685
I was glad to do it, Father,
for the church, you know.

206
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,455
Truth is I need to ask you
something in return.

207
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,184
Anything I can do.

208
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,555
- I need some face time with the Senator.
- Barbara?

209
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,755
She comes to the early mass on Sunday,
the one in Polish.

210
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,390
We got nothing but problems, Father.

211
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,799
We need to see something happen
with the C&D Canal...

212
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,803
and the grain pier's been down for a year.

213
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:02,705
I got tough guys coming in
to confess things I never heard before.

214
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:06,606
I don't need you to tell me
how bad things are at the docks.

215
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,580
So you'll set something up
with Mikulski soon?

216
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,446
You didn't need a German window
to ask me for that, Francis.

217
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,348
And what's more...

218
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,889
you've made offerings
way above what it would take...

219
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,084
to get that window up there.

220
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,954
How long since your last confession?

221
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,633
I'll see you, Father.

222
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,707
This shit might be somewhere else, man.

223
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:39,844
Yo, the shit is always up in the door, man.

224
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,011
Motherfucker, you been
standing there watching us.

225
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,380
You see any shit come up out of there?

226
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,347
You seen we ain't take shit up off this car.

227
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,548
- All right.
- You seen it.

228
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,455
Who gonna believe us? This shit is missing.

229
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:55,060
And fuck what you're saying.

230
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,686
All he's gonna hear
is that this shit is fucking missing.

231
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,821
Yo, check it again.

232
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,799
Yo, the shit ain't there, man.
Call your man and say so.

233
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:03,460
Nigger, what you say?

234
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,028
- I said check it again, God damn it!
- Whoa, chill.

235
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,608
Yo, man, cut that shit the fuck out.

236
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,672
What the fuck is going on today, man?

237
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,279
Taking their time, ain't they?

238
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,765
What the hell is going on?

239
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,773
Come on, man.

240
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:41,966
Damn!

241
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,848
- Ain't anywhere in this section either.
- Start on the next row.

242
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,486
Lieutenant, those two bags could be
anywhere in this damn basement.

243
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,917
You're right.

244
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,788
- We could be here all night.
- Right again.

245
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,854
So that's overtime, right?

246
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,565
Fuck me. I still cannot type.

247
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,709
Fucking white boys, I love them.
I fucking love them.

248
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,541
- Yeah?
- Dumb as a box of rocks.

249
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,942
- Who?
- White boys.

250
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:25,708
Talking about the brain-deads
in my Kane Street case.

251
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,253
I call him up,
I tell him I wanna buy some drugs.

252
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,617
You know what he says?

253
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,453
"Okay, I'll sell you the drugs.
How much drugs do you want?"

254
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,359
I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it,
they don't ask for a meet, nothing.

255
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,523
And then when you make the deal,
there's no runner, no bullshit.

256
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,862
It's the guy himself
walking up to you, saying:

257
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,266
"I brought the drugs.
Did you bring the money?"

258
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:47,033
I'm not kidding.
I have much respect for black people...

259
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,108
after working with these idiots
for two weeks.

260
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:53,373
If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore,
they have to make different laws for it...

261
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,970
like even it out for them.

262
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,141
- Affirmative action.
- Leave no white man behind.

263
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:02,353
- What the fuck do you want?
- I need you to do the seizures.

264
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,720
You got titles, deeds, registrations?
What do you have for me?

265
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,419
Thought you did that.
You're the Forfeiture Unit, right?

266
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,554
I write all the affidavits
and the filing for the City Solicitor.

267
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,497
But you've gotta give me the information
on what we're taking.

268
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,535
That's a fucking hassle.

269
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,332
You want the property, do the paperwork.

270
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:23,307
You gotta step up, Herc.
You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.

271
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,434
No?

272
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,575
How about you come
on the raids tomorrow?

273
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,614
Take a few doors with me
for old time's sake.

274
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:30,740
You taking doors?

275
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,410
Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street.

276
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,819
Come on, Kima, mount up with us.
I know you miss it.

277
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,426
I'm done rolling around the gutter.
I am inside now.

278
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,190
- You're a housecat now?
- I made a promise.

279
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,429
I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy...

280
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,666
and, actually, in some ways
you're better than most guys I know.

281
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:58,039
If you were a guy, your friends
would buy you a beer and let you know.

282
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,113
- Let me know what?
- You're fucking whipped.

283
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:04,212
- Whipped?
- Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life.

284
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,807
I kid you not.

285
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:13,852
So...

286
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,219
So?

287
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,803
So where do we find Omar?

288
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:27,797
Who?

289
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,712
- He say anything else?
- No.

290
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,743
Just to come back. All of us.

291
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,379
How he say it?

292
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,691
You know, he just said it.

293
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:54,392
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

294
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:15,445
Shit.

295
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,701
- They holding to it?
- So far.

296
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,443
All right.

297
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,320
They got the times right?

298
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:56,752
How about the mileage?

299
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,760
All right.

300
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,506
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

301
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,275
- You never saw him out the car?
- No.

302
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,271
- You stayed with him the whole time?
- Every minute.

303
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:21,116
How long before he came out
the parking garage?

304
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:24,952
- How long was he on his own?
- Not enough time to do shit, String.

305
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:27,083
He was in and out, like, in three minutes.

306
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,387
Chill.

307
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,595
- This shit is fucked up.
- Look...

308
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,964
You follow the directions?

309
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,470
- I did just like you told me.
- Wrote down the mileage?

310
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,199
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

311
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:46,705
See, right there.

312
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,721
No, you're three-tenths of a mile long, dawg.

313
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,687
And if you followed directions,
you wouldn't be.

314
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:04,260
String, I did everything like I should, man.
I swear.

315
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,712
You got answers?

316
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,391
You didn't have to take a detour
in Camden...

317
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:36,587
when they shut down a couple of blocks
on the Boulevard?

318
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:40,227
You hurt your foot?

319
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:43,969
- My foot?
- You know, the way you kicked that tire jack.

320
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:52,135
- You was on us the whole time?
- Who, me?

321
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:54,440
Y'all had people following us.

322
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,609
So where it at?

323
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,550
You know, you should take me with you.

324
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,194
I should meet these guys.
If I meet these guys...

325
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:14,198
we can figure out ways to do business.
You know what I'm saying?

326
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,630
- Zig, these guys are real.
- What, I ain't real?

327
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:27,711
Six degrees.

328
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,282
Everybody's going home
to sauerkraut and Santy Claus...

329
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,681
and here comes a gang of us
walking the other way...

330
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:36,118
Little Big Roy with his wooden leg.

331
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,690
- Christ, them wooden shovels.
- Yeah.

332
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,885
You children don't know nothing
about them wooden shovels, do you?

333
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,155
Can't have no sparks
when you working grain.

334
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,697
- Kaboom.
- It's more like kaput.

335
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,496
You never gonna see another grain ship
here in Bawlmer, my friends.

336
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,798
Zig, you believe these fucking dinosaurs?

337
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:57,137
They sit around all day talking shit about
how they used to off-load with shovels...

338
00:27:57,243 --> 00:28:00,576
and carry fucking railroad cars
on their backs.

339
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,944
Shit, and drink whiskey through a fire hose.

340
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,644
Go home and fuck their wives till breakfast.
There was some heroes back then.

341
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,846
Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.

342
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,583
What can you do?
This generation, they just don't know.

343
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,285
- Ain't never gonna be what it was.
- No, indeed.

344
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:18,091
Every night with these old fucks.
It's like 1952 and shit.

345
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:23,431
Boys, you know, when I was your age,
I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day.

346
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,868
You know, I'd do it with one arm...

347
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:30,170
after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos
fell on me.

348
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:33,443
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

349
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,878
Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.

350
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:38,143
Christ, here we go again.

351
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,716
Bring out pretty boy.

352
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,154
But, you know, where you boys hail from,
I'm sure any old breakfast link will do.

353
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,692
You know he's gonna
pull out his dick, right?

354
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,318
That boy ain't right.

355
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:50,794
It was just me...

356
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,866
and my old wooden leg,
and my old wooden shovel...

357
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,833
and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil.

358
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:01,168
Like anyone from the Checkers Local
ever used anything but a real pencil.

359
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:03,936
Shit, they don't even push
one of them no more.

360
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:09,006
Talking trash about 1514.

361
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:12,949
Jesus H. Christ, you know what?
All hands starboard.

362
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,952
Come on.

363
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,925
The old tub is listing. Can you feel her?

364
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:22,426
You wanna know why?

365
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:25,725
'Cause them old fucks
done unloaded so much bullshit...

366
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,300
that this whole motherfucker's
gonna capsize.

367
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,426
Brace yourselves, we're sinking.

368
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,664
God damn it, Ziggy.

369
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,104
You're not taking your dick out
in here again.

370
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:39,542
Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo
that none of you could ever handle.

371
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:44,608
Who says they don't make them
like they used to?

372
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:47,015
Pretty boy is on the town tonight.

373
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,487
Fucking Ziggy, man.

374
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:32,116
- Bring her in the boat?
- Hell, no.

375
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:36,222
- She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
- What's the plan then?

376
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,856
We'll hook her real good.
We'll tow her slowly over to the pier.

377
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,396
- What's she look like?
- What do you mean?

378
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:46,528
- How long you think she's been in?
- She's fresh.

379
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:51,003
- Legs are broke, though.
- Probably a jumper from the bridge.

380
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,940
All right, Ma. Shit.

381
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,252
Kitchen's closed.

382
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,159
There's no service for drunks
who can't get up in time to catch a ship.

383
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,324
What ship?

384
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:51,096
Your father says the Talco Line is in today.

385
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,728
That makes two ships at North Point.

386
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,405
It's the Atlantic Light.
Ain't due until this afternoon.

387
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,512
That still is no excuse.

388
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:15,420
Good morning, Mom.

389
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,295
Couple of goddamn drunks I got.

390
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:25,432
And don't leave
without taking your cousin with you.

391
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:29,565
I gotta clean in there,
and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.

392
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,881
You keep us guessing, don't you, Stan?

393
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,144
At Sunday mass, you can't be found.

394
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,948
But early on a Tuesday,
you arrive with an army.

395
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:20,856
$2,500 from myself and every other Polack...

396
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,622
in three districts and four firehouses.

397
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:27,026
- And to what do we owe such generosity?
- A surprise.

398
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:30,159
We ordered up a window
for where you renovated the nave.

399
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,396
A memorial. Let me see that.

400
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:37,374
To Polish police and firefighters.

401
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:43,275
Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie
that you would not believe.

402
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,449
- For the nave?
- Yeah, for the nave.

403
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:56,156
We could use another window
on the second floor of the rectory.

404
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,864
- The rectory?
- The upstairs hallway.

405
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,594
How much did them dock boys offer
for this spot?

406
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,671
- I can match it.
- Offerings are confidential, Stan.

407
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:10,435
- And as you can see...
- I can go as high as $4,000.

408
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,772
Just tell me if they went higher than $4,000.

409
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,877
More than $4,000? From the docks?

410
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,642
How the hell...

411
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,514
I'm sorry, Father.

412
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,820
- Who came to you with the offer?
- Francis Sobotka.

413
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,596
Frank Sobotka has that kind of money?

414
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,264
- It was from his local.
- The Checkers?

415
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:37,893
- They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
- It's a parish of givers, Stan.

416
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,972
Maybe you talk to Frank.

417
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,570
Work it out somehow.

418
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,311
Yeah, we'll talk.

419
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:55,984
Major?

420
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:18,503
Well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor.

421
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:19,805
Ray, how you been?

422
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:22,107
I got nothing but red ink
under my name this year.

423
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:24,944
Landsman's become an asshole with teeth.

424
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:28,585
- Fish your wish, huh?
- Jumper, probably.

425
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:33,623
- This close to the bridge.
- Probably, yeah.

426
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,723
- Pretty, though.
- She is, yeah.

427
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:37,489
I go into the men's room this morning.

428
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,030
Guess who's in the next stall
puking his guts out.

429
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,531
Bunk Moreland.

430
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:45,001
- How'd you know?
- Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.

431
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,513
- What's happening, man?
- What's up, Fam?

432
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:04,680
All right.

433
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,652
- You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
- Not a goddamn word, man.

434
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:13,664
Billy still got our money though, right?
So you need to get down to New York, man.

435
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,302
Fuck kind of game this nigger playing?
You sure of our people?

436
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,963
I broke down all their stories
and they came back clean.

437
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,041
Besides, I had some good people
watching them.

438
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,902
- Who?
- Tank, Country.

439
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,139
- How long that motherfucker been home?
- A month.

440
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:33,014
Still on parole. He said, "fuck that."
Straight back in the mix.

441
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,210
All right.

442
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,552
So good, it ain't on us. It's on Roberto.
Set it straight. You know what I mean?

443
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:41,558
So when you go hard on them,
take it light, but be firm.

444
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,322
They got our money
and we ain't got the product.

445
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,024
So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.

446
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,291
How you fixed in here otherwise, B?

447
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,032
This ain't no thing, man.
You know what I mean?

448
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,102
You come in here, man,
you get your mind right.

449
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:01,311
You get in here and you do two days.
It's the day you come in this motherfucker...

450
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:04,849
- And the day you get out this motherfucker.
- That's right.

451
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:07,313
Exactly.

452
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:10,553
- What's up?
- How you doing?

453
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:13,887
- Coming from the hiring hall?
- I'm working the Atlantic late today.

454
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,621
- How's it looking for Local 47?
- You're shit out of luck.

455
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,959
ROIROs isn't going to anybody
lower than a G-series.

456
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,464
Best you can get,
maybe half a day doing break-bulk...

457
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,364
on an aluminum load at Locust Point.

458
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:26,097
- Half a day, huh?
- Seniority sucks.

459
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:30,708
- Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
- Yeah, you got that right.

460
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:32,943
- I'm out of here.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

461
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:36,208
- The fuck you ain't wake me up for?
- Just getting up now, fuck-face?

462
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,681
No, actually,
your ma makes a good breakfast.

463
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,275
- No fucking way.
- Bacon and eggs, baby.

464
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,753
You going down to see the Greek, right?

465
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,489
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna fuck it up for you.

466
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:51,188
For Christ's sake,
will you just get in the car already?

467
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,890
Come on. Let's go.

468
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:02,532
I swear to God, Ziggy.
You open your mouth, I'll fucking kill you.

469
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:27,061
- Nicky, from the docks.
- Spiros.

470
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,134
How are you? Good?

471
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:33,366
- Who's your friend?
- This is Zig, my uncle's kid.

472
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,633
- Your uncle? Frankie?
- Yeah.

473
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:39,370
Ziggy's his oldest.
My car broke down, you know. He drove.

474
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,105
So you must be the Greek.

475
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,650
Well, I'm Greek anyway.

476
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:53,418
Boris Badanoff.
I know you from around the way, right?

477
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:58,225
Why am I Boris? I don't understand this.
Everywhere I am Boris.

478
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,527
- Shit, you're Russian, right?
- No, Ukraine. Kyiv is Ukraine.

479
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,898
- It's the same difference, though.
- No, you're wrong.

480
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,901
What's the matter?
You don't like being called Boris?

481
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,065
Sergei.

482
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:14,544
No way, man. Boris is way better.
It's like the guy from the cartoon.

483
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,074
Boris and Natasha?

484
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:20,143
Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle.

485
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,548
- You want some coffee, pie?
- No, I'm good.

486
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,317
- Actually, what kind of pie you got?
- Hey, Zig.

487
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,523
Shut the fuck up, huh?

488
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,100
Malaka.

489
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,677
No, it's cool. He's cool.

490
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,708
- That's Frank's kid?
- Yeah.

491
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:51,515
He's in the Union, you know.

492
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:55,144
But he's like an L-series,
so he ain't getting any hours.

493
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:06,324
- Same deal, same rate.
- All right. Who's driving?

494
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:09,527
Again?

495
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:13,833
You want to mix it up a little more.

496
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:16,840
Make it so customs doesn't put
no names to faces.

497
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,867
You trust a man, you stay with him.

498
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,508
- Okay.
- All right.

499
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,317
Boris it is.

500
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:29,319
- Sergei.
- Yeah, whatever.

501
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,521
Come on, fucknuts. Let's go.

502
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:35,457
- How's the open-face turkey?
- It's shit. Let's go.

503
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,623
See you guys later.

504
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,158
- Bullwinkle?
- Polacks.

505
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:48,802
You fucking embarrassed me in there, man.

506
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,937
You embarrassed yourself, Zig.

507
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,818
You seen my nephew anywhere?

508
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:13,921
Nick? Not yet.
I don't think he got any hours.

509
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:32,576
- Hey, Frank.
- Hey, darling.

510
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:37,379
Just so I can finish my paperwork early,
what are your people gonna steal today?

511
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,751
I don't know.

512
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:42,691
Couple luxury sedans,
some color TVs, wide-screen.

513
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:46,491
Maybe a couple cans of vodka,
maybe a whole container ship.

514
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:49,031
Okay. Y'all have a good one.

515
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,298
You let her fuck with you like that?

516
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,876
She's all right. I like her.

517
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:16,859
I checked the computer.
It's Bay 9, Cell 11 . It's right on the bottom.

518
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,892
- You working the light, ain't you?
- I'm on it, yeah.

519
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:24,901
- Did they say anything else?
- No. Just that it's the same money to us.

520
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,367
Let's go.

521
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,904
All right, Uncle Frank.

522
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:36,440
- Winona.
- Jimmy, where you been?

523
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:50,718
Look who it is. Sailor Boy.

524
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,820
- You owe me $10.
- Fuck you.

525
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:56,595
You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
You made it happen, Jay.

526
00:43:56,702 --> 00:44:00,798
- I told him where you didn't wanna go.
- Yeah, and they sent me there.

527
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:03,500
I knew Rawls was pissed,
I didn't know how pissed.

528
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,337
What can I tell you?

529
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:10,376
- Where's Bunk?
- Out on a call with Crutchfield.

530
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,543
What's up with the girl?
She come off the bridge or what?

531
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:18,214
Doc Frazier posted her today.
Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest.

532
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,348
He says she's dead
before she hits the water.

533
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:22,654
What about the defense wounds?

534
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:26,189
Bruising on three fingers?
We saw that as soon as we picked her up.

535
00:44:26,298 --> 00:44:28,027
You missed the defense wounds?

536
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,567
I wasn't looking.
Thought she went off the bridge.

537
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,830
Also, she's in the drink
with no coat or shoes.

538
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:35,406
Maybe that stuff comes off in the water,
maybe not.

539
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:38,704
I don't see her going to the bridge in winter
dressed like she was.

540
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,778
But then that's just me.

541
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:42,536
Tell Bunk I was here, will you?

542
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:43,875
Have fun.

543
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:47,509
We already had our fun.
Dumping her on Baltimore County.

544
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,188
On the County?

545
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:55,950
You fished her out east of the bridge.
That's Baltimore County. She's their stat.

546
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:59,121
- You sold them on that?
- Rawls did.

547
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,561
He called up the Colonel and said:

548
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,464
"You got one hell of a murder
on your hands."

549
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,767
It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy.

550
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,775
Something you never learned.

551
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,644
Hey, Norris. State Police, Line 2.

552
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,108
A little to the right!

553
00:45:20,986 --> 00:45:22,749
Good, bring her down!

554
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,345
It's there whenever they want it.

555
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,861
Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell...

556
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,730
we are protected
by the attorney-client privilege.

557
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:13,828
- I thought Roberto would be here.
- Not likely.

558
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:16,836
This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.

559
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:23,542
It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva
has been targeted by the DEA.

560
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,480
That's why we didn't do the business?

561
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:30,988
Right now, Roberto and his people aren't
going to be getting involved in anything...

562
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,319
that could further complicate the situation.

563
00:46:33,425 --> 00:46:36,792
You know, usually, when you take a fall,
you get right back in there...

564
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:40,092
- 'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
- Sometimes.

565
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:43,962
And sometimes you wonder
how it is you got caught in the first place.

566
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,629
And you decide to change the pattern.

567
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,298
He took our money?

568
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:51,432
Your advance payment arrived
as our problem did.

569
00:46:51,543 --> 00:46:54,478
And I'm told the money
is on the way back to Baltimore.

570
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,047
You know, I get the feeling
that you're blaming us...

571
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,673
for Roberto's predicament.

572
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:03,978
Perhaps your problems in Baltimore
and my client's problems here...

573
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:05,613
are coincidental.

574
00:47:05,724 --> 00:47:07,658
- But right now...
- Listen to me.

575
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:09,952
He was the first to know that we took a hit.

576
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:12,291
He knows no one came close
to rolling over us...

577
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,729
and all the documents from the case.

578
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:19,401
Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern.

579
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,440
Considering the scope
of Mr. Barksdale's operation...

580
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:28,172
his sentence was, to say the least, mild.

581
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:32,841
But if the possibility exists,
however unlikely...

582
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:37,650
that the leniency he received
was the result of cooperation...

583
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:42,890
You understand our position, I'm sure.

584
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,901
Frank, it's sitting out there waiting...

585
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,130
and this Russian fuck
won't take it off the pier.

586
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,228
I ain't blind.

587
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,501
I don't like it
sitting out in the open that long.

588
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:00,134
The customs seal is broke.
Somebody's gonna see it.

589
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:02,475
Our asses are hanging out here.

590
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,882
- Yeah?
- Nicky, what the fuck? It's still here.

591
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,518
- Shit.
- Yeah.

592
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,189
- Where's Sergei?
- He's parked at the end of the lot.

593
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:22,858
- What's he waiting for?
- I got no fucking idea.

594
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:26,062
But the ship's almost empty.
They need to shit or get off the pot.

595
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:28,139
- I'll look into it.
- Yeah.

596
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:32,004
Okay, I understand.

597
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:57,367
Fuck it. Get it on a fifth wheel
and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.

598
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:11,173
I ain't lying when I say
this paperwork is kicking my ass.

599
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,268
Maybe so. But the end of the day,
you come through the door in one piece.

600
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,177
You like to think so.

601
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:20,985
But all these paper cuts
are starting to take their toll.

602
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,747
You big, nasty detective. Come here.

603
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,087
Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.

604
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,333
- All this?
- I'm just getting started.

605
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,869
$1000 for the doctor.

606
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:48,878
$1000 each time, girlfriend.
Every month till I'm pregnant.

607
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,679
There's gotta be a better way.

608
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:55,076
That would be on you, sweetheart.

609
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,417
Come up with a suitable donor
and we pay a lot less.

610
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:02,321
Not with your pussy
would I fuck anyone of these guys.

611
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:05,658
What did you just say?
No, you didn't just say that.

612
00:51:35,894 --> 00:51:37,293
Sergeant.

613
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,598
Your floater's come back.

614
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:44,460
County boys are putting her
on our side of the bridge.

615
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,434
- No fucking way.
- Yeah.

616
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:49,635
Some useless fuck in our Marine Unit
faxed them a report...

617
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:52,266
on the early morning tides
and wind currents.

618
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,844
Shows the body went in the water
west of the bridge and drifted out.

619
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,505
McNulty.

620
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:02,680
Fucking Jimmy.
Fucking with us for the fun of it.

621
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:07,057
I gotta give the son of a bitch
some credit for wit on this one.

622
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,826
- Cocksucker.
- Motherfucker.

623
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:31,172
The count is right. What's on the shelf?

624
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:35,150
Mace carrying 10 down here.
So, Moe Man holding about 38 up top.

625
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:38,188
I checked the stash, and we way low.

626
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,280
- Moe Man taking our shit.
- What he holding?

627
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,485
He say he holds about 30-something,
but I know that ain't right.

628
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:45,028
I'm gonna fuck him up.

629
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,290
First thing you think to do
is fuck a nigger up.

630
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:50,060
When your brick brain gonna realize
there's more to this...

631
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:52,261
than just thumpin' on niggers?

632
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,396
- What Moe supposed to be holding?
- 38, thereabout.

633
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,304
- Ain't you the damn fool?
- But then we low.

634
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:01,411
Look, nigger, if we low,
it 'cause String want us that way.

635
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:05,278
When he wants us up, we be up.
String is on top of the shit.

636
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,617
He on top of everything.

637
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,411
Go back to your spot, man.

638
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,224
Fucking McNulty.

639
00:53:26,271 --> 00:53:28,000
The Prince of Tides.

640
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,196
- Brother, you feeling strong today?
- Yeah.

641
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,899
See if you can get his ass out of that chair.

642
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:48,541
He said it was fine
if you wanted to hit him, too.

643
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,508
What's the first thing a guy from Local 47
does after he gets laid?

644
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:55,518
- What?
- Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.

645
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,754
Hey, Frank. Something's going on.

646
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:53,403
- It's fucking girls, man. Young ones.
- There's a dozen of them.

647
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:55,206
Dead? They're dead?
