00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,544
Something in particular?

3
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:24,713
- Funeral.
- I'm sorry.

4
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,290
No, funeral, you know?

5
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,485
No, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.

6
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:29,925
Yeah.

7
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:33,994
That's a popular one.

8
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:40,664
- Who was it that passed, a relation?
- No, we worked together.

9
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:45,608
- I see. A professional relationship.
- Yeah, professional.

10
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,508
I mean, we wasn't all that tight,
but he was still my nigger.

11
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,680
I think I'm on it. Follow me.

12
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,625
Hell, yeah, this what I'm talking about.

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,028
That gat and grip thing
over there sells a lot.

14
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:10,431
We can do that in white,
or red, or pink carnations.

15
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,630
- Pink?
- Your boy was too fierce for the pink?

16
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,536
No, he wasn't all that.

17
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:19,168
But when you stand with a nigger,
you stand with him to the end...

18
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:21,212
otherwise you ain't nothing yourself.

19
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,713
True that. How did your boy fall?

20
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:27,014
Hung himself.

21
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,487
Over at The Cut, strung himself up.

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,252
Judge ran wild on his ass, gave him 20.

23
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:38,493
I guess he couldn't handle
all those years, you know?

24
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:41,566
It's a weak-ass nigger
when you think about it.

25
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:45,694
But it ain't no reason to drag
his name down no further, you know?

26
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:53,471
I'll tell you what.
Let me get something in strong colors.

27
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,673
Red, black, whatever.
But make it look like one of the Towers...

28
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,376
down on Franklin Terrace.
You know, the high-rises.

29
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:02,613
You want the arrangement
to look like a high-rise housing project?

30
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:04,279
Hell, yeah.

31
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:08,250
And put the numbers 221
in big-ass numbers on the front.

32
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:11,624
All right? He used to have that
Fremont Tower for a while.

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,564
221, all right.
Anything else you want it to say?

34
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:18,160
Like what?

35
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,068
"Rest in peace," "In Remembrance,"
something like that?

36
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:24,233
Something that says
how you feel about the loss.

37
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:29,337
Look, man, fuck it, all right? Just...

38
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:37,043
Just make sure the Towers
look like they do, all right?

39
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,624
All right. Thanks.

40
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:25,160
- You cloned a what?
- A computer.

41
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,357
We can watch how the cargo
comes off the ship in real time...

42
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:31,595
try to follow the contraband,
see where it leads.

43
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,536
We're running a 25-murder-a-month
MASH Unit here...

44
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:40,203
and you guys wanna slow things down a bit,
and do a bit of brain surgery.

45
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:43,975
If Rawls comes walking through here
and sees the two of you hunched over...

46
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:47,483
playing video games on 14 open murders,
he's gonna blow!

47
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,918
That is exactly why we asked Lt. Daniels...

48
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:52,616
to set us up at his off-site,
over in the southeast.

49
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:56,558
They're looking at the dock boys
for other shit, drugs mostly.

50
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:00,260
- Daniels, who used to be in Narcotics?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:05,802
If Daniels has a detail set up already,
maybe he takes the murders, too.

52
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:09,772
He ain't no fool, Jay.
He's just giving us a room with no view.

53
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,978
That was approval, right?
He gave approval to go ahead with this.

54
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,554
I don't know.

55
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,750
What's next?

56
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:30,726
Next is for us to get them dock boys
back to thinking that we've gone away.

57
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:34,321
I mean, we spooked them right good
with that grand jury shit.

58
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,901
If we're gonna set up on them,
they need to think...

59
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,833
we ain't gonna be a problem no more.

60
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,132
How are they gonna think that?

61
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:45,199
No, see, that ain't the way it works.

62
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,402
It ain't.

63
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:50,208
'Cause I'm the one out here all day
taking the chance, right?

64
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:54,012
Police roll up into this bitch,
it ain't gonna be you that catch no charge.

65
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,451
So, least-wise, the thing you need to do...

66
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:59,888
is lay all that good shit
down on an even split.

67
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:03,791
Come Friday, me and my niggers
done sold all that shit off...

68
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,123
you come past and get paid.
That's how I'm at with it.

69
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:08,563
Hey, Frog.

70
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:12,333
Come here.

71
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,772
No, seriously. Come here.

72
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,714
First of all,
and I don't know how to tell you this...

73
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:25,976
without hurting you deeply...

74
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:30,282
first of all, you happen to be white.

75
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:33,883
I'm talking raised-on-Rapolla-Street white...

76
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:36,620
where your mama used to drag you down
to St. Casimir's...

77
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:40,129
just like all the other
little pisspants on the block.

78
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,900
Second, I'm also white.

79
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,599
Not hang-on-the-corner-
don't-give-a-fuck white...

80
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:51,198
but Locust-Point-l. B.S.-Local-47 white.

81
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,507
I don't work without no fucking contract...

82
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:57,776
and I don't stand around
listening to horseshit excuses...

83
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,784
like my cousin Ziggy, who, by the way...

84
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:05,289
is still owed money by you
and all your down, street-wise whiggers.

85
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:10,626
You go in your pocket,
come up with $500 in advance...

86
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:13,220
and the $210 that you owe to Zig...

87
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,334
you can work my package.

88
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:21,770
This is the shit you had out here last week.
The dimes that Moochie was slinging?

89
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,208
The shit was good. Moochie sold out quick.

90
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:30,078
All right.

91
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:37,947
I'm saying, I'm gonna send
my man around with the dollars.

92
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,786
- Keep it real.
- Whatever.

93
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:28,597
- Everything to your satisfaction?
- Yeah, you on it.

94
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:34,376
Prison people taking it that
that boy hung his own self, right?

95
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:35,774
Seems so.

96
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,346
My cousin always works clean.

97
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,153
None of my business, I know...

98
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:49,188
but did your man Avon even know about it?

99
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,400
You're on your own here?

100
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:01,800
You're right. It ain't none of your business.

101
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,038
And if I were you...

102
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:08,810
I wouldn't want a word of this mess
up in Avon's ear.

103
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,680
Baltimore niggers off the hook. I swear.

104
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,689
All y'all.

105
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:31,428
You better get up in this before it get cold.
This shit is good.

106
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:40,402
My man, that bullshit ain't on you.
It ain't, man.

107
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,913
Up in here, D knew he had to stand
on his own. You know this.

108
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,782
Man, fuck him.

109
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:53,413
He knew when he hung himself
how we was gonna carry it.

110
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:58,527
He knew when he did that, that we were
gonna be in a moment like this, right now.

111
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,964
He knew that.

112
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,331
That nigger did that shit to hurt me, man.

113
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,835
But, you know, man,
D was just fucking weak.

114
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,006
I tried to crimp him along
since he was a shorty, nigger.

115
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:17,104
I tried to bring him up, bring him along...

116
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,548
- You were real good to him.
- I was.

117
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,321
Man, it's sad, what happened.
That shit is sad.

118
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:29,254
But the boy almost
rolled on you that one time.

119
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:32,853
You know, he get to thinking
he can't do the years in here...

120
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:35,865
he might've could've rolled again.
Who knows?

121
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,828
I'm just saying...

122
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:41,536
it might've been for the best, you know?

123
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,709
His name is Head. Dick Head.

124
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:59,953
Check this out. Put your finger right there.

125
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,621
- Nice.
- Nice, right?

126
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,862
- Fellows.
- We need a bug.

127
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,263
Something that can stand up
to the pressures...

128
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,494
of the modern urban crime environment.

129
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,161
Let me show you.

130
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:21,604
Okay, fellows, this is the real deal.
Smaller than a 22.

131
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,272
And it's got a clear channel. Sturdy as hell.

132
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:28,944
You get this bad boy
within 10 feet of any conversation...

133
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,784
it sounds like Chuck Thompson
doing play-by-play.

134
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,824
- How much?
- $1,500.

135
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:40,229
But seeing as you're sworn officers,
the police discount drops it to $1,250.

136
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,567
- You in?
- Am I in?

137
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,035
The man just said $1,250, Herc.

138
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,169
Can we give it a test run?

139
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,507
A test drive in the modern
urban crime environment?

140
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:58,138
Yeah, leave me your credit card
and take it for 48 hours.

141
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,774
Change your mind, bring it back.
No problem.

142
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:03,479
- Let me consult my partner.
- Of course.

143
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,121
You got a credit card?

144
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:10,154
- Don't you?
- It's maxed to the max, man.

145
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:13,124
We've been doing
hand-to-hands for a while now...

146
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,961
and we ain't no higher up
on the ladder and on those corners.

147
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:20,800
We're just gonna use it for a couple days,
get what we need, and bring it back.

148
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,936
I gave your man some room, that's all.

149
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:30,876
You gave him a home.

150
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:34,911
Det. Moreland's target
looks to be the same as yours.

151
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,445
- No.
- Yes.

152
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:40,589
You could take these 14 homicides...

153
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:44,321
and turn that half-assed detail
you got going into something that matters.

154
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:47,990
I'll be honest. You solve the murders,
I'll love you for the stats.

155
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,626
And if you don't,
I've made it so the Homicide Unit...

156
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:56,171
doesn't have to bear the whole brunt
of a lower clearance rate.

157
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,204
It's win-win for me.

158
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,640
- No.
- Come on, Lieutenant.

159
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:06,273
A good turn here will not be forgotten.

160
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:10,411
I'm trying to dig myself out of the basement
with something simple and clean here.

161
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:13,320
Drug arrests,
maybe a prostitution bust if I get lucky...

162
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,949
and I'm out from under with Burrell.

163
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,919
Sorry, Colonel.

164
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,192
You keep the murders,
and my ass stays covered.

165
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:35,676
Smarter than he looks.

166
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,854
- Where's your friend?
- Who's that?

167
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:59,663
- The black fellow, the Homicide guy.
- Case is done, for all I know.

168
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:02,130
Yeah?

169
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,399
You all didn't go for nothing,
and no one on the ship did either.

170
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:09,302
So, he sent me back
and moved on to new business.

171
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:13,441
- So you back to the usual then?
- Yeah, the usual.

172
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:17,519
Except I won't be around Patapsco
or North Point much.

173
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,722
Starting tomorrow,
I'm down at the Fairfield Terminals.

174
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:21,985
Fairfield?

175
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:25,153
Yeah, bosses want another car
patrolling the chemical plants.

176
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,424
Because of terrorism, I guess.

177
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:31,325
You're too pretty
for the Fairfield Piers, darling.

178
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:33,927
You need to be uptown here with us.

179
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,050
You got stripes in the Southeast...

180
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:54,556
and can't pull Valchek's spy van
to work his own detail?

181
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,991
Man, I've never seen that thing.

182
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,125
- Snug.
- As a bug.

183
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,265
In a rug.

184
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:06,731
Let's go.

185
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,046
- This shit is hypnotic.
- Boring, too.

186
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,885
You make a show of it?

187
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,978
Let everyone working see me
in that radio car.

188
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,225
Is that the Valparaiso?

189
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:33,731
It ain't a Talco Line ship,
doesn't have Horseface working.

190
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,265
Probably wasting half a day
watching it offload.

191
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:39,996
- Yeah, we should be at the bar by now.
- Nothing's wasted.

192
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:44,268
I've been getting a feel for this shit.
How it plays and works without the dirt.

193
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,242
- So when they lose a can...
- I see it go.

194
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:54,474
Gentlemen. Ladies.

195
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,688
The future is now.

196
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,957
To bring goods
to an exploding global economy...

197
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,961
and to deliver those goods faster,
cheaper and safer...

198
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:09,727
modern robotics do much of the work
in the world's largest seaport, Rotterdam.

199
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:12,428
Moving cargo is a traditional
strength of the Dutch...

200
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:16,633
who shuttle more freight in fewer man-hours
than any port in the world.

201
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:20,268
And now, the Dutch have modeled
the future of cargo management.

202
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:23,313
Completely containerized cargo
arrives and departs...

203
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:27,748
on ships a third of a mile long,
24 hours a day, with short turnaround.

204
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:30,782
Smart card technology
provides greater security...

205
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:35,416
and improved accountability, with no need
for unreliable human surveillance.

206
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:38,686
Frog, man, we light five caps is all, man.

207
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,525
I'm saying, you getting all ridiculous
over bits and pieces. You feeling me?

208
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,692
Nigger, it's the principle of the thing.

209
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:47,293
It's like you in a store working the register...

210
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,566
and at the end of the day,
the shitjust add up.

211
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:52,700
Mad Dog gonna roll through here tomorrow
with the re-up...

212
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,301
and I want to have the package
right for once.

213
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,145
Hey, Carver.

214
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,683
Isn't technology the fucking bomb?

215
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:05,317
...and global positioning systems
guide each container...

216
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:07,721
to its proper spot,
on board or on the docks...

217
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:10,919
while state-of-the-art-computers
track shipments in every part...

218
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:13,963
Some of the systems you're seeing
have already been upgraded.

219
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:18,229
Rotterdam now works
350 million tons of cargo annually...

220
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:21,100
leaving Singapore a distant second.

221
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,265
What kind of man-hours
are the stevedores clocking over there?

222
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,538
I don't have those figures handy. I'm sorry.

223
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:30,245
But Rotterdam does employ 4,000 people.

224
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:34,284
4,000 people to move
350 million tons a year?

225
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,615
- That's right.
- That's efficiency, Nat.

226
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,121
By eliminating
some of the more dangerous work...

227
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,623
the Rotterdam technologies have reduced...

228
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:45,628
employee work-related accidents
and injuries by 60%.

229
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,324
I think we can all be happy
with that, can't we?

230
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:49,491
Question? Yes?

231
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,500
The GPS readings, are they exact...

232
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:54,196
You can't get hurt
if you ain't working, right?

233
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:57,399
No, they work with all kinds of cargo,
in all kinds of weather.

234
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:58,702
Coming.

235
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,381
- Hey, Jackie.
- String. You, too?

236
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,847
We got enough food
for three weeks right now.

237
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:09,710
How's Brianna? Is she back there?

238
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:13,521
What's up, little man?

239
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:21,792
How you holding up?

240
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:34,969
Bri.

241
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,064
- Nicky boy, you get days this week?
- No.

242
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:35,966
Four ships on Thursday.
You could've pulled a day for sure.

243
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:48,148
That's your half on the last two packages,
plus what Frog owed you on your own shit.

244
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,650
It's all there, cuz.

245
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,290
- What the fuck is wrong with you, smiley?
- Nothing.

246
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,294
What did Frog say?

247
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:07,269
"Here's a couple of hundred extra,
make the little goof happy"?

248
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,698
The packages were my thing, Nick.

249
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:13,242
Fuck, if you ain't handle
that business better, too.

250
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,971
Zig, we're making money.

251
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,154
It's your move, Nicky.

252
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:32,129
Fuck it. I got other issues right now.

253
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,068
Paternity?

254
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,967
Priscilla Katlow.

255
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:54,044
Jesus, Zig. You knocked up Prissy Katlow?

256
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,552
I only fucked her once.

257
00:20:56,921 --> 00:21:00,288
Christ, everybody down the point
fucked her the once.

258
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,919
How do you know it's yours?

259
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,527
You call this lawyer?

260
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,492
Figured I'd get drunk first.

261
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,798
That's a good plan.

262
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:41,692
- Russians?
- Lot of girls. Pretty ones.

263
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,935
Most of them had
some kind of accent anyway.

264
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,667
Shardene's friend hooked us up good.
Who's in charge?

265
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:52,140
You got the club people, I guess.

266
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:54,905
And there's some woman
I've seen go into the back room.

267
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,536
She looks a little bit older.

268
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:59,081
I couldn't get close enough
to say much about her.

269
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:00,912
She looks about 40.

270
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,418
Grab any ass, Prez?

271
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:15,490
What I'm saying is, I've sorted it out for us.

272
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,624
- I have.
- For us?

273
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:23,934
When I was in the basement,
it made sense to quit. It did.

274
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,766
But once Burrell reached out...

275
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:30,609
But Burrell is the one that you crossed.
He's not likely to forget that, is he?

276
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:34,948
Not to mention what he knows
about you from the bad old days.

277
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:40,515
Fools half your age
are gonna be Major and Colonel...

278
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:43,957
and you'll still think that
scratching out a case or two will save you.

279
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:46,825
It isn't about the casework, I know that.

280
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,496
Just today, Rawls calls me up to CID...

281
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:55,465
asks me to take his homicides from
the dead girls on that shipping container.

282
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,667
I told him, no shot. That case is a loser.

283
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,774
If I'm looking out for number one...

284
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,369
I'm gonna bring Burrell
exactly what he asked for...

285
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:06,644
and exactly what he needs
to make Stan Valchek go away.

286
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:10,847
No more, no less.
I'm playing their game this time.

287
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,617
Look, it's one thing you taking a run
at this dredging thing.

288
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:21,061
Fucked-up as you are,
we can let that slide for a while...

289
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,292
but now, you're asking too much.

290
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,765
One more year, Nat.

291
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,066
- Not for me, for the fucking union.
- The election's been scheduled.

292
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,572
You knew last year,
when we gave you the votes...

293
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:33,234
that this time would be Ott's turn.
You knew that.

294
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:36,336
So Ott runs next time.
He'll take that year and the next.

295
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,244
It's our turn, Frank.

296
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:41,543
Black, White, what's the difference, Nat?

297
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:45,281
Until we get that fucking canal dredged,
we're all niggers, pardon my French.

298
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:47,323
Or Polacks, pardon mine.

299
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:50,291
You know what I'm saying,
this ain't about Ott.

300
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:53,955
I just want one more year
to finish what I started here.

301
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:58,534
Then Ott stays Secretary-Treasurer
for the next two, no problem.

302
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:01,294
Think about it.

303
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,709
- Hello?
- Brucie, baby.

304
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:20,587
- Frankie Sobotka, how's it hanging?
- You talk to the presiding officers yet?

305
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:35,337
Lot of girls. Lot of muscle.

306
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,078
Zig, Jesus, get off me, you jerk.

307
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:48,474
- When did you get served with these?
- I got them in the mail this morning.

308
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:52,014
- In the mail?
- Yeah, this morning.

309
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,954
When Pokey Barber got hit with paternity...

310
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:01,862
a sheriff had to come to his house
and serve him with papers.

311
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:22,214
Dolores, can I use the bar phone?

312
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:27,551
- Who are you calling?
- The lawyer on this piece of bullshit.

313
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:32,227
What? Ain't no fucking law firm open
in the middle of the goddamn night.

314
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,530
Shyster, Shyster and Shyster.

315
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:01,082
- He got you, Zig.
- Who got me?

316
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,558
Maui?

317
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:11,467
Love child, never meant to be.

318
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:16,066
Love child, born in poverty.

319
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:20,275
Love child, never meant to be.

320
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:02,517
There's no restroom in the lobby,
and if you're not an approved visitor...

321
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:05,110
I just don't have the authorization.

322
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:07,649
Okay.

323
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:11,824
Tell me something.
When you have to go, where do you go?

324
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:14,653
Excuse me, sir? Are you a resident?

325
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,995
Sorry. Wrong building.

326
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,532
Sixth floor, all of them.

327
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,677
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa.

328
00:27:34,785 --> 00:27:37,447
Slated to be the ship-runner
on Talco Line's Esmeralda.

329
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:40,682
ETA, noon tomorrow,
Berth 6, Patapsco Terminal.

330
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:43,885
- So we're on.
- We're gonna need help with surveillance.

331
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:47,020
On the docks especially,
since our faces are known down there.

332
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:50,831
I can reach out to Greggs and Prez, maybe.
Bring them in on it.

333
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:53,129
Should we tell the Lieutenant?

334
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:58,097
Right now, the less he knows
he's involved in the murder investigation...

335
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,073
the happier he'll feel.

336
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:07,647
New truck?

337
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:11,520
What the fuck,
we're making money here, right?

338
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:13,453
- Hell, yeah.
- For real.

339
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:17,254
This guy's some kind of supplier.
Snap some shots of the truck tags.

340
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:21,327
- You got more for me?
- I got if you got for me, right?

341
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:25,926
Got to say, your thing is tight.
Best around here in a long while.

342
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,837
Fuck!

343
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:34,802
I'm with you on this, man...

344
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,940
All right, dawg.

345
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:02,394
Come on, asshole,
what the fuck's wrong with you?

346
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:04,337
Keep it fucking moving.

347
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,874
Jesus Christ!

348
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,049
No!

349
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,769
I cleared it with KGA, we'll
be working off of Channel 6.

350
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:37,178
Prez, you got the eyeball
on the outbound truck gate.

351
00:29:37,282 --> 00:29:40,877
Need you to set up so you can move
in either direction on Broening Highway.

352
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:43,477
Bunk, you set up on Newkirk and Broening.

353
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:47,615
Me and Russell will be on the computer.
That leaves the terminal itself to Kima.

354
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:51,492
They might not know my face,
but I sure as shit can't hang down there.

355
00:29:51,596 --> 00:29:54,963
I'm thinking I should borrow
that CG&E truck from Narcotics.

356
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,830
Slap on a hard hat, pick up a clipboard.

357
00:29:57,936 --> 00:30:00,962
What if they're not sneaking anything off
this time? What then?

358
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:05,941
Tragically, you will have wasted another day
in a life you've already misspent...

359
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:09,041
in the service of the city of Baltimore.

360
00:30:19,524 --> 00:30:22,857
- Nothing's alive in these, right?
- If they don't go hot to a truck...

361
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,987
you go back in the stacks
and bang on them to make sure.

362
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:28,327
I trust these Greek fucks with nothing.

363
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:33,262
- How you hanging?
- Good. I'm good.

364
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:35,998
You ain't been working much.

365
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:42,137
Stay close, Nick.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

366
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:52,080
Jesus on the main line.

367
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,886
Tell him what you want.

368
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:59,054
Oh, Jesus on the main line.

369
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:02,232
Tell him what you want

370
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:05,833
Jesus on the main line.

371
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:08,906
Tell him what you want.

372
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:14,042
Call him up and tell him what you want.

373
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:17,308
If you want salvation.

374
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,009
Tell him what you want.

375
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:24,111
Oh, if you want salvation.

376
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:27,350
Tell him what you want.

377
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:30,758
If you want salvation.

378
00:31:30,862 --> 00:31:33,888
Tell him what you want.

379
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:38,561
Call him up and tell him what you want.

380
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,863
Oh, call him up, call him up.

381
00:31:43,074 --> 00:31:45,440
Tell him what you want.

382
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:49,536
Oh, call him up, call him up.

383
00:31:49,648 --> 00:31:52,742
Tell him what you want.

384
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:56,216
Call him up, call him up.

385
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:59,290
Tell him what you want

386
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:04,460
Jesus on the main line.

387
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:13,096
You did the 221?

388
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:16,496
Shit look tight.

389
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,029
Sorry for the loss.

390
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:47,428
You all sent him off right, though.

391
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,973
As good a homecoming as I been to.

392
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:53,238
- You been to your share, man, I know.
- No doubt.

393
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:57,406
Of course, this is neither the time
nor the place...

394
00:32:57,515 --> 00:33:00,484
but I thought I might
get at you for a moment.

395
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,982
- Got a proposition here.
- Go ahead to the car, man.

396
00:33:09,461 --> 00:33:12,430
Ain't exactly talking out of turn when I say...

397
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,294
that, uh, Westside dope
been weak for a while now.

398
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,235
Every dope fiend in the city knows that
Avon been putting out piss, calling it shit.

399
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:24,841
The thing is, y'all sitting on
some of the best real estate in the city.

400
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:28,538
The Terrace, the low-rises,
the avenue corners.

401
00:33:28,646 --> 00:33:32,138
Respecting the fact that you're known
to have a way with your words...

402
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,946
when are you gonna tell me
something I don't know?

403
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:39,884
Let me put a point on it.
My shit is right, String.

404
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,985
I got dope coming straight into Baltimore,
and the shit is raw.

405
00:33:44,095 --> 00:33:47,758
85, 90%. And you know it's true.

406
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:50,926
You got half the Westside coming over
to Fallsway twice a day...

407
00:33:51,036 --> 00:33:54,472
because Eastside dope be kicking the shit
out of Westside dope.

408
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:57,803
- You connected?
- This shit is straight off the damn boat.

409
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:01,675
I ain't even going to New York
except for my coke. Ain't no need.

410
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,513
Thing is, y'all got the best territory,
and no kind of product.

411
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:11,053
I got the best product,
but could stand a little more territory...

412
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:13,181
so you see where this thing needs to go.

413
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,522
Now you know Avon fought real hard
for them Towers.

414
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:20,257
We took down the Rayford brothers,
Big Dennis Woodson, I mean...

415
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:24,529
This shit is just business, String.
Buy for a dollar, sell for two.

416
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:28,436
That's all it need be. You got the Towers,
I got what goes in them.

417
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,633
Later for all that bullshit.

418
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,513
- I'll talk to Avon.
- You do that.

419
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,361
Come on, I can read a budget summary.
There's nothing in there for dredging.

420
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:03,202
Shortfall in revenues.
The governor's looking to limit bond issues.

421
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:06,573
- But the grain pier is still in there.
- And the rest is just talk?

422
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:09,738
Talk is good, Frank. Talk is a start.

423
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:12,408
Talk is your fucking job description.

424
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:14,144
Yak. Yak. Yak. Blah. Blah. Blah.

425
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:18,889
That's like saying all the checkers do
is punch numbers into a computer.

426
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,454
Your son, the oldest one,
he goes to what school?

427
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:29,299
- Jason's at Princeton.
- Princeton.

428
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:32,966
And after he graduates,
he's gonna do what?

429
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:35,963
- Whatever he wants.
- Right.

430
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:40,404
You sent him to Princeton
to do whatever the fuck he wants.

431
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,551
You know, back when we were kids...

432
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:52,716
Danny Hare's father stole
a couple cases of cognac off a ship.

433
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:56,385
Except when he gets it home,
it ain't cognac, it's Tang.

434
00:35:57,896 --> 00:36:00,228
- Tang?
- Just invented.

435
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,193
TV said it's what the astronauts drank
on their way to the moon.

436
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:07,567
- You drink it...
- You could be an astronaut, too.

437
00:36:08,273 --> 00:36:11,174
All summer long,
that shit was all the Hare kids drank.

438
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,767
Tang with breakfast, Tang with lunch...

439
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:17,143
Tang when they woke up scared
in the middle of the night.

440
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:19,808
What do you think they grew up to be?

441
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:24,249
Stevedores. What the fuck you think?

442
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,415
Something tells me
Jason DiBiago will grow up...

443
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:31,324
and squeeze a buck
the way his old man did.

444
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:33,887
You're out of line, Frank.

445
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:41,070
My great-grandfather was a knife sharpener.

446
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:44,671
Pushed a grinding stone up
Preston Street to Alice-Ann...

447
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:47,370
one leg shorter than the other
from pumping the wheel.

448
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:50,276
Since he didn't want his sons
to push the goddamn thing...

449
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:52,849
he made sure my grandfather
finished high school...

450
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:55,613
and my old man went to any college
that would take him.

451
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,585
You're talking history, right?

452
00:37:00,325 --> 00:37:01,952
I'm talking now.

453
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:06,155
Down here, it's still: "Who's your old man?"
'til you got kids of your own.

454
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:08,391
Then it's, "Who's your son?"

455
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:11,900
But after the horror movie I've seen today...
Robots!

456
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:15,067
Piers full of robots!

457
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,907
My kid will be lucky if he's
punching numbers five years from now.

458
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,208
While it don't mean shit that I can't take
my steak knives to DiBiago and sons...

459
00:37:23,314 --> 00:37:27,978
it breaks my heart that there's no future
for the Sobotkas on the waterfront.

460
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:37,722
Here, Brucie. I think they're your size.

461
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:50,971
I'm operating under the assumption that
because of your relentless diligence...

462
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:54,670
the funding for the grain pier
is gonna pass the assembly.

463
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:03,313
But I'm also talking about the canal.
So you're gonna talk about the canal...

464
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:06,584
the Muldoons who run the old line state
are gonna talk about it...

465
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:09,558
until some day, some way,
that motherfucker gets dredged...

466
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,891
and we get some ships in here.

467
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,219
Bring it down!

468
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:08,508
- Got one that disappeared.
- Get the container number?

469
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,646
- 11-37 to 12-14.
- Go ahead, Lester.

470
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:15,783
- We got one, you prepared to copy?
- Send it.

471
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:19,095
Zulu, Tango, Golf, Romeo...

472
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:23,395
9, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5, check digit 9.

473
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:26,460
Copy that, I've got it in the yard.

474
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:29,138
- 11-99.
- 11-99.

475
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,975
We got a live one. Be up.

476
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:34,670
- What am I looking for?
- Stand by on that.

477
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:38,044
Be advised, I've got a White male,
orange safety vest...

478
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:39,616
blue overalls.

479
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:44,245
He's hooking the truck onto the...
What do you call it?

480
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,615
Copy that. What next?

481
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:51,258
One of two things.
The driver takes it through checkout...

482
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:54,991
in which case it may be that Horseface
entered the wrong container number...

483
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,796
and they find it there.
Or it goes out to Bobtail Lane.

484
00:39:59,704 --> 00:40:02,434
If it does that, they're doing the dirt.

485
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:04,966
11-37 to 12-14.

486
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:08,341
Kima, keep the eyeball
until it clears the yard.

487
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:11,643
Advise if it stops at the checkout point,
or goes straight out.

488
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:12,807
Copy.

489
00:40:19,824 --> 00:40:23,089
12-14. He went around the checkout. Copy.

490
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:28,062
- 11-37 to 11-99.
- 99.

491
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,031
Target's coming at you, you see it?

492
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:36,336
I got him on Broening,
heading west towards the city.

493
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:40,643
Copy, 11-37 to 11-34.

494
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:44,044
- Target approaching your 20.
- 11-34, copy that.

495
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,041
I got him going straight on Newkirk.

496
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,790
- He's all yours, Bunk.
- Copy.

497
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:11,471
- 11-34, you got the eyeball.
- Copy.

498
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,826
- 11-34.
- Go ahead, 34.

499
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:43,865
He went to ground off of Newkirk.
Some kind of warehouse.

500
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:47,037
Wait one. I'll swing back, get a 20.

501
00:41:56,988 --> 00:41:59,252
Be advised, it is a warehouse.

502
00:41:59,357 --> 00:42:03,157
Pyramid lnc. 5605 Newkirk.

503
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,827
Copy that.

504
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,371
Brianna, man, she putting it on you?

505
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:23,405
Avon, you knew he was using?

506
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:27,849
I seen it, but I didn't see it.

507
00:42:29,086 --> 00:42:31,554
I mean, he came up off that shit...

508
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:35,092
then we did our thing with the guard,
and I thought...

509
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:43,096
Fuck.

510
00:42:44,702 --> 00:42:49,036
We did our thing with the homegoing, man.
I mean, it came off nice.

511
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:51,775
- Yeah?
- Yeah, everybody showed.

512
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:57,379
- How did Brianna do?
- Rough.

513
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:03,046
Don't nobody want shit like this
to happen, man.

514
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:06,146
If I'd have known the boy was
gonna be doing shit like that...

515
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:09,317
- you know what I mean?
- What are the prison people saying?

516
00:43:09,427 --> 00:43:11,918
That he just hung himself like that?

517
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:17,764
Just tied a rope around a knob,
and sat his ass down.

518
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:30,310
How the fuck you gonna stop a man
from doing some shit like that?

519
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:33,382
What are you gonna do?

520
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:36,976
Stay with him every damn minute,
every day you can?

521
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:39,750
He gonna find a way if he wants to.

522
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:43,017
It ain't on you.

523
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:48,628
It ain't on you. I would tell you if it was.

524
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:11,978
What's up with that other thing, man?

525
00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:16,048
Still shit, man. Your man in Atlanta
don't know what raw is.

526
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:20,764
- We gonna discount it.
- Do I look like Kmart to you, man?

527
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:23,925
- I'm saying, I mean...
- What are you saying? That's ridiculous.

528
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:26,230
Re-package it and sell it off.

529
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:29,670
You know, Proposition Joe
came to the funeral.

530
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:33,568
Pulled me aside. He's got a smoker.
Everybody knows he's got a smoker...

531
00:44:33,678 --> 00:44:37,341
and he wants to share,
if we cut him a slice of the Towers.

532
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:41,516
- You know, it's a thought...
- It's not even a thought, man. No.

533
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:45,350
Let me tell you something. We're gonna
get through all this, you hear me?

534
00:44:45,456 --> 00:44:47,617
- I know.
- All of it.

535
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,895
Anything come out?

536
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:03,133
If there were girls in that can,
they're still inside.

537
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:13,782
- Your DNRs go where?
- Phones for dockworkers local.

538
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:16,910
Offices, personal phones
for a couple of union officials.

539
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:21,754
Look here, 9581737
is listed to Thomas Pakusa.

540
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,755
On February 4th, and March 16th...

541
00:45:24,862 --> 00:45:28,320
our Mr. Pakusa received a call
from Frank Sobotka's cell phone.

542
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:31,458
And both times, he works
a Talco Line ship the next day.

543
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:34,163
And both times,
a can goes missing in the computer.

544
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:36,466
Pretty good argument for a conspiracy case.

545
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:39,236
- Conspiracy to do what?
- Smuggle shit.

546
00:45:40,778 --> 00:45:41,904
Smuggle what?

547
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:45,470
For starters, how about bringing girls
here for purposes of prostitution?

548
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:49,417
- That one we know about.
- You need to do better for a wiretap.

549
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:57,427
Read your annotated code.
Wiretap Statute, Subsection 10, 406...

550
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:00,929
designates crimes where telephonic
communication can be intercepted...

551
00:46:01,031 --> 00:46:04,023
in the great state of Maryland. Prostitution?

552
00:46:04,735 --> 00:46:08,068
You mean, you can tap a guy's phone
if he's selling drugs...

553
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:10,402
but if he's selling women,
he's out of bounds?

554
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:11,998
That's the law.

555
00:46:13,477 --> 00:46:15,536
Honey, I'm home.

556
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,318
Start looking at the two-bedroom joints.

557
00:46:25,422 --> 00:46:27,890
- We can pay.
- How?

558
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,585
- Got a new job.
- Off the docks?

559
00:46:34,331 --> 00:46:39,234
Three, four days a week.
Warehouse foreman for this Greek guy.

560
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:43,368
He owns an appliance store
down the avenue in Highland Town.

561
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:47,141
I can work it around the hours
that I pick up at the docks.

562
00:46:47,244 --> 00:46:48,734
How much, Nick?

563
00:46:51,015 --> 00:46:53,040
Come here.

564
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:03,125
Like $500 a week. Maybe more.

565
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:08,428
But steady. You know, we can count on it.

566
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:11,834
Between what you make
with them scissors and this...

567
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:14,996
we can pay down the truck
and still have enough left over...

568
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:18,632
for someplace nice out in the county.

569
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:29,881
$1,500.

570
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:33,622
$1,250, with the police discount.

571
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:38,717
It just couldn't stand up to
the modern urban crime environment.

572
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:43,329
All right, slow up. This is it.

573
00:47:43,968 --> 00:47:47,768
It's listed to Nicholas Andrew Sobotka,
1485 Reynold Street.

574
00:47:58,649 --> 00:48:02,016
- Sobotka?
- That's what it says here.

575
00:48:03,787 --> 00:48:05,778
That mean anything to you?

576
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:11,852
Beavis, that's the name of the guy
we're supposed to be working.

577
00:48:11,962 --> 00:48:13,452
Frank Sobotka.

578
00:48:15,132 --> 00:48:16,656
But we got Nicholas.

579
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:21,033
How many fucking Sobotkas can there be,
even down here in Polack town?

580
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,438
- You know what this means?
- What?

581
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:29,242
It means old fuzzy Dunlop here
is somewhat worse for wear, I admit...

582
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:32,873
it's really gonna start paying off
as a confidential informant.

583
00:48:32,983 --> 00:48:35,952
- No fucking way.
- Are you out $1,250?

584
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,853
Because linking a street-level drug connect
to our main target...

585
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:42,289
has to be worth $200 for starters.

586
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:47,855
Listen, if I try to register him,
Daniels will smell a rat.

587
00:48:48,732 --> 00:48:52,168
He trusts you, Carv.
You got that trustworthy look.

588
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,164
It's you, Lester. Got to be you.

589
00:48:57,608 --> 00:49:00,236
- Me?
- We need to bring in the Lieutenant...

590
00:49:00,344 --> 00:49:03,609
his detail and all the manpower
and toys that go with it.

591
00:49:03,714 --> 00:49:06,308
And Daniels listens when you talk.

592
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,317
You got the smell of wisdom
on you, brother.

593
00:49:13,123 --> 00:49:16,718
- We all got roles to play.
- What's your role?

594
00:49:18,562 --> 00:49:21,827
I'm just a humble motherfucker
with a big-ass dick.

595
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,100
You give yourself too much credit.

596
00:49:25,202 --> 00:49:28,035
Okay, then. I ain't all that humble.

597
00:49:49,493 --> 00:49:51,461
I'll be goddamned.

598
00:50:11,615 --> 00:50:14,641
I swear to God, if he plays
that goddamn song one more time...

599
00:50:14,752 --> 00:50:16,617
I'm gonna clock his ass good.

600
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,348
You can take him, Zig. He just looks big.

601
00:50:19,456 --> 00:50:22,050
Who the fuck is he? All pussy.

602
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:25,959
You're a legend of the docks, Zig.
A fucking legend.

603
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:29,132
You think I can take him?

604
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,592
You can take him.

605
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:39,532
- Man down, berth five.
- Who?

606
00:50:39,643 --> 00:50:41,042
New Charles.

607
00:50:49,086 --> 00:50:51,748
- Ambo's on the way.
- Jesus Christ.

608
00:50:51,855 --> 00:50:54,289
Night work with break-bulk. I hate this shit.

609
00:50:54,391 --> 00:50:57,121
- You guys gonna move this thing or what?
- Jesus. Fuck.

610
00:50:57,227 --> 00:50:59,161
Ain't supposed to move a guy
when he's hurt.

611
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:01,424
We'll remember that
when you hit the number.

612
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:03,727
Quit pulling your dicks
and get this thing off of me.

613
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:05,461
One, two, three.

614
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:11,031
Charlie, here. Take a drag.

615
00:51:17,381 --> 00:51:19,781
That's the ambo you're hearing, Charlie.

616
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:22,046
Right over there.

617
00:51:23,454 --> 00:51:26,355
Don't worry, kid, you're still on the clock.

618
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:32,359
Frank, how does the leg look?

619
00:51:38,702 --> 00:51:42,433
- Which leg is that now?
- Sir, can you hear my voice?

620
00:51:44,007 --> 00:51:45,565
Squeeze my hand.

621
00:51:47,478 --> 00:51:49,844
Let's get him into the ambulance.

622
00:51:50,147 --> 00:51:52,479
You need to clear the way for us, guys.

623
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,217
- And you followed the can?
- Right to the warehouse.

624
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,414
- Surveillance set up?
- Kima is on it tonight.

625
00:52:00,257 --> 00:52:03,090
This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.

626
00:52:03,193 --> 00:52:05,525
I know it began for you as a bullshit detail...

627
00:52:05,629 --> 00:52:10,089
but this Sobotka's into some shit
that needs to be worked by good police.

628
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,929
The DNRs, the cloned computer.
We've got the pattern.

629
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:19,504
Rawls came to me.

630
00:52:20,277 --> 00:52:23,474
- Asked if I would take the homicides.
- You should.

631
00:52:23,747 --> 00:52:28,480
Those girls in the can really suffocated.
They really died in that fucking box.

632
00:52:31,688 --> 00:52:34,953
You pick this case up,
you might eat those open murders.

633
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:36,923
But you let it pass...

634
00:52:37,027 --> 00:52:40,791
you got to ask yourself how you
want to live your day-to-day.

635
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:09,091
From the guys in 15-14.

636
00:53:24,975 --> 00:53:26,840
He should be all right.

637
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,710
You know how he got the name
New Charles?

638
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:36,318
First day of work was the same day...

639
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,719
the Paceco dropped a hatch cover
on Charlie Bannion.

640
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,723
Had to clean up old Charlie with a shovel.

641
00:53:43,293 --> 00:53:46,319
Ever since then, New Charles.

642
00:53:48,865 --> 00:53:50,799
He's gonna lose the leg.

643
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:04,746
Where's the money from?

644
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:22,826
I got your murders.
But what I need from you, I get.

645
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:26,535
No bullshit, no arguments.

646
00:54:28,138 --> 00:54:29,571
No arguments.

647
00:54:41,952 --> 00:54:44,580
- You're wasting all the batteries.
- So?

648
00:54:44,688 --> 00:54:47,179
Mom, he's wasting all the batteries.

649
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:50,920
You two get along
or I'm gonna take that tent down right now.

650
00:54:51,028 --> 00:54:52,518
- Snitch.
- Punk.

651
00:54:52,996 --> 00:54:54,588
- Squirrel.
- Mope.

652
00:54:55,098 --> 00:54:58,124
- Shut up.
- Who teaches them this stuff?

653
00:54:58,402 --> 00:55:01,394
It's my turn, you just had it.

654
00:55:03,874 --> 00:55:05,068
Elena.

655
00:55:06,877 --> 00:55:08,037
No.

656
00:55:15,118 --> 00:55:16,745
I don't trust you.

657
00:55:20,157 --> 00:55:22,022
I can care about you...

658
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:25,461
and I can want us to be friends...

659
00:55:25,896 --> 00:55:28,592
and if you give me enough time, Jimmy...

660
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:31,600
maybe I will actually want you to be happy.

661
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:38,206
But how the hell
am I supposed to trust you?

662
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:40,600
Mom, quick, it's a spider.

663
00:55:42,012 --> 00:55:43,877
It's a big, hairy one.

664
00:55:44,147 --> 00:55:46,115
- Oh, my gosh.
- Come on, Mom.

665
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:10,364
But if the case does come together,
I would at least have Rawls as a rabbi.

666
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,733
It could still work for me.

667
00:56:13,243 --> 00:56:15,040
Listen to yourself.

668
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,711
I love the job, Marla.

669
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:22,550
- I can't help it.
- The job doesn't love you.

670
00:56:25,088 --> 00:56:26,851
You know what I love?

671
00:56:29,393 --> 00:56:32,294
The mind that's always a step ahead of me...

672
00:56:32,963 --> 00:56:35,989
the person who never stops
thinking it through.

673
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,693
That's what I fell in love with first.

674
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:42,996
Do you know what I fell in love with first?
Do you?

675
00:56:44,674 --> 00:56:46,266
Your ambition.

676
00:56:48,478 --> 00:56:50,378
Where did that man go?
