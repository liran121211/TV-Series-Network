1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,743
Yo, the shit is late.

2
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,642
They're still vialing up.

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,112
Usually come off the train street-ready,
but this time they gotta vial.

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,377
Y'all got any testers, man?

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,951
-Yeah, later.
-Later?

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,380
Got any testers, man?

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,752
Nigger, it ain't even 9:00,
and you fiending on it.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,984
Get the fuck out of here, man. Damn.

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,156
Why you act like that?

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,659
What, for these junkie motherfuckers?

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,826
So you just gonna take his money all day
and treat him like a dog?

12
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,960
-How I'm supposed to treat him?
-I don't know.

13
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,869
-But you ain't got to punk him like that.
-He punked himself.

14
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,375
He's a goddamn drug addict.
And you a goddamn drug dealer.

15
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,204
So? So what?

16
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,141
What, the customer's always right?

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,184
We're in the projects.

18
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,880
The customer be fucked up.
You can't give these niggers shit, man.

19
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,489
Why not? Why can't you?

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,521
Shit, everything else in the world get sold
without people taking advantage.

21
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,623
Scamming, lying, doing each other dirty.

22
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,997
-Why has it got to be that way with this?
-'Cause they dope fiends.

23
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,472
Yeah, but the game
ain't gotta be played like that.

24
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,610
You can't tell me this shit can't get done
without people beating on each other...

25
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,374
killing each other,
doing each other like dogs.

26
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,246
Without all that...

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,513
you ain't got 5-0 here on our backs
every five minutes...

28
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,822
-throwing us around and shit.
-Shit, man.

29
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,825
You think 5-0 would care
about niggers getting high?

30
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,224
In the projects?

31
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,320
Man, 5-0 be down here
about the bodies.

32
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,161
That's what they be
down here about, the bodies.

33
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,828
-Squires, young squires.
-What you want, nigger?

34
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,172
A little bag of styles, man,
a little bag of styles for you.

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,601
Check it out.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,674
Only $5, what's up with that?

37
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,219
$5 make you
a gallant motherfucker, right there, boy.

38
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,987
Him, we know.

39
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,753
What are we facing from the riot?

40
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,455
Three witnesses' statements...

41
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,760
all of them saying the officer's assault...

42
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,630
on the youth was unprovoked.

43
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,293
You know how that goes, Commissioner.

44
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:09,134
People's idea of police brutality is
whenever we win a fight.

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,707
What does the state's attorney say?

46
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,469
He says it goes to a grand jury.

47
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:14,306
That's him doing Pontius Pilate.

48
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:17,540
The grand jury doesn't indict,
he looks clean for passing the buck.

49
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,775
-And if they do indict?
-They won't.

50
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:23,643
Criminal histories on
our three witnesses...

51
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,654
one longer than the next.

52
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,485
Drugs, weapons, assault...

53
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:28,786
more drugs.

54
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,157
Shitbirds throwing dirt at good police.

55
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,059
Just the same, Lieutenant...

56
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:34,131
I want you to rethink...

57
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,565
whatever tactic led you to send
three plainclothes officers...

58
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:42,105
to do field interviews at the high-rises
at 2:00 in the morning.

59
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,842
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,206
I take it your people have union counsel?

61
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:48,779
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,373
Sir, I would request...

63
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:53,579
that pending the grand jury review...

64
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,653
Officer Pryzbylewski be placed
on administrative leave.

65
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,985
I can use him in-office,
but we shouldn't have him on the street...

66
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,353
until the grand jury signs off.

67
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:06,328
That's putting our tail between our legs.
I think our official stance has to be...

68
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,125
he did nothing wrong out there.

69
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,029
A 14-year-old is half-blind.

70
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:12,159
And two of ours were injured as well.

71
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,467
Goddamn right.
They were fucking shooting at us out there.

72
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,071
Bobby, what do you think?

73
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:19,870
Keep him off the streets...

74
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,945
until it clears the courthouse.

75
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:24,979
Okay, then, we'll wait on the grand jury.

76
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,956
Lieutenant. A moment, please.

77
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:39,556
What happened out there?

78
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,999
Did you know they were in the high-rises
without backup?

79
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,033
If I tell you yes...

80
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,334
I screwed up.

81
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,905
If I tell you no...

82
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,102
I'm putting my men in the jackpot.

83
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:57,014
Do you still want me to answer?

84
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:04,354
I screwed up, sir.

85
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:06,616
Good man,
willing to take one for the company.

86
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,089
To hell with the company.

87
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:10,456
I'm defending my own people here,
that's all.

88
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:14,622
What Major Valchek means to say
is that he's grateful that you...

89
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:18,133
extended your support
on behalf of Officer Pryzbylewski.

90
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:20,533
-Fuck-up that he is.
-He should be off the street.

91
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,469
What can I say? The kid needs...

92
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,905
a little guidance, a little supervision.

93
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,707
Stan here thought that if he got
a young officer back on the street...

94
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:29,939
where he might start over--

95
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,447
A new unit, a new lieutenant.

96
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,418
-You know, that it might bring him around.
-I understand he messed up here.

97
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,885
I understand that.

98
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,657
Which is why I'm saying to you...

99
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:41,850
I owe you...

100
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,484
for walking him
through this grand jury thing.

101
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,927
And to compensate,
Southeastern is sending you...

102
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,364
two new unmarked units,
and a surveillance van.

103
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:52,129
Plus, you need manpower...

104
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,898
while these guys are busy
with this lID thing...

105
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,370
all you do is ask.

106
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,072
Lieutenant.

107
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,673
So I've got suction with you, Valchek?

108
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,975
That's what I'm saying.

109
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,079
Deputy, always a pleasure.

110
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,957
A necessary evil.

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,400
-What?
-Valchek.

112
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:27,599
Is it insubordinate
if I ask what's so necessary?

113
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,841
Thanks for not cutting Pryzbylewski loose.

114
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,938
If you had, the department would be caught
between Valchek and city hall.

115
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,480
I owe you for that.

116
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:39,513
This Barksdale...

117
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,012
he's dug in.

118
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:43,453
It may take more than buy-bust.

119
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,818
And since it's been
in the press about the witness--

120
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,288
It's not an issue.

121
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,460
Keep it a tight little circle.

122
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:54,758
Give me three weeks of good street work
and you'll see this through.

123
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:57,663
A couple of felony warrants,
a little dope on the table.

124
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,429
That's all we need here.

125
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:03,598
Under no circumstances
is it accurate to suggest...

126
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,973
that this particular homicide
was the result of the victim...

127
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,512
having been a witness in an earlier case.

128
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:13,073
Reports to the contrary
are without factual merit.

129
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:18,188
Are you saying that you know definitely
that this man was not killed...

130
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,483
because he testified?

131
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,682
We think that...

132
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,156
I mean, that is...

133
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,727
we're looking into the
possibility that Mr. Gant...

134
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,888
was involved in a street dispute.

135
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,655
Which, of course,
would have nothing to do...

136
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,200
with his being a witness...

137
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,066
in an unrelated case
that concluded weeks ago.

138
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,336
But you haven't developed
a suspect at this time?

139
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,237
No, we haven't.

140
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,746
Bunk, shame on you, lad.

141
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:45,341
What did you expect him to do?

142
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:46,780
I don't know, grab the mike...

143
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:49,375
shove Rawls to the ground,
declare that all of Baltimore...

144
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,752
should rise as one because
they're murdering witnesses in cold blood.

145
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,223
That sounds more like one of your moves.

146
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,657
Been working on him two weeks,
we don't even have a photo.

147
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:03,461
It's fucking embarrassing.

148
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:05,997
Hey, Pat.

149
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,705
We got a job for you guys
to try to run down.

150
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:10,774
What is it?

151
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,934
We need a photo of this guy, Barksdale.

152
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,670
We need to know what he looks like.

153
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,976
-So go down to the B of l.
-You see, that's the problem, guys.

154
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:20,073
Barksdale's never been arrested
as an adult...

155
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,049
so we don't really have a B of I photo.

156
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:25,589
He had his juvenile record expunged,
so there's no photo there either.

157
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,122
Then you're fucked.

158
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,154
Yeah, we are.

159
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:36,162
But seeing as we all came into work today,
I thought, let's try something different.

160
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,659
We know from his mother's
social service record...

161
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,568
that Barksdale grew up
in Franklin Terrace, right?

162
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:45,337
It occurred to me...

163
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:48,536
being vaguely familiar
with the high-rises of West Baltimore...

164
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,206
that the housing project
began to take photos...

165
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:54,148
of every registered resident
as a security measure.

166
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:57,485
-Am I correct, Detective Greggs?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:00,416
So you want us to go down
to the housing department...

168
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:02,617
-and pull his photo.
-Excellent.

169
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:07,187
You know, you and l, we think as one. We're
like two horses together in a harness.

170
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,962
Why don't you fucking do it yourself?

171
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:14,660
Sure, if you don't mind sitting in my desk,
reviewing homicide folders...

172
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:17,900
taking meticulous notes,
trying to run down a few new leads.

173
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:20,568
It's boring, painstaking work,
but if you don't want...

174
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:23,545
to travel to the housing department,
I'll switch with you.

175
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,884
Fuck it, Patrick. Let's take a ride.

176
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:41,129
-That was inspiring.
-I'm a leader of men.

177
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,575
-What's up with shop?
-No re-up.

178
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,643
-Why not?
-'Cause we out of red caps.

179
00:10:57,748 --> 00:10:59,841
Stink say we gonna have
a new package tomorrow.

180
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,076
New package?

181
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,649
Yeah, man, this weak-ass stepped-on shit
we got out here...

182
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:06,416
get these fiends agitated.

183
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:08,457
Look at them, they still buying it, though.

184
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,017
Yes, they're buying twice as much
and only getting half as high.

185
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:13,996
What was that?

186
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,031
Castle can't move like that.

187
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,295
Castle move up and down or sideways like.

188
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:23,305
-No, we ain't playing that.
-Look at the board, we're playing checkers.

189
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,405
-Checkers?
-Yeah, checkers.

190
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,668
Why're y'all playing checkers
on a chess set?

191
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:28,938
Why do you give a shit?

192
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,673
Man, we ain't got no checkers.

193
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:33,079
Yeah, but chess is a better game.

194
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,217
So?

195
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,418
No, hold up.

196
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,520
Y'all don't know
how to play chess, do you?

197
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:41,147
-So?
-So, nothing, man.

198
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:44,455
-I'll teach y'all if you want to learn.
-Come on, man. No, come on.

199
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:47,655
-We're right in the middle of a game.
-Chill out, I want to see this.

200
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,256
Y'all can't be
playing no checkers on no chessboard.

201
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,629
All right, man.

202
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,260
Look, check it, it's simple.

203
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:56,330
See this?

204
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,175
This is the kingpin.

205
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,372
And he the man.

206
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:04,474
You get the other dude's king,
you got the game.

207
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:07,709
But he's trying to get your king, too,
so you gotta protect it.

208
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:10,582
Now the king, he moves one space...

209
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,521
any direction he damn choose,
'cause he's the king.

210
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,850
Like this, all right?

211
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,552
But he ain't got no hustle...

212
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:19,822
but the rest of these
motherfuckers on the team...

213
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,731
they got his back.

214
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:23,831
And they run so deep,
he really ain't gotta do shit.

215
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:26,698
-Like your uncle.
-Yeah, like my uncle.

216
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:29,538
You see this? This is the queen.

217
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,505
She's smart and she's fierce.

218
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:34,672
She moves any way she wants,
as far as she wants.

219
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:37,972
And she is the go-get-shit-done piece.

220
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,274
Remind me of Stringer.

221
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:43,545
And this, over here, is the castle.

222
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,082
It's like the stash.

223
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,524
It moves like this.

224
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,390
And like this.

225
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,061
Dog, stash don't move, man.

226
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:54,488
Come on, think.

227
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:56,862
How many times we move
the stash house this week?

228
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,060
And every time we move the stash...

229
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,637
we got to move a little muscle with it
to protect it.

230
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,229
True, you're right.

231
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:07,138
All right. What about them little
bald-headed bitches right there?

232
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,711
These right here.

233
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,613
These are the pawns.
They're like the soldiers.

234
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:16,118
They move like this,
one space forward only...

235
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:17,651
except when they fight.

236
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,779
Then it's like...

237
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,447
or like this.

238
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:23,520
And they like the front lines.
They be out in the field.

239
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,458
So how do you get to be the king?

240
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:26,993
It ain't like that.

241
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:30,331
See, the king stays the king, all right?

242
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,225
Everything stays who he is...

243
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:33,826
except for the pawns.

244
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,268
Now if a pawn...

245
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:38,373
makes it all the way down
to the other dude's side...

246
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,067
he gets to be queen.

247
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:43,976
And like I said, the queen ain't no bitch.

248
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:45,914
She got all the moves.

249
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,483
All right, so...

250
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:51,016
if I make it to the other end, I win?

251
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:55,885
If you catch the other dude's king
and trap it, then you win.

252
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,457
But if I make it to the end...

253
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,593
I'm top dog.

254
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:02,796
No, it ain't like that, look.

255
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,762
The pawns, man, in the game...

256
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,295
they get capped quick.

257
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,636
They be out of the game early.

258
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:14,775
Unless they're some smart-ass pawns.

259
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:24,849
Nagras. Can you fucking believe this?

260
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,151
This shit is prehistoric.

261
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:29,817
What else have they got
down there in Property?

262
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:33,294
Eight-tracks? Victrolas?
That fucking department's a joke.

263
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:34,989
We got to get with the feds somehow.

264
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:38,262
They got light-weights,
wireless micro-recorders.

265
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:40,262
Yeah, DEA got those.

266
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,665
If I wear this on a warm day,
they're gonna know.

267
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,298
Even if they do a half-assed search,
I'm done.

268
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:46,376
Nagras.

269
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,742
Jesus.

270
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,144
You can't send his ass into the projects
with this shit taped to him.

271
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:52,806
That ain't gonna play.

272
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,274
I'm saying.

273
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:55,874
McNulty and the girl...

274
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,216
the lezzer from narcotics,
they've got the file.

275
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:00,552
-Who are you partnered with?
-McNulty.

276
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:05,318
But he don't have shit to do with me and I
don't want nothing to do with him neither.

277
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:09,725
Major, I'm a fifth wheel
on a car that's going nowhere.

278
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:11,662
Bring me home.

279
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:13,729
Soon enough.

280
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:17,271
Look, you're my eyes and ears
in this mess, right?

281
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,434
And I don't want no more surprises,
like that newspaper article.

282
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,978
If McNulty's planning
any more bullshit like that...

283
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,277
I got to be able to tell the deputy
before the shit flies.

284
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,479
Then you come home
with a favor in your pocket.

285
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,050
How bad is that?

286
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:03,178
Lieutenant.

287
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,351
You get Carver and Prez back tomorrow,
but Prez is in-office.

288
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,926
No police powers, no street work, nothing.

289
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:13,858
If the building catches fire,
he stays in the office.

290
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:16,694
-What about Herc?
-Medical, until Monday at least.

291
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:25,108
I wonder what you gotta do
to get thrown off this police force.

292
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:29,437
Keep on with some of your shit,
you just might find out.

293
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:32,172
Where are the fucking run sheets?

294
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,581
Behind the board.

295
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,416
You all go for a taste?

296
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:45,251
We got your picture,
don't you fucking worry, McNulty.

297
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,564
This is Barksdale?

298
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,365
Avon Barksdale.

299
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,774
I don't think so.

300
00:16:57,874 --> 00:16:59,068
Read my lips.

301
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,269
Avon fucking Barksdale.

302
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,209
His name's on the form in the file.

303
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,871
Excuse me for giving a shit...

304
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,247
but I can't help but notice
this is a middle-aged white man.

305
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,682
You want something different,
you give me another name.

306
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:15,815
That's the only Avon Barksdale
in the housing department files.

307
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:18,786
You got your smokes?

308
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,158
Have a nice fucking day.

309
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:28,568
Maybe he's white.

310
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:35,536
No, I mean, really. What do we really know?

311
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,210
"Avon Barksdale.

312
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:39,509
"31 years of age.

313
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,948
"Born Provident Hospital, West Baltimore...

314
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,452
"to Willette Jackson Barksdale...

315
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,212
"father unknown.

316
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,381
"Educated Baltimore city schools."

317
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,950
Address is in the same public housing
where he controls the drug trade.

318
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,689
No flash, no profile.

319
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:56,961
Pretty much comes up out of nowhere.

320
00:17:57,067 --> 00:18:00,332
No work history.
No tax information we can look at.

321
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:03,331
No cars in his name, no driver's license.

322
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,464
No kids.

323
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,441
No priors either.

324
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,879
Yeah, here's this vague CI information...

325
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,244
that states he stays in
various apartments out in the county.

326
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,580
Addresses undetermined, of course.

327
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:18,284
He moves from girlfriend to girlfriend...

328
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,913
might have another girlfriend in New York.

329
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:22,888
He likes to work out...

330
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:25,928
and he used to box Golden Gloves
when he was younger.

331
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:31,026
I've been working on him for two weeks
and the truth is, we don't know shit.

332
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:32,362
Golden Gloves?

333
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,695
How did you hear that?

334
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,367
I don't know.

335
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,073
I think I got that from a DEA File.

336
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,907
Or from a Cl...

337
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:46,812
who claimed to know him way back when.

338
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:50,250
So you write everything down?

339
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,090
Yeah, everything.

340
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:03,833
-Goddamn bomb, y'all.
-Blue-tops, blue-tops.

341
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:05,531
Double shorts.

342
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,000
In the hole, man.

343
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,195
Got blue-tops. Looking for blues?

344
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:11,797
In the hole, y'all.

345
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,009
-Blue-tops.
-Red-tops.

346
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,412
-Red-tops.
-Two for $10.

347
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:22,207
Blue-tops, blue-tops.

348
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,799
Keep your jab moving.

349
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:52,875
Move with your right.
Left, right, left, right.

350
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,543
Two punches.

351
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,751
I got a few questions
I wanna ask you, Mack.

352
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:07,091
Keep your hands moving,
work to the body some.

353
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,096
So who's your target?

354
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,632
-Barksdale.
-Who?

355
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,233
Avon Barksdale.

356
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,693
-Never heard of him.
-That's the thing.

357
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:16,830
This guy's got
the Westside projects locked up.

358
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,966
He's tied to maybe a dozen murders,
he's completely off the radar.

359
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:21,805
-Avon, what was it?
-Barksdale.

360
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:23,038
If you say so.

361
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:24,548
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.

362
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:26,038
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.

363
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:28,743
Nothing in NCIC, no adult arrests.

364
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,414
I've been working drugs
for the Bureau since '98.

365
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,456
I can tell you, we got
nothing on him that I know.

366
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,926
This little thing...

367
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,855
is the smile of the week.

368
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,122
Watch this.

369
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:43,990
-What?
-What was that?

370
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:45,965
Get the door.

371
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:55,171
It's a career case.

372
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:57,576
Not that my bosses
give a damn at this point.

373
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:58,739
Why not?

374
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,149
Why not?

375
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,811
All of them mopes in bracelets
and not one of them named Osama.

376
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,286
I owe you, brother. What do you need?

377
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:10,086
A couple of lightweight body mikes.
Wireless, remote taping capability.

378
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:11,419
That's all?

379
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,788
Where I come from,
we're just happy to be in the 20th century.

380
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,868
Who's running the case,
so I can tell my squad supervisor?

381
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:21,301
Daniels, out of Narcotics.

382
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:25,674
All right, no problem.

383
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,943
Shit! Fucking rain, man.

384
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:34,039
All right, y'all know
what the fuck this is.

385
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,278
-Up against the wall, hurry the fuck up.
-Come on, let's go.

386
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:40,083
Go on to the back.
Ain't got time for this shit.

387
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:44,455
Got some red-tops, some testers.
Get them around the corner.

388
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:46,893
Hurry up, take them around.

389
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,358
What the fuck you looking at me for?

390
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:51,434
Get your ass around the corner.

391
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,945
I want that shit, that's good.

392
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:08,041
Keep it moving.

393
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,700
-Man, you see that?
-Yeah.

394
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:29,132
Third from the end. That's the stash.

395
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,969
Some real raggedy-ass shit here, boy.

396
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:33,868
Very sloppy.

397
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:41,879
How old are your kids?

398
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:44,376
Mike is 8, Sean's 10.

399
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:46,886
That's the hard part.

400
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,220
Yeah, that's the hard
part, but you know....

401
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,454
-How often do you get to see them?
-Every other weekend.

402
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:55,027
Trying to get more, but she's fighting me.

403
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:58,066
-Why would she fight you on that?
-She's getting even.

404
00:22:58,602 --> 00:22:59,796
Getting even?

405
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:01,894
You must've been fucking around.

406
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,307
-I'm just saying.
-You're right.

407
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:05,734
It's always the case.

408
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,675
A woman wants to get even,
there's something extra there.

409
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,077
How come you got all this wisdom
and your life's so fucking hard?

410
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,309
I've been wondering on that myself.

411
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:19,454
How about you? You ever been married?

412
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:24,851
What'd I say?

413
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:27,293
-If you ain't gonna say anything, I am.
-What?

414
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:30,059
If you're a dog,
you barking at the wrong pussy.

415
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,891
What, so I'm a dog now?

416
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:34,197
-Meow.
-Bubbles.

417
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:36,531
I date women.

418
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,575
We've got something else in common.
I date women, too.

419
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:42,577
So pretty much everyone in CID
has worked this out but me?

420
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:45,239
There wasn't nothing to figure out.
I told them.

421
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:47,235
I guess I missed the
press conference.

422
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:49,478
It's better that than
to have every police...

423
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:52,612
on three shifts hounding you
every goddamned day.

424
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,854
-Cops are dogs.
-Yeah.

425
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,856
It's not like I was walking around...

426
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:00,555
waving some dyke flag in the air,
or some shit.

427
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:07,068
-I know I look like I could go either way.
-Lord, yes, you do. Yes, you do.

428
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,105
It was something I had to put out there
to get through the day.

429
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:12,834
-I should've known.
-Should've known what?

430
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:17,604
I worked with one other female police
officer who was worth a damn, only one.

431
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:19,147
-A lesbian.
-Yeah.

432
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:27,548
In the beginning, you're
in your radio car...

433
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,120
alone, working your post.

434
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,020
-Most women aren't getting out of that car.
-Right.

435
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,459
Not without side partners showing up.

436
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,734
They're intimidated, physically.

437
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:40,966
-They gotta be.
-You weren't?

438
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:43,139
Yeah, at first.

439
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:47,372
But I'm talking about some old
straight-out-of-the-academy-type scared...

440
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:48,501
you know what I'm saying?

441
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:50,408
I wasn't about to stay scared.

442
00:24:50,513 --> 00:24:54,279
You know, you get your ass kicked
once or twice...

443
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:57,376
you realize
it's not the end of the world, right?

444
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:00,887
Most of the women,
they don't want to believe that.

445
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,618
Some of the men, too.
They don't even want to go there.

446
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:06,161
-You think 'cause you're gay?
-I don't know.

447
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:09,021
But is there any other fucking way
to police?

448
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,096
All I know is I just love the job.

449
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:21,071
-That'll be $3.20.
-Keep the change.

450
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:22,974
Thanks, have a nice day.

451
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,420
Dee coming up.

452
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,173
Where's it all go?

453
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:36,884
The money. Where do all the money go?

454
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,497
$22,000 or $24,000, give or take.

455
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:51,399
From the low-rises?

456
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,964
Damn, boy!
You must have that crew humming.

457
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,565
I don't remember a day
we ever got this much from the Courtyard.

458
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:03,539
It wasn't even check day.

459
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:05,546
You doing good out there, Dee.

460
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:08,976
We'll be doing even better
when we get that new package.

461
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,188
New package, same as old, man.

462
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:14,479
-Say what?
-Ain't no new package.

463
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,322
Just gonna put that same shit
out in a different color gelcap is all.

464
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,827
Might spike that shit with some procaine
or some caffeine, but otherwise the same.

465
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,423
String, man,
people are already coming back on us...

466
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:28,197
-telling us that shit is weak.
-I know, the shit is weak.

467
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:29,828
But shit is weak all over.

468
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:34,132
The thing is, no matter what we
call heroin, it's gonna get sold.

469
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,404
The shit is strong, we're gonna sell it.

470
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:38,810
The shit is weak,
we're gonna sell twice as much.

471
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:40,109
You know why?

472
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,480
'Cause a fiend,
he's gonna chase that shit no matter what.

473
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,777
It's crazy, you know?

474
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:50,589
We do worse, and we get paid more.

475
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:54,958
The government do better,
and it don't mean no never mind.

476
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:58,960
This shit right here, Dee, it's forever.

477
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,944
That's your bonus right there.

478
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,178
And you buy something
that you wouldn't otherwise.

479
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:16,477
Thanks, man.

480
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,219
All right.

481
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,009
You remember me?

482
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:46,771
Do I remember you?

483
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:50,680
I was in here the other day,
you wanted a drink.

484
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:53,885
-Did I get a drink?
-Afraid not.

485
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,586
Then why would I remember you?

486
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,788
You want to be remembered,
you going about it the wrong way here.

487
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:01,921
All right.

488
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,230
The usual.

489
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:14,106
This here's my uncle's place.

490
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:15,733
You kin to Orlando?

491
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,446
No.

492
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:24,712
Orlando's like the up-front man, you know?
My uncle's the money man.

493
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:32,954
-Where you from?
-Right here.

494
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:37,029
-Baltimore.
-I know Baltimore, but, like, where?

495
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,762
You know Turner Station?

496
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:44,030
Down past Dundalk, near the Point.

497
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:47,631
The Point. So, you're a country girl.

498
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:52,307
-You mean county.
-Where I'm from, the county is the country.

499
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,844
Where is that?

500
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,480
So...

501
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,083
are you working with your uncle?

502
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:07,428
I'm his right hand.

503
00:30:18,975 --> 00:30:20,306
Yes, you is.

504
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:27,008
You want to ride with us in the van?

505
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,143
-No.
-Why not?

506
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,879
You think it's a waste?

507
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:36,352
Touts and children,
that's all you're gonna get.

508
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,292
Bingo.

509
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:50,830
Where did you get this?

510
00:31:04,387 --> 00:31:06,412
Now, look at this piece of shit.

511
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:09,181
I'm good to go, right?

512
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,385
Come here, let me see.

513
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:15,428
Detective Sydnor's ensemble.

514
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:18,159
It's the latest in Westside Project wear.

515
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:21,428
Have your torn cammies by Versace...

516
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:24,835
stained sweatshirt by Ralph Lauren.

517
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:27,838
-Where you miked?
-Down in my dick, man.

518
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:30,037
I figure they ain't gonna
go down there, right?

519
00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:33,081
I don't know, Sydnor,
the way you twirling around...

520
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:35,343
might be the first place they look.

521
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:36,540
Fuck you.

522
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,955
I ain't showered in two days,
I ain't shaved in four.

523
00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:45,025
Right now, I am one ripe,
nasty son of a bitch.

524
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:47,521
Bubbs.

525
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:49,726
What you think?

526
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:52,824
This your man?

527
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:54,795
Yeah.

528
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,764
Is he low-bottom enough for you?

529
00:31:58,774 --> 00:32:01,004
Clothes is tore down enough...

530
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:04,671
but he could use a little bit more stains,
more dirt.

531
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:10,880
-What's this here, man?
-It's my wedding ring.

532
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:15,419
Shit, you married to the needle, boy.

533
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:18,291
That shit been pawned off, if you for real.

534
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,028
It's a dead giveaway.

535
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,628
You could stand to lose about 20 pounds,
some yellow in your teeth...

536
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,762
fresh bleeds on your hands.

537
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:30,368
So maybe I should go out
and shoot up dope for a year or two, right?

538
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:34,307
-Come back when I can carry the look off?
-I'm just saying, man.

539
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:37,511
The more tore down you look, the better.

540
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:41,744
You going down in them towers,
they gonna check everything.

541
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:43,250
How about the shoes?

542
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:47,118
I know you ain't got no problem
with the shoes, fucked up as they are.

543
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,118
Let me see the shoes, man.

544
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:53,321
See?

545
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:55,622
You walking down them alleys
of the projects...

546
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:57,722
you stepping on the dead soldiers.

547
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:00,865
-Dead soldiers?
-Yeah, empty vials.

548
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,100
You can't walk down a Baltimore street
without them cracking underneath your feet.

549
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,438
You want to know if a fiend is for real...

550
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:09,477
check the bottom of his shoes.

551
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:13,041
Okay.

552
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:16,174
Have him dance on some empties
before we go out there.

553
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,386
Get us killed.

554
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:22,557
He hurt your feelings?

555
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:23,886
A little bit.

556
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:29,855
Shit.

557
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:01,646
Four hand-to-hands...

558
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:05,349
two to me, two to Bubbs,
with me close enough to mark it.

559
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:08,488
-From who?
-Kids, mostly.

560
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:10,356
Young-ass hoppers.

561
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,293
It's a start.

562
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,635
They're pretty tight out here, Kima.

563
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,171
If you don't hand no money
to nobody that matters...

564
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:20,140
you don't get no product
from nobody that matters.

565
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:24,536
You want to go back in?

566
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:27,741
Shit, we copped from every crew out here.

567
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:33,585
Ain't we supposed to go off somewhere
and fire this shit up?

568
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,754
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.

569
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,838
Well, now.

570
00:35:57,246 --> 00:36:00,579
Did you get to see where the money went
after you handed it off?

571
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,510
No.

572
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:07,314
Nothing but touts and runners here.

573
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:11,517
But then again, you told us so.

574
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,755
I didn't say that.

575
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:16,556
But as a matter of fact....

576
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,043
-Everyone else roll out?
-I--

577
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:35,684
You were upstairs and out of pocket,
so I cut them loose.

578
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:39,086
Just as well.
I'll give them the news tomorrow.

579
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,549
What happened?

580
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,758
I told the Deputy we had
a few hand-to-hands.

581
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:43,882
Low-level people.

582
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,860
He wants us to put everything
into search-and-seizures...

583
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:48,452
and hit the projects Wednesday afternoon.

584
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:49,929
-Lieutenant.
-I know.

585
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:52,796
Does he think that's what
gets us Avon Barksdale?

586
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,130
The buys we made,
they don't even go past the courtyards.

587
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,506
Scratch together everything
we got from the hand-to-hands...

588
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,975
and shape it into PC for the warrants.

589
00:37:03,078 --> 00:37:04,739
A few locations, at least.

590
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,281
But we don't even know what doors to hit.

591
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,717
A few apartments in the low-rises
that we've seen used for stash.

592
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:13,015
Then we write on those.

593
00:37:13,122 --> 00:37:15,955
Lieutenant, these guys change
stash houses every other day.

594
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:19,050
Look, the man upstairs wants to see
a circus.

595
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:22,221
A couple of days from now,
I got to show him three rings.

596
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:23,559
Christ.

597
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:28,628
I'm sorry. We gotta jump.

598
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,076
-What, is the Deputy Ops stupid?
-No.

599
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,087
This shit is fucking stupid.

600
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:47,621
Not if we bring in some arrests...

601
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,590
he takes them to the judge,
he figures the judge goes away.

602
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:53,389
And then he buries the fucking case.

603
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,467
What are we gonna do?

604
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,866
There's nothing you can do,
except pound out some probable cause.

605
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:04,735
-We're gonna be here all fucking night.
-I'm not.

606
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:07,898
-Where the fuck you got to go?
-No, I mean, I can't.

607
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,410
I'm not gonna help them gut the case.
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:13,243
I know he's your lieutenant.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

609
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,613
But I can't swallow this shit anymore.

610
00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:53,810
-Why are you here?
-I'm thinking about something.

611
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:55,989
-Can I come in?
-No.

612
00:38:57,092 --> 00:38:58,081
No?

613
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:01,454
What's the matter, McNulty?
No one ever tells you "no"?

614
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:03,589
Sorry. I should've called.

615
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:08,897
How do you clone a beeper?

616
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:11,097
-What?
-That's what I need to know.

617
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,908
You show up at my door at 9:00
to ask me that?

618
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,375
They're using pagers, right?

619
00:39:16,478 --> 00:39:20,437
Every other drug dealer has a cell phone,
and these guys are all on pagers.

620
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,251
What do you want to do?

621
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,480
Bunk and me, when we jack up
the Barksdale kid...

622
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:31,150
he's got a Motorola pager.

623
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,490
We give it back, so as not to spook him.

624
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,319
You want to clone it?

625
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:38,565
Can we do that without a subpoena
to the pager company?

626
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:44,932
Read that.

627
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:48,905
-What is it?
-Affidavit from a state police case.

628
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:52,408
A judge signs something like that,
you can clone a beeper.

629
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:53,606
Christ.

630
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:56,583
Probable cause,
coupled with an exhaustion argument.

631
00:39:56,785 --> 00:40:00,687
You've got to show the judge that other
investigative methods have failed.

632
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:04,991
You'll also need a supervisor
who wants you to clone a suspect's pager...

633
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:07,619
knowing that it might lead
to who knows what else...

634
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,391
pen registers, wiretaps.

635
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:11,390
Daniels will come around.

636
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:15,596
Daniels will have your ass.

637
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:19,474
Thanks.

638
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,265
-That's it?
-What?

639
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,107
No.

640
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:42,661
Let me understand.

641
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:46,796
You're married,
and a date's a room at the Best Western.

642
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:50,701
Now you're single, and a date
is you coming over unannounced...

643
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:53,934
to learn the legal requisites
for a pager intercept.

644
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:56,276
Pretty much.

645
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,847
No.

646
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:04,083
Okay, I hear you.

647
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:41,283
You?

648
00:41:45,227 --> 00:41:46,751
As if you give a shit.

649
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,815
You're an asshole, McNulty.

650
00:42:12,755 --> 00:42:14,780
What the fuck did I do?

651
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,219
-How much more to that pack?
-50, 60.

652
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:24,631
Re-up's late.

653
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:30,127
Have Wallace hit Stinkum
on his pager again.

654
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:32,270
You want something from carry-out?

655
00:42:32,374 --> 00:42:34,501
Yeah, lake trout sub.

656
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:36,203
Pay up.

657
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:38,246
Damn.

658
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,482
You asked, I thought you was treating.

659
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:42,709
You thought wrong, I ain't no bank.

660
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:44,552
You stingy like one.

661
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:47,247
Just make sure you give me enough.

662
00:42:48,924 --> 00:42:52,291
-No mayo, extra hot, something to drink.
-All right.

663
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,259
-He's going for food?
-Yes.

664
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:03,563
Why didn't you tell me?
My stomach's growling like a motherfucker.

665
00:43:03,672 --> 00:43:05,970
-Starve, nigger.
-Man, shit.

666
00:43:06,408 --> 00:43:07,636
Re-up's here.

667
00:43:08,644 --> 00:43:09,906
Stink, what up?

668
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:13,240
What's up, bro? 10 minutes.

669
00:43:13,482 --> 00:43:14,449
-10?
-Yeah.

670
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,608
All right.

671
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:26,255
Who's there?

672
00:43:40,676 --> 00:43:42,769
Y'all got my back, you heard?

673
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,735
Get the fuck in there.

674
00:43:46,315 --> 00:43:49,648
Get your ass down.
Sit your stupid ass down.

675
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:52,584
Get the fuck down. Shit, stay there, bitch.

676
00:43:52,688 --> 00:43:56,647
Get down, get the fuck down, motherfucker.

677
00:43:56,959 --> 00:43:58,290
Where it at?

678
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:02,853
-Ain't nothing here.
-Where it at, man?

679
00:44:09,304 --> 00:44:11,431
Shit! Fuck, my leg!

680
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:13,838
Where it at, shorty?

681
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:22,745
-Kitchen, under the sink.
-Go on and get that.

682
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,867
Two G-packs. Let's roll.

683
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:40,391
Two G-packs. Let's roll.

684
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:43,437
-Just two?
-Come on.

685
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:45,267
What the--

686
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:49,908
Stupid.

687
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,487
Shit!

688
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:06,527
Let's get the fuck out of here.

689
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,792
Shit!

690
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:18,797
Come on, Poot.

691
00:45:20,909 --> 00:45:22,376
Fuck!

692
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,361
-So, your man saw them get jacked?
-Yeah, part of it.

693
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:54,135
-And he gets the tag number?
-Good man, that Bubbles.

694
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,238
Listen up.

695
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:02,640
Western uniforms will meet us
in the Mount Claire parking lot.

696
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,413
We start there, and we don't stop
until we take the doors.

697
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,353
I want their lookouts
to have as little chance as possible.

698
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:11,089
What's with you?

699
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,520
My office.

700
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:31,976
-I'm not going.
-You're insubordinate?

701
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,810
I'm not jumping out
on something that will harm the case.

702
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:38,113
-You want to write me up on that, you can.
-You think I want this?

703
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,552
I got the Deputy Ops on
my ass for this shit.

704
00:46:40,655 --> 00:46:42,953
Now you show me up
in front of the whole detail.

705
00:46:43,058 --> 00:46:44,719
I don't mean to show anybody up.

706
00:46:44,826 --> 00:46:46,384
-Get your vest on.
-No.

707
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:48,556
I got police work to do.

708
00:46:49,331 --> 00:46:52,095
If you felt this way,
why didn't you call in sick?

709
00:46:52,234 --> 00:46:53,428
I'm not sick.

710
00:46:54,736 --> 00:46:55,998
Yeah, you are.

711
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,776
Give me a 95 on why you are physically
unable to participate in today's action.

712
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,076
What, I'm gonna lie so you can save face?

713
00:47:08,183 --> 00:47:09,810
Come on, write it up.

714
00:47:09,918 --> 00:47:12,751
"I can't jump out with my unit
because my tummy hurts."

715
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:14,446
I'm not gonna help you gut this case.

716
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:17,423
If you want to pretend to be police,
you go ahead.

717
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:38,471
Let's do it.

718
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,078
I'm up.

719
00:47:44,553 --> 00:47:47,351
-You're on medical.
-I'm up, boss.

720
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,257
Give him a vest.

721
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:07,798
No, motherfucker.
It ain't just up to Stinkum to be muscle.

722
00:48:07,943 --> 00:48:09,240
You got the Pit.

723
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,642
Your people supposed
to be ready for the re-up.

724
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:15,810
You supposed to be steady for him.
But where you at?

725
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,942
You in the goddamn sandwich shop.

726
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,587
You got $20,000, Dee,
coming into your shop...

727
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,318
and you ain't even around
to see that shit right.

728
00:48:24,426 --> 00:48:25,723
Look, I thought re-ups--

729
00:48:25,827 --> 00:48:29,490
No, thinking was what you wasn't doing,
and now we look like bitches.

730
00:48:29,598 --> 00:48:32,624
You feel me? We got to come back on them.

731
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:35,328
And you can't even tell me shit
about who they was.

732
00:48:35,437 --> 00:48:37,905
One of them was named Omar.

733
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:42,375
-Omar?
-Omar, that's the name I heard.

734
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,112
-And they had a white van.
-Yeah, I saw the van--

735
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,115
-What kind of van?
-Five-0.

736
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:08,362
-Wrong door.
-Yeah?

737
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,597
Yeah, switched it yesterday.

738
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:13,572
Let's see your hands.

739
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:15,609
Get out of the way. Let's see your hands.

740
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,406
Up, motherfucker, up. Turn around.

741
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:21,979
All the way up.

742
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:33,791
Police. Put your hands up. Put them up!

743
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:37,121
Turn your monkey ass around.
Put your hands at your back.

744
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:38,824
Why you fucking with us, man?

745
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,869
Come on, man, damn,
I wasn't even doing shit.

746
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:46,565
Come on, man.

747
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:50,901
Cuff that one, and that one.

748
00:49:51,012 --> 00:49:53,810
Motherfucker, how's that feel?

749
00:49:53,915 --> 00:49:57,146
You fucked up now. You feel it, right?

750
00:49:59,254 --> 00:50:01,552
Why you ain't swinging?

751
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,260
Motherfucker. Go ahead,
play that cowboy shit, motherfucker.

752
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:10,990
Hold him down. Hold his arms!

753
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,269
Spread your legs.
Don't make me kick your ass, too.

754
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:16,392
Come on!

755
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:20,132
Get him. You don't hit a cop.

756
00:50:20,242 --> 00:50:22,938
What's wrong with you, boy?
You wanna hit a cop?

757
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,445
If you'd been here earlier,
you'd have seen a beating.

758
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,472
Clean. Not a fucking thing in there.

759
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:04,552
Pick any door in the low-rises.
What are the chances?

760
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:26,567
Channel 2 wants to know if she can film
some of the places we raided.

761
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:29,473
She says whatever we
got, she'll put on film.

762
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:33,439
-Whatever we got?
-Drugs, weapons.

763
00:51:33,848 --> 00:51:35,315
We ain't got shit.

764
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:01,468
I can tell you were never in patrol.

765
00:52:02,444 --> 00:52:03,741
Right.

766
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:16,854
-Sorry I'm late.
-What's up?

767
00:52:18,193 --> 00:52:22,186
I didn't want to tell you in front of the
girl, her being from Narcotics and all.

768
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:24,196
Daniels is dirty.

769
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:26,191
What?

770
00:52:26,735 --> 00:52:29,431
The guy running your case,
he's got dirt on him.

771
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:30,895
You know this?

772
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:34,334
Your own agency came to us with
concerns about him last year.

773
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,909
Integrity questions.

774
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,979
They didn't want to go to lnternal Affairs.
That office leaks like a sieve.

775
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:43,107
Plus they couldn't handle a case
if their lives depended on it.

776
00:52:43,218 --> 00:52:45,948
-That, too.
-You looked at Daniels specifically?

777
00:52:46,054 --> 00:52:48,318
We did a two-month assets investigation.

778
00:52:48,423 --> 00:52:51,324
The man has a couple hundred thousand
more in liquid assets...

779
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:53,656
than any police lieutenant
should ever have.

780
00:52:53,762 --> 00:52:57,289
Maybe he goes to Atlantic City. Seriously.

781
00:52:57,866 --> 00:53:01,202
You look at his background?
Maybe he's got other sources of income.

782
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:03,564
Maybe. We never got the chance
to go further.

783
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:04,638
Why not?

784
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:08,568
We went to your Deputy for Operations
and told him what we had.

785
00:53:08,676 --> 00:53:11,611
-You took it to Burrell?
-He says, "We'll take it from here."

786
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:14,409
So, we backed away and waited
for something to happen.

787
00:53:14,516 --> 00:53:17,747
-And waited.
-That was a year ago?

788
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,484
Maybe more.

789
00:53:19,788 --> 00:53:22,518
And that fucker's still
the Supervisor for Narcotics.

790
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:25,291
So, you tell me what the hell's going on.

791
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,998
Anyway, if he's running your case,
I just thought you'd want to know.

792
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:34,869
Thanks.
