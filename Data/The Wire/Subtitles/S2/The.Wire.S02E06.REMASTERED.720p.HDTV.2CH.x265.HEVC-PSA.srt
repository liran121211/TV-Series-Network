Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,780
Ain't working out for y'all, huh?

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,651
- Mars is the god of war, right?
- Planet, too.

4
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,922
I know it's a planet.
But the clue is "Greek god of war."

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,258
Ares.

6
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,863
Greeks called him Ares.
Same dude, different name, that's all.

7
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,406
Ares fits. Thanks.

8
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,011
It's all good.

9
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,710
See, back in middle school and all,
I used to love them myths.

10
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,807
That stuff was deep. Truly.

11
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,747
You're up.

12
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,798
State calls Omar Little, Your Honor.

13
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,664
Faggot.

14
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,114
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth...

15
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,981
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

16
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,247
I surely do.

17
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:32,588
- State your name for the record.
- Omar Devon Little.

18
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:36,892
- Mr. Little, how old are you?
- About 29, thereabout.

19
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:40,126
- And where do you live?
- No place in particular, ma'am.

20
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:43,802
- You're homeless?
- In the wind, so to speak.

21
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:47,873
- And what is your occupation?
- Occupation?

22
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,636
What exactly do you do for a living,
Mr. Little?

23
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,741
I rip and run.

24
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,084
- You...
- I robs drug dealers.

25
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:05,219
And exactly how long has this been
your occupation, Mr. Little?

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,691
I don't know exactly.

27
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:11,157
I venture to say
maybe about eight or nine years.

28
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,696
Mr. Little, how does a man rob drug dealers
for eight or nine years...

29
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,794
and live to tell about it?

30
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,809
Day at a time, I suppose.

31
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,471
What do we know?

32
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,945
On Sobotka, very little.
He seems to live within his means.

33
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,684
House in Glen Burnie,
paid-off truck, modest savings.

34
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,811
- Credit history is okay.
- There's no flash to him, nothing dramatic.

35
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,015
Doesn't sound much
like a money man to me.

36
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,651
- Or maybe he's hiding it.
- The union is also a little threadbare.

37
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,455
They paid the taxes on union hall
almost a year late...

38
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,998
and that was only after
they got hit with liens.

39
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,499
Looking at their books...

40
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,036
- You subpoenaed their books?
- You don't need to.

41
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,162
IBS books are open
to the Justice Department...

42
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,400
under the terms
of a federal racketeering case...

43
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,443
- that came out of New York five years ago.
- We called Washington.

44
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:41,037
They sent us a copy of everything
the Baltimore locals have filed.

45
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,810
The books show
that there's less than a 100 checkers...

46
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,113
still paying dues to 15-14.

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,017
And that's down from about 300 in the '70s.
They're hurting.

48
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,892
So where's all this money
Valchek is talking about?

49
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:56,691
The IBS hired Bruce DiBiago
to lobby Annapolis this session.

50
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,231
And through individual officers
and union members...

51
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,166
they've paid about $70,000
to various PACs...

52
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,670
and Democratic organizations
in the last eight months.

53
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,330
They show any of that on their books?

54
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,238
No, we pieced that together
from the campaign finance reports.

55
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:13,143
That's just what was in the names
of the union officers we cross-referenced.

56
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,815
- So, where's the cash coming from?
- Drugs?

57
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:20,683
So far, DNRs
on the union hall phones don't show much.

58
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:24,088
Union business and personal calls,
but no beepers...

59
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,590
and not much in the way of cell numbers
or payphones either.

60
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,124
What's with those hand-to-hands?
Anything connect?

61
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,392
We're buying from a lot of white boys.

62
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,129
O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown above the park.

63
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:40,597
- But any port connections feel random.
- The money comes from somewhere.

64
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,040
Maybe it's what the checkers do.

65
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:46,780
I mean...

66
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,045
they monitor what comes in
and out of the port.

67
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:54,286
- That's what they do, that's their value.
- They're bringing the shit in?

68
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:56,919
Or they're letting it happen.

69
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:01,051
Like that can full of dead girls.
They kept that out of the computer.

70
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,190
Which is why we're gonna quietly do
some work on that side of things.

71
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:09,463
Kima, Prez,
I want you to start looking at girls.

72
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,336
No problem.

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,940
If they're coming into Baltimore,
who's working them?

74
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,603
Are they club dancing, whoring?
We need to plug into that circuit.

75
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,611
As for the rest of you...

76
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:23,684
Lester is gonna stay with the paper trail
and with the DNRs...

77
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,877
looking for connections to the union money.

78
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,011
Herc and Carver...

79
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:30,056
you guys keep working the drug corners
near the port.

80
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,488
Officer Russell here and Bunk Moreland
are assigned to Homicide...

81
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,494
but for the time being they'll be with us...

82
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,430
running the port database, looking
for any pattern involving contraband.

83
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,858
Questions?

84
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,943
Excuse me.

85
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,573
- I'm Thomas.
- Beadie.

86
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:00,120
Would you like to go to Royal Farms,
maybe get a cup of coffee?

87
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,249
Right.

88
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,119
Yo, I'm Thomas. You want a coffee?

89
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:14,065
Listen, I was gonna ask her for her panties
to make some soup with...

90
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,762
but I was afraid she'd take it the wrong way.

91
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,865
You were at the opposite end
of the parking lot...

92
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,571
- when the assailant drew his gun?
- Thereabout.

93
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,739
Do you see the gunman who killed Mr. Gant
anywhere in the courtroom today?

94
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,378
Yo, what up, Bird?

95
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:36,147
For the record, you are identifying
the defendant, Marquis Hilton.

96
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,157
It's just Bird to me.

97
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:42,421
And Mr. Little, you had seen him
many times before, had you not?

98
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,997
- Yeah, we jailed together down the Cut...
- Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?

99
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,397
Quite a witness, ain't he?

100
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:02,172
Word on the street is, Omar ain't
nowhere near them rises when the shit pop.

101
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:05,878
Street said little cocksucker
was over on the East Side...

102
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,352
sticking up some Ashland Avenue niggers.

103
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,617
That's the word on the street, huh?

104
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,924
Trouble is, String, we ain't on the street.
We're in a court of law.

105
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,925
Your Honor...

106
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:23,663
Objection is noted and preserved
for the record, Mr. Levy. Move on.

107
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,529
Thank you, Your Honor.

108
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:30,009
Jurors will disregard that last comment
from the witness in which he explained...

109
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,978
where he had last
encountered the defendant.

110
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,172
Yes or no, Mr. Little?

111
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:38,080
Prior to the shooting,
did you know the defendant?

112
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,684
I knew the man,
but wasn't like he was no friend or nothing.

113
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,691
So you would have no trouble
recognizing him from a moderate distance...

114
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,261
say 20, 25 yards in daylight?

115
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,320
No problem.

116
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,425
Mr. Little, do you recognize...

117
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,195
this particular weapon?

118
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,299
Yeah, that's Bird's gun, the .380.

119
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,067
- You've seen it before?
- Bird always flashing that thing.

120
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:04,144
So you'd actually seen it
before the day in question.

121
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,681
- And on the day in question?
- It was in Bird's hand.

122
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,849
- When he shot at Mr. Gant?
- Yes, ma'am.

123
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:17,245
- Bird covet them shiny little pistols.
- Objection, Your Honor.

124
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,087
And the boy too trifling to throw it off
even after a daytime murder.

125
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:25,131
You're a lying cocksucker, man.
I'll rip your heart out your goddamn chest!

126
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,633
The defendant will regain control
or he will be forcibly restrained...

127
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,465
and I will clear the court.

128
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,473
The witness's last answer is to be stricken
and disregarded by the jury.

129
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,313
Niko.

130
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,182
Eton is my friend.

131
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:48,655
It's good to have friends meet, no?

132
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,015
Eton, huh?

133
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,849
That's from the Greek, meaning what?

134
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,053
No Greek. Israeli.

135
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,698
Yeah?

136
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,297
'Cause you look Greek, no offense.

137
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,204
Either way, I mean...

138
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,646
- You have the chemicals?
- I can get them, as much as you want.

139
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,418
When?

140
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,453
I was gonna do something this week.
There's been a problem, though.

141
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,849
- What problem?
- My cousin Ziggy.

142
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,956
He got into a beef
with these East Baltimore guys.

143
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,999
Drug dealer by the name of Cheese
took his car, burned it...

144
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,092
now he's saying he's gonna dust Zig
if he doesn't pay.

145
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:41,973
Yeah, malaka, right.
Zig fucked up the package.

146
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,979
So, you bring us the chemicals, we pay.

147
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,372
Then you pay your debt.

148
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,984
It was $2,700, right?

149
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:59,157
Now, this asshole is saying it's double.
$5,400, you believe that?

150
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,126
First he takes the car...

151
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,628
and now he's jacking us around
on the money.

152
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,996
- You want, we kill him.
- No.

153
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,868
- That ain't it either, no.
- Why no?

154
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,040
'Cause first of all, Zig fucked it up.
He owes $2,700.

155
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:19,169
And second, you kill Cheese...

156
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,805
and we're gonna have a fight
with his people, right?

157
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,075
A year down the road...

158
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,777
some nigger sees my cousin
coming out the burger shop...

159
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:30,050
putting gas in his car on Central Avenue,
no questions, puts a cap in his ass.

160
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,921
He's smart, huh? Niko, smart.

161
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:42,568
We don't have the muscle
to go talk to this guy, make things right.

162
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,499
I was hoping maybe you do.

163
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,443
Mr. Little...

164
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:55,007
can I ask why you came forward
in this case?

165
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,747
- I told the police what I know.
- Were you offered anything in exchange?

166
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,953
- Like what?
- Were you arrested?

167
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,350
Were you going to be charged with a crime,
and by testifying...

168
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,952
did the police agree to drop those charges?

169
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,657
No, man, it ain't even about that.

170
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,964
How many times have you been arrested
as an adult, Mr. Little?

171
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,766
Shoot, I done lost count.

172
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,699
Enough, though, not to take it personal.

173
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,504
Possession of a handgun...

174
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,571
possessing a concealed weapon,
assault by pointing...

175
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:31,776
robbery, deadly weapon,
possession of a handgun again...

176
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,250
followed by violation of parole
on weapon charges...

177
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,150
followed by
one count of attempted murder...

178
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,920
and use of a handgun
in commission of a felony.

179
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,495
That wasn't no attempt murder.

180
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,593
What was it, Mr. Little?

181
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,769
I shot the boy Mike-Mike
in his hind parts, that all.

182
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,505
Fixed it so he couldn't sit right.

183
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,934
Why'd you shoot Mike-Mike
in his hind parts?

184
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,439
- Let's say we had a disagreement.
- A disagreement over?

185
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,780
Mike-Mike thought he should keep
that cocaine he was slinging...

186
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,753
and the money
he was making from slinging it.

187
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,585
I thought otherwise.

188
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,529
So you rob drug dealers?
This is what you do.

189
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,691
Yes, sir.

190
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,700
You walk the streets of Baltimore
with a gun...

191
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,236
taking what you want, when you want it...

192
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,102
willing to use violence
when your demands aren't met.

193
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,936
This is who you are.

194
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,375
Why should we believe
your testimony then?

195
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:37,075
- Why believe anything you say?
- That's up to y'all, really.

196
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,887
You say you aren't here
testifying against the defendant...

197
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,116
- because of any deal you made with police.
- True that.

198
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,193
That you are here
because you want to tell the truth...

199
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,627
about what happened to Mr. Gant
in that housing project parking lot.

200
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:51,755
Yup.

201
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,925
When in fact you are exactly
the kind of person who would...

202
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,764
if you felt you needed to...

203
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,168
shoot a man down
on a housing project parking lot...

204
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,707
and then lie to the police about it,
would you not?

205
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,710
Look, I ain't never put my gun on no citizen.

206
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,075
You are amoral, are you not?

207
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,749
You are feeding off the violence
and the despair of the drug trade.

208
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:17,220
You are stealing from those who themselves
are stealing the lifeblood from our city.

209
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,487
- You are a parasite who leeches off...
- Just like you, man.

210
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:23,188
...the culture of drugs... Excuse me? What?

211
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:27,734
I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase.

212
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,094
It's all in the game, though, right?

213
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,506
And with the economy, what it is...

214
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:40,603
you can really consider coming in
10% or 20% below asking...

215
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,976
and still feel competitive.

216
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:45,210
- Even on the Hamburg Street address?
- Absolutely.

217
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,083
I have to admit, I like the house at 1501.

218
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,850
Although I didn't like the color
of the whirlpool tub...

219
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,892
in the master suite bathroom. Magenta?

220
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,621
- That's cosmetic.
- If they want to make the sale...

221
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,425
they should have some amount
of couth to change the color.

222
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:00,932
I know it's such a tiny point to harp on.

223
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,704
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just keep looking.

224
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,739
We shouldn't settle for just anything.

225
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,708
And you think that there will be
some new open houses this Sunday?

226
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:13,609
- I'm sorry, what were you saying?
- We're gonna keep looking.

227
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:17,172
- You'll take us around again on Sunday?
- Definitely.

228
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:20,715
- Okay then, see you Sunday, early.
- Great.

229
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,153
Thank you.

230
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,618
I'll see you then.

231
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,098
You are a child, you know that?

232
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,692
- What do you want?
- Dinner and a movie.

233
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,240
- Come on, stop it.
- Why not?

234
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,369
This isn't going anywhere, Jimmy.

235
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,808
Dinner and a movie,
then I'll walk you to the door...

236
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:48,245
and you tell me to go fuck myself
like you should've done way back when.

237
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,942
How about I tell you to fuck yourself
here and now?

238
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,042
Then you can save that money
for someone else.

239
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,486
Come on, Elena.
Come on, I signed all your damn papers.

240
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,690
Give me another shot.

241
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,558
Friday. You pay for the sitter.

242
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:19,411
- So how that D.C. game, man?
- Same as it ever was.

243
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,605
Chocolate City, I ain't been there in a while.

244
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,843
Call it Drama City nowadays.

245
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,815
Otherwise, same old gogo. Same old Bamas.

246
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,582
Same soup, just reheated,
know what I'm saying?

247
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,819
If you need anything to make this happen,
you gotta get it yourself.

248
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,795
I can't go through my people.

249
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,161
If Stringer Bell reaching
all the way past Baltimore...

250
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,736
with this kind of work...

251
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,806
then we got a real mystery
going on, don't we?

252
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:51,972
Don't worry, no mistakes.
Nothing that might come back on you.

253
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,980
- You sure of your people?
- My cousin up in there...

254
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,144
- he on it.
- All right.

255
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,116
I can't stand that gogo shit, anyhow.

256
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,684
Ain't heard it live, then.

257
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,016
I know a club in Oxon Hill
that would wreck y'all.

258
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,185
All right.

259
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,321
If I'm around the way.

260
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,868
So, how you doing?

261
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:20,231
- Nursing school right now.
- Good, that's good.

262
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,534
Lester's been pushing me, you know.

263
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:26,144
He does it, kind of without you knowing
that he's doing it.

264
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,009
Yeah, I know what you mean.

265
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:31,182
He said that you would be by today
to talk about the clubs.

266
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,252
About some girls, Russian.

267
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,979
- Or from that part of the world.
- The ones on the circuit, yeah.

268
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,059
You should try this place called Nightshift
down off of Holabird.

269
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,752
I have a friend who works there.

270
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:45,423
She worked with a bunch of Russian girls
last year for about three months.

271
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,330
- Think she'll talk to me?
- Only if I ask her.

272
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,400
Thank you, Detective, nothing further.

273
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,997
- Anything more on redirect, Miss Nathan?
- No, Your Honor.

274
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,702
Let's take 10 minutes
and then run the closing arguments.

275
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,904
I have every intention
of beginning tomorrow...

276
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,605
with jury instructions.

277
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,950
- How'd Omar do?
- You didn't see it?

278
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,420
Not the cross. That bad?

279
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,704
- You have no problem.
- No?

280
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:11,776
To start, he wants you to pay $5,400.
Then we talk.

281
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:16,044
- He says, "No, you pay just the $2,700."
- Yeah, I saw how you talked.

282
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,217
But you will not pay the $2,700.

283
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,352
Instead you will get the money
for the car that burned.

284
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,791
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:30,462
Him we don't know.
But the one he calls boss, him we know.

286
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,139
You gonna sit there and pout?

287
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,544
I know you don't think I'm going down
to that club just to look at pussy.

288
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,645
I know you know me better than that.

289
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,224
- I ain't even looking.
- Everybody's looking.

290
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,199
- Most of them women are dykes.
- Cheryl, it's police work.

291
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,700
What, so that's supposed
to make me feel better?

292
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:06,034
Kima's out on the street
doing her detective thing?

293
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:11,608
All that hospital shit, all that rehab...

294
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,070
- all them promises...
- We talked about this.

295
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,672
No, you talked.

296
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:20,119
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

297
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,440
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

298
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,730
- Where you going?
- With you.

299
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,560
Excuse me?

300
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:41,163
Who knows? I might see a little something
I happen to like.

301
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,009
So all of that's on the table?

302
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,772
There's money in the transport budget
for the grain pier.

303
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,371
Also, a bond issue that pays
for maintenance dredging...

304
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,642
on the main shipping channel.

305
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,378
- But not the canal?
- Nope, not the canal.

306
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,717
For that we'll have to fight
a little longer and dig a little deeper.

307
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,051
So says Frank.

308
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:01,355
I gotta say, for my money,
we're lucky if we pull out the grain pier.

309
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,726
Be that as it may,
we spent the money and took our best shot.

310
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,629
Hired a couple lobbyists,
made some smart contributions...

311
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,065
paid for a consultant's report...

312
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,330
to argue against
some of the environmental stuff.

313
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,429
It cost, but we're starting to see it.

314
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,476
- So where y'all find the cash?
- I've been robbing liquor stores, two a week.

315
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:19,338
Seriously.

316
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,971
We got some help
from the national office on this.

317
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:25,381
There've been some timely donations
from a few friends here and there.

318
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,316
The point is, at the very least...

319
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,014
we're likely to see
the grain pier back up by next year...

320
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,819
which means a couple hundred
more ships a year, at least.

321
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,951
- If.
- And it's a big fucking "if."

322
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,188
- If that Polack motherfucker...
- Hey.

323
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,154
No offense.

324
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:43,268
If Krawczyk don't fuck us by throwing up
waterfront condominiums first, right?

325
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,136
Nat's right. The back door threat
is that Andy Kraw or some other developer...

326
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,641
gets enough last-minute votes
to sink the rehab money for the grain pier.

327
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,769
Those guys are looking at that location, too.

328
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,074
So we need everybody making phone calls.

329
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,843
Let your legislators know
that we're watching on this.

330
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:01,751
The money only goes so far.
Now we gotta make some noise, right?

331
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,351
- Make some noise.
- Okay, enough talk.

332
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,516
Some of youse got ships
to work in the morning.

333
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:09,754
- The rest of youse need to be drunk.
- I'll drink to that.

334
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:22,098
Help from the national office, huh?
Timely donations from friends?

335
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,507
Watch your ass, Frank.

336
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,776
- This is it?
- Yeah.

337
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:33,978
Just picked it up
from the port administrator.

338
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,418
So what am I looking at?

339
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:38,855
The Atlantic Light on the day
the can with the women was offloaded.

340
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,824
The boxes are containers.

341
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,992
This one's being offloaded
and set on a chassis.

342
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,597
Here's the time: 10:31 hours.

343
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:51,537
See? It was moved to Lane L,
Stack 6, Row 3...

344
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:54,732
by an RTG at 10:37 hours.

345
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,337
- RTG?
- Rubber tire gantry.

346
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,344
So from ship to stack took six minutes.

347
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,309
That's the way it's supposed to work, but...

348
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,715
"AQQZ," as in zebra...

349
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,616
"396594."

350
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,418
Check digit, seven.

351
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,226
That's the container number
of the can with the women in it.

352
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,319
See that?
It was never entered by the checker.

353
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,490
So as far as the computer is concerned,
it no longer exists.

354
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,536
Sobotka says that that can happen
when the radio waves get knocked down...

355
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,429
or when a checker inputs
a bad serial number.

356
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,340
It came off Atlantic Light at 11:26 hours.

357
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:34,880
And it doesn't show up
in the computer again until 15:12 hours.

358
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,049
I find it two hours after that.

359
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,850
So for nearly four hours,
it's out on the docks, unaccounted for.

360
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:45,017
Sobotka says cans get lost all the time.

361
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,821
When they get found,
they get put back into the computer.

362
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,485
You believe him?

363
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,925
No, not this can.

364
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,500
So what's the plan?

365
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:56,932
The database on this computer...

366
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:59,437
has records for every ship
that berthed at Patapsco...

367
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,131
over the last two years.

368
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,835
We gotta go back through
and find what other cans...

369
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,433
might've disappeared like that.

370
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:08,810
- See if there's a pattern.
- How many ships we talking about?

371
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,016
Hundreds.

372
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:18,316
It ain't like I got a prayer of bringing
this case in otherwise.

373
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:25,456
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right.

374
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,927
- What the hell is your problem?
- Nothing.

375
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,936
Yeah, you look like you about to be sick
or something.

376
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,029
I just can't look at them.

377
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:37,543
Prez, you ain't never been to a titty bar?

378
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:41,010
Yeah, sure. But not with women.

379
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,441
You're sure you're not gonna have
a problem for talking to us?

380
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:48,351
I don't give a shit.
You friends with Shardene, all that matters.

381
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,753
Besides, I'm from Westport,
and I told them club owners straight-up...

382
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,519
I was here before them ho's got here...

383
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,958
and they better make sure
I'm here after they leave.

384
00:24:56,062 --> 00:25:00,431
- So how long ago did they came through?
- Six months back was the last batch.

385
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,263
Russians, I think,
but shit all sound the same...

386
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,496
when you can't understand
a damn word, right?

387
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:09,200
- Who brought them?
- Club owner pays extra for them.

388
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,002
There was a woman...

389
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,170
she was like the madam
who handled the cash.

390
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,804
- But I ain't get a name.
- She Russian, too?

391
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,611
She was something. She had an accent.

392
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:22,383
So it's like, one day all Baltimore girls
are at the bar...

393
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:23,979
and the next, what?

394
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,524
- All foreign girls?
- That about right.

395
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,958
They was making so much money
with them new girls...

396
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,087
they let some of their regular dancers go.

397
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,722
Not me, 'cause I mean, I got clientele here.

398
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,995
- But some of the others...
- Where'd the girls stay?

399
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:40,769
Where they told. Shit, they ain't here legally.
They don't know shit.

400
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,273
They ain't got no family.

401
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,105
The men they got handling them
are always with them.

402
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,736
Right there to take them
from whatever motel they use...

403
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,178
to the club and back.

404
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:52,080
Right there when they need to get food,
or go to the Rite Aid.

405
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:55,712
Right outside the motel door
when they up in them rooms with the johns.

406
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,619
Anyone try to get away?

407
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,258
Shit, I seen one of them get lit up
with one of them stun guns...

408
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,386
for going down the block
to get some dinner.

409
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:06,693
They barely let them girls
go to the bathroom by themselves.

410
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,324
And if they see one getting
too close to the johns...

411
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:12,063
that's when they move the whole crew
to another town.

412
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,504
Keep it so they don't get no help.

413
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,632
You up after the next song.

414
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,872
Push my numbers then.
I gotta go get paid, honey.

415
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:25,244
You need anything else, you can call me.
Help if I can.

416
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,711
I'll tell Shardene you said hi.

417
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:31,284
She must be doing good,
to be out for so long.

418
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,118
She must've landed a rich one, right?

419
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,293
- You her girl?
- Yeah.

420
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,794
I wouldn't let mine come in here either
without me.

421
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,631
These bitches in here are no joke.

422
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,207
Thirteen of them.

423
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:08,280
They had about a third of that space
hidden behind the fake wall.

424
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:12,585
A few flashlights, some junk food,
some water.

425
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:15,857
A portable toilet they had to share.

426
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,988
And not enough air.

427
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:41,142
I'm going to schedule sentencing
for the third week of next month.

428
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:42,721
Anything else today?

429
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,725
Your Honor, my client,
having preserved the necessary grounds...

430
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,795
for appeal in the record,
wishes me to state unequivocally...

431
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,693
that regardless of this jury's verdict...

432
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,461
he is the victim of wholesale perjury
on the part of the state's key witness.

433
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,433
We ask that an appeal bond be set...

434
00:28:57,537 --> 00:29:00,097
so that he can participate fully
in this investigation.

435
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,640
An appeal bond on a conviction
of first-degree murder?

436
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,040
- Mr. Levy, get a grip on yourself.
- Your Honor...

437
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,942
Not only will there be
no bond pending sentencing...

438
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,639
but as far as I'm concerned...

439
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,343
the pre-sentencing report
is a mere formality.

440
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:16,445
Mr. Hilton has been found guilty
of killing a state's witness...

441
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:19,116
who testified in this very courtroom.

442
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:22,385
He did so in cold blood, and for pay.

443
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:25,762
Unless the pre-sentence report
indicates that he is, in fact...

444
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,355
the Messiah come again...

445
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:30,459
he will very likely be sentenced
to life, no parole...

446
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,130
by a Baltimore judge who,
for once in his life...

447
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,265
gets to leave his office feeling
that his job actually matters.

448
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:39,174
Mr. Hilton, are you the second coming
of our savior?

449
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,213
- Excuse me?
- Are you Jesus Christ come back to Earth?

450
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:46,247
See you at sentencing.

451
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,626
Was it good for you, too?

452
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,793
Mr. Little, this is good to get-out-of-jail-free
one time only...

453
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,391
on anything up to aggravated assault.

454
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,105
- Why thank you, ma'am.
- No, thank you.

455
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:09,202
A rare pleasure.

456
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,274
Time for the ceremonial eyefuck.

457
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:17,815
Come see me down the Cut,
you punk-ass snitch.

458
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:20,408
I'll shove a shiv down
your cocksucking throat!

459
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,817
You think on it, Bird.

460
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,980
You think on Brandon
while you doing that time?

461
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,754
I'm gonna see you, man, I swear to God!
Fuck that, I'll do you like a dog.

462
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,920
You really see him shoot the man?

463
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:34,130
You really asking?

464
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,099
But it's fucked because the man
got to where he needed to be...

465
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:45,408
and she wasn't even worth it.

466
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:49,045
Daisy wasn't nothing past any other bitch,
anyway, you know?

467
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:53,983
And he did all that for her and in the end,
it ain't amount to shit.

468
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,614
Fitzgerald said that
there were no second acts in American lives.

469
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,722
- Do you believe that?
- Man, shit, we locked up.

470
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:04,592
We best not believe that, right?

471
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:07,964
He's saying that the past is always with us.

472
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:10,795
And where we come from,
what we go through...

473
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:14,134
how we go through it, all that shit matters.

474
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,836
- I mean, that's what I thought he meant.
- Go ahead.

475
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:25,377
Like at the end of the book, you know?
Boats and tides and all.

476
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,980
It's like you can change up, right?

477
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:32,649
You can say you're somebody new,
you can give yourself a whole new story...

478
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,160
but what came first is who you really are...

479
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,593
and what happened before
is what really happened.

480
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,166
And it don't matter
that some fool say he different...

481
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,567
'cause the only thing
that can make you different...

482
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,935
is what you really do
or what you really go through.

483
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,407
Like, you know,
like all them books in his library.

484
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:55,144
Now, he fronting with all them books...

485
00:31:56,048 --> 00:32:00,178
but if we pull one down off the shelf,
ain't none of the pages ever been opened.

486
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:04,015
He got all them books,
and he ain't read near one of them.

487
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:10,222
Gatsby, he was who he was,
and he did what he did...

488
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:14,789
and 'cause he wasn't ready
to get real with the story...

489
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,366
that shit caught up to him.

490
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,498
I think, anyway.

491
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,191
Sorry, homey.

492
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,427
You done with your trial?

493
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:52,634
- All right then, let's take her on out.
- Tomorrow.

494
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:56,365
- I'm back with you tomorrow, Diggsy.
- You got something else to do today?

495
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,238
Yeah, last bit of business.

496
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,637
- This is your business.
- This is retirement.

497
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,475
And after today, I'm retired.

498
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:18,163
Talk when I say, not before.

499
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:31,638
- Tovarich.
- Serge, my nigger.

500
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:35,704
- You're losing weight.
- Shit.

501
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:37,442
You are down to nothing.

502
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,451
In this country, supermarkets are cathedrals.

503
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,787
- I worry for you, buddy.
- How your peoples, dog?

504
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,720
Same, good.

505
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,257
You talk to the man
about that other thing, right?

506
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,886
Because I can get behind
that business in a big way.

507
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:54,763
- We will talk later. Now, another business.
- Right.

508
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:58,193
This the man with the raggedy-ass Camaro?

509
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:02,134
Wasn't mine, it was my cousin's.
It wasn't all that raggedy.

510
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,846
Sorry. Nicky is with us. His cousin...

511
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,147
But family cannot be helped.

512
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:14,612
Who you telling?

513
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,089
I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws
fucking all my shit up all the time.

514
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:23,489
And it ain't like I can pop a cap in their ass
and not hear about it Thanksgiving time.

515
00:34:23,596 --> 00:34:27,225
For real, I'm living life
with some burdensome niggers.

516
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,099
So what the fuck?

517
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:37,801
You ain't pay my boy Cheese,
and Cheese ain't paying me, right?

518
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,434
I ain't talking
about all the money in the world.

519
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:43,640
But it ain't like Cheese be in a position
out on that corner...

520
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,684
to let your cuz exemplify shit, you feel?

521
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,819
The man cut you some slack...

522
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,355
and soon every fucking-up white boy
be on his titty.

523
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:54,392
We wanna pay what we owe.
The $2,700 anyway.

524
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,619
- We're gonna have it soon enough.
- Your man doubled it, though.

525
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,322
He also burned the car.

526
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,026
Now the blue book
on that Camaro was $5,100.

527
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:05,467
Now, let me understand.

528
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,965
You gonna come up in here,
having fucked up a package...

529
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:12,142
asking me to tell Cheese,
who you fucked it up on...

530
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,438
to pay you out $2,400.

531
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,744
He gets to keep the Camaro.

532
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:22,420
Just how good a friend
is this motherfucker to y'all?

533
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:29,352
The Cheese ain't gonna be happy
having to pay me back...

534
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:32,986
so I would advise y'all
to give him some distance.

535
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,732
Just so he don't come back on my cousin.

536
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:42,071
Anyway, thanks for being straight on this.

537
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:45,402
Fool, if it wasn't for Serge here...

538
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:49,038
you and your cuz both would
be cadaverous motherfuckers.

539
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:58,989
I went through INS, customs,
even the State Department. Nothing.

540
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,086
It's time, Jimmy.
You did what you could, right?

541
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,001
Yeah, fuck it, let her go.

542
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,943
This one to the anatomy board
in the morning.

543
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:22,607
Jane Doe on the paperwork.

544
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:27,651
- Ain't right, Doc.
- What the fuck ever is?

545
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,552
You leave it to Avon...

546
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:39,196
he's gonna get some years
off your sentence.

547
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,925
No doubt, knowing Avon.

548
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:44,997
It's all good, D.

549
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:49,131
Just show up,
and say what Levy tells you to.

550
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,942
What the hell is wrong with you?

551
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:55,705
I'm asking you.

552
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:59,410
Those hot shots, that was Avon.

553
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,218
I want you home, D.

554
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,658
You asked me to carry this. I'm carrying it.

555
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:12,125
- This is mine, right here, right now.
- Boy, you ain't listening to me.

556
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,858
- I am telling you...
- Ma.

557
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,329
You remember we used
to lived on Linden Avenue?

558
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:18,903
Remember that house?

559
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,367
I was about 6 or 7 years old.

560
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:25,708
I was playing on the porch.

561
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:30,843
Them twins came by,
started picking on me, messing with me.

562
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:33,746
Remember that?

563
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:38,216
I'm banging on the door,
trying to get inside...

564
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:40,986
and you standing right there
to open the door...

565
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,493
except you ain't letting me inside.

566
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:47,122
You told me to go back out there
and fight them...

567
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,791
whether I lose or not.

568
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:50,969
Remember?

569
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:56,599
- They beat the shit out of you.
- Yeah.

570
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,406
Then you say to me:

571
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:03,379
"Boy, I might have brung you
into this world...

572
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:06,785
"but you the one
who gonna have to live in it."

573
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,248
Ma, I'm still here.

574
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:14,789
Me. You gotta let me live like I need to live.

575
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:19,964
You tell Avon, Stringer, and Donette...

576
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,857
all of them, to leave me be.

577
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:02,569
All right, look, fuck y'all. I need a drink.

578
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:05,702
- Come on, we're almost through 2002.
- No.

579
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:11,441
- Tomorrow is another goddamn day, right?
- Yeah.

580
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,821
They look thirsty, a round on me.

581
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,627
Yo, Mr. Sobotka,
friend to the working man...

582
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,167
master of the game.

583
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,230
How many votes we get down
in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?

584
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:36,240
- Been here long?
- Since my hair was brown.

585
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,740
I was telling Chess about Benny.

586
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,971
- Benny with the harelip?
- That's a good one.

587
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,015
See, Benny was working the hole
and he got hit with a shackle.

588
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:46,949
Chunk of steel clocked him good,
but he didn't tell nobody.

589
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,679
Not until he came in here.

590
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,517
That's when Little Nose told Benny
to call the union lawyer.

591
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,954
- Paul Sevel?
- Yeah.

592
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,423
God rest his soul.

593
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:55,853
So Benny calls Paul.

594
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:58,987
"Me been hit with a 'ackerel," Benny says.

595
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:00,429
"A mackerel?

596
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,432
"You working frozen foods again?"
Paul says.

597
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:06,061
"No, 'oddamn it, a 'ackerel."

598
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,965
Then he slams the phone down.

599
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,804
"'Other'ucker on 'is way over 'ere.

600
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,071
"Says he can't undertan' me."

601
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,174
Little Nose says, "Why he wanna do that?

602
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,944
"Benny don't talk
no fucking better in person."

603
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:27,220
So that's it? Me and Cheese are straight?

604
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,883
Yeah, you're straight.

605
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,990
That there's $2,400 for Princess.

606
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:34,263
She was worth more than that.

607
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,568
Dolo. One for the bar, hon.

608
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:40,968
You win the lotto?

609
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:44,372
If my old man can do it,
who the hell says I can't?

610
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:51,714
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nick, when I'm flush, I'm flush.

611
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:56,079
- We ain't gonna live forever, right?
- Next round's on me.

612
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,721
- Not for me, I'm gonna head out.
- Come on, Frank, belly up.

613
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:06,796
Take a rain check.

614
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,532
- And that one as well, huh?
- Makes 22.

615
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:20,269
All on the Talco line.
All with Horseface Pakusa working the ship.

616
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:24,075
- We're on it then.
- You gonna call Bunk?

617
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,409
Detective Moreland is indisposed.

618
00:41:34,026 --> 00:41:37,860
- You with Daniels and them?
- No.

619
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,327
We just parked the computer down there.
We're orphaned, man.

620
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,431
- Orphaned?
- Yeah.

621
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,370
Rawls is talking like...

622
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:52,603
if I don't come home with 14 clearances...

623
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:57,439
I can't come home at all. Lester, too.

624
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:00,948
Where's the love, Jimmy?

625
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:05,382
Where is the motherfucking love?

626
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,742
- So what's up with you, man?
- Nothing.

627
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:29,541
Nothing, huh?

628
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,886
I'm done, Bunk.
Bird is my last piece of old business.

629
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:37,381
I got nothing new.

630
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,321
I was trying for an ID on this one...

631
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,729
and I can't even tell you why.

632
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:51,498
Just a way to pretend
I was still a murder police, I guess.

633
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,864
Who gives a fuck, right?

634
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,710
Elena and I are gonna try again.

635
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:06,206
Shit.

636
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,379
I'm done fucking myself up, Bunk.
I am done.

637
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:18,026
Come on, man, let's go home.

638
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,555
All right, man.

639
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,406
Over here, shitbird.

640
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:43,552
What the hell happened to you?

641
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:46,385
- I fell down.
- How many times?

642
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:51,888
Let's walk.

643
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,897
- Pop, I'm...
- Walk with me, Zig.

644
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:03,239
Votes break for us,
that pier comes back online by next spring.

645
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:07,209
- More ships, more work.
- Yeah, great.

646
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:14,147
- What the fuck are you about?
- What?

647
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,187
Is that my son lighting
hundred dollar bills like an asshole...

648
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,281
in a bar full of working stiffs?

649
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,427
- What the fuck is that?
- Just a smile.

650
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:27,430
- A smile?
- Yep, a smile.

651
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,399
You wanna hit me again, Pop,
go ahead, take a shot.

652
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:39,268
Where you come by that kind of cash?
You know you ain't had the days.

653
00:44:39,378 --> 00:44:40,845
Definitely not.

654
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,781
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

655
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,662
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

656
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,719
Seniority prevails, Zig.

657
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:52,153
- It's the only way to keep it halfway honest.
- I know, I ain't complaining.

658
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:56,216
I wish I could give you more.
You don't think I want to throw you more?

659
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:59,125
- You throw plenty.
- It's just, Christ, Zig.

660
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:02,325
If I'd listened to your mother,
she's the one always talking about...

661
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:03,423
It's cool.

662
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,662
You should do community college
like your brother.

663
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:07,602
Pop, don't.

664
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,639
You wanna know what I remember?

665
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:14,772
Do you?

666
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:20,449
I remember you, and Uncle Jerry...

667
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,644
and Uncle Walt Pe-Pop...

668
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:28,856
all sitting around the kitchen table,
talking shit about this gang and that gang...

669
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:31,257
who's better with the break-bulk...

670
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:34,764
who could turn it around faster, who's lazy.

671
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:39,528
- Always a fucking argument, right?
- Four Polacks, six opinions.

672
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:45,407
I remember when youse all
went down to picket them scabs...

673
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,205
at Covington Piers...

674
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:50,606
how Jackie Taylor got run over
by a police car...

675
00:45:50,716 --> 00:45:53,480
in the middle of that whole goddamn mess.

676
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:56,947
I remember when the Paceco
fell during that windstorm.

677
00:45:57,055 --> 00:46:00,081
You remember, right? Killed Fat Rick dead.

678
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,857
Yeah, what else you remember?

679
00:46:03,462 --> 00:46:04,793
Everything.

680
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,369
So tell me, Mr. "Back In The Day"...

681
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:26,181
what are we doing down here
with the wharf rats...

682
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,616
in the middle of the goddamn night?

683
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,381
Beats the fuck outta me.

684
00:46:38,397 --> 00:46:41,230
Every one of those Post-its
is a can that disappears...

685
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,595
when it's being offloaded.

686
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:44,999
The yellow slips, they show up again...

687
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:47,367
with legitimate cargo intact
and are re-entered...

688
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,406
so you figure those are honest mistakes.

689
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:52,238
But the pink and the green,
those cans never come back.

690
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:54,039
They stay out of the computer for good.

691
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:56,410
And the pink one,
like the can full of dead girls...

692
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:58,745
they're all from
the same shipping line, Talco...

693
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,751
and on all of them, the same checker,
this guy Thomas Pakusa...

694
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:04,720
he goes by Horseface, he's the one working.

695
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,151
You went at him already, right?

696
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:10,592
We grand juried his ass,
but that motherfucker didn't blink.

697
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:23,297
You wanna hit the head?
Get yourself right, Detective?

698
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:26,775
No, I'm good.

699
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:34,074
The point is, we have a pattern here.

700
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:37,414
What they're doing eliminates
almost all of the paper trail.

701
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,252
As long as they can get
a truck past the outbound lanes...

702
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,885
and there's a dozen ways to do that,
the only thing they leave behind...

703
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:45,792
is a little telltale in the computer.

704
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:49,298
A box comes off the ship,
flashes for a few moments and blip...

705
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:50,863
then it's gone.

706
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:58,199
Our target
is supposed to be Sobotka, right?

707
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,971
I mean, on paper anyway.

708
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,810
What you're telling me is
that it's better than a fair bet...

709
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,577
that he actually is
a target in Bunk's murders.

710
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,952
Maybe we can fold our investigation
into yours, Lieutenant.

711
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:20,589
And put my ass in the air with
14 open homicides that might never clear?

712
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:24,226
- The bosses wouldn't blame you for that.
- I wouldn't shine either.

713
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:27,669
I'm using what we do with this detail
to get a major case squad going.

714
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:32,175
I come up out of here with all those
open files, it doesn't smell as sweet.

715
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:35,908
- So what's the next move on this?
- We clone the computer...

716
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:39,814
and start watching
what's happening on the docks in real time.

717
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:54,923
Shit.

718
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:03,968
Yo, D.

719
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:30,664
Just wine, huh?

720
00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:33,798
I'm not drinking much anymore.

721
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:35,737
No Jameson's?

722
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:39,772
Maybe a quick fuck with the waitress, then.

723
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,271
Okay, I deserve that one, too...

724
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,440
even though I'm not doing
much of that anymore either.

725
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,950
- Anything else?
- I'm sorry.

726
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,278
I don't know where it still comes from.
It's been a year.

727
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:54,654
- You deserve to be angry.
- What's the point, though?

728
00:49:57,729 --> 00:49:59,060
How's work?

729
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:03,191
What, so we talk about
everything in my life...

730
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,791
that pisses you off?

731
00:50:04,903 --> 00:50:08,703
- Drinking, women, the work?
- Just trying to make conversation.

732
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:13,806
- I retired.
- Excuse me?

733
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:18,942
It's boats, not bodies.

734
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:23,111
On a good day,
I catch crabs and count seagulls.

735
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:26,450
- That's not you.
- It wasn't me.

736
00:50:27,926 --> 00:50:30,986
It wasn't me not to drink,
or dog around either.

737
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:35,524
A lot of things weren't me.

738
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:41,635
I want another chance.

739
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:49,606
How about a fuck for the road instead?

740
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:28,852
- How you doing?
- Okay.

741
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:31,547
You unload this,
you gotta ditch trucks and trailers both.

742
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,625
Make it look like it was a hijack, all right?

743
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:36,451
Niko.

744
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:41,826
If you want, I will pay you straight...

745
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:46,030
or Eton can pay in heroin.

746
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:49,036
Wholesale.

747
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:56,508
Turn it around,
you can make $60,000 or $70,000.

748
00:51:57,749 --> 00:52:02,379
Nicky, he's offering, like,
three, four times the value.

749
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:06,381
I'm out on this.

750
00:52:07,092 --> 00:52:10,528
Nick, even if we walk it up to White Mike...

751
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,789
we can make $30,000 or $35,000.

752
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,762
Nicky, come on, man.

753
00:52:24,776 --> 00:52:26,835
Half in cash, half in dope.

754
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:40,285
Nicky, I can turn that package around,
no problem.

755
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,359
- No, Zig, I got it.
- Nicky, you don't know...

756
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,258
You hear me? I said I fucking got this one.

757
00:52:46,064 --> 00:52:47,361
Stay at home and watch cartoons.

758
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:50,435
Let me handle this shit
for the both of us, all right?

759
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:00,909
You fucking walking home or what?

760
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:13,419
Hey, girl.

761
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:15,823
- What do we do with the day?
- Me?

762
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:20,658
- I gotta pick up the boys from the sitter.
- Okay, great.

763
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:24,765
They're gonna be coming back here.
Michael has piano this afternoon.

764
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,030
No problem, we'll do something after that.

765
00:53:27,138 --> 00:53:29,936
Maybe we go by my place,
pick up some things.

766
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:35,537
I don't want the boys to know
that you were here.

767
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:37,842
It's gonna get them hoping.

768
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:42,580
So you need to leave.

769
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:00,237
Look at this sorry shit.

770
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:04,237
Motherfuckers not appreciate
nothing that comes to them free.

771
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:09,270
I'll take it in the back.
Maybe they got some duct tape to fix it.

772
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:44,014
- D, right?
- Yeah.

773
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,480
You can't be in here now, man.

774
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,017
Yo, man, y'all get any final calls
this week, yo?

775
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:51,020
- Yeah, we got some.
- I didn't see any out there.

776
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,384
All right, give me a minute.

777
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,790
Let me finish up right here real quick,
and I'll go and get one for you.

778
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,290
- Hey, y'all.
- What's up?

779
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:36,155
I know you got my motherfucking cigs, yo.

780
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:38,219
- You trying to curb me, yo?
- Come on.

781
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:39,887
What's in there?
