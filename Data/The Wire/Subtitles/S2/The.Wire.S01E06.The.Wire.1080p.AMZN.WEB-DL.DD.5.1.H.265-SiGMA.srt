( helicopter whirring )

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,664
( chattering )

4
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,587
( radio alarm )
* Incarcerated...

5
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,722
Rise and shine!

6
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,524
C'mon, man,
get up!

7
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,895
Oh, boy.
C'mon, get up!

8
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,830
It's a school day,
y'all gonna be late!

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,399
Let's go,
get to school.

10
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,235
Go, get up,
c'mon, man.

11
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,671
- Damn, Wallace.
- Damn, Wallace, nothin'.

12
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,506
Little hoppers like y'all
don't go to school,

13
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,441
and soon enough they
goin' be callin' around

14
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,210
and all y'all end up
in foster care.

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,011
Y'all want
foster care?

16
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,080
Just climb your
little black asses
back in them beds, then.

17
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,282
Get out
of my way, man.

18
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,683
Damn, too early
for this shit!

19
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,418
( children laughing )

20
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:14,368
( sirens blaring )

21
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,848
Narcos?

22
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,318
Naw, rollers, man.

23
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,053
Yo, where's breakfast at?

24
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,723
Here, man,
take your chips.

25
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,158
I want two bags.

26
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,560
No, man,
you ain't gettin' no two.

27
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,128
Quit being greedy.
Take your chips!

28
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,298
Ah, c'mon, here,
take your juice.

29
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,302
C'mon, man.

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,472
Where mine?

31
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,842
Go share with Tee-Tee.
C'mon, man.

32
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,889
Where's
your book-bag?

33
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,724
Teacher ain't
give no homework.

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,662
C'mon, man.

35
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:18,632
( music playing )

36
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,378
This is the worst case
suicide I've ever seen.

37
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,547
That's him.

38
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,185
You see?

39
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:41,121
That's him,
right there.

40
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,457
That's Omar's boy.

41
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,803
Go ahead, man.

42
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,976
( theme music playing )

43
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,715
* If you walk
through the garden *

44
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,486
* You better
watch your back *

45
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,824
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

46
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,393
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

47
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,498
* If you walk
through Jesus *

48
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:29,069
* He'll save your soul

49
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,939
* You gotta
keep the devil *

50
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,075
* Down in the hole

51
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:39,079
* All the angels sing

52
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,850
* About Jesus' mighty soul

53
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,520
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

54
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,524
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

55
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,362
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

56
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:58,298
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

57
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,035
* You got to
keep the devil *

58
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,773
* Way down in the hole

59
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:16,350
* Way down in the hole

60
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,720
* Way down in the hole

61
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,658
* Way down in the hole

62
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,828
* Way down in the hole.

63
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,569
What the fuck
can I tell him?

64
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,571
Whatever the man
wants to hear, Jimmy.

65
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,940
Whatever
he wants to hear.

66
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,978
Prodigal son.

67
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,848
Major, we got a good shot
to clear a couple cases here.

68
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,249
One thing--

69
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,651
We're not here
to talk cases, McNulty.

70
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,219
I don't care
about your cases.

71
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,755
Sit.

72
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,457
Relax.

73
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,859
I'm a reasonable guy.

74
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,695
In fact, everywhere I go,
people say to me,

75
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,032
Bill Rawls, you are
a reasonable fucking guy.

76
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,035
- Am I right, Jay?
- You are reasonable, sir.

77
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,438
Yes, yes, I am.

78
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,840
And because your sergeant
knows me to be reasonable,

79
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,475
he came in here
a couple weeks ago

80
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,876
and reasoned with me,
right, Jay?

81
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,745
We reasoned,
we did.

82
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:21,449
We reasoned that despite
his negligible Irish ancestry

83
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,552
and a propensity
to talk out of turn,

84
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:27,421
Jimmy McNulty
is a good worker,

85
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,457
probably worth saving.

86
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,593
- Major, I'm not--
- He's a good-looking
kid, huh?

87
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,365
Do you know what
we do here, McNulty?

88
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,868
What we do here?

89
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,370
That was one of them,
what-do-you-call-its,

90
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,439
a question you don't
really have to--

91
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,875
A rhetorical question.
You were being rhetorical.

92
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,210
Rhetorical
and reasonable, sir.

93
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,979
We work murders cases
here, Detective.

94
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,581
We work them
as they come in.

95
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,348
One at a fucking time,
it's called a rotation.

96
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,717
You're up
'til you catch one.

97
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,018
When you catch one,
you step down,

98
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,920
you work it for a while,
someone else steps up.

99
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,389
It's a simple, but effective
way to do business

100
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,727
in a town that has 250
to 300 cases a year.

101
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,328
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,632
But if someone gets
it into his head to leave
the rotation,

103
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,701
it puts an unfair burden
on the other detectives,

104
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,603
who have to pick up
their casework.

105
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,606
Overworked cops
make mistakes,

106
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,642
mistakes lower
the unit-wide
clearance rate.

107
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,077
And that can make
someone who is

108
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,014
otherwise
as reasonable as me...

109
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,085
Unreasonable.

110
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,955
( chuckling )

111
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,626
Detective McNulty,

112
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:40,561
I expect to see your ass
back here next week

113
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,096
when your shift
rotates to night work.

114
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,044
* Dreams come true,
maybe it'll be me and you *

115
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,912
* Things go up
and the beat goes on *

116
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,881
* Like one of those nights
that goes on too long *

117
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,583
* Maybe one of those songs
that could've got *

118
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,417
* Cut the fuck off
a long time ago *

119
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,453
* My friends, still as I lent
like I knew you wanna see *

120
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,657
* Should've just
followed the laws *

121
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,892
* The hip-hop laws,
you know those laws *

122
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,861
* There's laws
of hip-hop, kid *

123
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,696
* You should've read that book
that I recommended *

124
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,464
* 'Cause if you did,
you would see... *

125
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,432
( pager beeping )

126
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,702
* If you don't
have a hip-hop license *

127
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,503
* You're trying
to be rhyming... *

128
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,510
He's up early today.

129
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,713
A lot of pager activity
last night too.

130
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,849
( reggae music playing )

131
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,908
No woman
takes that long.

132
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,884
Yeah, but
I look good, right?

133
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,693
Wow, you did
all this, huh?

134
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,995
Burn an egg or two,
ain't no thing.

135
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:26,566
Yeah, my mama
always said, don't let
'em get to cookin'.

136
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,736
Once they get
into your kitchen,

137
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,437
ain't nothin' left
to do but give 'em
a key to your house.

138
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,040
I don't want no key.
I don't want no house.

139
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,743
And your mama don't
know shit about me.

140
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,411
He looks
just like you.

141
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,248
Yeah, he do.

142
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:44,417
Where's his mother?

143
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,386
Around the way.

144
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,289
Yeah, you friends?

145
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,859
Oh, you know,
she want a key.

146
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,594
She want a house,
she want a car,

147
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,529
she wants some new clothes,
a necklace,

148
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,931
she wants
some pocket change,

149
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,566
you know, a trip
down to the shore,

150
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,468
and she want a credit card
with her name on it.

151
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,203
Ain't no such thing
as free, right?

152
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,640
When it come to pussy,
ain't no free.

153
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,279
I gotta go.

154
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,798
You're working
on this one.

155
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,565
Lines on the other
two pay phones aren't in yet,

156
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,001
but you'll
get 'em tomorrow.

157
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,002
So, we up?

158
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,670
On the low-rise
pay phones, yeah.

159
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,839
Let's hear.

160
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,174
Woman:
See what I'm talkin' about
is he ain't paid no one

161
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,943
and he just think
he right to do it.

162
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,912
- Man: Huh.
- You see how it go?

163
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,380
So I ain't got shit,
I ain't got it.

164
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,316
But, damn, you know.

165
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,551
Thinkin' he all that because
he got his family thing.

166
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,521
- Who?
- Dee, talkin' about Dee.

167
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,956
Hey, it was
getting good.

168
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,158
- It's unmonitored.
- It's what?

169
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,960
It's unmonitored.
We can't listen

170
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,195
to a conversation
on an unmonitored
pay phone.

171
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,596
What's that mean?

172
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,966
We got a tap on
the courtyard pay phone.

173
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,568
By tomorrow we'll be up
on two near the high-rises.

174
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,738
But we can't listen
to anything unless

175
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,840
we know one of our targets
is using the phone.

176
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,108
So, we gotta be out there
on those rooftops for hours,

177
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,477
watching these assholes
talk on the phone?

178
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,179
Yep.

179
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,680
It's more bullshit.

180
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,451
Detective,
this, right here.

181
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,853
This is the job.

182
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,155
You know, when you came
downtown to CID,

183
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,923
what other kind of work
were you expecting?

184
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,027
So, what are you
gonna do?

185
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,796
Well, I can't get
back here in a week.

186
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,431
This case
is taking off.

187
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,867
You tell Rawls that?

188
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,534
No.

189
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,237
McNulty,
line three.

190
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,075
Yeah?

191
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,411
Where at?

192
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,380
800 block,
in the rear.

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,315
Yeah, I got it.

194
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,717
Thanks.
Yeah.

195
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,464
( barking )

196
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,038
( laughing )

197
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,442
( police radio chatter )

198
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,515
11-22.

199
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,450
Man on radio:
11-22.

200
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm still out here
waiting on a lab unit.
Do we have an ETA?

201
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,388
Negative,
they're all out.

202
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,357
Christ.

203
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,926
Damn dog
got Norris too.

204
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,327
And you didn't
think to warn me?

205
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,529
Too much fun
not to.

206
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,365
Damn.

207
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,634
Yep.
He one of yours?

208
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,269
We found him
with the Kevlar,

209
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,971
like the one Worden
caught last week,

210
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,572
so we thought maybe
it might be a connection.

211
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,407
- Yeah, it connects.
- How so?

212
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,878
Don't have a name,
but he's part of
a stickup crew,

213
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,247
took off a stash house
last month.

214
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,250
- My guy, Barksdale,
is coming back on them.
- In a big way.

215
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,219
Jesus, they must've killed
this kid four or five times.

216
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,621
Cut him in a dozen places,
burned him with cigarettes.

217
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,290
Goddamn torture-fest
is what it was.

218
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,125
Doesn't look like
your scene either.

219
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,395
Fuck him up somewhere else,
dump him here for all to see.

220
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,763
Anything
we can use?

221
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,765
Not yet. But we're up
on some phones.

222
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,101
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

223
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,970
11-22.

224
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,637
- Man on radio: 22.
- Anything yet?

225
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,507
Or we just stand
around here and let
this guy go ripe on us?

226
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,775
Are you waiting
for crime lab?

227
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,377
Over an hour.

228
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,913
Only two units on the street
and both of 'em are up

229
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,381
at the city council
president's house.

230
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,648
What happened there?

231
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,350
Someone stole
his lawn furniture.

232
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,786
They're up there taking
pictures of an empty patio

233
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,855
and dusting the backyard
gate for latents.

234
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,423
I kid you not.

235
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,325
I swear to God,
you show me the son
of a bitch

236
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,894
that can fix this
police department,

237
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,496
I'd give back
half my overtime.

238
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,264
He was all
cut up and shit,

239
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,935
his insides
was hangin' out.

240
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,204
That's fucked up, yo.
I mean, damn.

241
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,173
Sometimes, you gotta
send a message, yo.

242
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,743
I mean, yo, when you
picked up that phone,

243
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,578
what you think
they was gonna do, huh?

244
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,648
Shit, all that shit
is in the game, man.
You know that.

245
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,285
Yeah, like you
and that girl, huh?

246
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,022
- What girl?
- The one in the apartment.

247
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,590
- Come here, man.
- The one you told us
about, remember?

248
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,361
I mean, I liked
what you said about all
that killing, you know.

249
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,631
Especially that part
about how it ain't
got to be like that.

250
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,433
Just sell the shit
and move on.

251
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,768
Get me a ginger ale
and get something
for yourself.

252
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,537
Boy:
Yo, Day, c'mon.

253
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,940
Yeah, I know,
I remember that, but it
ain't like that, is it?

254
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,674
- ( pager beeping )
- Yeah, I know.

255
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,309
I know it ain't.

256
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,312
Thing about it was his eye,
his eye was blown out,

257
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,081
and the other one
was open...

258
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,150
and, yo, Dee,
it fucks me up!

259
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,551
It's like
he's looking out,

260
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,920
like he sees
everything, you know?

261
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,157
Don't think about it.

262
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,691
I can't.

263
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,560
Fuck!

264
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,697
Yo, let that shit go.

265
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:01,168
Just let it go.

266
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,194
Yeah, Barksdale kid
on the line.

267
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,431
He's beeping someone.

268
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,315
Who threw that?
You got a good arm.
Go deep.

269
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,688
( phone ringing )

270
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,490
- Yo.
- What up?

271
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,660
- Yo, you ain't him.
- Hold on, hold on.

272
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,131
Hey, yo, Strings,
it's Dee.

273
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,099
Strings:
Yeah.

274
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,834
Dee:
Yeah, you hit me?

275
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,769
Yeah, yeah, um...
I wanted to know,

276
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,272
if you know young hopper,
the one they got down there?

277
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,906
Which one?

278
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,009
You know, the fool
who dropped the man
with a punch, you know?

279
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,444
Oh, yeah, yeah,
what about him?

280
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,479
He got some
promise, right?

281
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,980
What you mean?

282
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,216
Enough to bring
home, right?

283
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,452
You know, man,
whatever.

284
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,190
A'ight.

285
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:33,426
( phone clicking )

286
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,728
( beeping )

287
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,712
They bringin'
Bodie home.

288
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,418
The young boy
who was with him,

289
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,620
light-skinned kid
from the cemetery.

290
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,755
- Greggs: Where?
- In the alley behind
the 800 block of Argyle.

291
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,458
- Right across
from the low-rises.
- Shot?

292
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,228
- Stabbed, beaten, burned.
- Jesus.

293
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,730
- Yeah, we gotta
get with Omar.
- Yeah.

294
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,268
( tires screeching )

295
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,210
Impressive.

296
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,279
It's not often that I see
respondents come so prepared

297
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,181
for a juvenile
commitment meeting.

298
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,383
In addition to those
signed statements

299
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,619
from Preston's sponsors
at the Police Athletic League,

300
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,589
I also have a photostated
copy of a cashed check,

301
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,426
which indicates that he is
enrolled in the GED program

302
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,529
at the Baltimore City
Community College.

303
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,567
Can I ask how this young man
is able to afford, not one,

304
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,969
but two attorneys
from your firm, Mr. Levy?

305
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,272
This is pro bono,
Your Honor.

306
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,307
My firm is making it
a priority to identify

307
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,509
a number of city youths
who are in crisis

308
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,612
and to undertake efforts
to reorder their lives.

309
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,814
Excuse me, but I can't
help but notice

310
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,151
that your client is under
a delinquent petition

311
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,085
for the sale of narcotics,
and further,

312
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,754
for assault on
a police officer.

313
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,223
Beyond that, he walked away
from a JSA facility.

314
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,792
Your Honor, my client
stands ready to acknowledge

315
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,361
that he was involved,
for a time,

316
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,396
in the sale of
a small amount of drugs,

317
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,599
a transaction for which
he received no remuneration,

318
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,100
having been manipulated

319
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,470
by older traffickers
in his neighborhood.

320
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,338
That was a mistake,
Your Honor.

321
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,539
So noted.

322
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,608
However, we will contend
that it was Preston

323
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,877
who was the victim
of a brutal police beating

324
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,846
indications of which
are still evident on him,
Your Honor.

325
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,515
He struck back,

326
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,817
wildly and in
self-defense,
Your Honor.

327
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,587
- And the walk-away?
- Preston was heavily medicated

328
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,489
when he left
the Cheltenham facility.

329
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,291
In that state,
Your Honor,

330
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:48,361
he was simply trying to get
back to see his grandmother.

331
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,464
Did you know
what you were doing

332
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,066
when you left
boys village, son?

333
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,535
( clearing throat )

334
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,904
Naw, I was, uh...
I was messed up.

335
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,972
Anything else
you'd like to add?

336
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,610
Um, just...

337
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,279
I don't know, uh...

338
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,348
I'm ready to be good.

339
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,486
Pending a hearing on
these charges to be scheduled

340
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,588
within six months,
I'm putting the respondent

341
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,257
on home monitoring
with his grandmother.

342
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,725
Ah, Your Honor.

343
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,528
I'm afraid Mrs. Broadus
doesn't have a telephone

344
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,463
for any
monitoring calls.

345
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,465
She's on a fixed income,
Your Honor.

346
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,835
How about he calls
his probation officer
twice a week?

347
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,706
Cool, whatever.

348
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,609
Your Honor.

349
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,679
- ( dogs barking )
- ( sirens wailing )

350
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,533
( chattering )

351
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,403
Yeah!

352
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,505
Yo, Bubbles,
what's the game?

353
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,207
- Hey, Johnny.
Up an' about, huh?
- Yeah.

354
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,877
- Huck.
- Bubs.

355
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,612
Where's the scam
at here?

356
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,181
Ain't no scam.
Thank you, ma'am.

357
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,984
What you got here
is an honest day's work

358
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,886
for an honest day's pay.
Right, Lavell?

359
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,054
Oh, Mr. Straight-time,
Bubbles.

360
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,291
Gotta give a little
somethin' back when
they least expect it.

361
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,826
Me and Huck here,
we got somethin' on too.

362
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,128
- We got a plan.
- No.

363
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
For real,
for real.

364
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,439
Yo, we're gonna take off
on the Copper House.

365
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,509
Damn, Johnny.
Your first few days out and
you goin' get all dramatical.

366
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,544
- The Copper House?
- Got to be got, homes.

367
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,813
- Yeah, what about the fence?
- Fuck the fence.

368
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,147
Fuck the--

369
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,982
- ( laughing )
- How about the dog?

370
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,385
Fuck the dog.
Yo, all that time I was
resting got me thinking.

371
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,887
Yo, got good
to me, too.

372
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,989
Copper House...

373
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,958
gracious.

374
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,562
I gotta roll.
Okay, cash me out.

375
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,532
Yo, if you ain't got dreams,
Bubs, what the fuck you got?

376
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,901
Thank you.
C'mon, dreamer.

377
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:16,676
( chattering )

378
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,526
( phone rings )

379
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,863
- Yeah?
- One of ours on the line.

380
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,865
Got 'em.

381
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,199
Is Carv still there?

382
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,868
Hold a sec.

383
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,336
Carv, call for you.

384
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,037
Carver:
Yeah, hello?

385
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,074
You ain't gonna believe
who I'm lookin' at right now.

386
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,842
Again he walks off?

387
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,045
Ding, round three.

388
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:02,021
( pay phone ringing )

389
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,991
- Yo.
- What up, man?

390
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,026
Yo, Stink, what up.

391
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,361
Yo, where your
manners, fool?

392
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,796
My bad, yeah.

393
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,898
You need to keep
your fuckin' head, boy.

394
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,332
Forgot it.

395
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,135
Um, yo, what's up?
Where you at?

396
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,571
I don't know,
where you at?

397
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,708
Oh, I'm down in the pit.
Just came home.

398
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,910
I don't see nobody around,
I just wanted to know,

399
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,478
you know, what was up.

400
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,814
Ain't nothin',
goin' late, man.

401
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,716
Oh.

402
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,951
Just catch us
tomorrow, man.

403
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,920
- A'ight.
- A'ight?

404
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,122
Yeah,
a'ight, later.

405
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,658
( clicks )

406
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,229
- ( beeps )
- Non-pertinent?

407
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,065
How do you log that
non-pertinent?

408
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,935
No drug talk.

409
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,439
They use codes to hide
their pager and phone numbers.

410
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,474
And when someone
does use a phone,

411
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,242
they don't use names.

412
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,211
And if someone
does use a name,
he's reminded not to.

413
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,048
All of that
is valuable evidence.

414
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,783
Of what?

415
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,652
Conspiracy.

416
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,155
Conspiracy?

417
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,558
We're building something
here, Detective.

418
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,693
We're building it
from scratch.

419
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:18,465
All the pieces matter,
all right?

420
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,910
( tires screeching )

421
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,879
Shit.

422
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,948
Ow, fuck.

423
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,349
Oh, shit.

424
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,786
Are you
fucking serious?

425
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:40,787
Ah, fuck.

426
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,555
You keep walking
away from JSA,

427
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,223
we keep
kicking your ass.

428
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,658
I'm all right with that,
if you are.

429
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,627
Look, I ain't walk away
from nowhere, man.

430
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,996
Check my back pocket.

431
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,472
Home monitoring?

432
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,441
Yeah, man,
if you ask questions

433
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,776
before y'all start
wilding on niggas,

434
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,377
you might save
everybody some trouble.

435
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,079
How the fuck
are you home?

436
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,948
Yeah, you know
what I mean.

437
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,818
Juvenile judge, man,
he saw my potential, okay?

438
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,419
He expects
big things from me.

439
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,321
Yeah, like what?

440
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:16,823
I don't know,
college, law school,

441
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,991
medical school,
all that good shit.

442
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,827
Seriously,
how are you out?

443
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,662
Look, I'm gonna
tell you somethin'.

444
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,764
Okay, this is just
my opinion, but, uh...

445
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,466
the juvenile system
in this city is fucked up.

446
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,603
It's a big-ass fucking
joke, no offense.

447
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,106
Fucking fuck.

448
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,243
Hey.

449
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:40,046
Look, give me a ride
down to my grandma's,
we'll call it even.

450
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,181
Man:
Hey, yo, hold up!

451
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,216
In back, fucknuts.

452
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,853
Man:
Get a line real quick.

453
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:54,594
( sirens wailing )

454
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,916
Jay!

455
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:24,290
( music playing )

456
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,361
( honks horn )

457
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,832
Get your ass out of
the street, bitch.

458
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:39,205
- Hey.
- Hey.

459
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,540
What's up?
What you need?

460
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,980
Little late in
the month for this shit,
don't you think?

461
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,016
What you mean?

462
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,624
My aunt, she hit
the Match-Four.

463
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,960
You stealing
from me, Cass?

464
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,941
What?

465
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,478
Raymond,
you look fresh today.

466
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,080
Got laid last night,
that's why.

467
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,984
Oh, yeah?
Your asshole
still hurtin'?

468
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,887
- Call Jimmy.
- What's up, boss?

469
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:31,691
Rawls finally got around
to reading the office reports

470
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,059
that McNulty
tried to give him.

471
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,962
He wants arrest warrants
for Deidre Kresson

472
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,898
and the two project murders
that match up to that gun.

473
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,901
I know.

474
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,536
Ah, c'mon, jay.
Be right on this.

475
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:47,339
I can't, it's Rawls.
He wants warrants today.

476
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,908
All right, no problem.

477
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,643
So, who the fuck are
we supposed to charge?

478
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,713
You got a witness that puts
D'Angelo Barksdale

479
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,182
at the scene of the murder,
the night of the murder.

480
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,151
You've got a ballistics match
between the Kresson girl

481
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,488
and the two dead
mopes in the project
where Barksdale hangs.

482
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,156
Run with it.

483
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,993
This weak-ass shit is not
gonna get past a grand jury.

484
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:10,096
Charge the mope
and work it more afterward.

485
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,734
Call Jimmy,
let him know.

486
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,672
Dee:
Yo.

487
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,811
All right, listen up,
new deal.

488
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:27,379
Wallace, you goin'
be on the stash now

489
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,580
with LaTroy
and Peaches.

490
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,382
And what
about Sterling?

491
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,518
Sterling, he gonna
be down on Preston
lookin' out for a while.

492
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,687
- Cassandra too.
- What happened?

493
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,189
- Nothing.
- Why you wanna
change up then?

494
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,792
Nigga, I got to explain
shit to you now?

495
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,599
Stringer Bell's
pager number?

496
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,269
Stinkum's too,
I'm pretty sure.

497
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,938
Very sweet.

498
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,606
If they moved around a bit
more, we'd have problems.

499
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,609
But they're a little lazy,
you know.

500
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,511
Tend to go to
that one pay phone

501
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,613
in the courtyard
a little too much.

502
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,916
Jesus.

503
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,887
He's lit at 9:00
in the morning?

504
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:11,390
Or from
the night before.

505
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,833
Detective?

506
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,837
Detective Polk.

507
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:35,915
Yeah, it's McNulty,
Bunk paged me.

508
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,385
All right.

509
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,097
Why did you even
come in today?

510
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,765
I had some--

511
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,700
To pretend that
you were here?

512
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,836
To fill out
a run sheet?

513
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,705
I know I missed a couple days
last week, Lieutenant.

514
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:02,608
I got run sheets
from you every day
for the last two weeks.

515
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,944
Twice in
Carver's handwriting.

516
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,746
Twice it was Prez.
Once it was McNulty,
I think.

517
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,416
They covered for you.

518
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,418
But I won't.

519
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:15,487
Well, Lieutenant,
I, um...

520
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,759
I don't know,
I'm not really up for this

521
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,428
drug thing, you know.

522
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:26,132
Maybe if Mahone was here,
I could get into it more.

523
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:29,969
Learn some new tricks,
I'm...

524
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,172
oh, hell,
Lieutenant,

525
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,874
why don't you just
send me back to property

526
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,442
and keep
everybody happy?

527
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:37,743
Send you back
to property crimes,

528
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,345
so you can binge
for two more weeks?

529
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,947
I'm not doing that.

530
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,181
Lieutenant, please,
look I...

531
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,116
You were dumped
on me, Augie.

532
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:48,054
But it ends there,
I don't dump people.

533
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,089
You either go out
on those rooftops today

534
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,191
to watch pay phones
with the rest of this unit,

535
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:56,562
or you go over
to the medical office
and check yourself in.

536
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,465
- Medical?
- For alcohol abuse.

537
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:04,236
Either dry yourself out,
or go up on those rooftops wet.

538
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,446
Take a few minutes
and think on it.

539
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,125
- Where'd they go?
- Who?

540
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,863
Lieutenant...

541
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,199
we need a file cabinet,
or two.

542
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,801
The paperwork
from this, I mean...

543
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,769
there's a lot of it.

544
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,771
Lieutenant?

545
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,841
Sir, um...

546
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:46,445
I'm going to...

547
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:52,018
good luck
with the case.

548
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:56,088
( reggae music playing )

549
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:01,793
Fucking Rawls.
He's fucking up
the case to get to me.

550
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:04,163
No, he's fucking it up
for three paper clearances

551
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,098
on prior cases, Jimmy.
It ain't personal.

552
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,068
All he's got is D'Angelo
at the scene through hearsay

553
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,703
and a ballistics
match to a couple of
unrelated drug murders.

554
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,105
How can
he charge that?

555
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,573
Baby, he can charge
anything he wants

556
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,275
to get credit
for the clearance.

557
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,310
Grand jury doesn't indict,
he drops the case,
keeps the stats.

558
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,512
I need to go in there
and tell him what
the fuck he can do.

559
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,548
- No, you don't.
- No, I'm trying to build
something here,

560
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,516
all Rawls can think to do
is stick a finger in my eye.

561
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,386
- You talk to Landsman?
- Jay can't fix this.

562
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,089
Rawls told him to have
the warrants typed
and ready by morning.

563
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,890
You're telling me
he's gonna charge murders

564
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,692
he can't prove
just to get the stats?

565
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,327
And fuck up our case
in the process.

566
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,063
We give up
the ballistics info

567
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:38,597
and the motive for
the Kresson killing

568
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,599
in the charging documents
and Avon Barksdale,

569
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,134
he's gonna change up.

570
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,702
And what he don't change
up, he'll clean up.

571
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:44,937
Somebody needs
to tell Rawls that.

572
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,538
Oh, Rawls couldn't
care less.

573
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,107
Rawls wants me home
and he wants the stats,
that's all.

574
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,076
Then we take
this to Daniels.

575
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,777
- Daniels?
- It's his case,
he'll fight for it.

576
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,380
- Daniels won't do shit.
- He plays stiff every
now and then,

577
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,515
- but he's a good man.
- Are you kidding me?!

578
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,218
Daniels has been
trying to put the brakes
on this for weeks now.

579
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,253
This'll be his
new excuse to close shop.

580
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,155
Well, look, you guys
got to make your move soon.

581
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,324
All right?
I'm sorry to say.

582
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,027
- Freamon?
- All right, man,
take care.

583
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,363
- We tell Daniels.
- Fuck Daniels

584
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,966
and his fucking
ass-kissing, up-the-chain-
of-command ambition.

585
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:16,102
What other choice
do you got, huh?

586
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:18,537
We go to Daniels.
If he fights, he fights.

587
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,306
If he gives
it up to Rawls,
then fuck it,

588
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,374
we were never gonna do
the case anyway.

589
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:27,179
All right, come on.

590
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:44,396
( rock music playing )

591
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,514
Oh, God.

592
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,417
Fucking idiot!

593
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,588
Come on, get up,
stupid, let's go.

594
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:10,989
I'm hurt, man,
I'm hurt.

595
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,691
What are you doing?
Leave me alone.

596
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,226
What are you on,
dope or something?

597
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,328
- Mostly, yeah.
- Come on, get up,
get up.

598
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:19,831
Oh, ow! You tryin'
to rip out my guts
or something, man?

599
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,468
You tryin'
to kill me, man?

600
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

601
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,038
Buddy,
I gotta get help.

602
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,906
You can't. You can't
leave me here, man.

603
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,475
You gotta stay with me.
Stay with me.

604
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,277
All right, let me get you
over to the curb.

605
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,379
Go get help, man,
what are you doing?

606
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,982
- Stay there, stay there.
- Aw, Christ.

607
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,917
Damn, boy, that all
come out of you?

608
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,521
- Onion soup, Campbell's.
- Yeah, come on.

609
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,190
Run, Forrest, run.

610
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,861
You could go to Forester,
or the deputy ops.

611
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,030
Why come crying
to me?

612
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,665
Why not go to your friend
the judge?

613
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,502
I don't see a circuit court
judge being able to argue

614
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:59,605
the city homicide commander
out of three murders,

615
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,507
even if the cases
are all weak sisters.

616
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,509
It's put up or shut up
time, Lieutenant.

617
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,711
Either you step up
or you send us all home.

618
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,379
So, this is on me?

619
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:10,949
I don't see anyone else
in charge of this detail.

620
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,551
Rawls is a major.

621
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,154
Rawls is an asshole.

622
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,723
My point is,
he ranks me on this.

623
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,791
( scoffs )

624
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,329
The chain-of-command might
mean nothing to you, McNulty.

625
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,502
What I tell you?

626
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:38,076
( music playing )

627
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,763
( helicopter whirring )

628
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,244
( sirens wailing )

629
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,535
Yo, how we doin'?

630
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,638
We doin' good.
We doin' good.

631
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,574
You know, if you
say we doing good.

632
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,444
What's up?

633
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,214
So, the word is out about
these stickup boys, right?

634
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,915
Yeah, yeah,
y'all bein' heard.

635
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,850
A'ight.

636
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,320
There goes shorty
right there.

637
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,991
What's up, man,
you know?

638
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,527
I'm a man
of my word.

639
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,529
You know, I said
it was 4,000 on Omar,

640
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,731
2,000 on each
on the younguns.

641
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,499
This bein'
a team effort,

642
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,669
I'm puttin' $500
in the boy's hand
for doing the scope,

643
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,205
I'm putting $500 in your hand
for doing the relay,

644
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:16,174
I'm putting $500
in Wee-Bey hand, Bird hand,

645
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,445
for doing
the musclin' up.

646
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,547
How you doin'
with that other thing?

647
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,114
What?

648
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,951
Everybody
a little pressed, right?

649
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,953
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

650
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:29,488
You know,
ain't no surprises yet.

651
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,623
I cut everybody loose
on Friday,

652
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,460
and they all just
a bunch of beggin'-ass
bitches, you know.

653
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,062
I mean, ain't nobody
showed no money since.

654
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,797
You gonna keep it hummin'
though, right, cuz?

655
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:39,998
Yeah,
you know it.

656
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,733
Oh, oh, you got
your hands up,

657
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,034
you got
your hands up?

658
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,103
You keep on doing,
like how you're doing,

659
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,838
we'll be talking about
points on the package.

660
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,474
A'ight?

661
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:49,841
A'ight.

662
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,209
Keep it hummin'.

663
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,844
Yeah, mos def.

664
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:56,482
A'ight, baby.

665
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,949
Take it light,
but take it.

666
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,252
Yeah.

667
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,321
- 40 cents.
- No, not 40 cent
a foot, no sir.

668
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,988
No sir, look,
respectfully,
I got to tell you.

669
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,090
For 40 cent a foot,
you might as well
go ahead

670
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,326
and drive on out
to Home Depot,

671
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,827
right, and pay them.

672
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,396
They gonna charge
you, what, 45, 45,
50 cent a foot.

673
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,965
For copper
that isn't stolen.

674
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,600
Look, all right.

675
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,469
35 cent,
35 cent a foot.

676
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,538
And that's all
in respect I have
for y'all.

677
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,506
What y'all tryin'
to do in the our
community with these,

678
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,008
these quality
domiciles here.

679
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,312
30 cents a foot,
take it or leave it.

680
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,520
I understand the interest
in clearing these cases, I do.

681
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,989
But charging
those murders now,

682
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,458
and putting
the information

683
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:14,225
that we have into
the charging documents.

684
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,595
I just call 'em like
I see 'em, Lieutenant.

685
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:18,664
Three murders,
same gun.

686
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:21,299
We got this Barksdale kid
right at the scene on the one.

687
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,369
We're up on a wire.

688
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,070
We're starting
to pull good information.

689
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,107
You charge these
prematurely and Barksdale
will change up on us.

690
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,809
The work
we've already done.

691
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,111
I can't tell you how to run
your case, Lieutenant.

692
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,146
I can only run my own.

693
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,316
Major...

694
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,919
I'm asking
as a favor.

695
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,489
As a favor?

696
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,323
Yes, sir, a favor.

697
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,826
In that case...

698
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:49,961
no!

699
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,330
Sorry.

700
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,203
You got off
from work early today.

701
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,939
Yep, work sucks.

702
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,208
Are we eating dinner
with you?

703
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,876
Why not?

704
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,746
Mom was
cooking lasagna.

705
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,783
So, we'll go to Little Italy,
get some lasagna at Sabs.

706
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,251
You never cook.

707
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,487
Yeah, cooking sucks too.

708
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,389
( pager beeping )

709
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:33,805
Who's this?

710
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,074
Man: Hey, yo,
I want to see him.

711
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,375
Who?

712
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,944
Brandon, my boy.

713
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,227
Copper House, yo.

714
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,330
Wasn't shit.

715
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,500
My plan, Bubs.

716
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,902
Johnny had a plan.

717
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,203
( laughing )

718
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,272
Get out the way,
motherfuckers,

719
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,840
this here white boy day.

720
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,045
- I got a plan too.
- What?

721
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:18,684
We gonna wait
for that cheap-ass,
speculatin' motherfucker

722
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,219
to put that
good copper line

723
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,890
back into them row
houses he fixin' up.

724
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,760
And then, before
the drywall get up,

725
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,964
we creep back in
there and steal that
shit right back.

726
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,167
30 cent a foot.

727
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,706
Got to come back
at a motherfucker
for that, you know?

728
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,040
Yeah.

729
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,513
You good?

730
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:50,516
I could top off
with one more.

731
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,884
Just one,
just one more.

732
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,893
Johnny got it.

733
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,029
I'll be back.

734
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:13,204
( video game sounds )

735
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:31,022
It's my night
with the kids.

736
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,027
( ignition starting )

737
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,473
( Johnny shouting )
You ain't gonna
buy nothin',

738
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:49,841
'cause I ain't
do nothin', man.

739
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,509
Why don't you just
leave me alone, man?

740
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,645
A white man can't
walk down the street?

741
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,948
What's that about?
Come on, man.

742
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,451
That sucks, man.
It's profiling.

743
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,921
What, it's 'cause
I'm white, right?

744
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,322
Why don't you
just let me--

745
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,524
oh, man,
what the--

746
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,526
what's that?
What's that?

747
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,799
That boy
ain't got no luck.

748
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,424
Hey.

749
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,027
Hey.

750
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:44,529
So...

751
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,531
what you gonna do
with your money?

752
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,366
You know,
what you should do,

753
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,768
you should take
the whole roll

754
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,637
and go do somethin'
nice for your girl.

755
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,972
You do have
a girl, right?

756
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,742
Yeah, well, anyway,

757
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:59,711
you got enough money
to get yourself one now.

758
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:04,515
Yo, why you punk Sterling
like you did?

759
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:07,285
I mean, he did get shot
behind this shit.

760
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,954
I didn't
punk him, yo.

761
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:10,956
So, why you drop him
to lookout?

762
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,624
Cass, too.

763
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,592
'Cause they
was thieving, yo.

764
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,728
Both of them.

765
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,764
They got pissed
'cause I wasn't
paying them.

766
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:21,066
So, Sterling,
he started shaking
up the vials,

767
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,567
handing off to Cass.

768
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,736
She was selling
on the side.

769
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,838
You ain't
tell anybody?

770
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,606
I mean,
Stinkum, Bodie?

771
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,742
They don't know?

772
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,078
If I tell 'em,
what you think
they gonna do?

773
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,446
They gonna take
a baseball bat
to Sterling.

774
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,282
Probably one
to Cassandra, too.

775
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:38,917
There's too much drama,
right?

776
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:42,220
So, I just took 'em
both off the stash.

777
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,990
So, why didn't
you pay us?

778
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:48,493
That wasn't right.

779
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,996
Listen, man.

780
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,932
Stringer thought
we had a snitch down here.

781
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:58,136
You know, with the jumpout,
Omar, all that shit.

782
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:01,506
So, he told me to punk
y'all for a little while,

783
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:03,842
see who was
still holdin' money at
the end of the week.

784
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,643
Was they snitchin',

785
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:08,246
Sterling and Cass?

786
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,949
Naw, man,
just thievin'.

787
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:19,290
( TV playing )

788
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,692
Hi. I'm homicide.

789
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:24,195
Okay, you two sit
right here, okay?

790
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,064
Don't wander off.

791
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,166
Um, Dad?

792
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,534
What?

793
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,202
You know,
it's a school night.

794
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:32,470
Mom said
we had to--

795
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,839
I know, I know,
we will.

796
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:35,506
Okay?
You stay there.

797
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,443
( video game sounds )

798
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:31,129
( Omar screaming )

799
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,770
Woman on radio:
64 Charlie to Central K.

800
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,509
You up to this?

801
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:50,281
McNulty:
Pay it back, Omar.
Pay it back.

802
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:54,352
( police radio chatter )

803
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:21,012
I'm saying, why we ain't
in no real police office?

804
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,049
We're a little
like you, Omar.
Out here on our own.

805
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,852
Playing the game
for ourselves.

806
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:34,425
Hard way
to go sometime.

807
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:40,031
Sorry about
your friend.

808
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:43,501
Avon is
one sick bastard.

809
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,904
Of course he had
his reasons.

810
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,907
Greggs:
For one thing,
y'all did take his stash.

811
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:50,876
For another, he was
looking for you, Omar.

812
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:53,845
That's what all
the cigarette burns
were about,

813
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:57,949
broken fingers,
cracked forearms.

814
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,551
He wanted your boy
to give you up.

815
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,288
An address,
a street.

816
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,256
Kid had heart.

817
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,392
Yeah.

818
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,862
I know you want to go
to wherever it is

819
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:12,797
you lay your head
and pick up that sawed-off

820
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:14,900
you like so much
and go on the hunt.

821
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,069
That's how a man like you
wants to carry it.

822
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,670
And you wouldn't
be wrong.

823
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,339
Greggs:
No, you wouldn't.

824
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,775
But one man with two barrels
ain't enough, Omar.

825
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,677
Now you gonna do
what you gonna do,

826
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,646
but whatever else
you can give us

827
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,448
on Barksdale
and his people,

828
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:33,284
well, that can go
to hurting them, too.

829
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,121
McNulty:
Just throw us
what you can.

830
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,025
Hey, look, let me tell
y'all something, a'ight?

831
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:43,628
What I do, I do!
Straight like that.

832
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:46,064
So ain't no sense
in y'all even troublin'
yourselves over that.

833
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:49,867
'Cause, man, the way
I feel right now, today!

834
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,310
Hey, what y'all
need from me?

835
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:04,549
When'd you
last see Brandon?

836
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,051
Tuesday.

837
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:08,753
'Round 7:00,
maybe later.

838
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:10,956
He was on his way
to Mondawmin,

839
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,790
then the Greek's
after that.

840
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,160
Everybody talkin'
'bout he got snatched
up from there.

841
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,995
From the Greek's
on Baltimore Street?

842
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,998
Yeah, he like to play them
pinball games to death.

843
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:22,600
Greggs:
He go alone?

844
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,635
Oman:
Yeah and I ain't
like it none neither,

845
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,106
but you know, you can only
treat a young man like a boy

846
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:30,808
for so long
before they buck,
you know what I mean?

847
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,443
When Bailey got killed,
you must've figured

848
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,512
that Barksdale was coming
back on you, right?

849
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,247
Man, Bailey?
Please.

850
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,549
That nigga's enemies
got enemies.

851
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,851
I just figured he tried
his hand on the wrong corner

852
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,220
without us
and got dropped.

853
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,590
But you were worried
about Brandon, right?

854
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,158
Omar:
Look, in my game,

855
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,860
you take some
care and you play it
the safest way you can.

856
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:51,963
But it ain't about
no hiding forever.

857
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:54,165
You heard?

858
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,567
And frankly, you been
in this as long as me,

859
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,503
you do the thing
on your name.

860
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,005
Anyone gonna
come after Omar,

861
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:01,772
they gonna know Omar's
comin' after him.

862
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,242
Oh, indeed.

863
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,711
So, who came
after Brandon?

864
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,981
Heard it might've
been Wee-Bey.

865
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,250
Boy Stinkum.

866
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,019
And Bird,

867
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,654
he was down
with the snatch, too.

868
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,695
Greggs:
So, what can you
give us on the towers?

869
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,264
Omar:
What you need?

870
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:28,633
Check it,
7:56, Tuesday night,

871
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,768
you got an incoming call
to D'Angelo Barksdale's

872
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,370
giving him the number
of a pay phone,

873
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,806
Westside exchange,
numbers encoded, right?

874
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,408
Three minutes later,

875
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:40,445
you get another call from
the low-rises to that number.

876
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,947
Then a half a minute later
you get another call

877
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:44,715
from the low rises
to a pager number

878
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,484
we know is
Stringer Bell's.

879
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,119
Well, I'll be damned.

880
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:51,289
Finally, you get another call,
probably from a pay phone,

881
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:53,124
probably Stringer Bell
calling back

882
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:55,026
coming on into
the low rise courts.

883
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:58,929
45 minutes later,
another call,

884
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:03,334
this one from
the same pay phone that
went to D'Angelo's pager

885
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,636
to start the
whole damn thing off.
You see that?

886
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,505
This is the murder,
right here.

887
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,841
This first number,
the one they sent
to D'Angelo,

888
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:14,445
I'm thinkin' this
comes from a pay phone
over by the Greek's.

889
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:24,655
He's on you.

890
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,325
We're up on those pay
phones Tuesday night,
we catch that murder.

891
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:28,859
Shit, we get there
before the murder.

892
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,328
It's all here
on the pen registers.

893
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:33,431
This one calling that one,
that one calling back.

894
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,633
We're up on those pay phones
when we should be,

895
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:36,967
and we have them cold.

896
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:39,003
But we're not up
in time, are we?

897
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,606
In this case, we're never
where we need to be.

898
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,575
( door slams )

899
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:55,553
Bad time for y'all?

900
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,902
He fight,
but you arrest.

901
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,038
You saw him
get arrested?

902
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,840
On Tuesday?

903
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,408
Tuesday, Tuesday,
yes, yes, Tuesday.

904
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,877
By the police?
The police arrested him?

905
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,946
Cuffs,
they handcuffed him.

906
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:24,048
Mmm.

907
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:26,117
How about
these guys?

908
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,486
Were they there
with him?

909
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,388
No, no.

910
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:31,989
No?

911
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,593
No, he fight,
you arrest.

912
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:37,962
Thank you, sir.

913
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:39,697
Thank you.

914
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:48,239
It's a match.

915
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,776
No.

916
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,911
I need help.
Rawls ranks me.

917
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:57,382
Lieutenant, think
what you're doing here.

918
00:51:57,482 --> 00:51:59,817
You're gonna
cross Bill Rawls,

919
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,754
as ruthless a fuck
as we have in this
department,

920
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:07,625
and to do what?

921
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:11,262
To fight for a case
the Deputy of Operations
doesn't even want.

922
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,365
No.

923
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,802
I like my career,
thank you very much.

924
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,507
Greggs:
In the cemetery,
you were telling us a guy

925
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:25,009
by the name of Bird
killed the working man?

926
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,978
Omar:
Yeah, that man
who testified.

927
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,248
William Gant, right.

928
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,650
Yeah, Bird did that one,
for sure.

929
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,420
- How you know?
- Everybody know, man.

930
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,954
Nigga walked up
behind the man

931
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:38,389
and shot him
straight in the head.

932
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,458
The whole blessed
projects saw that much.

933
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,493
And Bird worked
for Avon?

934
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:44,295
Yeah, as one
a his shooters.

935
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:46,497
Liked to use this
real sweet gun he got.

936
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,833
A 380 from Austria
or Australia,

937
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:50,134
or something like that.

938
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:52,203
But I know
he love that gun.

939
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:54,104
- A 380?
- Yeah, a 380.

940
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,840
You get him,
you get the gun,

941
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,409
'cause Bird too dumb
to throw a gun like
that off.

942
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,045
- A gun alone ain't enough.
- Oh, no?

943
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,814
He goes to court,
testifies he bought
the gun on the street

944
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,115
after Gant was killed.

945
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,684
Come on, now,
so, what be enough then?

946
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,319
Eyeball witness.

947
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:11,622
Some kind of corroboration
for what you're telling me here.

948
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,127
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

949
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:18,763
I'm your man.

950
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,398
You saw the murder?

951
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:22,567
Yeah.

952
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:25,570
You can ID this man Bird
as the shooter of William Gant?

953
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,573
And you ain't afraid
to go into the court downtown

954
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:31,976
and testify against
one of Barksdale's people?

955
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,413
Omar don't scare.

956
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,250
The fact is that while
Lieutenant Daniels

957
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,286
and his merry band
are lost in the swamps,

958
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:44,689
playing with beepers
and pay phones and body mikes,

959
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,424
my people have
developed information

960
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:48,225
that ties Barksdale
to three killings.

961
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:49,960
D'Angelo Barksdale,
not Avon.

962
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,996
D'Angelo,
on behalf of Avon.

963
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:53,531
The victim is identified
by our witness

964
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:56,534
as being involved
with Avon Barksdale.

965
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:59,169
Sir, we're developing
information.

966
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,439
You're dancing
around this thing.

967
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,341
I'm charging
three murders.

968
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:06,811
You charge those cases,
my investigation folds.

969
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,446
And what's more,
not one of those cases

970
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:10,014
is strong enough for court.
You know that.

971
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:12,182
So, we bring
the Barksdale kid in,

972
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,453
throw a little mindfuck
at him and the case
becomes stronger.

973
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,254
You've had him
in the box twice before.

974
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,189
He's gonna go for less
the third time around.

975
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,960
So, we recanvass,
develop fresh witnesses.

976
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,495
The case
I charge on today

977
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,997
can be twice as strong
by the trial date.

978
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,666
We get a conviction,

979
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,537
we roll little boy Barksdale
into big boy Barksdale,

980
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:36,006
then we go home like
good old-fashioned cops

981
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,509
and pound
some Budweiser.

982
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,978
This...

983
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:43,348
is bullshit!

984
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:45,383
It was
McNulty himself

985
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:47,084
who made the ballistics
match on these murders

986
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:48,786
and he's telling me
to fight this.

987
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,755
He knows you don't have
a viable prosecution.

988
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:52,923
So do you,
so do I.

989
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,592
Enough!

990
00:54:56,994 --> 00:55:00,765
Look, I've got no love
for your wiretap, Lieutenant.

991
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:04,702
I'm spending 2,000 a day
over the unit operating budget

992
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,737
to staff the case.

993
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,806
And Major Rawls here
is offering a chance

994
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:12,242
to leverage Barksdale
through a murder prosecution.

995
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:14,612
Why not jump on this?

996
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:18,516
Because if
Major Rawls is right,

997
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:21,652
then he will be just
as right a month from now.

998
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,888
And if the wire
doesn't give us a case,

999
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,890
he can charge all
the murders he has.

1000
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,658
We lose nothing.

1001
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:30,828
But if he's wrong,
if he can't convict,

1002
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:33,330
or if the Barksdale kid
doesn't flip,

1003
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:36,200
then it's too late
to do anything else.

1004
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,671
Avon Barksdale
changes up his pattern
and the wiretap dies.

1005
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:42,707
And at that point,
there isn't gonna
be a thing

1006
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:45,676
that you or me
or Rawls here

1007
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:48,446
is gonna be able to say
to that goddamn judge.

1008
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,188
You wanted
to see me, Major?

1009
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:01,692
McNulty does personal
business on the clock,
I want to know.

1010
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:04,562
He cheats on a run sheet,
I want to know.

1011
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:07,131
He runs any kind of game
at all, I want to know.

1012
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:09,667
Major, the man's
an asshole,

1013
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,936
but he doesn't do much
other than work.

1014
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,839
He's got this fuckin' case
in his gut like it's cancer.

1015
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,675
He does no wrong?

1016
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,478
He doesn't drink anymore?
Doesn't drink on duty?

1017
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,613
Doesn't drink
and drive, Detective?

1018
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,314
Major...

1019
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,451
You gotta help me
on this, Michael.

1020
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:50,775
Daniels:
The murder warrants
are on hold.

1021
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:54,579
The deputy gave us
another month.

1022
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,914
Also, whoever that was
you brought in here today

1023
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,850
gave himself up
as an eyewitness
in the Gant murder.

1024
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,752
Who, Omar?

1025
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:04,955
And Greggs said
to tell you she'd write
it up in the morning.

1026
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:09,059
Lieutenant.

1027
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,062
Thanks.

1028
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:19,970
It cost you?

1029
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,143
( music playing )

1030
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,957
( theme music playing )
