00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,200
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:31,259
What's up?

3
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,397
Great view.

4
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:38,566
Harbor, I mean.

5
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,503
It's fucking picturesque, is what it is.

6
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,702
Every morning I ask myself,
"Is today the day I drive down...

7
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,974
"to Fort Armistead, stare out at the harbor?"

8
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:52,778
No, I figure eventually,
if I mind my own business...

9
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,718
Uncle Frank will wake my ass up
at 7:00 in the morning...

10
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:59,723
tell me to get my ass down there
for some mysterious fucking reason.

11
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,558
Good anchorage, good cranes...

12
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:12,535
good railroads, close to I-95.
Lot of people ready to work, right?

13
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,603
That's my fucking town.

14
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,669
Except, the thing is,
we're another 110 miles...

15
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:21,610
for any ship coming up
from Hampton Roads. An extra day.

16
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,113
So why come?

17
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:25,115
Unless you know your cargo's
gonna move...

18
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:27,276
fast and clean through the port.

19
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:30,116
Why offload in Baltimore,
except that a Baltimore gang...

20
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:33,020
can turn your ship around
faster than any other port...

21
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,956
and will make sure your cargo...

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,655
all your cargo, gets where it needs to go
faster than anywhere else.

23
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,164
Like you guys never stole nothing
back in the day.

24
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,599
We ain't back in the day, Nicky.

25
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,797
When was the last time
you saw trucks backed up for three miles...

26
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,033
outside Patapsco terminal?

27
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:52,076
If it wasn't for the car-ships,
we would be starving.

28
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,642
The cameras come back.

29
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,036
I'm serious.

30
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:59,845
They come back today, we tell the shipper
we lost the can in the stacks.

31
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:02,750
They're gone. We turned them over already.

32
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,481
To who?

33
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,357
You know the Tasco line's a cunt hair away
from taking their business down to Norfolk.

34
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:17,902
- I don't need this shit right now.
- I do, Uncle Frank, I need the money.

35
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,995
- You ain't hearing me!
- What? You think this shit is easy?

36
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:24,542
You think it's fucking easy?
You try living on five or six days a month.

37
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:28,238
See how fast it puts you on your ass.
I am on my ass, Uncle Frank.

38
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,008
You need money, you come to me.

39
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:32,345
Frankie Sobotka is
Father fucking Christmas...

40
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,850
on the docks lately.

41
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,047
- No doubt, his pockets are full.
- You think it's for me?

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,790
Is that what you think?

43
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,826
It ain't about me, Nick!

44
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,230
I know, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:51,027
You got Ziggy mixed up in this.
Jesus, Nick, what the fuck are you thinking?

46
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,333
Me and Zig are gonna talk on this
long and hard.

47
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,146
Come on, let's go to work.

48
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:14,720
How much?

49
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,887
Twenty.

50
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,261
- Three-way split.
- Who's the inside man?

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,424
You don't know?

52
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,803
Fuck you then, I ain't no snitch.

53
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,609
Nobody should flash too much money.
You know that much, right?

54
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:35,471
Yeah.

55
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:14,912
Toxicology's coming back positive
for strychnine.

56
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,504
10%, 12%. It's pretty well laced.

57
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,106
This was intentional?

58
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:22,652
That's the ME's call, but I've seen
street packages cut all the time...

59
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,915
with all kinds of chemicals.

60
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,957
You don't use too much,
you give a weak package some kick.

61
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,960
People start thinking you're high-grade,
when what you got is...

62
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,724
stepped-on trash
with a little bit of rat poison mixed in.

63
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,595
Too much rat poison,
you got people falling out, like we got.

64
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,067
Be nice to have a few answers
for those reporters.

65
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,296
What do they wanna know?

66
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,600
How it got in, what we're doing, the usual.

67
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:43,334
It got in like everything gets in.

68
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,138
If you can't win
the war on drugs in a prison...

69
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,469
where the hell you gonna win it? I ask you.

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,071
Listen, if it were one or two dead,
it would fade.

71
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,913
But five in one night,
and eight more in the infirmary?

72
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,509
We need to show the flag on this.

73
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,055
What I'm gonna need is for you all
to wheel and deal.

74
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,454
What do you mean?

75
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:01,788
If this case gets made from an informant...

76
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,328
and you're gonna have
a couple dozen of them...

77
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,762
if you're ready to shave some years.

78
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,034
Colonel.

79
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,938
- Jimmy.
- Winona.

80
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,120
Gilligan, little buddy.

81
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,920
Don't you have a job?

82
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,282
Ouch!

83
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,093
I smell fresh police work.

84
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,702
Okay, be like that.

85
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:50,933
You got some paper from inside the can?

86
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,341
A letter, couple of envelopes,
some scraps of stuff?

87
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,606
Yeah, everything's down
in your evidence control.

88
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:58,444
- You got the submission slips?
- He does.

89
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,754
- Lester.
- You want to pull all of it?

90
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,255
Hold it.

91
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,422
Before you start dancing
with your Jane Doe...

92
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,364
I'm gonna need a little something from you
on the Gant case.

93
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,595
I got a full set of llene Nathan's teeth marks
on my hind parts.

94
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,036
- No problem, I got you covered.
- You found Omar?

95
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,232
I never lost him, my friend.

96
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:30,313
- He's got Omar?
- Bullshit.

97
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,746
Who's Omar?

98
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:45,988
My papers are in.

99
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,057
They are.

100
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,532
You want out, you're out.

101
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,966
But I'm offering to clean the slate here.

102
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,272
- You and me.
- Why?

103
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,972
The council vote is next week,
after which I'm upstairs.

104
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,483
Now, if I'm gonna give myself a chance...

105
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:08,815
to make my mark on this place,
I'll need good people.

106
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:11,484
People you can trust.

107
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,520
And you ain't that?

108
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:17,158
All right. You're a snake.

109
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,723
But you seem to know your business.

110
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:23,323
I'm taking the bar exam in a month.

111
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,836
Why not put it off for a year or two...

112
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,805
leave the department
with a major's pension?

113
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,066
Scalise is gonna retire this summer.

114
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:35,344
You do me a good turn
on this detail in southeast...

115
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,706
and you'll have that posting.

116
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,647
Why would you do that?

117
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,412
I value you, Cedric.

118
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,816
You're arrogant and disloyal.

119
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,688
But maybe, given time,
you'll find a way to shine.

120
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,793
- What's the detail?
- Drug case, probably.

121
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,630
My sense of it is that Stan Valchek has got...

122
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,966
some personal issues with somebody
in one of the port unions.

123
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,006
He thinks they've got too much money.

124
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:05,133
And so, being Valchek, he gets a detail.

125
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:07,868
That it? Pretty thin.

126
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,942
I don't care if you make a case
for Valchek or not.

127
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,246
I do care that the old Polack
comes away from it...

128
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,719
feeling he got his money's worth.

129
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,253
Valchek asked for me by name, didn't he?

130
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:25,454
You two are trading horses
and you need me in the corral.

131
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,494
How about this?

132
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,372
If I bring in the case...

133
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,701
you make the detail permanent
as a major case unit...

134
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,370
within CID.

135
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,778
Fair enough.

136
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:46,510
Just keep Valchek stroked
and make sure you bring in...

137
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,643
- a drug case or two.
- One other thing.

138
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,190
A promotion and the promise
of a specialized unit isn't enough?

139
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,758
I choose my own people.

140
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,960
Fuck me once, shame on you.

141
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,559
- Fuck me twice...
- Make a list.

142
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,768
Give it to Rawls. He'll pull who you want.

143
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:22,951
The shit do not make sense.
Some of them wasn't about nothing.

144
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,888
I mean, Tae? Lizard? If it was a hotshot...

145
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,755
they were after
some real lightweight motherfucks.

146
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,254
Yo, Dee, you want any Silver Surfers?

147
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,854
They tossing shit Tae had in his cell, man.

148
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,433
Whoever load that shit up
didn't know what he was doing.

149
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,600
My boy down the infirmary say the shit
was more rat poison than it was dope.

150
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,651
Fucking-A right.

151
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,803
Jane Doe, number five.

152
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,678
Five.

153
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:38,653
What's up, baby?

154
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,829
Not here, put it away.

155
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,040
Shot and a beer, darling.

156
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,004
Kept one for yourself, did you?

157
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,807
Them Japs, they make a nice little camera,
they do.

158
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:59,213
- You even got film in that bitch?
- No, it's digital.

159
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,313
I know it's digital, so what?

160
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:04,877
So, no film, look,
there's a computer chip inside.

161
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:08,053
You take that off,
you load the pictures onto the computer.

162
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,218
Thanks.

163
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,557
Ziggy.

164
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,724
Don't spread no cash around
for a while, all right?

165
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,463
Hell, no.

166
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,938
I might get a new clutch plate
put in Princess is all.

167
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,208
- Also, your father knows.
- How does he know?

168
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,041
Horse saw us, right?

169
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:33,441
Fuck me, he told?

170
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,521
How long has Horse been tight
with your pop? Of course he told.

171
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,214
He's pissed, Zig. He ain't happy.

172
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,215
What did you say?

173
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,157
I told him we already
turned the cameras around...

174
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:49,665
and after a while, he stopped yelling.

175
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,497
At you, maybe.

176
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:54,839
Anyway.

177
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:58,234
It's low profile for a while, all right?

178
00:12:58,343 --> 00:12:59,571
All right.

179
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:09,282
You take a picture on that,
you don't have to take it to photomart...

180
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:12,447
- to get it turned around?
- No, it goes on a computer.

181
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,826
I got to take a leak.

182
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,128
I go next, all right?

183
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,587
Pretty boy. Hey, there.

184
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:51,785
Christ, Ziggy.

185
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,237
Jimmy, just a scheduling thing.

186
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,366
Sean was invited to Mark Lohrman's
birthday party on Saturday.

187
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,274
So you can pick him up there after 2:00.

188
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,746
I realize it's your weekend,
but Sean would be upset if he missed it.

189
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,214
Okay? Great.

190
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:17,486
Omar by the end of the week, Jimmy.
Ilene is on the warpath.

191
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,815
Motherfucker, I am serious.

192
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,524
Mr. McNulty, this is Dr. Halpern's office.

193
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,755
You missed your six-month cleaning
on Tuesday...

194
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,092
and we haven't heard from you.

195
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,790
Give us a call, please.

196
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,195
McNulty, this is your dear friend
llene Nathan.

197
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,169
I indicted this piece-of-shit case...

198
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:37,070
because you swore to me
we had an eyeball witness...

199
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:50,319
Drive time is 6:38 in the a.m.
and we have reports of a...

200
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,901
- Go around, asshole.
- What'd you call me?

201
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,172
I'm sleeping on this side.

202
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:15,041
Because you got to get up, everybody does?

203
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,107
Yup.

204
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:30,016
Wipe off the seat, Nick, I know you hit it.

205
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,199
- If I could fart now, I would.
- That's a surprise.

206
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,832
No chance for breakfast?

207
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,338
No. I'll stop by the bar.

208
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,606
No, you won't. You ain't got time.

209
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,012
You got to run me past my ma's
to pick up Ashley.

210
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,314
Shit, hurry up, then.
You know I got a ship to work today.

211
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,555
Your ma knows you got a ship, too.

212
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:02,485
Don't go upstairs. Just head out the back.

213
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,586
I'll pick you up at the back
of the alley, all right?

214
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,464
Jesus, Nicky, we got a kid together.

215
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,670
What's the big deal we spend the night
in your folks' basement?

216
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,603
They're decent people.

217
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,684
- We ain't got time.
- I know.

218
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,520
- So, why you grabbing?
- They were staring right at me.

219
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:49,837
I'll meet you out back.

220
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,478
So how do you get the container
off the ship, off the dock?

221
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,048
I guess if you wanted
to make sure your cargo...

222
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,209
isn't messed with, you'd want to get
with one of the checkers.

223
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,310
- Who are they?
- Local 1514.

224
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,651
They monitor
all the loading and offloading...

225
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:08,351
they match the manifests,
they tally the cargo.

226
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,293
Nothing goes in or out
without them putting it down somewhere.

227
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,954
- Or not.
- Or not.

228
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,923
So we need to talk to a checker.

229
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,560
What?

230
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:21,096
Black, white, Polish, lrish, ltalian,
it doesn't matter.

231
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,830
No one talks to police.

232
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,842
How do you make a case then?

233
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,106
I patrol.

234
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,079
I write traffic tickets.

235
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:34,174
If we got an open container,
or a damaged container...

236
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,513
I take a report.

237
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,986
We got something stolen,
I take another report.

238
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:42,526
Someone gets something dropped on him
or gets run over by a front-end loader...

239
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,754
- I keep writing.
- That's the job?

240
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,526
How long you been on?

241
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:51,693
- Two years.
- What did you do before that?

242
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:56,635
I took tolls from people
at the Fort McHenry tunnel.

243
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,940
Which, I'm happy to say,
wasn't nearly as much fun.

244
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,609
Made $22,500
and went home tired every night...

245
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,274
until I walked by the office bulletin board
one night...

246
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,873
read the MDOT job posting.

247
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,012
Port Authority officers, Schedule one,
starting at $33,000 with benefits.

248
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,783
Toll-taking days were over?

249
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,858
Father of my two kids
went to Houston in '99...

250
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:23,761
hasn't so much as called in three years.

251
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,699
I wasn't gonna make it on $22,500.

252
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:27,464
Not with kids, I wasn't.

253
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,668
Did you want to be a police?

254
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,863
- Could've been me the other night.
- True.

255
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:02,539
Except for all of a sudden,
you up and tell me to stop doing that.

256
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,131
Avon to the rescue. How did you know?

257
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,571
I figured you were gonna be
bringing your ass in here...

258
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,671
to thank me for pulling you off of that shit.

259
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,546
Five dead. More in the infirmary.

260
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:16,814
- How did you know?
- I did as your uncle should...

261
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:20,080
because I'm concerned about
you fucking yourself up.

262
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,957
You knew.

263
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,388
Look, man, I ain't had nothing to do with it.

264
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,823
I might know who did, though.

265
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,560
You practically running this place.
Who else could it be?

266
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:34,571
It ain't about what happened,
you understand?

267
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:38,433
It's about using what happened
to our advantage.

268
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,200
Play or you gonna get played.

269
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,472
I need to know that you ain't do that shit.

270
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,740
That's what I need to know.

271
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:47,045
I already said it.
You ain't gonna believe it, fuck it.

272
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:51,219
You can tell yourself that I spiked it,
but be grateful that you still standing.

273
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:52,846
Once you done with all that...

274
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,949
we can talk about how we start
shaving some of these years off.

275
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,789
And not just for me, for you, too.

276
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,887
They looking for the motherfucker
who brought that shit in here.

277
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,796
They need him to fall. And you know what?

278
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,892
I can give you a name.
I can give you the right name.

279
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,768
We can take that name
down to the assistant warden...

280
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,374
and we can get some of our lives back.

281
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:13,371
You dig?

282
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:18,141
So, stay close.

283
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,683
This play on the inside,
this play on the outside...

284
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,650
we got it all covered.

285
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:29,484
I don't want no part of what you do no more.
You hear me?

286
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,029
So you can just leave me
the fuck out of that.

287
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,655
Whatever it is.

288
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,122
Anyone seen Omar?

289
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,762
We're back in!

290
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:19,800
Six ships in one day.

291
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:23,646
Ain't seen the terminal this busy in months.
Feels sweet.

292
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:25,941
Shit, look at this pretty bitch.

293
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,915
- What the fuck are you wearing?
- Italian leather, all right?

294
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:32,312
In the middle of winter?
On the goddamn docks?

295
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:34,789
- How much does that shit cost?
- $2,000.

296
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:37,861
For a goddamn jacket?
Are you out your fucking mind, Zig?

297
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,521
Fuck it.

298
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,064
$2,000 for a single goddamn jacket.

299
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,734
Jesus, Zig, you need therapy and shit.

300
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:48,563
I figured an African-American
such as yourself would understand...

301
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,972
how a player such as myself
needs to take heed in the latest fashion.

302
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:55,204
But apparently,
you ain't got no fucking style neither.

303
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,178
- I'm gonna walk, all right?
- See you.

304
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,477
What?

305
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,388
What did I tell you about
not spreading no cash around?

306
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,357
Jesus Christ, Nicky, it's a fucking coat.

307
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:13,286
I can tell people I'm paying for it
on installments or whatever.

308
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:17,363
But you got to admit, I do look pretty today.

309
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:18,526
I do.

310
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:26,672
The Greeks wanna talk to us.

311
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:28,106
What about?

312
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:30,580
We did good by them.

313
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:32,140
Yeah?

314
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,882
But, for Christ sakes, Zig,
keep your shit quiet...

315
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,888
before half the fucking waterfront's
talking about us.

316
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:40,683
All right, no problem.

317
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,723
- All right. See you later.
- See you.

318
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,586
Yo, quit it.

319
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,383
Gentlemen.

320
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,159
We don't need that now.

321
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:22,494
- Say what?
- I don't give a shit about drugs.

322
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,865
Littering pisses me off, though.
You can pick that up when I'm gone.

323
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,530
I'm looking for a stick-up boy,
name of Omar.

324
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,968
Dark-skinned, thin guy
with a scar right down his face.

325
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,775
You boys would definitely know him
if you saw him...

326
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,143
because he's got a shotgun about yea-long.

327
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:40,706
He'll put it to your head
and steal your shit without thinking twice.

328
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:42,513
Does anyone know where he hangs?

329
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,453
Who he's running with?

330
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,159
What he's driving?

331
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,486
Fuck you, Officer.

332
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,265
The second package came
even weaker than the last.

333
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:03,169
It won't take the cut like it did before.

334
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:06,368
Fucking Atlanta shit cost more
and still not as good.

335
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:08,943
Came in at 25.

336
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:11,071
All we can do is sprinkle it and bag it.

337
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,479
And lose my money?

338
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,312
I lose my money.

339
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,121
Step on that motherfucker.

340
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,485
How hard?

341
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,319
Make it 10.

342
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:25,588
- It's shit now.
- I know.

343
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,841
So the container itself leads us nowhere.
Fake addresses on either end.

344
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,204
Which leaves us the port itself.

345
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,639
Because whatever went wrong
on that ship was known to whoever...

346
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,547
was supposed to pick that container up.

347
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,677
Which is why it stays on the dock.

348
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:54,417
Bottom line is, we need to know more
about cargo moving off that terminal.

349
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:57,551
How to do dirt.
And how to hide when you're doing dirt.

350
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,489
Bottom line for me is different.

351
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:07,265
Bottom line for me is,
you guys should've held that ship.

352
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:10,670
For your crime scene, for your witnesses,
for the whole damn case.

353
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,867
Sir, the witnesses...

354
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,467
I don't care if they were
speaking Mandarin Chinese...

355
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,944
with a cocksucker's lisp.

356
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,574
They needed to see the inside of
an interrogation room. They were the case.

357
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,118
We were in Philadelphia,
with no real jurisdiction...

358
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:25,086
dealing with foreign nationals
and no real probable cause.

359
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:28,556
I can only tell you
what it looks like from where I sit.

360
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,091
And from here, the view is
two of my detectives fucking the dog.

361
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:38,696
Thirteen homicides, 14, if we connect
the floater, and all of them red.

362
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,838
So what can I tell you?

363
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:45,204
If this case doesn't fall,
we're all gonna be stepping on our dicks...

364
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,970
trying to explain what happened.

365
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,871
So, work it as you see fit...

366
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:54,348
but understand...

367
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,649
if I have to throw Burrell
a scapegoat or two...

368
00:25:58,022 --> 00:25:59,489
I got one to throw.

369
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:19,904
Fuck me.

370
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,710
What did you want to talk to us about?

371
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:03,309
If you are able to do like you did,
we have other things we can use.

372
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,388
Like what?

373
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:07,980
Fact is, we shook things up down there
snatching all them cameras.

374
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,759
It comes to expensive shit like that,
we got to lay back for a while.

375
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:13,887
Stuff we need is not like that.

376
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:15,387
No?

377
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:22,662
Acetone, sulfuric acid,
potassium permanganate.

378
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,674
- Chemicals?
- It's like paint thinner, shit like that.

379
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:29,143
What do you need with those?
Just go get them at the hardware store.

380
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:31,544
No. We need much.

381
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:35,508
Metric tons. Five or ten tons.

382
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,350
Check and you'll see,
they make these things here.

383
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,892
Send them from here.
Tanks and tanks down at your docks.

384
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:46,658
Good money for those.

385
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,193
How much?

386
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:57,702
How much chemical? Two tons? Four?

387
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:00,333
- Eight?
- I'll look into it.

388
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:21,763
Yo, Bubbles!

389
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:25,330
McNulty.

390
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:28,462
My meanest man.

391
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,232
Get in the car.

392
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,543
Where you been at, brother?

393
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,887
What did you get? Walkman.

394
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,959
You know how it works, Bubs.
You're going to pay taxes on this shit.

395
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:55,365
Taxation without representation, you know?

396
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,763
I don't want much. I need Omar.

397
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,067
Wild Omar?

398
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:03,235
You want us to wander around town...

399
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,002
looking for a crazy motherfucker
with a shotgun?

400
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,374
Him and me go way back,
it's a friendly thing.

401
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:11,175
If he's a friend,
you can find the motherfucker without us.

402
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,911
No problem. Show me the receipt
for this shit, you're off the hook.

403
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:21,287
- Here.
- Keep it, part of my tax.

404
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:23,753
Your tax is Omar.

405
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:27,492
I need a line by Friday, Bubs.

406
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:32,057
Fuck!

407
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:36,330
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

408
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,307
He can identify the method
by which contraband is smuggled...

409
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,072
into this institution,
as well as the people responsible.

410
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,771
Cellblock talk is cheap.

411
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,872
He'll give you what you need
to make a case...

412
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:48,850
- if that's what you're interested in.
- Your terms?

413
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,786
Mr. Barksdale is due
for a first parole hearing at 28 months.

414
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:53,652
We'd like to trim that to a year...

415
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:56,191
and have your assurances
of institutional support...

416
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:58,386
for work release and early parole.

417
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,257
One year on a seven-year bit?

418
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:03,259
We are offering extraordinary cooperation
in this matter.

419
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,597
Mr. Barksdale's placing himself at risk...

420
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,137
by offering information
implicating other prisoners...

421
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,831
and staff at MCl.

422
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,343
And I would only add that
Mr. Barksdale's extant conviction is his first.

423
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,276
He has no priors whatsoever.

424
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:21,115
It's my recollection that a city police
got shot behind Mr. Barksdale's business.

425
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:23,618
- No, sir.
- You don't remember that?

426
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,051
I remember the officer got shot.

427
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:29,922
And I remember being upset about that,
not only because the officer got shot...

428
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:33,053
but because I knew it meant
there was gonna be more police on me.

429
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:36,792
I remember thinking, "Any time any fool
do something like shoot a police...

430
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,095
"it's bad on everyone."

431
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,432
I know that you know
that my name ain't nowhere...

432
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,835
on what happened to your friend.

433
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,967
I think what we're asking is reasonable
under the circumstances.

434
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,846
After all, until someone identifies the source
of the tainted heroin...

435
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:54,611
you could have
another five overdoses tomorrow.

436
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,115
Or the day after.

437
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,612
Consider the offer.

438
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:01,756
But the next time we talk...

439
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,726
an assistant attorney general
has to be in the room.

440
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,432
Tuna surprise?

441
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:23,846
Christ sakes, Ma,
I climbed all over two ships today.

442
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:26,975
How about a meal for that kind of day?

443
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:35,216
- Where's Pop?
- He's at the bar with the horses.

444
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,394
Go tell him it's dinner.

445
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:03,682
- We winning, Pop?
- Nicko.

446
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:05,721
You up today?

447
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,786
I was doing good,
but this year Gulfstream is killing me.

448
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:13,358
Go easy. That's my inheritance.

449
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:19,936
After 25 years, I'm still ahead almost $7,000.

450
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,835
You ought to let me take you up to Pimlico
when it opens.

451
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,805
Try your system out for real.

452
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:26,473
Too tempting.

453
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,275
Just once.

454
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:34,475
Saw that the Cape Spruance
is over at Point West.

455
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,645
Yeah, we offloaded her today.

456
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,926
You know we double-hulled her
down at number four.

457
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,430
Maybe two years before
the dry dock closed up.

458
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,167
She still floats?

459
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,472
Of course she still floats.

460
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,640
You ever miss it, Pop?

461
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:06,844
Wouldn't do no good.

462
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,219
What's for dinner?

463
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,657
Tuna surprise.

464
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,866
You're loyal to your people.
I respect that, at least.

465
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,838
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

466
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:37,311
Burrell wants you on this detail,
so I want you, too.

467
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:39,814
I need your approval
for Freamon, Greggs, and Hauk.

468
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,784
- They're all CID.
- Correction.

469
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,215
You need my approval for everyone.
This may be Valchek's creation...

470
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:50,316
but the detail is investigative
and comes under CID.

471
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,390
If they work for me, they need my okay.

472
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:59,558
Good news is, I got no problem
with anyone on your list.

473
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:03,771
Except McNulty. No McNulty.

474
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,870
Nothing that even resembles
the son of a bitch.

475
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:09,907
- That bad?
- He quits or he drowns.

476
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:14,344
That's the only two things get him
off the fucking boat, so help me God.

477
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:20,087
You even know what
this detail's about, Lieutenant?

478
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,987
Some kind of beef that Valchek has.

479
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:24,754
Two fucking Polacks
pissing on each other's leg.

480
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,452
I heard.

481
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:29,997
Anything to get you
out of the basement, Lieutenant?

482
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,007
Girl.

483
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,624
No! Kima, who cares?

484
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:00,825
We're gonna be there in five minutes
and they'll still be dumb-ass frat boys.

485
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,695
You got to start thinking,
what would a lawyer do?

486
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,631
What would a lawyer say?

487
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:08,903
Shakima Greggs, Esquire.

488
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:12,001
That's what I'm talking about.

489
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:25,253
- Get your ass down, fool.
- Fuck you, lady.

490
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,096
Ain't no lady.

491
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,967
- Bitch, drive it or lose it.
- Oh, my God, let's get out of here.

492
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:52,640
Only the finest breeds can perform this well,
with this much heart and obedience.

493
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:57,245
Obedience that brings out the champion
not only in show dogs...

494
00:35:57,354 --> 00:36:01,984
Look at that tiger go. A third generation
champion from Glassport.

495
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:05,994
Even house pets that never knew
they had the blood of champions in them.

496
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:07,853
To perform at this level...

497
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,559
an animal has to follow orders
without question.

498
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:11,725
It is not instinct.

499
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:13,063
Come on upstairs.

500
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,967
All dogs have instinct.

501
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,478
Jesus Christ.

502
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:40,590
Nothing's on this side. Most chemicals
are over at the Fairfield terminals.

503
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:42,494
Who do we know at Fairfield?

504
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,993
Ott's brother-in-law works there.
You might try and touch him.

505
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,172
What do they want with those for, anyway?

506
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,242
Beats the fuck out of me.

507
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,913
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Fuck, man, shit.

508
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,178
I didn't see you standing there
in all that sweet leather.

509
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:04,719
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Clumsy, I guess.

510
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,847
You can just go out
and steal a whole can full of baby wipes...

511
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,721
and just clean yourself up.

512
00:37:13,196 --> 00:37:14,857
You fucking goof.

513
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,864
Dick.

514
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,268
Shit, Lieutenant, I promised.

515
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,307
Think my woman's gonna give
a great big cheer when she hears about it?

516
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,005
- I was out the damn door.
- You don't know Cheryl.

517
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:31,740
You don't know Marla.

518
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,513
If you want...

519
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,379
I could use you inside,
like we did Prez last year.

520
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:39,614
If I hear the music, I'm gonna dance.

521
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,395
I'll tell your wife, if you tell mine.

522
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,116
In the car, but not out in the open.

523
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,675
Yo, Rock.

524
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,256
Be subtle with it, man.

525
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:18,156
- You know what subtle means?
- Laid back and shit.

526
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:35,167
- Good tunes, Pop?
- Yeah.

527
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,577
Thanks for the phones.

528
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,289
I don't know, Bubs. I mean...

529
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,630
if you go rolling over rocks...

530
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:59,467
then you're gonna get bit by a snake, right?

531
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,797
Got to pay that tax, Johnny.

532
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:08,469
You got to give a working police his due.

533
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:17,183
- So, Bee's working for Lamar?
- All of them work for Lamar.

534
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:19,515
He got that whole corner to hisself.

535
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:22,857
You saying the stash is across the street
in the low-rises?

536
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,256
In the second court.

537
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:27,888
They got it up in this one place
that got the boarded-up windows.

538
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:30,464
How many doors down from the end?

539
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:33,633
Three.

540
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,704
Yo, Pops.

541
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:53,154
Anyone got a line on that wild boy
who likes to pop the shotty?

542
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:56,623
- Omar?
- Yeah, I need Omar.

543
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:58,660
What do you want with Omar?

544
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:01,193
Just want a word with him.

545
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:03,221
Just a word.

546
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:06,327
You want to get with Omar...

547
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:09,203
you need to stand out
on one of them corners...

548
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,206
with a big-ass package.

549
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:14,706
You be talking to that nigger soon enough.

550
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,747
You feel anything?

551
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,353
Let's go.

552
00:40:32,662 --> 00:40:33,890
Come on.

553
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:02,149
As agreed, the price of cooperation is
an agreement by the state parole officials...

554
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,558
to move Mr. Barksdale's
first parole hearing forward by 12 months...

555
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,721
and to credit him in the file
with cooperation in this matter.

556
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:11,528
You can't make a case
on just some con's say so.

557
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,262
We need the dope on the table.

558
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,530
Of course you do.

559
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,436
If, before the end of business today,
you effect a search...

560
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:21,307
of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle,
locker, and person...

561
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,073
we are confident
sufficient evidence will be recovered.

562
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,545
"We are confident"?

563
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:28,680
As far as D.O.C. is concerned,
this is a fair deal...

564
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:31,481
if it takes the overdoses off our plate.

565
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,821
But if we come up empty on this...

566
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,081
You won't.

567
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,598
Five will get you ten...

568
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:46,999
that's the motherfucker
that spiked the packages.

569
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:48,695
You have proof of this?

570
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:51,764
Then we make the case
that's there for us to make.

571
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:12,058
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. New Orleans.

572
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,491
Lieutenant.

573
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:23,728
- Welcome to the southeast.
- Major, I understand you asked for me.

574
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:27,101
My son-in-law can't say enough
in your favor.

575
00:42:27,243 --> 00:42:30,474
And, of course, you did him
a good turn last year, right?

576
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:34,547
- You want to tell me about this target?
- Frank Sobotka.

577
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,985
A union man down at the port.

578
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:42,049
The motherfucker's showing a lot of money.
My gut says a drug connection.

579
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,352
I can also tell you for a fact
that his people...

580
00:42:45,762 --> 00:42:48,629
will up and steal anything
that isn't nailed down.

581
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,596
- You seen the off-site?
- Not yet.

582
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:53,999
I told my people to meet up here,
at the district.

583
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,834
Pretty good digs. Come on, I'll show you.

584
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,871
It's from a young woman to her mother...

585
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:06,477
or at least an older woman.

586
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,778
She mention any names?

587
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,545
There is an Anya here.

588
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:16,385
And from the way she writes,
I'm guessing it is a child.

589
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:21,090
It's almost ready, Father. Excuse me.

590
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:32,374
- So who's she writing to?
- There is no name.

591
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:35,074
The letter is for the whole family.

592
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,141
But...

593
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:44,547
she signs, "Nadya." Her name is Nadya.

594
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:47,153
- Nadya.
- Is she in trouble?

595
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,489
She's dead.

596
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,327
Anything in the letter to indicate
as to where these people live?

597
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,865
If you had an envelope, I could...

598
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:01,066
The only thing specific she mentions,
is a church...

599
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:05,004
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

600
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:09,442
- Father Vasyl, it says.
- There's no names or places or...

601
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,707
Across the water,
Father Vasyl is a common name...

602
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,708
and there are many St. Volodymyrs.

603
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,451
But leave the letter. I will try.

604
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,157
Thank you.

605
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:33,492
I'm saying, if there isn't enough work,
then you could do something else, that's all.

606
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:35,332
There's enough work.

607
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,311
Fact is, I came into
some back pay I was owed...

608
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:44,277
from about a month ago.

609
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,076
A couple thousand from
the vacation fund.

610
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:49,782
Stop, Ash.

611
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,354
I was thinking...

612
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,563
maybe this'll be the time
for us to get a place.

613
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,756
You could cover that?

614
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,334
And maybe we don't rent.

615
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:08,804
Maybe we try and buy something
in the neighborhood.

616
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:11,696
Nothing too big, just...

617
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,708
I heard Aunt Treesey's
old place up in Covington...

618
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,838
has been fixed up real nice.

619
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:23,716
Like with wood floors and all.

620
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:29,257
Ash, what's that ship right there?

621
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:33,153
- Cable ship.
- And what's the gray one next to it?

622
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,730
Military Sealift.

623
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,027
Attagirl.

624
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:40,770
You cold?

625
00:45:47,143 --> 00:45:48,906
- Dwight?
- What's up?

626
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:51,578
We're gonna have to
search your vehicle. Sorry.

627
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:52,909
Search? What the fuck?

628
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,780
Open it, or I'm gonna shim the lock,
maybe damage your ride.

629
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:57,944
You got no call to be doing me like this.

630
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:01,285
- No call and no damn warrant.
- You drive onto a D.O.C. facility...

631
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,484
you acknowledge the vehicle's
subject to search.

632
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:05,527
Where's the key, Dwight?

633
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,299
He's gonna be back
from lunch any minute, Zig.

634
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,308
You hear me? He sees you on that thing...

635
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,174
he's gonna break you down
and sell you for parts.

636
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,338
Here it be.

637
00:46:52,775 --> 00:46:54,902
You all planted that shit.

638
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:57,002
You fucking know you did.

639
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:15,559
- What's with the whistle squad?
- It's for us.

640
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:18,190
They marked us the moment
we stepped out of the car.

641
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:20,496
- That's him.
- That's Horseface?

642
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,067
- How did he get the name?
- You need a close-up?

643
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,006
Thomas Pakusa.

644
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:30,045
We need to talk to you about something.

645
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:31,238
What?

646
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:37,576
You were working the Atlantic Light
when it docked, right?

647
00:47:37,687 --> 00:47:38,847
If you say so.

648
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,014
You remember that container
that came off that day?

649
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,285
- With all the dead girls.
- No.

650
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,759
You don't remember
all them dead girls in a can?

651
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,295
Come on, Horse.

652
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,592
I remember when you found them all
in the stacks.

653
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:52,133
I don't remember
they came off the Atlantic Light.

654
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:54,965
Let's take a ride downtown,
clear this mess up.

655
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:56,095
No.

656
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,975
Get the fuck in the car.

657
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:02,510
- Am I locked up?
- Get in the damn car.

658
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:04,705
You want me in that car,
you need to lock me up.

659
00:48:04,814 --> 00:48:07,647
If that's the way it'll be,
I wanna talk to my shop steward...

660
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,241
and he can have an IBS lawyer go with me.

661
00:48:15,024 --> 00:48:16,286
Dad, what...

662
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,957
Jesus, Pop, what's that for?

663
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:20,927
Say cheese.

664
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,999
You pull another stunt like that, Zig,
I'll have your damn card.

665
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,297
I don't care who your mother is.
Get the fuck out of here!

666
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:35,767
Kind of smart for a fat man, isn't he?

667
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:37,209
All right.

668
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:55,790
Goddamn it, Ziggy, you sick fuck.

669
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:58,193
Get your dick out of my computer!

670
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,275
Where are the detectives
who were first assigned?

671
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,679
Dead. To me, anyway.

672
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:17,275
I shipped them humps back to Burrell
as fast as I could.

673
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:33,034
What kept you?

674
00:49:33,736 --> 00:49:35,897
That's the beautiful thing
about this department.

675
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:38,701
Every brain-dead
somehow manages to land on his feet.

676
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:40,708
- How's it hanging, Prez?
- How're you doing?

677
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,072
I'm all right.

678
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:44,510
Where's Lester? We got him, too, right?

679
00:49:44,847 --> 00:49:47,145
He was out on the street
today with Homicide...

680
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,616
but Rawls promised to give him
the bad news tomorrow.

681
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:50,879
Not McNulty though.

682
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,512
McNulty they really hate,
not that I blame them.

683
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,682
You, of course,
have Roland for the duration.

684
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,989
Anyone else from the southeastern
you need, you got.

685
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:03,856
I'll leave you to it, then.

686
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:09,862
Carver's in the southeast, now.
I think he's got Sector Two.

687
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:12,497
It'd be great to have Carver on this, right?

688
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:13,939
On what?

689
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:17,240
We don't even know what the hell
we're supposed to be chasing here.

690
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:19,940
No offense to your father-in-law,
but it's real thin.

691
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:23,678
We're here, right? Whatever happens,
we run with the program for a few weeks.

692
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:25,845
Maybe make a drug case or two
down by the port.

693
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:28,116
Beats the hell out of E.C.U. anyway.

694
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:36,198
Him and this lady have this daughter.
The daughter's born a mute.

695
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,767
The wife doesn't like that at all,
so she breaks out.

696
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:41,462
So this guy's raising his daughter,
she has her period...

697
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,267
freaks out, goes to him,
he thinks she was raped...

698
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:45,601
Jackpot.

699
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,707
That's about $10 worth
of bulk metal right there.

700
00:50:49,812 --> 00:50:52,838
We just have to haul it down
to the scrap yard and we're good.

701
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,917
We'll break our fucking backs on this thing.

702
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:58,475
Keep your eye to the ground, okay?
I'm schooling you.

703
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,782
Okay?

704
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:02,085
This is good, right here.

705
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:04,889
This is $10 right here.

706
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:09,421
Snitching Bubs.

707
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,735
You be asking for me?

708
00:52:06,055 --> 00:52:10,116
These headphones are great.
I'm gonna use them at the gym. Thanks.

709
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,857
- You hear the boys?
- No, it's quiet up there.

710
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,495
A little too quiet.

711
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:22,093
That means they're probably
playing video games.

712
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,036
Or with a book of matches.

713
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:29,578
So, did you have a lawyer
look at the papers yet?

714
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:31,405
I did.

715
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:36,481
- And?
- He says I shouldn't sign it.

716
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,922
Says I'm giving away too much.

717
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:42,487
I would never, under any circumstances...

718
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:45,322
pay that kind of support and alimony
if we went to court.

719
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:46,894
That's what he says?

720
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,304
Signed and notarized.

721
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:06,579
I don't wanna argue about the money.

722
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:08,974
I wanna get back together.

723
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:18,594
Yeah.

724
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:27,529
Yo, String, I was subtle with that.

725
00:53:28,437 --> 00:53:31,804
...has led to drug distribution charges
against three inmates...

726
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:33,966
one who was, himself, incapacitated...

727
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:36,943
by the tainted narcotics
and the correctional officer...

728
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:38,035
a 10-year veteran.

729
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:40,615
I've been instructed
by the Corrections Commissioner...

730
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:43,082
and the State Public Safety Secretary...

731
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:46,380
to announce that the maximum penalties...

732
00:53:46,522 --> 00:53:48,922
will be sought against this officer...

733
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,423
I got a midterm. I got to study.

734
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:20,277
- So this is their joint?
- What's the plan?

735
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:24,556
Time to make it clear to these people
that we're not gonna go away.

736
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:50,077
You ain't gonna play
that country shit, right?

737
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,345
I hate that country shit.

738
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:57,623
Not even Ray Charles
can save that mess for me.

739
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,258
No, sir.

740
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:16,939
Big Daddy Lipscomb was right tackle.
Your brain's gone to shit, Jessy.

741
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:18,908
Left tackle.

742
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:22,551
You was too busy pissing in your drawers
to learn left from right.

743
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:26,052
Take your ass down to Schula's Steakhouse
and get an education.

744
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:27,349
Darling.

745
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:33,019
What's the deal?

746
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,860
Just dropping in for one or two
and then we take ourselves out of here.

747
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,900
How about you?

748
00:55:39,268 --> 00:55:41,099
I'm leaving after this one.

749
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,545
You guys Port Police?
I don't recognize either one of you.

750
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:58,645
- City Homicide.
- Homicide?

751
00:55:58,754 --> 00:56:01,621
- Who got killed?
- Those dead girls in the can.

752
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:05,953
That was an accident.
That was a fucking accident.

753
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,355
That's what I heard, anyway.

754
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,470
Excuse me.
