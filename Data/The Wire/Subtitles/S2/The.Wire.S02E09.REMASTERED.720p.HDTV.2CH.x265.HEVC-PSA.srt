00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:26,247
WMD. Got that WMD here.

3
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,258
I'm looking for what you had the other day.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,523
- This shit right here?
- The other day you was calling it bin Laden.

5
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,293
But now it's WMD.
It will mass destruct your ass.

6
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,162
So this the hi-test?

7
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,131
Same shit, new name.

8
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:41,171
You be all right.

9
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,816
Okay, get dressed.

10
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:01,584
I pressed you some clothes
and laid them out upstairs.

11
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,786
And don't forget that book bag neither.

12
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:09,293
You got your chrome, young one?

13
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,029
I'll take mine.

14
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:21,513
Y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?

15
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:22,773
Let's go.

16
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:32,981
They coming up the alley!

17
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,952
They coming back!

18
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,697
Aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?

19
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:42,127
Slide up.

20
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,308
You get down on that floor and stay there,
you hear?

21
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,574
- You hear me, boy?
- Okay, Mama.

22
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:00,675
Come on!

23
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:02,008
Fuck!

24
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:06,615
Shit!

25
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:11,488
- Why you running?
- What the fuck?

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,667
Oh, shit!

27
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,134
Hit that nigger cold.

28
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,166
Bitches!

29
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,309
Why you hiding?

30
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,467
Drama done with, boy.

31
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,874
You gotta get your bags
and get yourself to school.

32
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,809
Get in, damn it!

33
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:17,317
T.T., you hear me?
Come on now. The drama's done.

34
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:20,361
Get your bags and get yourself to school.

35
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,935
I told you, you gotta get ready...

36
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:41,343
No!

37
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,692
They're changing up?

38
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:32,127
Looking for my La-Z-Boys.
Five of them you got for me, right?

39
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,661
- That shipment is tomorrow.
- Got it.

40
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,758
That's what the Newkirk warehouse
was giving us a few days back.

41
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:41,066
Straight, to-the-point drug talk.
No muss, no fuss.

42
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:42,837
Now listen.

43
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,703
Pyramid, lnc. May I help you?

44
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,440
- You got them Davinas or what?
- I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.

45
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,247
Between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...

46
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,511
we been sitting on that warehouse
every minute...

47
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,484
since we followed that truck off the docks.

48
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:59,614
No players coming in or going out.
No drug-related traffic at all.

49
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:03,217
To top it off,
Sobotka hasn't used his cell phone since.

50
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:07,991
- We tipped our hand somewhere.
- That second can, maybe.

51
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,592
The port police making a traffic stop
on their cargo must've spooked them.

52
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:14,433
If that's what did it,
we fucked ourselves over nothing.

53
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,167
They dumped that can as a misdelivery.

54
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,143
- What?
- They probably changed that up, too.

55
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:24,816
If they think we're onto them...

56
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,282
they switch the can themselves,
just to be safe.

57
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:29,819
And it goes off the docks
with some bullshit inside...

58
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:32,446
- just to see if we pull them up.
- Which we did.

59
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:34,215
Which I did.

60
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,755
No, they're not on us completely.

61
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,395
If they were, they'd be shutting
that warehouse down and rolling out.

62
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,869
Instead, they're just sitting inside that place,
turning away calls...

63
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,905
waiting us out.

64
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,998
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.

65
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,772
Don't waste film.

66
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:02,047
I been here so fucking long
that you're starting to look good to me.

67
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,182
Anything?

68
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:08,486
The drugs go in, they gotta come out, right?
I mean, what the fuck?

69
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,572
Little late.

70
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,644
When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...

71
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,009
a district commander would be there
within minutes.

72
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,309
I guess we're living in a brave new world.

73
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,611
I was in Washington with Burrell
when I heard.

74
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,413
D.C.? What for?

75
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,683
Burrell took some district commanders
down to DOJ with him...

76
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,657
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.

77
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,420
So what do we got?

78
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,490
Nine-year-old in his bedroom...

79
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:48,566
catches a seeing-eye stray
through the window.

80
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,998
- Dead?
- Pronounced at University.

81
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,331
- Witnesses?
- No one offering a name...

82
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:56,373
but the general theme
is two crews arguing over the real estate.

83
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:59,154
We got casings from at least
three different calibers on the ground.

84
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,769
We're gonna canvass hard,
but your people and Tactical...

85
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,542
should hit the area drug corners
and collect bodies.

86
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,344
Fucking pointless.

87
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:09,117
We jack up enough shitbirds,
this case can fall.

88
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:13,157
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.

89
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:17,594
Been chasing this shit
from one corner to the next like it's a plan.

90
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,394
Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.

91
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,996
You'll feel better when you do.

92
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:27,729
You told us about WorldCom
and the name change-up, right?

93
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,801
- You said that...
- I said change the name of our product.

94
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:33,434
I didn't say nothing
about taking people off a corner.

95
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:36,275
We done changed the name
of that weak shit so many times...

96
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,645
that don't nobody come down
to the Towers no more.

97
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,514
And them Carrollton boys had it going on.

98
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,918
Who shot the young one?

99
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,024
I don't know. I don't think it was us.

100
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,355
Them other niggers was going wild, though,
I mean...

101
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:53,261
You know, the cops are gonna have to
bang some heads on this one.

102
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,730
They got to.

103
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,799
That means we gotta shut everything down
until this shit pass.

104
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,803
That means the Towers, the low-rises.

105
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,874
Everything gotta take
a long fucking time-out!

106
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,665
I know, String.

107
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:08,602
I'm sorry, man.

108
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:18,051
Let me tell you something, man.

109
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:22,554
This here game,
it's more than the rep you carry...

110
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:23,855
the corner you hold.

111
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,021
You gotta be fierce, I know that.

112
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:30,730
But more than that,
you gotta show some flex.

113
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,929
Give and take on both sides.

114
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,967
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

115
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,737
All right, anything that fired a bullet
out on that corner...

116
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:43,575
has gotta disappear, you understand me?

117
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,479
I'm not talking about the storm drains.

118
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:49,451
Call that nigger Shamrock
and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.

119
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,121
All right.

120
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,532
Coming up.

121
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:37,228
I got people waiting on a package from me...

122
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:40,065
but Sergei says
that until we're sure about the police...

123
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:43,368
We're not going to be doing that business
for a few days.

124
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:48,838
Your uncle, he is right to be careful.

125
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,338
But, Niko...

126
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,351
if you are going to be doing this,
you should not be talking to us about it.

127
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:56,579
Why not?

128
00:10:57,055 --> 00:11:00,252
We are more, what you call, wholesalers.

129
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,424
I'm kind of small-time, huh?

130
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:10,490
You are not so big,
but you're among friends.

131
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:16,999
Call that number.

132
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,742
- Talk to him.
- Mike?

133
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,337
This White Mike?

134
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,780
- You know him?
- From Curtis Bay.

135
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,885
I went to Southern High School
with the guy.

136
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:33,981
You are with us now,
so he will be fair. No problem.

137
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,120
Now, for the rest of our business...

138
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:43,593
We will disappear these containers.
All of them clean.

139
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:45,969
Take them to Newkirk Street.

140
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,397
If there is a problem,
they will stop the trucks...

141
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:52,237
or we will see the police.

142
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,810
If not, no more worries.

143
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,279
All right.

144
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,418
We are off the warehouse phone now?

145
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:08,321
All day yesterday,
I was giving the new number to our people.

146
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,053
This is bullshit.

147
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,833
If they were onto the truck,
then they would've searched it, no?

148
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,570
Five-O!

149
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,980
Where you guys going?
Come on, you know the deal.

150
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,748
Get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!

151
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,923
Come on, keep moving.

152
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:46,229
Get him. Down.

153
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,194
This is bullshit, man.
You know I ain't did nothing, man.

154
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,472
Everybody gets the special
downtown at central booking:

155
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:02,307
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.

156
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:06,851
- Just shut the fuck up.
- Man, I'm clean, you hear me?

157
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:09,886
- What are you doing in the Pit then?
- Saying no to drugs.

158
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:13,890
Don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
Say, "No, thank you."

159
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:18,390
Put your fucking head down,
step up and get in.

160
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,131
Sit down right here, stupid.
Watch your head going in.

161
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:23,461
Slide over, asshole.

162
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:27,595
Shame a kid had to get killed
before we got around to doing this.

163
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,765
What exactly is it that we're doing?

164
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:36,211
Young boy killed over bullshit.

165
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:39,806
Now you got the police
crawling all the way up your ass.

166
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,954
It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger,
I gotta say.

167
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:49,660
Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that
if I take you up on your offer.

168
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:53,119
I'll be out there selling that real.

169
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,165
My boys ain't gonna be scuffling.

170
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:59,828
They ain't gonna be scuffling or standing
on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.

171
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,029
You're Westside.

172
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,208
You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?

173
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:06,610
No.

174
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,305
Goes all the way back
to Franklin and Fremont.

175
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:12,247
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.

176
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,410
- Sollers?
- Sold heroin like it was water.

177
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:18,317
I mean,
the motherfucker made himself some money.

178
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:21,324
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.

179
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:23,485
I know you don't.

180
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,791
And the police don't.

181
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:29,624
And the stick-up boys
wouldn't have a fucking clue either.

182
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,328
'Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.

183
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:37,704
No profile, no street rep.
Just buy for $1, sell for $2.

184
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:42,472
Sometimes, when your back up
against the wall, you go to the gun.

185
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,477
I know. I been there.

186
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:46,679
But you ain't gotta live by it.

187
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:51,178
Avon's a soldier.

188
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,954
That's who you want with you
when the shit fly.

189
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,220
But as far as business go...

190
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:05,759
- You still got that connect?
- Right off the boat, String.

191
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:08,468
All right.

192
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,168
I'm gonna buy from you
at the price you paying...

193
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:16,238
and I'll let you walk that shit
straight in the Towers.

194
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:21,011
You can have 734, 770 and 221.

195
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,585
I keep the other three.

196
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:27,451
How you gonna tell it to Avon?

197
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,694
It makes sense, don't it?

198
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:35,022
He gonna hear something
when it makes sense.

199
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,094
Right?

200
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:49,607
No shit.

201
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:01,922
- I thought you was in with Nicky.
- Fuck Nick.

202
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,287
He said you was his other half.

203
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:07,159
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.

204
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:08,857
And fucking drugs are bad, right?

205
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,935
I mean, you gotta consider
what that shit does to the community.

206
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:14,732
You spent all last year with White Mike.
You remember that?

207
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,170
A man can grow.

208
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:21,409
Besides, I got a caper in mind
that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.

209
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:22,979
I'm telling you.

210
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:24,946
You want in?

211
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:30,745
- What do I gotta do?
- What a longshoreman does best, Johnny.

212
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:35,119
Zig, your duck won't touch
the Pikesville rye?

213
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,462
He drinks mid-shelf.
He don't like that rail shit.

214
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:45,960
Fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg
for a shot and a beer.

215
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,205
New Charles in the house.

216
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,207
- Moving pretty good.
- Waiting on a prosthetic.

217
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,436
You got a decent lawyer?

218
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:56,308
Nat Coxson hooked me up
through the union.

219
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:58,777
What's with the duck?

220
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,811
- You know you gotta let go of your name.
- Say what?

221
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:08,323
Yeah, New Charles don't work no more
for a one-legged fuck.

222
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:10,189
Yeah, maybe "Stump."

223
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,325
You know what? "Peg."

224
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:14,630
"New Peggy."

225
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,335
- How about "Tilt"?
- Tilt?

226
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,364
Tilt. Just like a pinball machine.

227
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,836
Tilt. I like that.

228
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,447
Yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.

229
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:37,521
Told you I might be in town tonight,
remember?

230
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:41,956
- So, this is your first time?
- Yep, first time for me.

231
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,988
What do you do, Jimmy?
Are you the police?

232
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,792
- Do you work with the police?
- No. Christ, no.

233
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:52,430
No, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know...

234
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:55,898
- Where do you live?
- I'm not gonna tell you that.

235
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,103
I live out of town.

236
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,538
I'm sorry.
I don't think we can help you tonight.

237
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:03,773
Thank you.

238
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,851
You sucked. I mean, really.

239
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,047
Fuck if I thought
I was gonna be interrogated.

240
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:16,752
I mean, Christ,
I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?

241
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:30,863
Hey, fucknuts.

242
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,600
What the fuck is wrong with you?

243
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,372
Christ, Ziggy.

244
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:52,118
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?

245
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,644
What's up with my cousin?

246
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:13,512
Don't even talk to me about that asshole.

247
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,621
- Drank himself to death.
- Oh, shit.

248
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,058
What kind of fool
would give a duck whiskey anyhow?

249
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:26,993
That boy ain't right.

250
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:30,829
And his fucking bird
couldn't hold liquor for shit.

251
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,199
La-Z-Boys?

252
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,211
And Davinas. Male and female.

253
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:44,005
Dope and coke.

254
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:47,141
- What the hell is a Davina?
- It's like a love seat, kind of.

255
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,947
- Any line on weight?
- All whole numbers.

256
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:53,317
- No halves, quarters, eight-balls?
- Ounces?

257
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:56,560
What kind of numbers
they putting on the furniture?

258
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,595
Nothing much above five.

259
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,994
Proposition Joe has Ashland
all the way up to North.

260
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,865
Ten corners, easy.
Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.

261
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:09,568
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

262
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,834
- What was coming and going last night?
- Not much.

263
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:15,310
No trucks in, some cars in and out...

264
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,177
but none of the drug players
we saw rolling up there before.

265
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:22,480
Whatever was in that last truckload
probably went out in car trunks.

266
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,853
They're doing their distribution
somewhere else for now.

267
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:28,221
Which is why job one
is to get back to a good phone.

268
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,590
The same PC
that got you on that warehouse phone...

269
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,720
will get you anywhere else you want to go.

270
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,092
All we need is the new number.

271
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,189
Verizon running
any new lines in there lately?

272
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,598
We talked to the phone security people.
They say no.

273
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,000
Probably going to a cell phone.

274
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:43,198
Best bet is to get the new number
off the Russian's cell phone.

275
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,604
Okay, then.

276
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:47,977
Freamon and Prez,
stay on one shift in the wiretap room.

277
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,104
Bunk and Russell, man the other.

278
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:52,546
Herc and Carver,
you guys are on Newkirk Street...

279
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,175
waiting to see
if the warehouse traffic picks back up.

280
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,982
McNulty and Greggs
have a line into the prostitution ring.

281
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,023
But so far, the people handling the girls...

282
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,183
have been a little cautious
about fresh johns.

283
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,625
So we're gonna need a new angle there.

284
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:06,026
Questions?

285
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:14,694
What was your play with those girls?

286
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,966
Out-of-town salesman.

287
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:19,133
- How far out of town?
- What do you mean?

288
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:21,268
The farther out of town,
the more they believe.

289
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,937
Less like a cop you sound.

290
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:24,207
You do any accents?

291
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:26,476
English, British, Scottish,
something like that?

292
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:27,744
Crikey!

293
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:31,551
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...

294
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:36,150
and this one bloke gave me this number
to call when I got across the pond.

295
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:38,723
Work on it, son.

296
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,924
$200,000?

297
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,925
That isn't a quarter of what they owe.

298
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:48,096
They say they will pay another $200,000
once their shipment clears the docks.

299
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:50,400
- And then?
- That is all.

300
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:57,910
These Colombians
are without honor, Spiros.

301
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,606
They are cheats.

302
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,943
- The chemicals we sent are good, no?
- No complaint.

303
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:05,181
They say they want more, even.

304
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,123
And they understand that we can guarantee
their product gonna clear Customs?

305
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:10,694
Right.

306
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:15,531
- And still, they try to chisel.
- Why?

307
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,265
What are they thinking?

308
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,197
That it is all profit for us.

309
00:22:21,872 --> 00:22:24,397
That we will settle
for half of what we agreed...

310
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:27,272
because $400,000 is still a lot of money.

311
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:30,346
The Greek will be angry.

312
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:33,647
This is business, Eton.

313
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,953
The Greek? He will be smart.

314
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:46,991
Jesus.

315
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,929
You accidentally shoot one 9-year-old
in his bedroom...

316
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,093
and the whole city gets its undies
in a bunch.

317
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:53,966
To err is human, that's what I like to say.

318
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,369
The mayor went to the scene
for the cameras last night.

319
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:57,771
Said the crime will not stand.

320
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:00,638
Tell the mayor we're still working
without an eyeball witness.

321
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,007
How about the street talk?

322
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:05,082
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old
with the streetname Bodie.

323
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:07,309
Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.

324
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:10,353
And why is young Preston
not being hurled with great abandon...

325
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,354
around one of our interrogation rooms?

326
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:15,220
We got cars on his grandma's as we speak.

327
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,120
What the fuck you think
you're dealing with here? Amateurs?

328
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:27,133
Fuck Nick. This is my thing.

329
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:29,271
You want in, you gotta deal with me.

330
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:32,501
All right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.

331
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,168
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.

332
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:36,576
I got them brand new,
with the keys in the ignition.

333
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,704
Nothing stripped.

334
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:40,113
- Off the docks?
- No shit, off the docks.

335
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:43,015
What the fuck do I look like,
a fucking car dealer?

336
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,314
Twenty on the dollar.

337
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:48,790
But if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna
need you to order a minimum of three.

338
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,360
Or else it ain't worth it for me.

339
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:53,487
Now, base price on an S430
starts at $73,000.

340
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:56,862
You round it,
I get $15,000 for each car that you want.

341
00:23:57,301 --> 00:24:00,998
A stolen car is a stolen car.

342
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:03,729
Without title,
who is going to pay even $10,000 for it?

343
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:06,935
Sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
But where you're from...

344
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:09,706
I'll bet you got family
that don't give two fucks...

345
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:12,544
whether or not an American car
got a title on it.

346
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,244
Man, it would be a sad state of affairs...

347
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:17,650
if an international entrepreneur
such as yourself...

348
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:21,020
didn't know what to do
with a couple of extra Mercedes.

349
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:27,428
Big night for Jimmy McNulty.

350
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:30,466
Or should I say
James Cromwell of Knightsbridge...

351
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:33,662
Stepney and Mersey.

352
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:34,971
Excuse me?

353
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:38,165
Cromwell was the English fuck
who stole my ancestors' land...

354
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:41,244
and the other ones
are all from rock 'n' roll songs.

355
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:43,074
Anyways, 10:00 tomorrow night...

356
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,081
the shuttle comes for me
on the parking lot off Russell Street.

357
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,480
Good work.

358
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:50,379
We'll get Greggs to wire you up
and set the surveillance.

359
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,853
Shame we're not up
on a good phone right now.

360
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:55,653
Be nice to tickle the wire
when we raid the brothel.

361
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,819
A little luck,
maybe we get back up before then.

362
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,390
One other thing.

363
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,162
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant
this deep in dirt...

364
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,000
doesn't have anything
in a law enforcement computer.

365
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,097
You still got that friend over in Woodlawn?

366
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,540
I'd like to know what the FBI has
in its database.

367
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,509
After that meeting on the Barksdale case...

368
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,138
I made a point of pissing him off,
remember?

369
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:21,213
So what? You do that to everybody.

370
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:25,213
This is George Glekas.

371
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:29,691
He's the cat who owns the appliance store
where that second can landed.

372
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:33,988
Run his ass, too.

373
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:38,694
Why not just cut another guy in
and run them out the bobtail lane?

374
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:41,737
These babies start disappearing
and everybody on the terminal...

375
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,898
is gonna suspect an inside job.

376
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,976
We're gonna need bolt cutters
for the fence...

377
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,067
and then we're gonna need
enough wood beams...

378
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:51,045
to make a track across the grass
onto the road.

379
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,137
Why bother?

380
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:55,275
We can run them cars
over that little patch of grass, no problem.

381
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,115
That ain't the plan.

382
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,221
I just saw a can disappear.

383
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:07,729
- Talco line?
- Pakusa working it?

384
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:11,732
- It's him. Do we try to follow?
- We know where it's going, right?

385
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:14,497
12-08, you copy?

386
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,697
12-08, what's up?

387
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,075
We got a can that might be coming to you
off the port.

388
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:24,409
Can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...

389
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:28,651
4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two.

390
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:32,617
- What do you want us to do with it?
- See if it arrives.

391
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:35,347
And if it does?

392
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,491
See what happens then.

393
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,695
You wanna know something, Carv?

394
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,435
I'm starting to think
that as criminal investigators...

395
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:47,595
we're not really respected.

396
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,137
That ain't necessary, Jimmy.

397
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,675
I knew we were fucking the dog
on that Barksdale thing.

398
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,244
Who do I tell?

399
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:59,379
We got this new ASAC,
thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.

400
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,383
And believe me, this ain't like your agency.

401
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,180
You piss them off, you ride the boat.

402
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,254
Here...

403
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:07,789
you come into work one morning,
you find yourself assigned...

404
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:10,655
to some fucking dustbowl
lndian res in Arkansas.

405
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,820
- Still, I was out of line, Fitz.
- Fuck it.

406
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,023
What you got there, brother?

407
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:21,301
White boys. A different look for you.

408
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:25,205
Funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
What's the chance of that?

409
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,640
Anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.

410
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:30,771
Customs had a little intel
on this guy, Glekas.

411
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,290
You said Customs had intel on him?

412
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:44,691
Should show here.
Let me try something else with it.

413
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:51,701
This'll give us any contact your boy
might have had with us, agency-wide.

414
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:53,099
Got something out of San Diego.

415
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:55,034
- On Glekas?
- We'll see.

416
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,646
I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...

417
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:05,772
I need three forms
and a lieutenant's approval.

418
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:08,113
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.

419
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:11,483
Believe me,
we ain't short on paperwork here either.

420
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:13,322
Agent Koutris?

421
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:15,189
Not much to it.

422
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:19,485
We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case
I worked in '95, '96.

423
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:23,892
He was just crumbs, so no charges.
But I did an interview.

424
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:27,264
The guy struck me
as just a mope playing it slick.

425
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:31,039
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.

426
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:33,303
All right.

427
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:35,970
If you need it, let me know.

428
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:03,470
We need to talk.

429
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:13,908
Anyone following?

430
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:29,655
Run up and down the street.
Take tag numbers from cars.

431
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,126
- All week I've done it. Nothing.
- Again.

432
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,194
The truck is here.

433
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,130
Lester, it's here.

434
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,403
They offload anything?

435
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,833
Not yet.

436
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:46,601
Okay, wait on it.

437
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:52,611
See, the thing about it, Preston,
is that you're unbelievably stupid.

438
00:29:53,784 --> 00:29:54,978
You are.

439
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:58,249
I don't say it to upset you.
Just to state a fact.

440
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,288
He doesn't think so.

441
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:03,918
Nobody ever thinks they're stupid.
It's part of the stupidity.

442
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:06,496
You don't need to tell us
what happened on that corner.

443
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,928
We know what happened.

444
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:11,832
We got you, we got your guns,
we got the whole fucking story.

445
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:20,333
Where that lawyer at, man?

446
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,649
See, you just fucked up.

447
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:32,689
Way you looked at the bag,
you know what's in there, don't you?

448
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,385
That's you, right there, fucking up.

449
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,097
- I don't know what you talking about.
- No, you fucked up.

450
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:52,005
We even got your prints on one of the guns.
We even got that.

451
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:54,408
Which one?

452
00:31:02,186 --> 00:31:04,051
That's you right there.

453
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,352
Lawyer.

454
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,486
They were asking about me?

455
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,664
San Diego.

456
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:20,396
San Diego was a long time ago.

457
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,003
Our friend in Washington
does not know why.

458
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:25,200
Only that the people asked.

459
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:29,541
You told me the police
looking into the women were local.

460
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:30,978
They were.

461
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:32,476
No FBI.

462
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,248
We've been running only clean containers?

463
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:40,051
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.

464
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:42,155
No one stops anything.

465
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:44,056
And we changed the warehouse phone?

466
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,189
A day or two more,
and we are back to business.

467
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:54,700
We watch, we are careful.
But we are back to business.

468
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:59,199
You will have to do a favor
for our friend, no?

469
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,777
Fair is fair.

470
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:03,041
The Colombians, I think.

471
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:06,541
They take our chemicals
and pay less than promised.

472
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,983
Down there,
I understand everyone is a terrorist now.

473
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:14,684
Judges are killed.
Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.

474
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:20,620
The Colombians who cheated us,
they're not with the guerrillas.

475
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,198
They're trash.

476
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:27,002
The world is a smaller place now.

477
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:32,604
And the FBI cares very much
about such things.

478
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:35,744
Fair is fair.

479
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:42,849
Sergei's making a call.

480
00:32:46,824 --> 00:32:49,816
If there is no problem,
then bring in the La-Z-Boys.

481
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,758
I will meet you there.

482
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:53,360
Recognize that voice?

483
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:55,523
That's the man
from the warehouse phone, right?

484
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,466
- That's the same guy?
- Same guy, new number.

485
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:02,935
- Who you calling?
- Pearlman, at home.

486
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:06,072
Another affidavit,
and we're back on the main stem.

487
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,123
Shit is raw, String.

488
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:28,027
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.

489
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,694
All right.

490
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:33,836
So, when them police stop
busting heads up in them Towers...

491
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:36,498
you all let Prop Joe's people
take hold of three of them.

492
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:37,767
All right.

493
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:45,512
Okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate,
and you're there.

494
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:47,114
Start connecting the dots...

495
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:50,449
and you have to start asking yourself
what these guys aren't into.

496
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:53,387
Drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.

497
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:55,088
FBI didn't have much.

498
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,285
A little something out of San Diego
on Glekas...

499
00:33:57,394 --> 00:34:00,488
- in a stolen goods case that was closed out.
- San Diego?

500
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:02,865
These guys move around.

501
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:06,167
- What's with the suit?
- Date night.

502
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:09,731
The undercover at the brothel.

503
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,603
Run like hell, ma'am.

504
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:15,270
We wanna be up on that phone,
so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.

505
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:17,006
Who's the affiant?

506
00:34:25,923 --> 00:34:30,053
Can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
That would be best.

507
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:32,160
Whatever you need, chief.

508
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:34,390
I don't give a damn
about the color of this one.

509
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:35,795
Whatever you have.

510
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,097
Ain't a problem.
They all just gotta have sunroofs.

511
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,364
It's a long story.

512
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:46,340
Next Tuesday would be good for us.
A ship comes Wednesday early, so...

513
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:48,339
Listen...

514
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:51,171
you think I can get an advance on this?

515
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:54,683
I got some expenses right now,
and I'm a little tapped.

516
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,247
- I'm just asking.
- Payment on delivery.

517
00:34:58,589 --> 00:34:59,988
Don't worry about it, chief.

518
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,719
I would never even dream of cheating
a smart businessman like yourself.

519
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:08,430
It ain't enough that I gotta be the one
thinking this whole shit through.

520
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:11,501
That I gotta be the one
looking out for this shit and that shit.

521
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:14,469
Checking up on this,
making sure this shit is done.

522
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,403
No, that's not enough.

523
00:35:16,507 --> 00:35:19,806
That's why they be paying
them fucking CEOs so much damn money.

524
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,641
Because when the shit fall bad,
it all fall bad on them.

525
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:27,774
Everybody else can be ducking and hiding,
doing what they fucking wanna do.

526
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:30,080
But when push come to shove...

527
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,486
I'm the one
who's got to take that responsibility...

528
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,583
and y'all are leaving me
very little to work with right now.

529
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:40,494
- Hold up, String...
- No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.

530
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:42,929
You drive the guns to the water.

531
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:47,470
You look around, you ain't see anybody,
you throw the guns.

532
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:49,638
In the water.

533
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,105
Splash.

534
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,313
Now, get the fuck out of here, man.

535
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,813
Except you, young one.

536
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:11,988
You ain't say shit back there?

537
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:15,862
No, they fucked up when they told me
my prints was on one of them guns, right?

538
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,059
And I wiped them shits down myself.

539
00:36:18,168 --> 00:36:20,693
And the one they said was mine
wasn't even.

540
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:25,971
If they would've had anything past my name,
they would've kept me, right?

541
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,917
- All right.
- All right, String.

542
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:37,543
Lock that door.

543
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:47,420
You got a bolt cutter?
'Cause I'm gonna need a good one.

544
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:49,625
Got two in the window there.

545
00:36:51,468 --> 00:36:53,402
You hung this on a duck?

546
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,736
Of course.

547
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,536
$1,200.

548
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,645
Fair enough.

549
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:14,556
- Nick.
- It's been a while, Mikey.

550
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,285
Yeah, it has.

551
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:19,191
But your name
has been ringing out in my mind lately.

552
00:37:19,296 --> 00:37:20,388
Yeah?

553
00:37:20,664 --> 00:37:21,688
My man called.

554
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,630
Said you was gonna take a re-up from me.

555
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:25,964
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.

556
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,968
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.

557
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,032
Who fucking knew?

558
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:34,903
- So how much you looking for?
- Two or three G-packs a week.

559
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:37,507
I was getting that shit
from the Greek's people.

560
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:39,104
- Four each.
- Four?

561
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:41,474
I wholesale for five, man.

562
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:44,152
I don't know.

563
00:37:44,254 --> 00:37:47,314
They told me
you were gonna be straight with it.

564
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:53,220
Sergei. What up, dawg?

565
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,697
I got a friend of yours here
says we're giving Gs at four.

566
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,767
Yeah?

567
00:37:58,135 --> 00:38:00,535
All right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.

568
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:02,695
Another thing.

569
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:04,665
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

570
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:08,074
dropped that body over on Potee Street
the other night, you know?

571
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:11,243
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with some Greek-ass name...

572
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:14,112
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

573
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:17,517
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

574
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:20,585
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

575
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,392
Idiot.

576
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:26,054
You got friends in high places, Nicky.

577
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:28,988
- Four a pack for you.
- All right, cool.

578
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:36,903
Thank God for the Russian's cell phone.

579
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:41,103
They might be laying off the warehouse line,
but at least he ain't changing that up.

580
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:44,703
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

581
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:47,713
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

582
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:04,527
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a man's purse.

583
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:08,304
European men like yourself
sometimes carry one.

584
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:12,141
Them people ain't right over there.

585
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,604
The mike has to go somewhere.

586
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:18,977
Besides, you might have hands all over you
before we get what we need.

587
00:39:19,082 --> 00:39:20,640
Indeed I might, luv.

588
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:23,584
It'll be your call
when we come through the doors.

589
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:27,248
You want us in, you say... What was it?

590
00:39:27,624 --> 00:39:30,855
"Spot on." It means "exactly."

591
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:34,755
And remember, they have to bring up
the money and the sex first...

592
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:38,357
then an overt attempt to engage.

593
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:41,899
Spot on.

594
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:44,937
Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.

595
00:39:46,243 --> 00:39:49,576
Listen, what do you guys have
in VICAP for male victims...

596
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,207
headless or faceless,
and missing both hands?

597
00:39:53,717 --> 00:39:55,344
Middle Atlantic region probably.

598
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:30,815
$4.5 million in the capital budget
that's set to pass House and Senate both.

599
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:34,081
Money'll be allocated
for the fiscal period next year.

600
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:36,056
Congratulations, Frank.

601
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:43,125
What kind of stevedore drinks champagne?

602
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:03,378
So, Nat, about the election.

603
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:08,257
I just need one more year
to bring the dredging home.

604
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:10,053
That's what I need.

605
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,055
Ott's turn, Frank.

606
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,660
This is Agent Koutris
of the FBI down in Washington.

607
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,933
He's with the counterterrorism people
down there.

608
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:25,898
- Terrorism?
- He needs our help tonight.

609
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:46,993
11-34, what's your 20?

610
00:41:47,898 --> 00:41:50,264
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.

611
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:52,331
Copy that.

612
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,868
Okay, we're on here.

613
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,702
Good evening.

614
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,522
Paint pigments.

615
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:26,034
They ship them in
for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.

616
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,304
It's in there somewhere.

617
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:29,999
Run it.

618
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:02,265
Same consistencies on all the barrels.

619
00:43:02,906 --> 00:43:05,642
- Nothing else in there, really.
- Nothing but the pigments.

620
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:11,742
- What's going on?
- I don't know nothing, Horse.

621
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:15,043
Swear to God.

622
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:18,451
Tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy
from Locust Point.

623
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:36,195
You know,
I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.

624
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:39,867
I love the man like my brother,
but when it comes to something like this...

625
00:43:39,976 --> 00:43:42,809
he gonna listen to you
more than he listen to me.

626
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:44,380
You think so?

627
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:49,513
All I put in his ear about my son
didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?

628
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:53,921
All them times I told him
that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...

629
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:55,651
and what happened?

630
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:58,485
He feel for that.

631
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:01,121
He feel for you.

632
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:04,497
I know he didn't see it coming.

633
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:07,402
- None of us seen it coming.
- I did.

634
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,364
I swear, I saw it.

635
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:15,410
He ain't listen to me then.
Why the hell you think he gonna listen now?

636
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,474
'Cause we got a weak product...

637
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:21,540
and we holding on to prime real estate
with no muscle.

638
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:25,052
I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.

639
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:32,124
Now look, I know that your heart is heavy.

640
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:35,457
I know.

641
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:39,399
But them wolves is at that door.

642
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:51,212
As long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.

643
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:56,752
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
everything we fought for go to shit.

644
00:44:57,354 --> 00:44:59,083
So I'll talk to him.

645
00:45:24,881 --> 00:45:26,314
Mr. Cromwell.

646
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:30,415
Decisions, decisions.

647
00:45:33,123 --> 00:45:35,648
Would it be wrong to take two?

648
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:38,721
Attaboy.

649
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,729
We should get upstairs.

650
00:45:46,102 --> 00:45:48,935
Nothing but paint pigments.

651
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,405
Trust me, old friend. It's there.

652
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:10,423
Son of a bitch!

653
00:46:24,507 --> 00:46:25,838
Okay, then.

654
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:29,371
Right.

655
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:33,111
Maybe, we could talk about this first?

656
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:43,686
Any time you guys want.

657
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,792
The money changed hands, right?

658
00:46:45,896 --> 00:46:47,488
Sounded that way.

659
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:50,698
- And they talked about sex?
- Definitely.

660
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,563
Any time you guys want.

661
00:46:52,669 --> 00:46:53,863
Hang on.

662
00:46:55,705 --> 00:46:56,729
Oh, God.

663
00:46:58,508 --> 00:46:59,998
Is it soup yet?

664
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,070
Spot something. Spot on it.

665
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:04,213
Let's go.

666
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:13,586
- Whoa.
- Why?

667
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,851
We're supposed to take the door
and get in quick.

668
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,051
Calm the fuck down.

669
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,493
It ain't like they gonna flush
a half dozen whores down the toilet.

670
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:26,596
- Who is it?
- Baltimore police.

671
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:30,100
- What do you want?
- To lock your ass up.

672
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:38,441
Hands. Let me see them.

673
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:53,990
- Two more in the back.
- Come on, ladies.

674
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:11,912
You're late.

675
00:48:15,752 --> 00:48:16,980
He okay?

676
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:19,586
He'll live.

677
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:26,956
...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms
ofprocessed crack cocaine...

678
00:48:27,063 --> 00:48:30,396
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.

679
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,196
Federal officials have confirmed
to Channel 6 News...

680
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:35,032
that their investigation is ongoing...

681
00:48:35,138 --> 00:48:37,163
and that while no arrests
have yet been made...

682
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:40,765
the seizure itself has severely disrupted
the operations of a group...

683
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,846
believed to have ties
to Colombian narco-terrorist...

684
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:47,280
Now, that, gentlemen, is a case.

685
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:54,120
God forbid you two should put something
like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...

686
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,318
I would die happy.

687
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,761
Our case is progressing.

688
00:49:00,864 --> 00:49:03,628
- Great, what can you charge?
- We're not at that point.

689
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:07,601
We've got wires into a smuggling operation
that we've linked to drugs and women.

690
00:49:07,704 --> 00:49:10,434
Likely, they're the people
who were bringing in the girls...

691
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,633
who turned up dead in that can
two months ago.

692
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:16,701
Now, we're on one location that we believe
is a transshipment point for narcotics.

693
00:49:16,813 --> 00:49:19,043
And last night, if you check the 24s...

694
00:49:19,149 --> 00:49:21,640
you'll see that we hit a brothel
we also think ties in.

695
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,651
A month or two more
on the taps and DNRs...

696
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:26,244
and we will be able to identify
the top-end players.

697
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:30,190
- You hit a brothel?
- Waterfront condo, high-end.

698
00:49:30,794 --> 00:49:31,920
Jesus.

699
00:49:32,562 --> 00:49:36,896
If you find anything that looks
like a list of steady customers, flush it.

700
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,527
I mean, half the names
in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.

701
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:43,905
Any problems on the raid?

702
00:49:44,174 --> 00:49:47,666
A complication or two.
Nothing we can't write around.

703
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:49,540
Immigration is holding the girls.

704
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:53,173
And the madam, who has legal residency,
we cut loose after she posted bail.

705
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:55,376
You try to interview them?
See if any will roll?

706
00:49:55,485 --> 00:49:56,679
Not while the taps are up.

707
00:49:56,786 --> 00:50:00,813
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

708
00:50:00,924 --> 00:50:04,621
Cut to the chase.
You any closer on my murders?

709
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:07,252
If these are the people
who were importing those girls...

710
00:50:07,363 --> 00:50:08,853
then, yeah, we're closer.

711
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:12,457
The more we learn, the more chance
we have to clear those cases.

712
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,626
What about Frank Sobotka?

713
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:17,404
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.

714
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:19,475
The union may be involved
in the smuggling...

715
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:22,511
but we're not getting a sense
that it goes past that.

716
00:50:22,612 --> 00:50:25,945
This is about Frank Sobotka.

717
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:28,214
The case is bigger now.

718
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:33,346
Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it.

719
00:50:34,124 --> 00:50:38,857
Now, I'm asking,
do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?

720
00:50:38,962 --> 00:50:41,487
Charging Sobotka at this point
would lose us the wire...

721
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:43,122
and a chance at the real targets.

722
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:46,600
- He is the real target.
- Patience, Stan.

723
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,965
- I'm sure if they bring the case...
- You owe me on this, Erv.

724
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:54,569
You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail.

725
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:58,043
You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.

726
00:51:00,383 --> 00:51:01,441
Okay.

727
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,646
Now the votes are in...

728
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:08,747
and you're moving your damn golf trophies
upstairs to the commissioner's office...

729
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:10,951
now you're freezing me out, huh?

730
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:14,292
Fucking rat fuckers, all of you.

731
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:17,724
This is my case.

732
00:51:18,268 --> 00:51:19,326
Mine!

733
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:23,063
And now you're gonna tell me
who the target is?

734
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:26,567
Not fucking likely.

735
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:36,708
He's saying no.

736
00:51:38,188 --> 00:51:40,748
He's saying we fought for
every one of them Towers...

737
00:51:40,857 --> 00:51:43,382
and to give them up now
would mark us as weak.

738
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:46,485
He's saying if we do this,
Prop Joe would have it over us...

739
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:48,962
and we might never get out from under.

740
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:52,626
- We don't have the product or the muscle.
- I told him.

741
00:51:53,536 --> 00:51:54,662
I did.

742
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,870
He say he still trying to find us
a better connect.

743
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:01,670
And for muscle...

744
00:52:01,778 --> 00:52:04,679
he's saying he sending us
the best he can find.

745
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:08,407
Brother Mouzone.

746
00:52:12,622 --> 00:52:14,453
He sending in Brother?

747
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:16,881
From New York.

748
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:21,428
Coming down to work on retainer,
for as long as we need.

749
00:52:21,898 --> 00:52:24,264
- Brother Mouzone?
- Yep.

750
00:52:30,173 --> 00:52:33,199
"At which point
the officer was unable to resist...

751
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:36,904
"the ministrations
of the aforementioned suspect...

752
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:41,211
"and found himself
brought to the point of a sexual act."

753
00:52:43,253 --> 00:52:45,881
You're famous behind this, you know that?

754
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:49,152
As a pervert,
this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.

755
00:52:49,259 --> 00:52:51,693
I can't perjure myself.
I gotta explain it somehow.

756
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:56,128
Motherfucker, you have violated
a half dozen departmental regs right there.

757
00:52:56,232 --> 00:53:00,168
Not to mention that no state's attorney
is gonna even bring this thing into court.

758
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,704
We're not going to court.
The girls are being deported.

759
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,968
We did the raid
just to tickle the wire, remember?

760
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:12,744
There were two of them. I was outnumbered.

761
00:53:25,061 --> 00:53:27,120
You fucking with me, right?

762
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:30,289
Brother Mouzone, from NYC?

763
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,564
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have
enough muscle to hold down them Towers.

764
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:36,832
- Played it like that.
- Yeah, and he reached out.

765
00:53:36,939 --> 00:53:38,839
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.

766
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:41,910
Know what I'm saying?
This is just some shit we gotta deal with.

767
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,706
Deal with how?

768
00:53:43,813 --> 00:53:46,441
My nigger, I would take
the motherfucker out if I could...

769
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:48,983
but Avon can't know
it came from his own people, right?

770
00:53:49,085 --> 00:53:53,021
You don't think I'm gonna send
any of my people up against Brother?

771
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,350
Shit.

772
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:57,685
That nigger got more bodies on him
than a Chinese cemetery.

773
00:53:57,794 --> 00:53:58,783
True.

774
00:53:58,895 --> 00:54:03,389
Look, I'm just saying,
this your problem, not mine.

775
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,260
You want my product,
you need to deal with it.

776
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,929
All right, so listen, we got some time here.

777
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:13,202
Avon gotta send up word
and wait for word to come back...

778
00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:16,710
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone,
I mean, set up the whole shit.

779
00:54:16,813 --> 00:54:18,508
And that's like a week or maybe two.

780
00:54:18,614 --> 00:54:21,208
And by that time,
your people's gonna be in the Towers...

781
00:54:21,317 --> 00:54:24,377
and if the money's right,
then that is what it is.

782
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:28,253
Ain't no nigger from New York
gonna change the facts from the ground.

783
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:29,425
All right?

784
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:39,826
12-08 to 11-37, you there?

785
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,299
11-37, what you got?

786
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:44,669
That last truck is on the move.

787
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,535
It sits there for two days
and they don't offload a thing.

788
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:49,803
- 10-4.
- They're testing us.

789
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,005
They been moving clean cans.

790
00:55:05,027 --> 00:55:07,621
- The trash hasn't drawn any flies.
- No?

791
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:11,826
- Wejust took out the last of it. No problems.
- Okay, then we go.

792
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:15,734
- What about llona?
- She is home. They kept the children.

793
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,369
There are always more children.

794
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:24,212
Why don't we tap that cell phone,
even if we don't know who we're tapping?

795
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:27,709
That call might just be our PC.

796
00:55:29,152 --> 00:55:32,212
And this here is the little king of everything.

797
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:47,562
So how many we got in the sector?

798
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:51,629
Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU...

799
00:55:51,941 --> 00:55:54,273
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.

800
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:56,174
We're on every corner.

801
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:59,047
Pretty damn quiet today.

802
00:56:00,716 --> 00:56:01,842
Today.

803
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:06,749
Let's go.

804
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:51,593
Officer.
