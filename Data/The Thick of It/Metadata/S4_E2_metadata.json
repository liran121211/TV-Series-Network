As Remembrance Sunday approaches Nicola feels the party should be realistic and agree with two unpopular policies of the government that they previously opposed. Tucker is appalled - as are the rest of the party - and things get worse when the press photograph Helen on the street with the notes from the policy meeting. Tucker is supportive - to her face but is secretly grooming Dan Miller, as he feels Nicola will commit political suicide soon anyway.
