First witness is Pearson, whose obscure jargonese strikes the panel as being at odds with his role as an information giver, whilst Tucker is reprimanded for trying to score political points. It soon becomes apparent that opposing sides are using the inquiry to discredit each other whilst those who sent the emails do a good job of discrediting themselves. Mannion struggles, as does Nicola (even though she called for the inquiry) and the most honest witness is aide Robyn, who inadvertently blows the whistle on everybody else's back-biting. Glenn blames Ollie and Tucker, who is recalled and sees that he is cornered, gives a very impassioned speech in which he accuses the accusers.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2128320", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 518, "number_of_episodes": 24}
