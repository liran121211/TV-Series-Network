A further crisis looms over the number of police staff being cut by the Home office, leading to a backlog of paper work and queues outside police stations. Whilst Mannion and his advisers panic, Ollie sends Dan on a fact finding mission to Lewisham police station though it is not very productive. After delivering a rant to Ollie about his inadequacy as a replacement, Tucker tries to create a smoke screen by getting himself arrested, though this also falls flat. Glenn also quits, tearing strips off his colleagues and resolving to turn himself in for perjury - though he changes his mind on the police station steps. Nicola is persuaded to give a face-saving interview with the Daily Mirror journalist who has been shadowing her, dressed as a giant pork chop, and Pearson gets the sack and everybody else is left wondering whether they will still be left in the thick of it.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2469726", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 402, "number_of_episodes": 24}
