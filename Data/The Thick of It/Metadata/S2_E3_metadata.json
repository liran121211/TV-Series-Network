The department has a new name, the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, though they seem to be dealing with issues no other departments want. They also have a new building but it is a disappointment - with no ventilation and the email system is down so the staff must temporarily use their own email addresses. Hugh takes a dislike to educational advisor Roy Smedley over special schools and uses Terri's computer to send Glenn an email calling him a four letter word. Unfortunately it gets erroneously sent to a little girl also called Glenn Cullen and Tucker has to clear up the fall-out when the press get wind of the story.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0720703", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 572, "number_of_episodes": 24}
