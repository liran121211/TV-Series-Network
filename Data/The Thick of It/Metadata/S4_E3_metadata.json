Back at the ministerial office Phil finds the place deserted except for Glenn, still working on the Fourth Sector for Nicola, and Fergus and his advisor Adam, who are talking to economist Tara. Then the news breaks that anti-government protester Tickel has killed himself. Everybody rushes to inform Mannion, who can only get a phone signal on his mobile by standing on a children's slide - in which embarrassing pose he is photographed. But there is worse news when he gets back to the office. To get rid of Tara, Fergus and Adam have bought a bank - for two billion pounds.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2128317", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 428, "number_of_episodes": 24}
