00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,759
As we enter the third week
<font color="#0000ff">(Subtitles Edited by Abhishek Shandilya)</font>

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,319
I find Mr Tickle's attention-seeking,
tent-based twattery

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,280
even more annoying than
in weeks one and two.

4
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,319
We haven't made him,
we just sold his house.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,680
What do you put into
the Networked Nation? Well...

6
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,240
I am... a minister.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,919
Look at this, no missed calls.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,159
I used to have missed calls piling
up like fucking pizza leaflets.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,879
I suppose it means everything's
fine. How was your evening?

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,919
Really nice.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,239
We managed to get
a table at Mishkin's. Oh.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,559
And you? Ah, a bit of a quiet one.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,359
Just a bottle of pinot and
Twitter-abusing the cast of Glee.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,158
Was kind of wonderful
in its own way.

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,800
Malcolm, can I have
a couple of words?

16
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,919
Political lightweight?
Making up the numbers?

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,919
Sorry, that's four, isn't it? Lovely,
lovely, yeah, you still got it(!)

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,040
But, erm, seriously,
can I just, er...

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,039
'Don't take too wide a step.'
'Start with the right.'

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,599
'Yes. OK, so relax.'

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,840
Cenotaph, here.

22
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,880
Right. OK? Off you go.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,880
Yeah, I think that's too slow.

24
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:03,199
A minute ago you said
I was too fast.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,440
You look like Sleeping Beauty,
that's just weird.

26
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,039
You look like you've been dug up. OK.

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,638
Do you remember when
you got married?

28
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:11,280
I'd rather fucking not.
OK, Nicola...

29
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,959
Olly, shit! I had it then.

30
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,360
Right, sorry to interrupt
you at this very sad time,

31
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,639
er, but we do have Prime Minister's
Questions in one hour.

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,600
No, it's fine, I've got the lead
question,

33
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,679
I've got the follow up
sarcastic question

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,759
and I've got the withering put down,
so I'm prepped, I'm fucking prepped.

35
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,679
Yep, you'll walk rings round him(!)

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,279
Erm, this does seem to be taking
an awfully long time.

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,879
Is that too bouncy?
What do you mean "bouncy"?

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,679
Cos that's helping with my balance
but if it looks... Bouncy?!

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,399
It is too bouncy. Well, that's...
You've over exaggerated now.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,760
It's like you've got rickets.

41
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:46,319
Its Remembrance Sunday. That's what your
face should be doing - remembering.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,560
Think of a sad thing and rememb...
Not remembering!

43
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,159
You don't want to be going along
going, "Oh, that reminds..."

44
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,159
Is that what you do when
you're remembering?

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,879
I think I've got it, I've got it.
Right, let's see. Look, watch.

46
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,198
I'm starting with my left foot
but never mind that.

47
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,438
Now my shoe's coming off.

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,838
The leader of the opposition
is in that room, Malcolm,

49
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,880
practising walking.

50
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:06,319
I mean, baby horses can
walk from the womb.

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,199
She's one-nil down to a pony!

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,999
A pony isn't a baby horse, it's a
foal, a fucking foal is a baby horse.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
Right, our guest tonight on I Don't
Give A Fuck About Baby Horses is me.

54
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,600
We need to do something
about Nicola.

55
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:19,199
I mean, you know about her plan?
I mean, Nicola with a plan?!

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,079
That's like a... toddler
with a harpoon.

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,879
There's a toddler wandering around
in that office with a harpoon.

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,559
Yes, well, don't you worry about
Nicola's plan...

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,040
I'll deal with that Sweaty Betty.

60
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,559
Listen, when you wake up in the morning,
you've got a routine, haven't you?

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,319
Big shit, granola, check the e-mail,
shower and a shave, Nespresso...

62
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,759
sometimes a second shit.

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,720
Exactly, you have a plan,
that's good.

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,279
Nicola has a plan, that's not good...

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,239
but I have a plan that's
fucking great.

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,719
And then I bow?

67
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,399
It's more of a nod, anyway.

68
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,879
Yeah, it's, sort of, "All right,
dead-oes?", but a bit more solemn.

69
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,838
Remember to put the wreath
down this time.

70
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,200
I didn't actually not put it...

71
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:59,759
It got caught in my glove,
I told you.

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, that's very moving,
"They shall not grow old,"

73
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,439
"who photocopy their arses
at the Christmas do."

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,519
Look, I don't want
to show myself up

75
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,679
in front of 5,000 uniformed
pensioners again.

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,799
I'm glad you're thinking
about those pensioners

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,080
cos those are the poor fuckers
who gave everything

78
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,839
so people like you could play
at running the country. Oh nice.

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,279
Olly, walk with me.

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
Er, forwards or backwards?

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,599
Malcolm!

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,599
You'd get a much better response
from her if you didn't bully her.

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,599
Sweetheart, she should
be doing the bullying.

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,919
She should be taking the PM's lunch money
and using his arse as a fruit machine,

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,079
not practising throwing a straw
frisbee in slow motion!

86
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,759
I don't think you got enough
cuddles as a child.

87
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,959
So how do we engage with
this demographic?

88
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,959
The first thing is, is first of all,
knowing who we're talking about,

89
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,320
then finding a name for them.

90
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,639
People who would do something
for nothing.

91
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,319
They are mugs.
Mugs do something for nothing.

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,240
Erm, how about,
"deserving work force"?

93
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,520
Why are you laughing,
does it sound a bit Pravda-ish?

94
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,199
What, handbags?

95
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,319
Pravda! Soviet newspaper.

96
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,959
This is the sort of person,
they find an umbrella on a bus,

97
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,200
they go all the way to the depot
just to give it back.

98
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,879
They're commuters,
they are the street pounders,

99
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,159
street walkers, er...

100
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,439
You can't call them
"street walkers"!

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,639
They're the people who deal
with the little stuff, erm...

102
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,679
Wombles. Honest Wombles.
Everyday Wombles...?

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,399
Sorry, I've just got to take a call.
Erm, straights?

104
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,959
No. No? No, of course, sorry.

105
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,200
Commuting Champions?

106
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,559
Inter-rail... Human inter-railers...

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,039
"Human inter-railers"?
That's inter-railers.

108
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,519
Er, everyday superstars...

109
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,359
All-British supremes...

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,559
Fuck, that sounds like
a racist tribute band.

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,839
Ordinary people with,
with something special about them,

112
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,040
with a special power.
Please, don't say "special".

113
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,839
Don't say special. No, but, you
know, like, people as superheroes.

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,119
Iron people, spider people...
They're just regular citizens

115
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,399
but they have this,
that one special quality

116
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,679
that makes them like Batman or
Batpeople. Erm, the quiet...

117
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,039
Batpeople.

118
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,879
Quiet Batpeople?

119
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,639
No, that's not it.

120
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,239
That's the general area we're
looking at, is what I'm saying.

121
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,278
It's just a marker.

122
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,760
Yep, shall we wrap it up
and make a move? Shad Cab?

123
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:15,479
Yes. Don't, don't say "Shad Cab".

124
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,960
Don't... Why not?
Cos it's Shadow Cabinet, isn't it?

125
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,519
It's like saying spag bol.

126
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,399
Fuck annoy!

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,319
All very worthwhile. What a session.
"Quiet Batpeople"?

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,919
What's she doing, is she fucking
sniffing the pens at night?

129
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,960
This is every day.

130
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,359
This is what we do every day,
scat all day.

131
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,279
Jizz FM! Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah!

132
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,839
What's going on in that abandoned
barn of a brain of hers?

133
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,280
This is, this can't go on -
this is fucking suicide.

134
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:39,039
Malcolm, I know, I know, I know.

135
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,080
I mean, Nicola...

136
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:43,359
she's a nice lady - especially
when she's drunk. Yes!

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,359
Karaoke, you can't take her karaoke
off her. Fucking wish I could!

138
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,080
She's going to have
to fall on her sword.

139
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,359
Which means that we have to stick
one in the ground, trip her onto it,

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,840
get someone to jump up and down
on her back for ten minutes!

141
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:57,000
Nothing personal. Nothing personal,
of course not! Of course not.

142
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,519
So, Ben tells me you have a plan.

143
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,839
Anything I should be worrying about?

144
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,239
You're not going to found
a religion, are you?

145
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,078
Reshuffle? Don't send Ben
to the backbench

146
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,680
cos he'll just wank
and eat Pringles.

147
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:10,999
Leather seats are an invitation
to him. Morning.

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,919
You'll never get in. Ha-ha!

149
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,239
Cock!

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,439
New party logo - a kitten.

151
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,359
A kitten in a sock. Kitten in a sock,
sitting on a motorway, shouting,

152
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,520
"Help me, I don't know what to do!"
Getting close?

153
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,839
All right, look, I just think we
need to show,

154
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,359
we need to be seen to accept

155
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,240
that there are tough
decisions to be made.

156
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:34,359
So, I thought it would be a good
idea if we publicly agreed

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,799
with two government policies
that we previously opposed.

158
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,920
That's all.

159
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,639
Can we talk about this?
Yes absolutely, Malcolm.

160
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,479
We'll, we'll talk about this
in Cabinet, OK?

161
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,320
I'll be talking, you'll be nodding.

162
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,639
I'm struggling here, you want us
to agree with the government?

163
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,999
Not on everything, obviously.

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,599
No, we're just going to back
two government policies...

165
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,239
the coastguard pay freeze

166
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,359
and the end of ring-fenced funding
for primary school breakfast clubs.

167
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,399
So, what?

168
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,999
We're now in favour of drowning
sailors and starving children?

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,559
We are, technically, the opposition. Can
I be devil's advocate here for a moment?

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,799
Nicola's right, of course,
she's right,

171
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,439
but we should at least think
about what Dan has to say here

172
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,939
because we've already seen
one set of quisling wankers

173
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,964
cross the floor
and join JB's barmy army.

174
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,680
If the opposition now join them

175
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:26,319
everyone will just be facing
half an empty fucking chamber.

176
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,719
Yeah, it's important that we rise
above partisan politics, Dan...

177
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,959
so that, Dan, so that we can
take our poll ratings with us.

178
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,119
Malcolm? Malcolm...

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,159
Sorry.

180
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,399
Could you not, talk behind
my back? Thank you. Sorry.

181
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,519
Now, you know, if you don't think
that message is clear,

182
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,800
then that's fine
but it is your job to clarify it.

183
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,320
Fine. Good. OK, great.

184
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,919
Before we finish,

185
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,399
I just want to throw one more
pebble into the thought pool.

186
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,159
Ploop. Sorry, Ben, I missed that.

187
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,679
Just, sorry, I said "ploop".

188
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,239
It's just the noise of a pebble
being dropped.

189
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,879
Er, we're still having
a bit of trouble

190
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,599
connecting with the,
the ordinary voter.

191
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,759
The, erm, the silent majority.

192
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,920
Erm, Malcolm, can you talk us
through our session this morning?

193
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,799
Well, for the record, I do think
that this is a good idea.

194
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,399
Do you mind if I...? Helen, can
I borrow your notes a second...

195
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,799
Oh, I should say, actually,
none of this is set in stone.

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,399
You know, they're, they're
not even set in Plasticine!

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,080
So, the marker for this target
demographic is Quiet Batpeople.

198
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,119
As I say... "Quiet Batpeople"?!

199
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,679
Quiet Batpeople,
it's everyday superheroes.

200
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,919
There's a big tick next to that here.
Everyday heroes like...

201
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,200
like vigilantes?

202
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,999
It's ordinary people,
not vigilantes.

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,199
Don't worry your pretty
little head about it.

204
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,359
"Little" being the operative word,
"pretty" not.

205
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,639
Helen's written here, "Normality
as a kind of superpower."

206
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,639
OK, I'm sensing, er, opposition.

207
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,159
Good, cos earlier you were talking about
getting rid of that(?)

208
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,719
So, I would like everybody
to take the idea away

209
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
and just let it percolate.

210
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:21,839
OK, good, er...

211
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,919
Oh, poppies!

212
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,880
Last thing, can we just make
absolutely sure

213
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,439
we have them on at all times.

214
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,879
Jackets, coats...

215
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,079
Or batsuits.

216
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,439
Wear your poppies or
you will be shot at dawn!

217
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,559
(Thank you.)

218
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,079
Yes, thank you(!)

219
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,519
Well, I had more fun
at my last mammogram!

220
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,879
Oh, no, you were fine.

221
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,599
Well, maybe... You fox-faced fuck!

222
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,159
Dan The-demi-man Miller,
interview with The New Statesman...

223
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,079
he says that he,
"pledges himself to change the fractured"

224
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:54,179
"and shaky narrative
at the heart of the party."

225
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,839
Arse! Well, I'm pledging myself
to find Dan Mr Smoothie Miller

226
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,639
and fracture and shake him into
an actual fucking smoothie.

227
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,360
Looks like a fun runner's
lost his way.

228
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,360
Why are there bits of food
wandering about?

229
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,519
Are you for the chop?
It's a fucking hack pack.

230
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,799
Any comment on Dan Miller's article?
No comment, be gracious,

231
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,799
smile, look good. No questions.

232
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,040
Are you for the chop, Mrs Murray?
Oh, it's a chop!

233
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,879
Oh, it's that dick from The Mirror
who... Are you top of the chops?

234
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,479
Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Thank you.

235
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,999
You, fuck off!
Get back to the fucking Flintstones.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,839
Turn up like that again I'll fucking
stick that down your throat

237
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,439
and pull it out your arse.

238
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,519
That's enough. I don't even do things
I enjoy for that long! That's it!

239
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,279
No questions, Nicola's got
a government to bring down.

240
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,599
No comment, no comment,
thanks very much.

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,638
Why did we have to stand
there smiling like that?

242
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,998
You think it'd be better if you
were seen in tears?

243
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,320
I just think my face next
to a chop does not look good

244
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:42,320
unless I'm applying for
a job in Asda!

245
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:44,359
Why pictures of her coming
from Shadow Cabinet?

246
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,039
Maybe they don't want pictures
of her, maybe they want you.

247
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,679
Maybe they want pictures of
an over-botoxed Nancy Dell'Olio?

248
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,359
Right, the first chance you get just
go and deal with Dan.

249
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,320
Tear him a new bum or whatever
it is people say.

250
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:58,719
Right, right, right, right, right.

251
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,999
I mean, what would possess you
to walk about the streets

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,399
with notes just... there
for anybody to see?

253
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,919
They're my notes but they're
your shit suggestions.

254
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,278
Well, I'm not the one flapping them
about in such a way

255
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,760
that the press can take pictures
of them! How was I to know?

256
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:16,439
They were taking a photo of
Nicola... Cos you're an adult...

257
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,799
"Quite Batpeople" on every
fucking paper!

258
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,559
Right, this is a wake-up call.

259
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,759
By the way, the next time you want
to make Nicola look like a clown,

260
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,439
with her fucking hair on fire,

261
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,239
why don't you just take your notes
down to Snappy Snaps

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,198
and get them blown up
to gigantic cheque size

263
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,520
so the partially sighted
can be in on the fucking gag?!

264
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,839
I didn't know they'd
be able to see it!

265
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,759
So we have to seize the agenda,

266
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,919
we have to deflect attention
away from all this.

267
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,439
It's now time to embrace
our friend Mr Tickle.

268
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,038
I can't say his name
without smiling.

269
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,480
Well, he's not smiling, is he?

270
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:49,159
He's living in a tent cos his
key worker housing was sold off.

271
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,119
Yes and he's a 24 carat
fucking nutcase.

272
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,839
Which means that Peter Mannion

273
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,839
has been picking on a man with
a history of depression.

274
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,039
That's a way right into the
principality of pricks, right there.

275
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,518
Yeah, and that's exactly what
they will expect me to do.

276
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,840
They'll know about his mental
health records as well.

277
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,280
They'll just be waiting for me to attack
and I'm not going to

278
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:09,305
and that will surprise them.

279
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,559
I think that you and I need
to have a little talk.

280
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,239
A proper talk.

281
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,559
Like when mummy explains why daddy's
going to be in the papers tomorrow.

282
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,639
Out. You mean you'd like us to go?

283
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,599
Yes, into exile, preferably.
Bhutan's nice.

284
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,999
I need to know that you're really
on top of things, actually, Malcolm.

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,040
I do my fucking job!

286
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,879
Well, do you do your fucking job
out of a sense of obligation

287
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,280
or are you doing it because you
actually believe in me?

288
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:38,839
Oh, let me boomer-fucking-rang that one
right back at you, do you believe in you?

289
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,359
Cos I can't see any fucking
fire in your eyes.

290
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,679
I can't even see the clicking
of the, of the pilot light

291
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,598
to try and get a tiny,
little flame going.

292
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,640
What I do see is that you
might at any day decide,

293
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:52,079
"Oh, I've fucking had enough," and go
off and get a blanket from the car.

294
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,119
I slightly resent what
you're saying.

295
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,079
The fact of the matter is, I do not
believe in my heart of hearts...

296
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,999
that you're hungry for power.

297
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,079
You've got no idea how hungry
for power I am.

298
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,319
You have to really fucking want to do
this. This is what I'm telling you!

299
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,799
I fucking want this...
Shit, people can hear me.

300
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,639
I am hungry for this, yes!

301
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,639
Well, you've got to be as hungry
as a fucking Hutu

302
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,999
in the fucking jungle
with a big machete.

303
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,919
You've got to go hacking through
the fucking opposition

304
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,879
with a big fucking belt full of hands
and a necklace made of ears.

305
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,920
Can you do that?

306
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,918
Yes. Can you wear a necklace
made of ears?

307
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,960
I can be a Hutu...

308
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:31,159
I can wear fucking fingernail
bracelets, I can...

309
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,199
do this, Malcolm, yes.

310
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
That's what we need to see.

311
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,079
Yeah, I promise you, I can deliver.

312
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,879
I can see that.

313
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,679
She's got Bette Davis eyes.

314
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,439
You're going to do this.
Brilliant, thank you, Malcolm.

315
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,520
Fucking useless.

316
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,479
She is unstoppable and she loves you.

317
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,759
Because a wine tasting is not a night
out, it's an admission of defeat.

318
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,199
You might as well go to...

319
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,880
Er, Jo, I'll call you back.

320
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,319
Hiya, I thought you were
bollocking Dan Miller?

321
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,399
Oh, I am.

322
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,839
Right, is he...?

323
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,039
I'm in the middle of slamming
his smug face

324
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,319
into a verbal deep fat fryer.

325
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,159
You know Dan, of course, don't you?
Why don't you sit down and join us?

326
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,159
Er... Join us!

327
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,239
I don't know if you've met
Mrs Susan Doherty?

328
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,199
Mrs Doherty is a quiet fucking batperson,
or a fucking motorway mingebag,

329
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,039
or whatever the fuck we're calling
these fickle shits this week.

330
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,199
I'm going to get a coffee,
do you want anything?

331
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
I'll have a fucking Fanta. OK.

332
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,078
You know what I think
I did wrong last year?

333
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,040
I think I set off on the wrong foot

334
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,639
because I actually have a bit
of a problem with left and right.

335
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,319
It's like directional dyslexia
or dyspedia, dys...

336
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,799
It's one of the dys...
Oh, I'm doing it now.

337
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,519
For goodness sake.
Oh, is this more quiet bat guano?

338
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,239
This Week would like
to photograph politicians

339
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
wearing underpants
over their clothes.

340
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,559
And Grazia would like to know

341
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,199
what you carry in your
utility belt and why?

342
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,079
I'll say you're not interested.
I'm fucking not interested.

343
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,639
I'm only interested in working out
which of my feet is which.

344
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,839
So we need to be rid of Nicola.

345
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,679
Rid of her? She's tank.

346
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,719
She's fucking electoral asbestos.
Wow, so... you, you want to...?

347
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,439
I want this party back in power
where we can help people.

348
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,559
I don't know whether you've noticed
but we haven't got any fucking power.

349
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,839
We can't help anyone.
We're like a family in a Cuban slum.

350
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,679
We're out in the middle of nowhere. We're
in the fucking... middle of the ocean,

351
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,560
with our own Ellen MacArthur
sobbing, crying - enough.

352
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,159
Over the side she goes.

353
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,719
She's going to sleep with the fishes.

354
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,300
Or at least witter on at them
until they

355
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,325
fucking lose the will to live.
So, do you...?

356
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,479
(Do you have a plan?)

357
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,119
Optimum time for her to step down
is eight months from now.

358
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,759
Over that period she has
to be very gently dislodged...

359
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,679
like a tick from a cat's ear.

360
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,439
You set up that batpeople photo!

361
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,719
Olly, I'm shocked at you
suggesting that.

362
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,759
Jiminy Fuckmas, Malcolm!
I don't know about any of this.

363
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,239
It's time for you to step up, Olly.
What's that film that you love?

364
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,398
What film? The one about
the fucking hairdresser,

365
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,920
the space hairdresser and the cowboy.

366
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:11,959
The guy, he's got a tinfoil pal
and a pedal bin.

367
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,399
His father's a robot and he's fucking
fucked his sister.

368
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,799
LEGO, they're all made
of fucking Lego.

369
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,719
Star Wars. That's the one, right.

370
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,279
It's like that, OK? You want
to fucking kill the bad guys.

371
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,600
And you'll be able to blow up
the big... The Death Star.

372
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,359
The Death Star thing.

373
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,479
Then you can go and live
happily ever after

374
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,999
on the planet of the teddy bears.
They're Ewoks, Ewoks.

375
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,560
It's a fantastic analogy, well done.

376
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,319
Are you, are you absolutely
sure about this, Malcolm?

377
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,359
Well, not really, no...

378
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
but it's worth a punt, isn't it?

379
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,239
Good. Life is interesting at last...

380
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,279
I've been so fucking bored
for the last two years.

381
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,160
Bonnie Langford's paying.

382
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,760
It's a good speech, I think.
Does it need a bit of a...? Rethink.

383
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,199
I was going to say trim.

384
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,319
Are you going to address the
batpeople thing in the speech?

385
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,319
No, I might walk on stage
to the theme tune!

386
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,399
Just make sure you're not
wearing anything

387
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,040
that can be photographed
like a cape.

388
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,679
Oh, Malcolm, did you see Dan?

389
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,039
I saw him and I fucking
eviscerated him.

390
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,238
What did you say?

391
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,080
He crumpled like a crisp
packet on a cooker.

392
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:22,319
He's now just a small pool of grease
and regret, isn't he?

393
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,759
Yeah, yeah, you can only see him
under UV lights now.

394
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,639
How do you know? Were you there?

395
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,439
Yeah, yeah. Malcolm flayed
his skin off,

396
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,639
he's going to use it as his onesie.
That's him just coming in.

397
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
Don't say anything.

398
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't humiliate him any further -
that's my fucking job.

399
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,599
Give us your dinner money! I haven't got
dinner money, I bring a packed lunch.

400
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,559
Fuck that. I don't want one of your
home-made fucking feta parcels.

401
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,680
I presume you need to bollock
me for my disloyalty

402
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,599
in doing that New Statesman thing,
so why don't we... I already have.

403
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,359
This morning - were you not there?
Can't say I recall it.

404
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,959
Would it be cheeky if I invited
you onto the veranda?

405
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,240
I've got a little matter I'd like
to discuss with you.

406
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,880
We're lovers, deal with it.

407
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,039
I suppose the key question is,

408
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,799
is Dan Miller going to pull
the same stunt again?

409
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,919
Well, I mean, I think, after what
he's just been through with Malcolm,

410
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,479
Dan's crushed! He's just in the
shower crying, with his clothes on!

411
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,799
Dan? Dan Miller? Yeah, Malcolm
gave him a right old... K'cher!

412
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,160
He gave him a cash register?

413
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,399
No, that was me cracking
a whip, plainly!

414
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,800
Well, shame I missed that,
where was, er, where was this?

415
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,079
It was in the back stairwell.

416
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,799
That's right by my office.
I'm surprised I didn't hear that.

417
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,799
I mean, I can hear fat Pat's farts
bouncing off the walls

418
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,878
when she has to take the stairs
if the lift's bust.

419
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:38,320
Well, it was, sort of, you know,
he did it in a lower tone.

420
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:41,440
Special, kind of, terrifying...
He calls it, erm, whisper boarding.

421
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,159
It's not a healthy sign when
the deputy attacks the leader

422
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,159
but maybe we should embrace
this point of no return.

423
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,439
Are you saying you agree
with what I wrote?

424
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm saying that I spoke
to Nicola earlier,

425
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,879
to gauge the fire in her belly,

426
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,999
and now I'm standing
in a cupboard with you.

427
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,039
What's the worst thing that he said?

428
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,199
Oh, well, he said, er,
"Fuck right off, you fucker!"

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,439
Really? Well, I once
used the last tea bag

430
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,039
and Malcolm pushed me up against a wall and
called me Noncey Sinatra - that seems tame.

431
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,079
Well, like I say, it was, it was,
it was mainly in the tone, Ben.

432
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,839
I didn't hold the door open for him
and he called me a minge mop.

433
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, but he likes Dan.

434
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,439
Ooh!

435
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,399
Did you need me?

436
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,360
Nope, nope.

437
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
So, your loyalty to Nicola is...?

438
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,760
Unwavering.

439
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,239
Right up to the point that...

440
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,759
Someone challenges her?

441
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,038
Not necessary, she's going
to kick her own head in,

442
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,278
which will be easy for her
because she does yoga.

443
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,038
We just need someone
to hold her jacket

444
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,760
while she commits political hara-kiri

445
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,119
and sweep in unopposed...

446
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,239
being careful not to tread
in the mess.

447
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,199
So, you think...

448
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,160
I should challenge her?
What the fuck is this?

449
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,479
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Cunt?!

450
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,120
Do you or do you not want
to be the next leader of this party?

451
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,279
Yes.

452
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,198
Well, she needs to fuck off
in eight months,

453
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,998
so it looks like we're
giving her a chance.

454
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,198
I will teach you the way of tears
and love, my friend.

455
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,000
Now let's get out of this
fucking cupboard

456
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,759
before Ben Swain comes
in for his lunchtime wank.

457
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,159
And I agree that we no longer
have the luxury,

458
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,119
the privilege of thinking
in the abstract about politics.

459
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,759
How's Martina Luther King doing?

460
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,720
It's like that old show Faking It.

461
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:29,999
She's a shit politician
pretending to be a,

462
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,319
pretending to be, er,
a mediocre one.

463
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,039
What's that text? It's not a text.

464
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,999
Show me the text. It's telling me to
tell you to mind your own business.

465
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,599
Show me the text! No, no, get off.

466
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,439
Show me. No, get off, it's a girl
sexting me, Malcolm.

467
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,519
Practising for Strictly.
Get off my fucking...

468
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,039
Give me my fucking...

469
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
What is this tiny font?

470
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,559
Is it to match your
subatomic thoughts?

471
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,079
Give me my phone, Malcolm.

472
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,639
"As I thought, we're dropping BC,"
what does that mean?

473
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,398
That's my friend who works
in education.

474
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,160
The government are dropping
the reforms

475
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,719
to the primary school
breakfast club policy.

476
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,519
OK, let's rewind here
a bit, stick man.

477
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,559
Nicola is about to adopt
a policy that is so toxic

478
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,479
that this stony-hearted government of
fucking puppy killers is dropping it?

479
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,319
Yeah. Shit in my porridge.

480
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,919
Get a dart gun and go
and fucking kill her.

481
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,679
No, no, think about it.
This is exactly what we want, right?

482
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,959
No, think about it, this isn't what
we want. This is too soon.

483
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,639
The mechanics of the leadership
election are not in place.

484
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,879
Right, we've got to get
her off that stage.

485
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,120
Go and piss in a fuse box,
or finger a security guard.

486
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:35,279
I'll bundle her out during the melee.
We need to stop Nicola announcing.

487
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,119
Rumour has it that
the government is going to

488
00:21:37,144 --> 00:21:39,119
- drop the breakfast club policy.
- Oh, shit!

489
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,439
But just a rumour, yeah?

490
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,800
Yes, I'm just getting it
You need to signal her to stop.

491
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,959
You've got a signal? Er...
We never agreed on one.

492
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,999
You don't have a fucking signal?
You must, from Hampstead Heath?

493
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,159
Didn't Nicola mention
something about iceberg?

494
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,959
As in you're going to crash into an
iceberg. OK, how do I do that?

495
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,519
That's subtle(!) Get in, whatever
it is. I'll do a triangle.

496
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,719
In times of deep crisis, tribal
politics can act as a break upon it.

497
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,759
And it's down... to us to rise
above this and think...

498
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,240
What is that? Breached birth?
It's a fucking iceberg.

499
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:13,679
Upside down uterus. Shut up, Olly!

500
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,759
..that we're endorsing fully
and unreservedly

501
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,359
a pay freeze for the coastguard.

502
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,879
And an end
to the ring-fencing of funds

503
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,879
to provide primary school
breakfast clubs.

504
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,479
We are in concurrence with
the government

505
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,320
because we are in unity with
the British people.

506
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,919
Any questions?

507
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,879
Mrs Murray, did you know that
the government have just announced

508
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,840
that they are dropping the reform
on primary school breakfast clubs?

509
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,799
(Pretend you heard
another question.)

510
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,280
Er, yes, yes, we, er, yes.

511
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,759
Breakfast, er, really is a...

512
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,679
really is a meal for the whole
family, er, and, er...

513
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,999
I think that we regard that as...

514
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,360
You've got some nice fake concern
going on there, Malcolm.

515
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,879
I'm sorry?

516
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,239
Undermining Nicola.
You're getting off on this.

517
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,040
You've got some sort of agenda.

518
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,759
Don't you dare question my loyalty
to my leader or my party ever again.

519
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,999
And don't flatter yourself
into thinking that

520
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,239
you can divine my motives or actions.

521
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,719
You are a mouse in a maze.

522
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,679
..now that's not to say that
if you don't have a family you,

523
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,120
you can't enjoy breakfast.

524
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,879
Plainly, you can and you should

525
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,079
because, erm, because it is the most
important meal of the day,

526
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,119
especially if you've been
fasting during Eid.

527
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,039
I'm dead, aren't I?
Why didn't you stop me?!

528
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,679
I tried to warn you.

529
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,319
Oh, with the triangle thing.
W.T.Fuck was that?

530
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,199
Iceberg. Not to scale, obviously.

531
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,999
The iceberg you were heading
for was much, much bigger than that.

532
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,679
Do you know what I thought it was?
Hash brown.

533
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,559
You see a triangle and the first thing that
comes to your mind is hash brown? No...!

534
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,359
Bye-bye. Thank you.

535
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,279
Not the first thing, the first thing
I thought was pyramid.

536
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,959
Pyramid, the signal being...?
Being everything's fine.

537
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,280
You know, everybody likes pyramids.

538
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,439
Do we know why
the fuckers dropped it?

539
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,959
Even the Etonian mess over at number
ten has to acknowledge

540
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,599
that people hate the policy.

541
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,959
It's taking food
out of children's mouths.

542
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,079
It is kind of the opposite
of Comic Relief.

543
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,718
Well, then you should
have stopped me!

544
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,480
You could have created a diversion...

545
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:33,359
you could have gone in there
and set yourself on fire

546
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,999
or got your tits out and shouted,
"Oh, there's a big lion!",

547
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,039
I don't know.

548
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,480
Just something, just anything

549
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:41,399
rather than leave me in there
committing career suicide

550
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,959
by starving small children.

551
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,399
And you, Malcolm,
the one time in my life

552
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,319
I would've been actually pleased
to see you. Where the fuck were you?

553
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,599
Sorry. Can you U-turn maybe?

554
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,120
No, that was a U-turn - if I do
another U-turn it's an O-turn.

555
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,879
Am I dead? No. No, no.

556
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,159
Cos I feel like I'm dead.

557
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,999
I feel like on Sunday I should just
put the poppy wreath round my neck

558
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,840
and take 40 paracetamol.
No, don't worry.

559
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:11,320
Look, we're all still Team Nicola.
We'll fight for you, won't we?

560
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,960
Can somebody get
me a coffee, please? God, yeah.

561
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,840
Hold the wreath in your
right hand...

562
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:24,479
It's going to be heavier, isn't it? It's a
practise wreath, I haven't weighed them.

563
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,519
Down, two... three, frown,
two... three,

564
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,199
up and walk backwards.

565
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,919
Just copy the Queen, if in doubt.

566
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,080
That's going to have to do.

567
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:35,999
Good luck! Just, you know, knock 'em
dead in a silent respectful manner!

568
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,079
Yeah. Phone off.

569
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,839
Ho-ho! Helen given you
the wreath lecture?

570
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,359
Oh, come on, Nicola,
you'll be absolutely fine.

571
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,678
I couldn't eat breakfast.

572
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:47,080
I felt like I'd personally
ripped it out of the hands

573
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:49,759
of some malnourished infant.
Stop it. Stop it.

574
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,359
The first rule of breakfast club
is we do not talk about it.

575
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,400
That's it for now.

576
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,959
It's not just that,
my head's full of bat.

577
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,999
Because of the hat?

578
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,639
What? No because of the...
Does this look like a bat?! No!

579
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,438
I was going to say
it doesn't look like a...

580
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,680
It looks, it's more Mickey Mouse,
isn't it? The hat?

581
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:08,159
Or Minnie Mouse,
it's Minnie Mouse. Not bat.

582
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,839
Fuck off, Olly. OK.

583
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,120
Just wreath up that bad boy!
OK. Yeah.

584
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,119
'Oh, and the DPM is up next.'

585
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,079
Firm grasp on the wreath, there.

586
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
He's aiming for the steps.

587
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,519
Top step! And that is...

588
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,720
magic poppies.

589
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Oh, here we go.

590
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,199
She's flustered, isn't she?

591
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,600
That's the problem. She'll be fine.

592
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,680
Oh, my God.

593
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,759
Bollocking poppy wank!

594
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Why is she hovering in the middle?!

595
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,799
You're right, she can't fucking walk.

596
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,158
I mean, shall we get a pony

597
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,200
to challenge her?

598
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,520
It's not a fucking pony,
it's a fucking foal.

599
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
Sorry.

600
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,299
I don't understand how

601
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,975
- you can get that wrong.
- It's this! Da, da, clonk!

602
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,839
She is officially a ceno-twat.

603
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,799
Fabulous work. Let's just,
er... bury her in a grave...

604
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,719
The Unknown Leader.

605
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,599
I can't watch. I feel a bit sick.

606
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,159
I just hope there is no afterlife

607
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,479
because if people fought

608
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
and died for this.

609
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,559
It is going to seem even more
ridiculously futile.

610
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,999
Why do you know so much
about horses anyway?

611
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,159
'I thought you were raised
by wolves.'

00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,959
First thoughts?
We're policy jamming here.

614
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,319
Yes and ho.

615
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,399
Let's Macintyre this. Stand up.

616
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,559
I feel like I've joined
the Scientologists.

617
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,559
Do you want to have an idea-gasm?
Yes, please.

618
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,960
She's some kind of economist.

619
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,359
I think we're looking
at about two billion.

620
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,919
I quite like Emily Maitlis.

621
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,440
I'm sure she'd love a grey pounding.

622
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,039
Is this what we came
into politics for?

623
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,920
Yep. That and the pussy.
