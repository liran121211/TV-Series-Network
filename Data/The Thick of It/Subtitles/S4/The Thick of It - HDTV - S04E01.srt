1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,580
Of course I know it's our
anniversary. What do you think the
card was for?
<font color="#0000ff">(Subtitles Provided by Abhishek Shandilya)</font>

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,420
I left it on the kitchen table.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,700
Oh right. My bad, as they say.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,140
You're a very tidy man, aren't you?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,740
There's no happiness without order.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,820
It's a Nazi quote but
it stands the test of time.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,460
When is Peter getting in? That nurse
is becoming a bit of a running sore

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,340
which is ironic.
Tickle? Mr Tickle?

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,140
Mr Tickel. He's not still
in his fucking tent is he?

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,620
I know we only have
one anniversary a year.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,140
There's a clue in the name,
I did do classics.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm not being chippy, it's a fact.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,020
I'm saying Tickel. Tickle.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,980
It undermines him. If we say Tickle
it makes him look stupid.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,900
I was at school with a guy called
Timothy Burr. Either change school

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,140
or change your name, but don't get
your mum to ring my mum and complain

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,780
about the lumberjack jokes.
Why was she complaining?
Err... Timothy Burr, Tim Burr.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,940
I can't leave before
my coalition partner.

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,140
Fergus, I told you.

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,980
Well, I say partner.
He's Lewis, I'm Morse.

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,140
I hate to ask but I've got to ask.
Are you ready for today, Fergus?

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,500
Yeah, somewhat.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Silicon Playgrounds are... is go.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,100
I just hope Mannion keeps his
baccy stained fingers out of it.

25
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,820
Don't worry about Mannion.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,380
He's allergic to the 21st century.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,220
Yeah, he didn't like the 20th much
and the 19th makes him fart papyrus.

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,860
I think I'd better end this call now
in case I get a brain tumour.

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,300
Precisely. I'd lose all my lovely
thick hair. Can't wait for later.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,380
What?

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,460
Yes. The whole protest is really
taking off. It's a sensible policy.

32
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,620
If we sell off
NHS key worker housing,

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,540
we can pay off the PFI debts.
We haven't made him live in a tent,
just sold his house.

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,420
The cold winter will finish him off.
He's like bindweed.

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,220
Well, you know I can be romantic.

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,060
Haven't we... Oh, piss.
Christ, I've been spotted.

37
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,140
Peter. Can we talk Tickle?

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,180
I'd love to, but I think Fergus
was asking for you,

39
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,740
something about Silicon?

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,780
OK, well. Tickle you later.

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,140
Oh, she just made eyes at me.

44
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,420
another 50 of those, these will stay
outside dotted around. Morning!

45
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,460
Big day for the reception class.
Well done you.

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,140
Ah. Oh, I'm not sure
"App-ortunity" works.

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,420
Yes it does.

48
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,580
It combines app and opportunity.

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,060
(Yes, I know that.)

50
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,260
Just looks like a team name
from The Apprentice.

51
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,620
As you can see, Terri, I'm noting
down every one of your comments.

52
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,700
Excuse me,

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,620
you asked to see me for the launch
of Silicon Playgrounds, no?

54
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,500
I have never asked to see you.

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,180
Terri, don't worry about us.
Go and help Malfoy and his dad.

56
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,540
Thanks, Ridgley.

57
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,940
I don't get it.

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,820
Andrew Ridgley, Wham.
Hitched A Ride?

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,380
Oh, contemporary reference.
Yeah. Yeah, very up to date.

60
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,020
Bit like your hair. What is it you
ask for? The Disney Prince?

61
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,020
What do you ask for? Err...
The...wanker?

62
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,500
Brilliant. Oh, forgot to tell you,
sorry. Stewart's popping in.

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,540
Fuck me. What's the Last Airbender
want? He needs the... Excuse me!

64
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,620
Oh, Jesus, this came through
yesterday.

65
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,340
Yes, well, it came at 6:05.

66
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,580
I turn off all my work
devices at six.

67
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,740
After that, it's me,
the Kindle and Jodi Picoult.

68
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,100
Silicone Playgrounds project
cleared for uplaunch.

69
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,740
Boom!

70
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,300
Hello, century 21.

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,100
We get kids to create apps
in schools,

72
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,860
we pay them a digital dividend,
we foster a new generation
of entrepreneurs.

73
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,220
Sounds like that third
Tron film no one's waiting for.
We'd better tell Peter.

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,060
Well, we could celebrate it
at another time.

75
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,900
Technically, and thrillingly,
it'll be our anniversary all year!

76
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,860
Oh, sorry darling
I've got to go.

77
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,980
I think the bailiffs are here
take my will to live.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,740
Fergus, my coalition colleague stroke
junior, big day for you.

79
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,180
Every day is a big day for me,

80
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,620
that's why I get here
an hour before you.

81
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,460
I'm afraid the human snowman
is coming in...now.

82
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,620
Stewart!  Great. Ah, if it isn't
Raffles the gentleman MP.

83
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,020
Why are you coming in together?
Something we should know about?

84
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,500
We were married in Vegas, didn't you
know?  We're really happy.

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,060
OK, everyone. Meeting room, now.

86
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,260
Terri, could you get someone
to bring me some chai?

87
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,820
I'm parched as a cuttlefish.

88
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,580
Oh for fuck's sake.

89
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,420
OK, folks. Today's headline in
Copperplate Gothic Bold, font 72,

90
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,700
is Emma and I broke the fast this AM
with the PM.

91
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,620
And it is a massive yes. So our
Silicon Playground initiative

92
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,900
is going to be the standard bearer
for the Networked Nation.

93
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,820
It is a double double win.
A double win for both babies
of the coalition.

94
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,020
Absolutely. It's win squared.
Terrific.

95
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,020
What, shall we do a Mexican
wave around the table?

96
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,060
From my POV, re all this, big
hurrah, we're ready to upload,

97
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,580
ie, let's launch the fucker.

98
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,460
I'm registering your energy Fergus,
but we've decided it's going
to be launched by...

99
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,300
the Secretary of State for
Social Affairs and Citizenship.

100
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,140
Oooh... All my gallstones have come
at once.

101
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,580
Are you fucking serious?
What is wrong with you people?

102
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,260
Peter can't even right click
a fucking mouse.

103
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,780
He can. It's track pads
he has a problem with.

104
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,740
No, you come in here,
like, Dr Robotnik,

105
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,180
and say "Oh, I'm sorry."

106
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,260
We put in the graft on this.
You can't just take it off us.

107
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,780
I think we can, you see... We can.

108
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,100
Coalition's like a band.
Every band has a front man.

109
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,620
He's Florence and you're...
The Machine. The Machine.

110
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,860
Sorry I'm late, guys. I was just
changing in a phone booth.

111
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,780
Ha ha ha. Was that a joke or...?
Yeah, no, I was on the phone.

112
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,420
Hey, Fergus, you look a bit A&E,
everything all right?

113
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,860
No. Mannion is announcing Silicon
Playgrounds on Stewart's orders.

114
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,340
PM's orders. What?

115
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,380
Hang on a moment.
This is demarcation stuff.

116
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,180
This is fourth sector, right?

117
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,540
And I am the fourth sector guru.

118
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,460
I've been on Team Fergus on this,
you know?

119
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,740
Me and the Inbetweeners.

120
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,300
The what? The what? Sorry?

121
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,820
You know that's what we call you.

122
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,780
We did all the work on this, us.
We're a team, we did it.

123
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,580
And now you say we're playing
a new game,

124
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,940
pass the parcel,
and he gets to unwrap it?

125
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,060
I don't think so.
This is bollocks, Stewart.

126
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,580
Come on, calm down.
Just a second.

127
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,860
Just leave it, leave it.

128
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,180
He's going to have a heart attack,
look at him.

129
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,740
Will we cope? Can we even carry on?

130
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,420
Oh, it doesn't seem to have
changed anything.

131
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,460
The top line, folks, is this.
It's about coalition, remember.

132
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,500
This is not about coalition,

133
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,420
this is about you nicking our ideas
and doing us up the Eurotunnel.

134
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,540
You're a couple of homeless guys
we've invited to Christmas dinner.

135
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,180
Don't bitch cos we don't let you
carve the turkey. Let me say it
simply for you, Stewart.

136
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,060
I don't understand
the Networked Nation

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,700
and the Silicon fucking Playground,

138
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,180
gigabits, people watching
television on telephones.

139
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,060
For what it's worth, I think Fergus
should carve this particular turkey.

140
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,220
There you go.

141
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,460
Peter, the Networked Nation
is about harnessing

142
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,020
the interconnectivity of everyone
in society.

143
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,060
It's a new way of thinking.

144
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,900
Innovation, self-investment,
revenue flux, growth,

145
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,220
ergo a healthy network.

146
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
What's so complicated about that?

147
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,340
All the words you just used.
Oh, Christ.

148
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,700
Here comes Dennis Norden.
Oh, he brought his laughter file.

149
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,140
I don't know if this is any use,

150
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,740
but it might give you some idea
of the scale of the problem.

151
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,820
Look, I think we're about
done here, yeah?

152
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,300
OK, let's wrap this up.

153
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,620
Am I in some kind of ghost story?
I've been hit by a bus

154
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,420
and no-one can see me any more?

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,220
Everyone's really loving
your energy.

156
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,060
Why don't you pilot the staff cuts?

157
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,660
Let Peter go down to the school,

158
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,060
bounce some ideas off the wall,
see if the kids like the echo.

159
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,140
So, Peter gets to announce
Silicon Playgrounds,

160
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,220
I get the elephants' graveyard.

161
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,500
I could terminate some of the staff
here using combat techniques.

162
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,940
Where are we actually on staff cuts?
Is there a shortlist at all?

163
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,820
Phil has a staff cuts dossier
with maps and charts and everything.

164
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,780
I saw a guy out there who takes
three shits an hour. That's not
biologically possible.

165
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,220
Well, that's Graham.
He has Crohn's disease.

166
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,140
I have a very short concise brief on
Silicon. I can just email it to you.

167
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,100
Put it on a piece of paper
and I'll read it.

168
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,300
One piece, we don't need that.

169
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,980
Glenn, you look like a week-old
party balloon.

170
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,260
Yeah, don't worry about me, Terri,
I'm fine.

171
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,380
I just don't want you ending up
as one of those, "Before he turned
the gun on himself," kind of guys.

172
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,500
That isn't going to happen, Terri,
because I don't even possess a gun.

173
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,220
Is that all that's stopping you,
lack of resources?

174
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,180
Ah, Peter,
I'm expecting great things.

175
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,140
Then you're an idiot.
Laters, legislators.

176
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,420
The only way this policy launch
could be worse is if I
understood the bloody thing.

177
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,260
I'm going to put the old tea
cauldron on. Anybody fancy a brew?

178
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,900
Risk of sounding like your mum.
Time for school.

179
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,660
You need to get to this meeting.
I hate school children.

180
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,140
They're volatile and stupid
and haven't got the vote.

181
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,020
Might as well be talking
to fucking geese.

182
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,620
The school's only ten minutes
from your house. Pop round
for a late lunch.

183
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,220
Not much of a celebration. "Hello,
darling, make me a Cup-a-soup."

184
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,900
I need a thoughtful, very personal
present for Tina. Any ideas?

185
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,860
Err... what about
sexy undergarments?

186
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,500
No.

187
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,020
Perfume. What perfume does she wear?

188
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,420
No idea. Expensive,
smells a bit of lemons.

189
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,340
I do really need a comment on
this Tickel protest, please.

190
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,380
OK.

191
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,220
"As we enter the third week, I
find Mr Tickle's attention seeking,

192
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,020
"tent-based twattery even more
annoying than in weeks one and two."

193
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,900
I can't actually say that. Really?

194
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,300
Then by implication you know what
you can say, so say that instead.

195
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,420
All right. I'll channel you.

196
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,460
Channel me?

197
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,500
She's really quite predatory,
isn't she?

198
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,020
Who? Terri's Clockwork Orange?
That's what I call her.

199
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,540
For the other lady in your life.
Where did you get that?

200
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,140
It was in my desk. I was saving it
for something special.
Like losing your virginity?

201
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,420
I've done that in style,
actually. If my penis could talk.
It would say, "I'm lonely!

202
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,780
"Where is everyone?
Let me out of this coffin!"

203
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,580
Two years ago I was a fucking guru.

204
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,860
I give two fingers to Nick
and what happens?

205
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,060
Lo and behold, a party
with principles comes crawling

206
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,300
and begging for me, and then what do
they do with their principles?

207
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,260
Shove them on the compost heap and
join the upper class-holes

208
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,580
I've spent my career trying to keep
out. Glenn, I need your help.

209
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,500
I want out.
I want a redundancy package.

210
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,740
Could you just bump my name up
the exit list?

211
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,900
I mean, just put in
a bad word for me?

212
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,220
Yeah, sure, Terri.

213
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,020
Consider yourself redundant,
we all do.

214
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,900
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I have a word?

215
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,180
Sure, kettle's just boiled.
I meant Terri.

216
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,540
(Sorry, Glenn.)

217
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,580
Just to keep you up to speed, Terri,

218
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,060
we're going to do a companion launch
for Digital Playgrounds

219
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,300
tonight at the Learning Centre
at 7:00pm.

220
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,380
All right? And we just need you
to pop a press pack in the

221
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,820
Coverley microwave and
let us know when you've pinged.

222
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,500
Sorry, I don't think I'll be able
to get that cleared before six

223
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,220
so that's effectively tomorrow, isn't
it? Terri, we don't need clearance.

224
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,740
We're not covering a Beatles track,
we're the fucking government.

225
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,180
I'm sorry but I do need to get that
through Number 10 before
I can do anything.

226
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,740
Was Terri in the meeting earlier?

227
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Yeah, she was Fergus.
I know she was there

228
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,340
because I heard her humming
the theme to Call The Midwife.

229
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,980
Yes, well, Stewart was
very clear about this protocol.

230
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,380
It's about the only thing
he has been clear about.

231
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,020
The policy has been agreed.

232
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,620
This is just an additional
publicity push.

233
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,220
Adam, I'm sorry if you think
I'm being obstructive

234
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,380
but I cannot and I
will not do as you ask.

235
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,420
Well, you can't stop me, Terri, OK?
You cannot win, Nurse Ratched,

236
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,860
because this is my moment.

237
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,300
Now, you like musicals. Well, this
is Tonight from West Side Story,

238
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,620
And I am going to bring
the bloody house down

239
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,660
so you can't rain on
my parade, funny girl!

240
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,740
Why don't you go and have
a lie down and a Hob Nob

241
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,940
while we run the
fucking country, all right?

242
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,460
Anything else?

243
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,540
No, don't think so.

244
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,700
Thank you, Minister.

245
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,660
Did you see me being deliberately
less professional than usual?

246
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,540
You'll be gone by midday.

247
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,020
Yes! Thank God.

248
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,740
I don't understand,

249
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,460
what's the difference between
upload and download?

250
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,460
Er, well you download porn
although you could upload porn

251
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,940
but you'd have to, you have
to make some porn first.

252
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,220
Does it have to be porn? Is it
compulsory? Look, please, guys,
can you stop saying porn?

253
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
Did you say porn? Porn?

254
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,700
What's he doing?
Projecting it onto the building?

255
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,180
Is he on top of everything?

256
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,300
Mentioning pornography's
a definite no-no.

257
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,780
Oh, really(?) OK,
so maybe I'll tell him

258
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,980
not to big up any jihad sites either
or give out the PM's email address?

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,700
Does he understand the policy?
Forgive my concern

260
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,740
but it's a bit like asking if a dog
can grasp the concept of Norway.

261
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,820
'Thanks, Terri, that's very helpful,
bye.' Does he understand the...?

262
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,700
Oh, she's hung up.
Ever the charmless minor royal.

263
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,180
And I keep a straight face, do I,

264
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,980
when I say to a room full of
frog spawn, "Upload your future?"

265
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,340
That sounds great.
No pronunciation traps.

266
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,860
You know what happened to
the Chancellor at the Brits.

267
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,380
Tinny Tempah.
It could have been worse,

268
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,940
I heard he opened his
stag do speech with "Ma niggaz."

269
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,140
Oh, I can't get my head round
this whole digital dividend element.

270
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,620
Kids design apps,
whatever the hell they are.

271
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,860
Don't say, "What are apps?"

272
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,820
He knows what an app is. That Ocado
thing I put on your iPhone's an app.

273
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,020
And the On This Day in Jazz History
thing I gifted you. You love that.

274
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,860
The best thing is you just stick
with that. "I call app Britain."

275
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,340
"I call up Britain."

276
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,700
"I call app Britain." App.
"I call app Britain."

277
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,100
"I call app Britain."

278
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,340
Is there some whistle Fergus
blows that only you can hear?

279
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,900
It's called being wanted, Terri.

280
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,940
Right, he can go for a start.

281
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,060
He makes more noise breathing
than he does fucking talking.

282
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,060
What the fuck does a Statistical
Procurement Officer do anyway?

283
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,380
Fuck all. Same as the rest of them.

284
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,820
Speaking of which, Glenn.

285
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,580
Always on the horizon like
a fucking Antony Gormley statue.

286
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,740
Arms outstretched covered in rust.
Just let it go to voicemail.

287
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,340
No, his messages are always
so long and pleading. Hi, Glenn?

288
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,580
Where have you two gone?

289
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,740
We thought we'd go through
the redundancies

290
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,060
away from the dead-eyed stare
of the zombie army.

291
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,140
Ah, good thinking, yeah.

292
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,700
Look, I could help prioritise
that kill list, you know?

293
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,900
There are some people who want out.
Terri for instance.

294
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,420
'Oh, that's no problem,
Mannion fucking hates her.'

295
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,340
It's one of the few things
that brings us together.

296
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,700
Is that a fruit machine I hear?

297
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,140
'Are, are you in the local?'

298
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,940
Erm, no.

299
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,020
Yes.

300
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,140
Right, OK, I'll be
with you in ten. Walkies.

301
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,340
And erm, Ferg, mine's
a G and a slimline T, OK?

302
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,580
See you in a mo.

303
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,740
Why is it that
Silicon Valley is in America

304
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,980
when we have so many
net-savvy tech heads here?

305
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,220
They may have the silicon chip,

306
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,220
but, er, we have the silicon chap.

307
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,900
And of course, chap-esses. Er, er,

308
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,700
and we want you to design
game apps for use in the classroom.

309
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,180
Sorry to interrupt,
erm, it's not game apps,

310
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,820
we're actually looking
for educational apps.

311
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,100
Erm, of, of course.

312
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,420
That's...that's why I'm here
to say, I call you up, app,

313
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,260
I...I call app Britain.

314
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,260
Yes. And...and everyone
will benefit.

315
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,980
Not...not financially, er,
not cash in hand, of course.

316
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,180
All profits will be stored as part
of a digital dividend. Which...

317
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,580
Are you saying that if I wrote an
app I wouldn't get any money for it?

318
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,020
I would be working for free?

319
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,140
If you don't mind we'll
keep the Q&A to the end.

320
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,460
What...what I wanted to...

321
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,420
Sorry, why can't you just
answer him now? Charlotte.

322
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,380
The other lady was
allowed to interrupt.

323
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,020
Yes, but...but she's my lady.

324
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,460
LAUGHTER

325
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,340
What...what...what...what...
what was your question again?

326
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,700
Why won't we profit from this?

327
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, but you would. Er, maybe
I didn't explain it properly.

328
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,740
What, what's your name? Rajesh.

329
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm sorry?

330
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,980
Rajesh, Raj.

331
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,060
Well, erm...

332
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,540
Rajesh Raj, erm...

333
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,180
GIGGLING

334
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,980
Right.

335
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,660
Well, erm, what I...

336
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,420
what I wanted to say is that
you would erm...er...profit,

337
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,100
err, that any profits you made

338
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,980
would be, erm, offset
against tuition fees...

339
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,340
Sorry, we don't believe
in tuition fees.

340
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,020
Well, err, what's...? Charlotte.

341
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,700
That's an easier one.

342
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,220
Fuck me, I feel like I've just
been pushed out of a plane.

343
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,220
I make apps, I sell them through
Apple and I get paid for it.

344
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
Good for you, Ra...
erm, good for you,

345
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,540
but, but, but with us,

346
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,780
you let us license it as part of
the networked nation policy.

347
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,940
We all put in, you see... What do
you put in to the networked nation?

348
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,620
Well, erm...

349
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,020
I am...

350
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,580
a minister.

351
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,660
But what do you actually do?

352
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,140
I, er...take the...the...

353
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,900
..science that, that
you made earlier and I...

354
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,540
..apply it in...

355
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,660
..scenarios that are...

356
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,060
cost effective.

357
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,500
Well, at least I got
"I call app Britain," right.

358
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,660
Thankfully with only a modicum
of the contempt you used just now.

359
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,260
Hooray! You got the title
right. Let's get the driver

360
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,940
to do some victory doughnuts. You're
going to have to issue an apology.

361
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,780
I'm not going back there and saying,
"Oh, that moment when I mistook

362
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,380
"an abbreviation of your name
for your surname, sorry."

363
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,820
I'll look completely mental.

364
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,260
You can't apologise for
a fart you did a day ago.

365
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,700
You have to apologise
for the follow up as well.

366
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,300
"Charlotte, that's an easier name."

367
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,820
But it is! That's a fact,
not a judgement!

368
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,540
Great, Stewart. Stewart, hello.
'Can I speak to Peter, please?'

369
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,980
I wish your friend had an app

370
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,380
that would deliver Stewart
a dead cat in a box. Stewart.

371
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,620
Congratulations, Peter.

372
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,860
Silicon Playgrounds has now been
dubbed Mannion's Workhouse Web.

373
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,860
Well, it's not my fault if they
misinterpreted something

374
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,620
that I said I never understood.

375
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,700
Oh for fuck's... I literally
can't believe this man.

376
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,380
Is he trying to get sacked?

377
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,100
What he's done is close to
resting his cock on his
boss's wife's shoulder.

378
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,540
So, who's going to be
Santa Claus, eh? What?

379
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,620
Who's getting the sack?
Oh, for fu...!

380
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,340
I need to get back to DoSAC.
I was looking forward to my G&T.

381
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,980
Why don't you stay here
and creep out the barmaid?

382
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,220
Use your unplucked flower line.

383
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,340
Peter Mannion just
got the name wrong, that's...

384
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,860
Well, names are very difficult.

385
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,220
Sometimes people spell Terri with
a Y not an I but I don't complain.

386
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,620
Yes, all right I do complain but...

387
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,900
Coverley comms.

388
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,980
Heads up, OK, just keep moving.
Minister, can we get a comment

389
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,700
on the secretary's
speech this morning?

390
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,980
Is it true you're planning
for young children to work

391
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,140
designing apps for free?

392
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,060
I understand the...the Secretary
of State made...made a speech.

393
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,220
Obviously I...I haven't
seen that speech.

394
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,740
He said profits would be
offset against tuition fees

395
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,620
which implies pupils will be
working for their education.

396
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Let me be very clear the digital
dividend element of this scheme

397
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,660
is optional. If they prefer
pupils can be paid in cash.

398
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,540
So this isn't about turning
schools into workhouses then?

399
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,900
Erm, no. Maybe Peter did
come across as more of a...

400
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,820
fibre-optic Fagin than he
might have intended. Thank you.

401
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
REPORTERS SHOUT

402
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,540
Minister, other way, other way,
other way, other way.

403
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,620
Minister, why are you at home
in the middle of a working day?

404
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,860
Erm, it's...it's my
30th anniversary

405
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,380
and I popped home for lunch after
the Silicon Playgrounds launch

406
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,700
which is literally round the corner

407
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,860
and I'll be staying late
to make up for it.

408
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,580
Are you turning schools
into teenage sweatshops?

409
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,380
I...I...I'm sorry if this
is proving a complex idea.

410
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,700
Pupils will receive

411
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,940
a digital dividend towards
their higher education fees.

412
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,780
The dividend is optional, though.
You can get cash instead?

413
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,460
No, you can't. I'm sorry.
We're quoting your junior minister.

414
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,500
I see. Minister, do you think
you came across this morning

415
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,420
as a fibre-optic Fagin?

416
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,660
That's a ridiculous phrase.

417
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,260
Well, that again is a quote
from your junior minister.

418
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,140
Minister, is that
a bottle of champagne?

419
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,260
Drinking on the job, Minister?
It...It's a...a half bottle.

420
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,380
As I said, it is my anniversary
and I have just recycled it.

421
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,540
Er, thank you.

422
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,460
Less of a Fagin and more of an
Artful Dodger, is that what this is?

423
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,780
Run those fuckers over.
50 quid for every one you maim.

424
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,420
I've got a blank page. You dictate.

425
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,300
It should have been done
like, an hour ago.

426
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,980
Thanks a fucking bunch, mate!

427
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,740
I couldn't have looked
more of a twat

428
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,860
unless I'd announced it dressed as
a mermaid with scallops on my tits.

429
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,700
I'm angry too, Peter. I spent
a lot of time on that policy

430
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,500
that you just raped in a ditch.
Your stupid idea in the first place.

431
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,900
What are your ideas, Peter?
We'd love to hear them!

432
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,940
A public information film on
the best wine to have with fish?

433
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,620
A butler on every street corner?

434
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,500
This is a long game, Fergus. I've
been around a lot longer than you

435
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,060
and I'll still be here when
they rip your name off your door

436
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,260
and turn your office back
into something useful

437
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,380
like a spare toilet.
Both of you desist!

438
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,260
You have caused me to raise
my voice and I do not like it.

439
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,980
I reserve this level of anger
for when I'm flying Ryanair.

440
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,300
Peter's palace, now!

441
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,100
Drinking champagne in the middle
of the day during a recession!

442
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,900
Who do you think you are? P Diddy?

443
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,620
It was a half bottle
on my 30th anniversary

444
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,540
and I was recycling it.
At least give me credit for that.

445
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,860
Sorry, Peter, I take it all back.
As strong a defence

446
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,100
as the fertiliser in my
home-made bomb was organic!

447
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,660
What have you got planned
for this evening, dancing girls?

448
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,340
Garage, car, hosepipe.

449
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,820
The anniversary present
your wife's been dreaming of.

450
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,300
Fergus, what about you?

451
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,580
I'm launching Silicon Playgrounds
properly at a learning centre.

452
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,100
Something you didn't clear
through me! You announced this

453
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,340
before Peter took
his daily gaffe dump.

454
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,180
What was the word
I used this morning?

455
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,980
You used a lot of words. It was
like a fucking Will Self lecture.

456
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,420
What was the word I used?

457
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,980
Coalition. Boom! So you will
go to the learning centre

458
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,420
where you will re-explain
Silicon Playgrounds

459
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,940
with Peter who will make
an abject grovelling apology

460
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,260
for being a both a digitard
and an elderly racist.

461
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,900
So first you take the policy
away from me for Peter to screw up,

462
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,860
then you take salvaging the policy
away from me for Peter to screw up.

463
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,500
Good yeah, that's just great(!)

464
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,740
I'm bored of this.
I'm going for a Twix.

465
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,740
Adam's coming. Oh, not on my watch.

466
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,140
Oh, here we go. You shall not pass.

467
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
You couldn't keep
the cast of Glee out.

468
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,620
Is Peter sharing a car with Fergus?

469
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,860
Wait here, I'll check.
Yes go, run many miles.

470
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,940
Make heart soar like eagle.

471
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,700
Prick.

472
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,220
Peter says he's sorry but he doesn't
have any child seats fitted.

473
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,780
Oh, Really? OK, kids,
Raj can make it for eight o'clock.

474
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,660
What's going on?
Have you two just kissed?

475
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,380
Give him this, final list of
staff cuts. Needs his signature.

476
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,140
If it makes him happier, he can
pretend he's sectioning you.

477
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,580
Sure, but tonight Dobby
does not ride with Dumbledore.

478
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,060
Oh, fucking hell. Brilliant(!)

479
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,380
Does he have any references based in
reality? Listen, don't fuck about.

480
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,340
Just make sure Fergus gets Peter
to the church on time, OK?

481
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,820
All right, get a boyfriend.

482
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,380
Oh, come out.

483
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,540
She's not on the fucking list!

484
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,940
Will you please tell me why
Terri Coverley is not on this list?

485
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,460
Sorry Peter, she's too
expensive to get rid of.

486
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,780
Christ, Fergus we both know
she's a fart in a frock

487
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,460
and I want to waft it out of here.

488
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,660
My hands are tied.

489
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,580
Fuck you! You're not
getting in my car tonight!

490
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,780
What a very principled
stand you're taking.

491
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
Did you see how stressed
Mannion was there?

492
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,820
Soon he'll be so weak
and disorientated

493
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,140
he'll stagger off in the night like
a tramp who's stood up too quickly.

494
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,580
No, I don't think today is our
entire marriage in a nutshell.

495
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,580
Well, we had champagne

496
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,180
and your sister wasn't there.

497
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,260
All I'm saying is that
sometimes it's necessary

498
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,940
to lose the battle
in order to win the war.

499
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,580
Or lose your mind to believe
all the crap you come out with.

500
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,100
Ah here he is, the King of Sheba.

501
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,060
Er, Terri. Sorry, do you
mind holding...? Jesus.

502
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,340
Just pass it to me.
Why don't you get in the front?

503
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,820
We can't all get...
No inconvenience at all. Budge up.

504
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,060
I...I think you'd be more
comfortable in the front.

505
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,700
It's not a problem in any way.

506
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,620
Minister, ministers is it true
that you hate each other?

507
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,220
Not at all. Of course,
we're not strangers to
a frank exchange of views.

508
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,940
Have you been forced
to come here together?

509
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,620
I think I can say in all candour
that no one could force me

510
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,420
to stand next to this man.

511
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,780
Ah, Raj. Thank you
so much for coming.

512
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,260
Raj.

513
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,500
Good to see you, Peter Pete.

514
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,500
Err, I'd like to thank
er, er, Raj here

515
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,660
for pointing out
the flaws in Fergus's

516
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,140
and, and my
Silicon Playground scheme.

517
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,540
Yeah, and we'd love you to
become a silicon player, Raj.

518
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,100
Help us nail it, yeah?
Yeah, sure, if you pay me.

519
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,740
Can you get me a
chicken and cashew nut?

520
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,100
Get your usual order,
dead dog's dicks.

521
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,660
They're still down at the centre.

522
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,820
No, my children, not them
I'm looking for but you.

523
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,180
I thought while they were
dovetailing we might chat the chit.

524
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,460
There's no reason why we
can't go bigger on this.

525
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,500
With the spread of computer
literacy across all demographics.

526
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,140
We could be having silicon pubs,
silicon prisons,

527
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,660
silicon care homes.

528
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,980
I mean this way we really would
have a networked nation guys.

529
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,300
Silicon banks. Silicon hospitals.
Silicon buses.

530
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,140
Err, silicon phones,
silicon lights, silicon plants...

531
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,700
No, Phil, don't just
say what you fucking see.

532
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,060
Why don't we hive mind on this?
Get our best brains on it.

533
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,940
Adam come and join us.
Phil, go make us some ginseng tea.

534
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,700
You're getting a coffwee,
coffee with wee in it.

535
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,780
So the core question here is
can we engender the same sense

536
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,100
of pan-demographic communalities
we had in the war,

537
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,780
but furrowed into
the digital revolution, hmm?

538
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,460
Do you have milk in ginseng?

539
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,380
No. Shit.

540
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,620
Simeon, hi.
Yeah he is, he's with me.

541
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,860
Number 10.
Apparently your phone's off.

542
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,060
That's because my mind is in give
mode not receive mode. Simeon, hi.

543
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,620
No, no, no, no, no, don't say that.

544
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,660
No, no don't drown the kitten here!

545
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,420
Look, we're cooking up the
Schlieffen plan for the mind here!

546
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,100
No, I'm sorry I don't believe
he said that. No.

547
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,180
OK.

548
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,940
OK, curious.

549
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,380
What's happened?

550
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,020
Silicon Playgrounds, erm... dead.

551
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,780
Too much confusion and negativity.

552
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,060
Says who? The PM.
Oh, for God's sake.

553
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,020
Interesting, he's never used a
conduit to deliver bad news before.

554
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,660
Sorry should I not have left
the bags in? No, they look lovely.

555
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,260
Are you all right, Stewart,
can I...?

556
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,340
No, I'm erm, I am... I'm going to
go and rest my eyes on the river.

557
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,300
He touched me. OK.

558
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,020
Well, landmark day.

559
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,460
We bring in an idea,
you like it, you nick it,

560
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,740
you put two bullets
in the back of its head.

561
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,340
Snuff politics, you've got to laugh.

562
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,180
It's good to see Stewart lost
for multi syllables though.

563
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,580
Have you ever seen him
like that before? Never.

564
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,580
He took the morning off
when Steve Jobs died.

565
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,860
But otherwise,
been seven years of ear piss.

566
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,420
Ah, look at us, Fergus
We're such good friends.

567
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,820
It's like Ike and Tina Turner.
Or Caligula and his horse.

568
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,980
This will cheer you up.

569
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,700
Your boss has chucked
Silicon Playgrounds down a well

570
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,500
and poured a bucket
of shit after it.

571
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,220
Whole day, it's been
an excruciating waste of time.

572
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,660
Am I...am I needed?

573
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,100
We'll get back to you on that.

574
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,460
We can stop pretending
to like each other now.

575
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,660
Maybe it would be better
if we actually did try to get on

576
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,900
rather than just pretending.

577
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,500
Maybe it would.

578
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,260
Have a good, erm...

579
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,620
what's left of the evening.

580
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,340
Thanks.

581
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,940
OK, darling I'm on my way.

582
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,140
Finally got rid of
Captain fucking Scarlet.

583
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,940
DoSAC please Martin.

584
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,340
Terri, hi, it's Glenn.

585
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,380
Silicon Playgrounds has been
axed and so's your evening!

586
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,860
They want you to come in and draft
a press release. And by draft I mean

587
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,300
work on it all night.

588
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,020
Oh, no.

589
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,380
Looks like he's
going back to DoSAC.

590
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,860
I'm sorry Tina I'm going
to have to turn round.

591
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,660
Are you about to head off?

592
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,380
I'm sorry it should be...

593
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,300
11 at the latest.

594
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,980
Could, could, could you just put

595
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,420
something eggy on a tray for me?

596
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,420
And...and then we will

597
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,860
snuggle, I promise.

598
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,380
The Leader of the Opposition
is in that room, Malcolm,

599
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,380
practicing walking. It does seem
to be taking an awfully long time.

600
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,140
Is that too bouncy?
It's Remembrance Sunday!

601
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,660
We haven't got any fucking power.

602
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,420
We're like a family in a Cuban slum.

603
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:36,780
It's important that we rise above
partisan politics, Dan.

604
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,060
So that, Dan...

605
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,780
I feel like I should put
the poppy wreath around my neck

606
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,060
and take 40 paracetamol.
