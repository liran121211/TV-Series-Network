00:00:01,894 --> 00:00:06,732
I'm finding Mr Tickel's  attention seeking tent-based
twattery even more annoying than weeks one and two.

3
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:11,092
Peter Mannion has been picking on
a man with a history of depression.

4
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:14,812
I call app Britain. App. I call
app Britain. I call app Britain.

5
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:17,292
Silicone playgrounds are, is, go.

6
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:20,252
I just hope Mannion can keep
his baccy stained fingers out of it.

7
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,132
I call you up, app...

8
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:27,053
I couldn't have looked more of a twat
unless I'd announced it dressed as
a mermaid with scallops on my tits!

9
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:30,212
I was picked up at 7.
Of course I haven't walked the dog.

10
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:32,011
I barely had time to take myself
for a shit.

11
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:34,253
Phil, I'm sure you have
Peter withdrawal symptoms

12
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,932
but I need you
to keep an eye on the Tickel issue.

13
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:41,252
Thought camp ETA 13 minutes, OK?
You're taking the bridge, Kieran.

14
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:44,972
You can start by not referring
to him as gypo or gypsy, Phil.

15
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:47,492
It's not the abbreviation
that's the problem.

16
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:50,892
If he has a thorn in his paw
it must be from when you took him
for a walk yesterday.

17
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:53,613
What do you mean, you're in charge?
You are not in fucking charge.

18
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,173
You've got to keep me informed.

19
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:58,732
I want the full crunch
on all the feeds as usual,
everything below the equator.

20
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,892
Take him to the dog hospital.

21
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,772
No, I'm not being sarcastic.
There is one.

22
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:08,452
The number will be in the folder.
Try and keep an eye on things,
right? Bile... Mm, what?

23
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:12,492
Where are you taking us, Stewart?
This mind Kampf is in
the middle of nowhere.

24
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:17,492
Thought camp, Peter, and isolation
is the mother of renewal.
We shall retreat to go forward.

25
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:22,052
Terrible signal.
Phil sounded like he was phoning in
a report on an African coup.

26
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:26,572
Why's he even gone in today?
I put him on Tickel oversight.
Oh, the eviction.

27
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:30,772
Well, cutting the guy ropes on
his tent is hardly the siege of Troy.

28
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,652
Bailiffs thought it would
be easier today, quicker or quieter.

29
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:38,692
I want Phil sealed off, right?
He makes no statement today,
not even off the record.

30
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:41,532
He wanted to feel useful.
Then he should sell his organs.

31
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:44,572
Glenn. What?
What the fuck are you doing here?

32
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:46,732
Oh, God, you're not living here,
are you?

33
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:50,292
Oh, no. I've just go some stuff
I've got to catch up on.

34
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:52,693
Plus one of my neighbours is having
a rooftop barbecue

35
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:55,692
and I didn't fancy being bombarded
with chicken bones and Radio 1.

36
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:58,532
Anyway, why aren't you
on Stewart's away day?

37
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:01,812
Drinking herbal tea
and playing leapfrog?
I told Stewart where to get off.

38
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:05,492
Yeah, well, we've got
the whole palace to ourselves, eh?
Rosencratz and Guildenstern.

39
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,732
But very much alive.
Well, one of us.

40
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,812
I'll put the kettle on.
Sure.

41
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:11,452
Easy on the milk, Shaky Hands.

44
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:22,892
This is like some weird
inverted Dodge City.

45
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:27,612
Presumably we're allowed to keep
our six shooters. I might want
to blow my brains out.

46
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:30,572
Stewart, my son's coming back
from a school trip

47
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:33,452
and I'm gonna need to find out
what time the coaches are arriving.

48
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,213
Sorry, Mary,
same rules for everyone.

49
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,292
Reception will take a message,
yeah,

50
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:40,332
but I mean we all have children,
yeah? I don't literally but...

51
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:44,213
OK, lovely people.
Let's go truffling
in the forest of knowledge.

52
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,892
Come on, quick. Quick.
Fuck, fuck, it's hot.

53
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,452
Jesus Christ. What's happened?

54
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:52,411
Is this the start of some zombie
apocalypse?

55
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:53,851
What are you guys doing in?

56
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:56,013
Well, work comes first with me,
Adam. You know that.

57
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:58,852
Protestant ethic.
Not that I'm at all anti-Catholic.

58
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,652
You're in for...?
A meeting with Fergus.

59
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,052
Heads up. Lady and the Tramp are in,
too.

60
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:08,092
Yeah, I know. Cheers.
Just make sure you copy me in
on any minutes. OK.

61
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:09,932
How about you copy that, yeah?

62
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:12,452
Cos it's party business.
It's not ministerial.

63
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,932
The meeting is in the department.

64
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,092
While Peter is absent,
I'm his surrogate - the king's hand.

65
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,852
Yeah. Finish him off with that hand
as well, do you?

66
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:23,172
Prick.

67
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:26,933
I may... I may be needed.
I've been needed in the past.

68
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:32,052
OK, people. I'd like to start
this session with a question.

69
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:35,452
When is a party not a party?

70
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:38,212
When it's at your house?
Peter!

71
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:41,052
A party is not a party
when it is plural.

72
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,772
There she is, the party, singular.

73
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:46,492
She thinks like you, she votes
like you, she is not you

74
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,212
and yet of course she is you.

75
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:51,452
I feel like
I've joined the Scientologists.

76
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:54,492
Some of these people want
a federal Britain, others don't,

77
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:58,692
and as long as
we continue to do nothing
we can call that consensus.

78
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:02,492
Why am I the only senior minister
here? Is JB punishing me?

79
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,612
Look, Mary Drake's here,
Home Office.

80
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,012
And yes, JB is punishing you.

81
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:11,292
OK, let's, let's Maclntyre this.
Stand up.

82
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,852
Maclntyre?
In fact, chairs to the side, please.

83
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:18,132
Great, vague prancing about.

84
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,492
Isn't that one of the fundamental
principles of democracy?

85
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:25,812
Oh, I'm sorry, Peter, do you want
to share your thoughts? Hmm?

86
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:29,252
No, we just hoped we were going
to do some dancing, er, Stewart.

87
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,652
What, Merce Cunningham,
something like that?

88
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:33,971
OK, maybe later you can share it
with us. Fabulous.

89
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,933
But first, let me share
something with you.

90
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,772
Silicone Playgrounds, yeah?

91
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:43,652
What caused this slow motion
pile up? Shall we sit down
and chew over hash tag epic fail

92
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:45,813
or shall we try and get
some solutions on their feet?

93
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:48,732
That's it just put it at the side,
Peter.

94
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:53,452
I was hoping to catch the snooker
after I've finished collating
those healthy workplace stats.

95
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:55,373
Just down there.
Glenn, you're a marvel.

96
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:59,852
You're like a modern day Jeeves.
Only not modern... day.

97
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:02,892
You're like Jeeves
but only not as good.

98
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:05,172
This meeting, is it something
I should be in on?

99
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:08,932
Well, it's not really a meeting,
it's more sort of faces
with lips making noise.

100
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,012
Uh-huh.
Sounds like a meeting.

101
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:13,213
Yeah, well you know,
Fergus just called someone in

102
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:15,412
for a... for an exploratory chat.
Right.

103
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,053
Stop Slytherin getting wind of it.

104
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,052
Oh, hang on. I've got to go.

105
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,213
You need to get back to your telly?
It takes a while to warm up,
doesn't it?

106
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,972
Here we are at the coal face.

107
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:28,772
Ah, Adam, this is Tara Strachan.

108
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,692
Hello, lovely to meet you. Hi there.
Really lovely, lovely.

109
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:35,492
Shall we...? Just... Thank you.
She's an economist and a lady.

110
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:39,252
Yes, obviously. Lovely. Ahem.
What's going on? Who's the skirt?

111
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,571
I'd love to bring you up to speed,
Phil, I really would,

112
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,373
but I'm not going to live
long enough.

113
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:46,452
So tell you what? Why don't you go
and help Glenn watch his telly?

114
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:48,452
I think the dancing's on
in a minute.

115
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,452
I really like your coat, by the way.
Thank you.

116
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:53,772
It's like a leopard.
It is a little bit. Or a cheetah.

117
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:59,132
Am I supply-side economics?
No. Oh, bugger.

118
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:04,492
OK, Mary, you've got to help Peter
work out what political concept
he is. You have one guess left.

119
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:07,132
Keep the energy up, guys.
Chins up, yeah.

120
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,853
Am I a solid, sensible concept?
No.

121
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:17,492
The beauty of this model... Yeah.
..Is that micro banking can
happen anywhere, OK?

122
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:21,052
Great. Small, low interest
loans, that's the way forward.

123
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:24,372
This is terrific, I mean,
it's so fucking us it's brilliant.

124
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:26,012
Adam! Adam!

125
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:29,332
Oh, don't worry, I don't mind
swearing. Shows passion.

126
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,892
I've done some community
enterprise case studies.

127
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,492
Sisters who want to set up a pop-up
bakers in a disused travel agents.

128
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,813
The boiler guy who wants to take on
an apprentice.

129
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:42,332
Yeah. The helping hand
for hands-on people.

130
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,092
Yeah. I like that, that's great,
that's really good.

131
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:48,373
Making sure the can-doers
don't get canned.

132
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,853
Terrific, yeah, really good.

133
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:54,812
Would I be comfortable
or uncomfortable...?

134
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,533
Yes or no questions only, please,
Peter.

135
00:06:56,534 --> 00:07:03,172
Would I be uncomfortable
talking to Andrew Marr
about this concept on the television?

136
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,852
Yes.

137
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,372
Am I diversity?
No.

138
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,693
You're out of questions, Peter.

139
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:14,292
Oh, for fuck's sake. Inclusivity's
practically the same as diversity.

140
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,532
No, it's not.
No, it isn't, Peter.

141
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,092
I could be at home
watching the snooker with
a bottle of unpronounceable scotch.

142
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:21,652
Can I sit down now?

143
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:23,572
I'm sitting down, I don't care.

144
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,812
Actually we can all sit down now.
Thanks, Peter.

145
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:30,092
So take a chair because Emma's going
to co-steer module 4 with me.

146
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:35,212
We're gonna do a kind of
Top Trumps stats check
on the PM's future enemies, yeah?

147
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:38,052
Strengths, weaknesses,
blocking moves and take downs.

148
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,012
Em. Great, thank you, Stewart.

149
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:43,652
You've turned into
the wrong Mitford sister.

150
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:48,132
Basically, we'd set up a network
of micro-credit lenders
at neighbourhood level.

151
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,612
This is great.
So what would it be called?
Like the Citizens' Bank or...?

152
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:54,972
The People's Bank.
Erm, community... The credit fund.

153
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,612
No, no, credit's a bad word.
Negative.

154
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,332
Something with advance. The We Bank.

155
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,092
The We Bank? I like that.

156
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:07,213
Although it does sound a bit like
a sperm bank but for wee.

157
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:11,052
Bit of a farce going on here
with your Mr Tickle.

158
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:13,772
They've turned up to evict him
and he's not there.

159
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,212
Good, self-evicted.
Gone. Problem solved.

160
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,132
Anyway, what's going on with Fergus
and Adam and the sexy stranger?

161
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,772
She's an economist, apparently.

162
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:23,093
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
she's far too attractive.

163
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,852
You can get sexy economists.
What about Stephanie Flanders?

164
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:29,252
Yeah, that's true.
I quite like Emily Maitlis.

165
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:32,332
Really? Oh, I'm sure
she'd love a grey pounding.

166
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,132
Do you want to have an idea-gasm?
Yes, please.

167
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:42,412
Ask me how we'd initially fund this?
How would we initially fund this?
How would we initially fund this?

168
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,292
A one-off Robin Hood tax.

169
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:46,252
Steal from the fat cats,

170
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:51,132
raise enough seed capital
for hundreds of start-up funds
for fledgling businesses.

171
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:53,213
You know what? This could work
really well for us.

172
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,812
This... This is... Yeah.

173
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:57,292
Yeah? I mean, let's just talk
figures.

174
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:00,212
What sort of start-up capital
are we talking here? Erm...

175
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:03,332
Not very much. I think we're looking
at about 2 billion.

176
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,492
2 billion. 2 billion.

177
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:09,172
Good. I erm... Well, obviously,
I'd have to ring the Treasury.

178
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,932
Sure. And twist a few arms.
You know, it'll take a couple
of weeks to work out

179
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:18,532
but we are extremely keen
to set that process in motion.

180
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,052
Nicola Murray. We're assuming
she's on her way out.

181
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,732
That's a given. She's
a political accident nobody
can quite remember how it happened.

182
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,772
Contender one - Ben Swain.

183
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:33,012
Now, ABC1's over-thirties consider
him shifty and unfocused.

184
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:34,972
Can't think why that is.

185
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:39,652
Geoff Holhurst. Tiny head.
Yeah, an Achilles head.

186
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:42,812
Ah, Dan Miller,
definitely our anti-fave.

187
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:49,452
Charming, charismatic, clever,
dedicated and phwoar, God, he's hot.

188
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:50,932
Yes, thanks, Em.

189
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:54,572
OK, let's architecturalise this,
yeah? Oh, don't bother.

190
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:59,612
If it's Ben Swain,
we all shout "sweaty Swain" as
he dehydrates himself through PMQs.

191
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:02,932
Holhurst looks like a shepherd
dressed up to meet the Queen

192
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:05,372
and if it's Dan Miller we're fucked.

193
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:09,972
I should tell you
I do also have a meeting
with Dan Miller booked in.

194
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:14,372
What? I would just knock that
right on the head, don't do it.

195
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:19,332
Well, he's in opposition, we rule.

196
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,492
We're the rulers,
we're the governors.

197
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:28,333
And in the end, this is so
fucking us. Fuck, yeah. Yeah.

198
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,852
Here, Tara Strachan, LSE, Harvard,

199
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:34,013
author of Strapped:
Why We're In Debt To Each Other,

200
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,572
Small Is Bountiful,
expert in micro financing

201
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,492
and community credit guilds.

202
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:41,372
God, that sounds dreary. Bloody
hell, that's all 4th sector stuff.

203
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,853
I mean, why have they kept me
out here like a stray dog?

204
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:46,252
And why are they keeping Mannion
out of it?

205
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,853
This is government business.

206
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:53,732
Right, that's enough, stop, stop,
stop. I demand an explanation.

207
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,172
Sorry, Phil, we're busy.

208
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,093
Maybe come back in, I don't know,
2017?

209
00:10:57,094 --> 00:11:00,932
As Peter's representative,
it's as though you lied to him.
That's probably illegal.

210
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:04,692
If you want to see something
probably illegal, pass me
that fucking stapler over there.

211
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:06,851
Er, listen is there a problem
with me being here?

212
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:08,253
You're not supposed to be here.

213
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:11,132
The minister is unaware
that you're here,
so you have to leave.

214
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:16,292
So she's a security risk?
Oh, no - I'd forgotten. You're not
allowed within 50 feet of a woman.

215
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:19,652
How d'you explain this, then?
I'm within 50 feet of you.
You're a woman.

216
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,652
Oh, brilliant. That is really good.
Fuck! Tickle's dead!

217
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:25,173
Oh, shit. Jesus.

218
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:28,492
Oh, God, he's killed himself.
Suicide.

219
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:30,132
He used a car exhaust.

220
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,492
Hey, classic. The Bohemian Rhapsody
of suicides.

221
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,172
Oh, Phil, for fuck's sake.
I'm sorry, I just, you know...

222
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,332
I mean it's, it's...
It's good, in a way.

223
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,012
He was drawing attention
to an issue

224
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:43,213
and now he's not drawing attention
to it because...

225
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:46,732
Can you just turn it down, all
right, because we have somebody in?

226
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:47,893
I'm gonna ring Terri.

227
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,852
God, I was just ringing you.
I got a heads-up from Reuters

228
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:52,651
whilst I was planting
the dwarf irises.

229
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:54,373
This is gonna take
a lot of managing.

230
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:56,532
Who's that? No-one.
Ah, Minister, sorry.

231
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:59,692
Yes, I'm halfway through a draft.
Any minute. Thank you, Terri.

232
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:02,132
Is this the homeless nurse?
That's awful.

233
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,412
Er, yes, this is Mr Tickel,
it's a tragedy.

234
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,331
Homeless out of choice, right,
Fergus?

235
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:08,253
Er, now is really
not the time to...

236
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:10,772
This is a tragedy
and it's complicated.

237
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,772
Not complicated enough for you
to voice any public opposition.

238
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:17,012
Do you think we could not wash
our dirty linen in public?

239
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:18,572
I'm not the one who shat the bed.

240
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:20,692
Tara, could you give us two minutes?
Yeah.

241
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:23,532
This situation calls for
a black coffee
and my Bluetooth headset.

242
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,412
Do not touch that phone, Glenn.
That is a comms phone.

243
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,892
Erm... No filters, Emma. First
thoughts. We're policy jamming here.

244
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:33,452
OK, erm, 24/7 parliament.

245
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,892
Oh, sorry, a little bit
of mental housekeeping.

246
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:37,613
There is only positivity
in the circle.

247
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:41,492
When someone makes a suggestion,
we say, "yes and".

248
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,452
Yes and what?

249
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,292
We could, we could make a noise.

250
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:47,813
What noise
would you suggest, Mary?

251
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,692
Yes and

252
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:52,572
ho. Great. Let's run with that.
Yes and ho.

253
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,092
Thanks, Emma.
24/7 parliament.

254
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:57,292
Yes and ho.

255
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:01,612
Pay the unemployed
to drive ambulances. Yes and ho.

256
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:05,653
Free thermals for the elderly.
Yes and ho.

257
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:08,933
I'm just telling it straight.
Adam, the girl is still in
our office.

258
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,732
Well... Well, then,
let's get rid of her.

259
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,692
Well, ask her out, that'll do it.

260
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,931
Did you get her a tea?
What? Er, she needs a tea.

261
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:17,891
Well, get her a tea.
You get her a tea.

262
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:19,853
She's your girlfriend.
Get her a fucking tea.

263
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,772
I'm the minister. I don't even know
where tea is made. Make her a tea.

264
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:26,292
Could you make her a tea?
I'm in charge. You're not in charge.
I am in charge.

265
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:29,252
Get hold of Mannion. They need
to know about this. I am Mannion.

266
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:31,532
Hi. Sorry.

267
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,253
Can I get you anything?
A tea, coffee?

268
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:37,292
Oh, no, don't, don't worry, you
just... Sure? Yeah. OK, sit tight.

269
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:40,812
It's fine, the protest is over so it
solves the problem. It's gone away.

270
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:43,412
It's like there's a little
12-year-old boy in a suit

271
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,051
with a fucking light sabre
in his desk...

272
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:46,973
don't think I don't know
it's there...

273
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:50,452
running this department
when Mannion's away. Yeah?
It's a fucking joke.

274
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:53,372
No, it's not, no, it's not. Have you
seen Game of Thrones season 2? No.

275
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,093
Or Anakin Skywalker -
he was young.

276
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:57,812
Er, Frodo, in his thirties -
still young for a hobbit, you know?

277
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:01,412
I'm in charge because I'm a Jedi
and you're a fucking Ewok.

278
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:05,092
Right, what is the Ewok
position on this, then?

279
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:08,212
Free tea bags.
Yes and ho.

280
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,572
Free maternity leave
for people getting a puppy.

281
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,612
Yes and ho.

282
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,972
Obese Olympics.

283
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:18,332
Yes and ho.

284
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,172
The line from Stewart via Emma
was that I do nothing.

285
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,413
That was the one clear instruction
they gave me, OK?

286
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:27,332
We ignore him and he goes away.
He is dead. Which makes him
easier to ignore.

287
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,813
As a minister I should
at least express condolences.

288
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:33,372
That, that should come from Peter.
But he's not here. I am.

289
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,452
Has anyone seen my Bluetooth headset?

290
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:39,892
Look, I speak for Peter
and I say that we look guilty
if we say we're sorry he died.

291
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,732
I'll take that as a no.

292
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:43,732
Listen, Phil, I was a journalist,
OK?

293
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,172
Now, if you don't respond
you create a vacuum

294
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:47,852
that sucks in speculation

295
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,092
and then you can't respond -
you get sucked fucking inside out.

296
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,373
Look, Tickle wasn't
the Queen of people's hearts.

297
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:57,172
He was a twat in a tent.
Tick-EL! He was called Tick-EL!

298
00:14:57,173 --> 00:15:00,812
We drove a man to his death.
We are responsible for this.

299
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,412
Glenn, please, shush.

300
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:08,652
Do you think we could just pretend
to behave like compassionate
professionals in control,

301
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:11,652
just for once?
Yeah, OK, er...

302
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:14,332
Look, er, whatever the fallout
from today, megaphone Mary,

303
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,852
you brought her in,
she's your problem.

304
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:18,693
Right, fuck. Adam, we need to.

305
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:23,452
Could be...
Hang on they're coming back.
I'll ring you back.

306
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:26,812
Great stuff, Tara, we're going to
go ahead with the bank.

307
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,612
Yep, meeting's over. Don't you need
to talk to the Treasury?

308
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:34,292
Done that.
OK, well, let's talk details.

309
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:38,093
When it comes to interest rates,
there's still quite a lot...
Hey, don't talk us out of it.

310
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:42,092
You don't want to do that.
So, is this the green light?

311
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:44,612
Uh-huh, yep, £2 billion.

312
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:48,732
Oh, my God! Oh! Crikey. Ohh!
That's great.

313
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,812
Oh, right, OK! Oh, my God.
Great, great, terrific.

314
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:55,292
We'll be in touch. Thank you.
Lovely to meet you. Great.

315
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,052
What have we just green-lit?

316
00:15:57,053 --> 00:16:01,132
Well, we are starting
a community bank with £2 billion.

317
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,012
Right, is that the £2 billion
we keep in the biscuit tin?

318
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,692
This is just great,
this is just fucking great.

319
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:11,732
Oh... I hang around this moral
abattoir to do something exactly like
this and you shut me out.

320
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:15,252
So I'm spending
my bank holiday founding a bank?

321
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:18,412
I thought the point
about bank holidays is
that they're supposed to be shut.

322
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:20,693
You know, when we see
something we like we just buy it,

323
00:16:20,694 --> 00:16:22,292
that's the way we work round here.

324
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:25,212
I hope the Tickel situation is
all OK.

325
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:29,172
Well, it'll be fine.
Thank you. Great.
Lovely to meet you. See you soon.

326
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,093
Right.

327
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:38,813
Right, I'm in fucking charge
and I am going Nordic drama.

328
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:43,172
Adam, secure the economist. You get
Stewart and Mannion back here stat.

329
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:45,292
Brilliant, got that guys, yeah? OK?

330
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:47,532
Sure, I'll do it
your way for now, Fergus,

331
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,812
but they left me in charge
for a reason.

332
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:53,172
I bet you line up
all your action figures on the edge
of your bath, don't you?

333
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:58,173
One, I've got a shower and two,
they're still in the boxes.

334
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:04,252
Emma, it's Phil, same message
as before. Tickle's topped himself,
the press want me to respond,

335
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:06,692
so just fucking ring me, OK?

336
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,692
Have you got them?
No, everyone's ignoring me.

337
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,573
It's like the first year
of university.

338
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:13,012
Fuck it, the whole of university.

339
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:14,252
Jesus. Hello?

340
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:18,412
No, I can categorically say
that Peter Mannion will not
be resigning over this.

341
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,572
Thank you. Who was that?
World At One. I handled it.

342
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,852
You don't handle the World At One,
Phil. They're not stolen goods.

343
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:27,452
If you want to go
and play phones,
you can go down to the creche

344
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:30,212
where there's a big phone
with big boggly eyes

345
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,292
that go round and round
when you wheel it about.

346
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:33,892
Now piddle off.

347
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:36,932
We've got to put something out there,
Terri.

348
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,492
That boy is a simpleton.

349
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:41,253
Two hundred years ago they wouldn't
have let him milk a cow.

350
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:45,572
Jonty! Terri here
over at Hectic House.

351
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:48,572
No! No, Peter's not resigning!

352
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:52,092
Free apples.
Yes and ho.

353
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:55,373
Free coffins.
Yes and ho.

354
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,012
Reduce the deficit
with spending cuts.

355
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,292
Yes and ho.

356
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:05,932
Peter, Peter, I want to hear
new ideas ricocheting
off your sinuses like a pinball,

357
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:07,732
not just a 2-year-old slogan.

358
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,612
OK, Dr Jazz, let's hear it.

359
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:13,332
We do away with computers.

360
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,932
Yes and ho.
You idiot, that's fucking mental.

361
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:19,372
No blocking, Peter,
only counterpoint.

362
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:22,052
Do away with computers, what do
we think? How would it affect us?

363
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:26,172
Good idea, bad idea?
Good idea for me. I wouldn't get
any more of your fucking emails.

364
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,172
Try and stay cross-legged if you
can, Peter. Don't break the circle.

365
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:32,812
I'm 54, Stewart. My knees are fucked
and my patience is snapped.

366
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:35,612
Some of us had to go through this
hippy shit the first time around.

367
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:38,013
I'm not talking about selling
it to the electorate.

368
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:41,852
I'm talking about exploring it
within the free space of the circle.

369
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,732
OK, give me the ball. Give
me the ball. Give me the ball.

370
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,053
No.
Give me the fucking ball, Stewart.

371
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:52,852
Let's do away with you.
What?

372
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:55,652
Filters off, daddyo,
let it all hang out.

373
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:58,412
Just suppose your free-range,
no-consequences bullshit

374
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:01,852
was hugely entertaining when we were
in opposition and shitting money

375
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:05,092
but now that we're in government
and it's all gone a bit JG Ballard,

376
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,612
it's irrelevant and infantile.

377
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:07,893
Oh, very droll, Peter.

378
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:10,652
And maybe the reason you don't mind
handing your phone in

379
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:12,932
is that it doesn't ring as much
as it used to.

380
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:17,532
Oh, sorry, doesn't ring
as much as it used to, yes and ho.

381
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:21,292
Er, I'm sorry but does the sign
on the door say "do disturb"?

382
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,652
No. Sorry. It is urgent.

383
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:31,172
Your office says Peter Mannion and
Stewart Pearson should check their
phones and call back now, please.

384
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:35,412
Fine, well, you've,
you've burst the thought bubble,
erm, receptionist,

385
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:38,292
so that's great.
Thank you very much. Fantastic.

386
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:40,892
OK, everyone just take...

387
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,892
Sorry, is that a phone, Emma?

388
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:45,492
Er, hotline, Number 10.

389
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:48,172
It's just I'm amending
some boring policy drafts.

390
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:51,212
They're encrypted
but I've got to keep it on me.

391
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,332
And Stewart hasn't got one.

392
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,772
Want the opinion of an old lag?
Mannion will have to go.

393
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:00,932
Stick to policemen are
getting younger, Glenn.

394
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,932
Peter's going nowhere

395
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,333
and I don't mean that
in a Glenn's career kind of way.

396
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:09,452
I've seen a lot of people resign and
they're always happier afterwards.

397
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:11,573
You're thinking of lobotomies.

398
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:15,373
Peter resigns over my dead body.

399
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:20,252
Yes, yes.
That would be the ideal scenario.

400
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,332
It's probably just Phil, he's run
out of colouring books or something.

401
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,092
Anything to get out
of Stewart's think sphincter.

402
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,892
Hello, receptionist.
Could I have my phone, please?

403
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:33,452
Your name, sir? It's Stewart.
Stewart...? Stewart Pearson.

404
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:35,893
Peter Mannion,
mine's the old Nokia. It's engaged.

405
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:38,932
Yeah, thank you. Look, the one with
Stewart written on it.

406
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,612
No, nothing.
Just keep trying. It's engaged.

407
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:45,452
I can't get any reception.
No, you won't round here.

408
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:51,812
No reception at reception, we
always say. The best spot, sounds
stupid, is the children's play area.

409
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:52,973
Top of the slide.

410
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:56,732
Nothing.

411
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:01,533
God, I hate the country.
Get higher, you idiot.

412
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,932
That's it, that's it,
I've got something.

413
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,492
Download the intel, Peter.
Come on. Put it on speaker.

414
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:11,413
No. I've got loads of messages
from my wife and from Phil.

415
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,733
She's taking the dog to the hospital.
Oh, come on.

416
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,613
She's... She's had a long wait.

417
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:22,653
The wound in his paw's gone septic.
Oh, please, Peter, move on.

418
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:28,612
Tickle's dead. What? Tickle's dead.

419
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:30,973
OK, it's my turn on that signal,
Peter, get down.

420
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,492
Wait, I'm listening to
the fucking message.

421
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,932
I need to get this signal.
Just get down.

422
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:39,333
Stop being so childish.
Jesus Christ. Just get down, Peter.

423
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:44,212
I've got it, I've got it.
Playtime's over. Tickle's dead, OK?

424
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:47,372
Number 10's gone off-the-hook
mental. Take my phone
to call the PM.

425
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,532
Right, Phil's meeting us, he's going
to bring a shirt, suit and tie.

426
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:54,092
You are not going to arrive
looking like the manager
of an organic wine bar.

427
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:57,852
Right, come on, come on, come on!
Movement. Sh! Hello?

428
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:00,212
Update, Phil's intercepting Peter.

429
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:02,692
Everyone's coming back
here, half an hour.

430
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:05,852
Coverly, comms. Yeah, can you hold
on one second please?

431
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:08,693
ETA plus 30 minutes GMT.

432
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:14,492
Well, anyway,
Mannion has surely got to freeze
housing disposals now.

433
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:18,132
Yeah, on that point, Glenn, I wonder
if it might be at all helpful

434
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:24,012
if we collated every single
statement Mannion's made about
Tickle and the sell-off policy.

435
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:26,132
Yeah, as a sort of favour
to selected hacks,

436
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,012
put a bit of air between us
and the policy, a lot of air.

437
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,772
Adam, this is not the time
for party political point scoring.

438
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:34,892
At least let the body get cold.
Of course. Understood.

439
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:38,292
What was it...?
What was it Peter said
to those Welsh chartered surveyors?

440
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:41,812
"The health service should be
for care not subsidised housing."

441
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:42,893
Now, I mean, that is...

442
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:47,812
Jesus. Is this what we came into
politics for?

443
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,293
Yeah, that and the pussy.

444
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:57,332
What's that? I'm supposed
to be commenting on a suicide
not a fucking camel race.

445
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,773
It will balance out
the bad news. You know - yin-yang.

446
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:02,612
Jon Snow does it. I want Tickle's
movements over the last 24 hours

447
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:05,892
and I want
his complete mental health records
since he first sat on a potty.

448
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:08,812
Do you think you might need one
or two computers for that, Stewart?

449
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:11,492
We're going to try and dredge up
some fire-fighting strategy.

450
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,973
Absolutely. I'll top-load you
as soon as we arrive.

451
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,652
Yep, thanks. OK. All right. Bye.

452
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,613
Can I...?
Can I take the seatbelt off?

453
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,852
No, Peter.
Stewart, what are you doing?

454
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:21,772
It helps with the car sickness.

455
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:23,292
This is great, isn't it, Stewart?

456
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:27,812
A conference on crisis management
that's been scuppered
by an actual fucking crisis.

457
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:29,733
We don't even know
why he killed himself yet.

458
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:31,252
I mean, suicide, it's pathetic.

459
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:34,052
At least take some of your enemies
with you, that's a noble death.

460
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:36,331
This is going nuts.
So many questions being asked.

461
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,573
It started with why did Phil
bring a tie from the '90s?

462
00:23:38,574 --> 00:23:43,292
I brought an alternative.
But that's too far the other way.
It makes him look guilty.

463
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:46,732
How can he be guilty? He's got the
perfect alibi. He was at boot camp.

464
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,613
Oh! Brilliant, let's release that,
hey?

465
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:53,132
There's no actual blood on his hands
and he remembered to wipe
the fingerprints off the knife.

466
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,172
Look, you can wear my tie,
what about mine?

467
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,812
What's on your tie? Tintin moon
rockets. Oh, for fuck's sake.

468
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,452
It amazes me you ever found
your way out of your mother's womb.

469
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:03,732
Here he is! Minister!
Minister, does the government
have blood on its hands?

470
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,292
Are you resigning? Have you got
anything to say to the family?

471
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:09,852
Shouldn't you have done more,
Minister? Please! Not the trousers.

472
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:11,852
Let's show a little more decorum.

473
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:16,533
A man has died in tragic
and complicated circumstances.

474
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:20,492
This is not the time
for barked questions
or hurried judgment.

475
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,173
There will be a statement presently.

476
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:25,013
Was Mr Tickel killed
by politics, Mr Mannion?

477
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,692
Do relax... Heads up now, yeah?

478
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:32,532
Terri, poppet, can you send me out
a cry mail?

479
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,853
"We give a toss,
we're sorry for your loss, yeah?"

480
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:37,052
Peter, we might need to relaunch
the trousers.

481
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:40,652
Get him a tie, a bland one.
Glenn, one of yours, yeah?

482
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:44,412
Peter, I have a bit of news that I
should probably make you aware of.

483
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:47,372
Yes, I do know, Fergus. A man
with an amusing name has died.

484
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:52,693
Er, no, actually.
It's that this morning I...
Well, I set up a community bank.

485
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:56,532
What? You did what? You...
You... You set up a bank?

486
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,452
I had a moment of weakness
and they exploited it,
like Hugh Grant.

487
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:01,532
Yeah, well, we didn't
really have much choice

488
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,532
because it was all going to piss
in a kettle here,

489
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:08,452
so we had to get the economist
out of the way. What economist?

490
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:11,372
Well, we were having
a preliminary meeting
when Phil started to crow,

491
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,573
Glenn was having a meltdown -
it was embarrassing.

492
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:16,292
You bought a bank
out of social embarrassment?

493
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:21,732
I sometimes buy the Big Issue
out of social embarrassment,
I don't buy a fucking bank.

494
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,172
Oh... Peter,
this is so fucking us.

495
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:29,132
Just wind back, right.
Let's get this straight,
so I can deal with you two properly.

496
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:30,572
How much is this bank?

497
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:32,013
Well, 2 billion.
2 billion.

498
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,772
2 billion!
Sweet Tracy Emin!

499
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:37,172
All right, don't need
to shit yourself about it
because we're not buying it, OK?

500
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,452
It's funded by taxes.
That's all right then.

501
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:44,332
Oh, great, the triple!
I'm a nurse killer, a banker
and now I'm raising fucking taxes!

502
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,452
Well, you are meant to be
the bad cop, so what's our out?

503
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:50,852
You're giving me an actual noose
along with the metaphorical one.

504
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,612
Trousers!
Sorry, I'm getting your trousers.

505
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:57,972
Jesus, what were
you guys doing at the hotel?
There's a picture of you on a slide.

506
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,092
It's been tweeted by a golfer.
Oh, for...

507
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:01,772
No, no, no, no, no, no.

508
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:04,492
It's gonna go big,
bigger than Charlie bit my finger.

509
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:07,692
You look like the Shit Family
Robinson. Aaahhhh!

510
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,212
Jesus Christ! Shit!

511
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:13,292
Oh, poor Stewart.
I think a bit of his brain broke.

512
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:17,332
My phone broke. I was up to
Warlock General in Dragonlance.

513
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,132
A year of my life, gone.

514
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:21,852
Er, Peter, speaking of socially
embarrassing situations,

515
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:25,932
what the fuck were you doing
being photographed on a slide?

516
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:29,932
It was the only place
we could get a fucking signal.

517
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:33,812
Two grown men in a playground -
that's a pretty clear signal.

518
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:37,372
Peter, Number 10 have
seen the photo. They don't want you
to make a statement.

519
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:39,092
Fergus, looks like you're up.

520
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:42,412
Statement on Tickle
in 10 minutes OK? Bring it!

521
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:46,532
I'm gonna go and talk Stewart down.
I don't want the fucking trousers.

522
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,972
Peter,
sorry to take this off you.

523
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:51,732
Yeah, but that's swings
and roundabouts, isn't it?

524
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:55,052
Coverly, comms.
Yeah, statement in er... Emma?

525
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:58,532
Yes. Statement in?
Nine. Nine, nine minutes.

526
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:02,573
Yep. OK, everyone.
Terri Coverly offline.

527
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,173
OK, shall I bring you some tea?

528
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:09,772
Oh, Peter, that tie's
a bit rubbish, isn't it?

529
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:12,452
Can I just...?
Why don't I just help you with that?

530
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:15,772
Just... I'm very willing to...
Take it.

531
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:20,053
Jesus, Christ, Terri.
Next time why don't you just
lick his spats?

532
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:25,332
This is not about changing
policy, this is not about running
away from our obligations...

533
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:28,452
Here you go. I managed to wrestle
your tie back off Terri.

534
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:30,293
There's some of her fingernails
in it.

535
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:33,292
Well, in the grand scheme of things,
that's not such a big deal.

536
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,773
You're not gonna watch your guy
give the statement? No.

537
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:41,652
He's not my guy, Phil. I'm
on my own here. There's no one quite
like me, not here, not any more.

538
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,932
Yeah. You're the last VHS in Oxfam.

539
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,132
They won't take them anymore,
I've tried.

540
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:49,212
Series one to five of the X Files -
nothing, can't give them away.

541
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:54,652
For a fairer NHS, for a fairer
public housing programme.

542
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:57,852
He's exactly why
people hate politicians.

543
00:27:57,853 --> 00:28:01,532
He's making me hate politicians,
him in particular.

544
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:04,532
Any second now he's gonna do
the imaginary tits.

545
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:08,412
There they are.

546
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:09,733
Thank you.

547
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:15,172
Look at him.

548
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:19,412
Moments like this make you realise
why Elvis shot so many TVs.

549
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:21,163
