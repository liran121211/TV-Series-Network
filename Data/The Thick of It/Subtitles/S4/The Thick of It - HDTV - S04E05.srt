2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,699
Tickel's dead. What?

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,619
This is an emergency situation,
You have to bash the Tickel button.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,378
You should all for an inquiry. Now.

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:16,300
That's why I'm
calling for an inquiry.

6
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:18,459
I need to have that email.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,019
I'll do it.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,219
I may have fleetingly supported
the policy myself.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,539
So you've essentially launched
an investigation into yourself?

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,979
'I have decided to
stand down as leader.'

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,700
Ding Dong! The useless bitch is dead.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,619
Oh, God. Here we go.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,058
Do you feel you've been
stabbed in the back, Mrs Murray?

14
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,978
She won't be answering
any questions.

15
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,940
Are you backing
Dan Miller for Leader?

16
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,700
Thank you all very much.

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,259
There she goes, a tiebreaker
in the making.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,939
"Who was Nicola Murray?
I'll have to hurry you, teams."

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,259
Farewell our shit
and useless servant.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,140
At least Miller's
a step up from Murray.

21
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:58,299
He doesn't have Left and Right
on his wellies.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,619
I need your attention for thirty
of your earth seconds.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,859
This is what will happen.
What is Stewart doing?

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,299
You will go to the Z drive.

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,659
You find a file entitled "Miller's
Ascension, Whitehall Arab Spring".

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,579
Open, ingest, implement. And after
that, I expect both of you.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,019
You two, to get together.

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,739
Oh, fuck, the man made of space
hopper is coming this way.

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,859
This is going to
be about the inquiry.

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,859
I'm thinking I should resign now.

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,179
What?

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,059
You can't do that. You're Aslan,
no-one shaves your mane.

33
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,699
I'm not a fucking lion, Phil.

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,699
There's going to be an inquiry
into the death of a man

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,699
who died because of a policy
I signed off on.

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,300
We all know how this is going to end.

37
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:42,379
I, I, I should take
the dignified way out.

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,379
You've missed the dignified exit.
That was straight away, basically.

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,459
Yeah.

40
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,499
The only silver lining in today's
cloud of farts is that another one

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,700
of Morecambe and Wise's
policy launches is ruined.

42
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,379
Are those the carers?
They don't look old enough.
Free travel passes or something.

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,499
It's another one of Adam and
Fergus' 'Pop Up Book of Policies'.

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,339
Peter Mannion. Lovely to meet you.
What vital work you do.

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,580
Peter, I'd love to introduce you to
'The Carers'...

46
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:07,539
I've just met them.

47
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:12,053
What's my plan? I didn't resign,
and now this inquiry's

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,020
going to nail me up
like fucking Barabbas.

49
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:17,819
Actually, he was the one they let
go. Shouldn't have, he was a
criminal. Wait.

50
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,779
We could wrong-foot Murray.

51
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,819
How? You could push for the inquiry
to go wider.

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,939
Wider? That's mental!
We want to shut it down.

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,259
Just hear me out.

54
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,059
We could look into the whole culture
of PFI procurement.

55
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,659
That is a good idea. Really?
Fuck, that hurt to say.

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,339
But she's right, because Murray's
husband's involved in PFI

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,699
and he's as dodgy as a Russian...
As a Russian.

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,620
We can backspin it, Peter.
It's good.

59
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:44,419
But... but... Is revenge a mature
response? Let me think. Yes, it is.

60
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,539
Right, let's poke her in the PFI's.

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,740
If you get any channel problems,
just swing them past the purple
Power Ranger over here.

62
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,459
Hello, again. Vital, vital work,
so proud of you.

63
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,139
Terri, I've got a job for you.

64
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,739
Ah, Peter. This is all pretty
white-knuckle stuff, eh?

65
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,620
Is it getting the old
adrenalin pumping?

66
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:08,299
Assuming you can squeeze past
the port and stilton?
Shut the fuck up, you prancing shit.

67
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,779
Ah, we need to widen the inquiry
into the Mr Tickel's death

68
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,379
to include the issue
of PFI contracts.

69
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,499
Great. OK.

70
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,059
I'm just working on Fergus's
Carer's Pass press release...

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,779
Good. Could you fuck that to one side
for the moment and concentrate
on this? Thank you.

72
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,859
Slip into neutral for
a moment here, Peter.

73
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,300
We haven't got a green,
so let's not hit the accelerator.

74
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:29,059
Here's another way of looking at it.
Let's. Goodbye.

75
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,739
So, we heading home?

76
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,819
No, back to the office.

77
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,659
Oh. Really?

78
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,259
Lots of people there have worked
incredibly hard for me.

79
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,580
They're going to want to see me
to say a proper goodbye.

80
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,779
Of course.
Yeah, I'm sure that's true.

81
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,979
Oh, Christ,
there's that fucking chop!

82
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,579
You've been chopped, Mrs Murray!
How does it feel to be chopped?

83
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,379
You're a little bit late actually,
Mr Chop.

84
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,700
You've... you've had your chips!
Ha-ha!

85
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,139
That is precisely why
I didn't let you go to the One Show.

86
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,979
Olly, for God's sake pick up. I've
had it. I'm coming in from the cold.

87
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,019
I'm, I'm re-crossing the floor.

88
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,979
Oh, Glenn! These are the carers.
This is Jack, and this is Rohinka.

89
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,179
Hello.

90
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,899
I'm really sorry for your loss.

91
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,499
Mannion's called for a PFI enquiry.

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,619
Oh, that's going to put
the cat among the pussies.

93
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,299
We need to show that we were never
in favour PFI and that we never

94
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,099
approved of the sell off of
key-worker housing. However...

95
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,259
In a way that doesn't make us look
like dicks for not saying so

96
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,899
at the time or shits
for saying so now.

97
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,019
You know, we don't have much time.
Well, let's just bin the
Carer's Pass launch. Just bin it.

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,579
It's spring conference in two weeks.
The Dungaree Jubilee.

99
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,299
That kind of stuff is exactly
what the conference needs.

100
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,819
But we've been here for three years
and we've done fuck all.

101
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,020
We haven't done fuck all.

102
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,579
No, no, seriously, think about it.

103
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,099
In that time, Apple have
launched two iPhones,

104
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,380
three iPads and their boss
is a fucking dead guy!

105
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:51,619
Yeah.

106
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,779
Let's just push it till
the end of the day.

107
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,579
OK, we'll push it near the end of
the day, but you know the... Robyn.

108
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,659
Hello, Robyn.

109
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,980
That, in fact, is my name.

110
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,259
Take a seat.

111
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,379
I know it's your name, because it
was at the top of a redundancy list

112
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,818
that I've just looked at.

113
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,060
Right, stop rolling around
naked in the headlines.

114
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:12,179
Blind Man's Crumpet's on the way up.
If you're going to film her,
try not to make it obvious.

115
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,979
And no smiling. Not even a wee
fucking Anne Robinson, right?

116
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,099
The look we're going for should
be solemn respect.

117
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,579
You know, like blokes
modelling underpants.

118
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,539
Oh, hang on. Mannion's
calling for a wider inquiry.

119
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,219
He's what?!

120
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,779
He's trying to drag you in - shift
the focus to the PFI conflict

121
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,739
with your husband's company.

122
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,299
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

123
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,139
Fuck! What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

124
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,860
Go up there and smile for starters.

125
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,819
Yes, Dan! Dan, Dan can put
the lid on this, can't he?

126
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,300
Course he can,
because he is actually quite good.

127
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,419
I'm probably going to get quite
emotional, might get quite teary

128
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,019
if I can find an onion or somebody
to pluck my pubes.

129
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,058
Robert! Yes, sir?

130
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,820
I want you to get over
to Fatty's. Yeah.

131
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,459
Make sure he's not hiding
a leadership challenge from me.

132
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,059
Frisk him if necessary,
all 300 of his folds. Get to it.

133
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,379
I will, do some small-talk,
best wishes stuff,

134
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,059
and then I'll just casually
bring up the inquiry.

135
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,619
Or, no! No, no, I should cut
straight to the inquiry,

136
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,379
shouldn't I?

137
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,619
Oh, fuck, I don't know how to play
this. Um...

138
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,740
This is why they got rid of me,
isn't it? Isn't it?!

139
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,859
No, no...
This is it, this is it!

140
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,699
No, there were other reasons. Fuck!
Come on, let's go.

141
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,259
Seat of the pants airways.

142
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,299
Are you smiling? I can't see your
face. Make sure you're smiling.

143
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,540
Oh, here she comes. Yes, hello.

144
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,339
Ha, Thank you. Thanks very much.

145
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,339
I hope you're not clapping
because I've gone.

146
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,659
Ha-ha! Um, seriously, I, er,
I feel over the past two years,

147
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,739
I've given it my best shot.

148
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,419
And I'm quite sure that my,
er, successor,

149
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,219
whoever he or she may be,
will achieve the victory

150
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,179
that this country badly needs.

151
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,259
I've got some, some very, er...

152
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,339
strong memories from working here,
and I'll, um...

153
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,739
I'll keep those with me, for ever.

154
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,699
So thank you guys.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

155
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,059
Thank you. Thanks so much.
Thanks for everything. Dan!

156
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,899
It feels a bit odd for me
to add to your speech,

157
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,499
but I will be tweeting
a tribute later.

158
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,698
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

159
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,060
I was just wondering if we could
just have a private word

160
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,379
in my office, in your...
Well, in, in, this office.

161
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,059
Umm, yep.

162
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,660
Yes? Great. Thank you.

163
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,819
Oh.

164
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,019
Oh! Ha-ha! Don't know where to sit!

165
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,979
I, er, actually I'll just grab...
One of those.

166
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,299
This inquiry, you know,
it's not really necessary now,

167
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,339
so if you want to say that,
I'll just back down.

168
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,499
An inquiry wouldn't be a bad thing.

169
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,379
A clean break with the past
in the minds of the electorate.

170
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,899
Well, I mean, the electorate,
you know, like me.

171
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,619
Quite a lot of them
voted me leader, so...

172
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,019
But you only beat me
on a technicality.

173
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,379
Yeah.

174
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,899
I mean the thing is, Dan,
you know, pragmatically,

175
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,379
I'm now a party grandee.

176
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,099
Malcolm,
this is a private conversation.

177
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,779
You are not a grandee,
you're a fucking blandee.

178
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,579
No-one knew what the fuck you
stood for. Political fucking mist.

179
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,339
No substance, no weight.

180
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,179
You've got all the charm of a rotting
teddy bear by a graveside.

181
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,380
By the way, women fucking hate you.

182
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,419
I can show you the polling.

183
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,139
They think you come across like
a jittery mother at a wedding.

184
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,099
The best thing you ever did in your
flat-lining non-leadership

185
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,539
was call for an inquiry.

186
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,539
Because that will fuck the
government, and it will fuck you.

187
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,379
So now, please, just fuck off back
to your home, you headless frump,

188
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,340
and prepare for your column
in Grazia.

189
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:46,019
Steady on Malcolm, that's a bit
strong. Come on, let's go.

190
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,779
OK, you... Well, you just need to
know that you have absolutely

191
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,939
fucking done it now, Malcolm.

192
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,300
Because you're about to find out
what it feels like

193
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,339
to have me pissing into your tent.

194
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,499
Well, you know what?

195
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,539
Your piss will never fucking make
it into my tent, because by some

196
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,579
unforeseen Nicola Murray-shaped
fiasco, like every fucking Nicola

197
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,099
Murray-shaped fiasco I've had to deal
with for the last two years,

198
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,419
you'll end up blowing
your own fucking stream

199
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,659
into your own fucking face.
There's your golden handshake.

200
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,499
Finished?

201
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,019
You're finished.

202
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,539
We'll see.

203
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,099
Right. Well, thanks, Dan.
Think about what I said.

204
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,539
Also might want to think about
the fact there should be

205
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,620
an apostrophe in 'it's'.
Illiterate fuckers.

206
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,899
What did Dan say about the inquiry?

207
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,659
Fucking Dan! He's just a...
He's basically just a bent dummy

208
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,100
with Malcolm's hand shoved
up his arse. Fucking...!

209
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,379
All right, just calm down.
Bastards.

210
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,019
Do you want some Rescue Remedy?
No.

211
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,780
Do you want me
to send for some noodles?

212
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:48,499
No, I don't want fucking noodles!

213
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,739
I just...

214
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,060
Oh, God.

215
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,259
I just... I just want
a fucking break.

216
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,540
Mmm.

217
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,539
I think we both need to
think about where we're at.

218
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,700
You know, trajectory and so on.

219
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,820
Bollocks.

220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,579
I don't want you.

221
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,220
I just didn't want everybody to
go on the same day, that's all.

222
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,620
I'm fine. I've got me from here.

223
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,419
Box.

224
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,059
Box.

225
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,260
Fucking box.

226
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,899
Bingo! We just need to leak it.

227
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,219
You saying, "Key worker housing
sell-off is possibly the worst idea

228
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,499
"since the invention of theatre."

229
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,859
Does that give us
enough distance from Mannion?

230
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,859
Oh, yeah. This is your 'Get Out
of Jail Free' card strapped
to a fucking jet-pack.

231
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,459
We just need to leak it.

232
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,299
Well, obviously it can't look
like it came from us.

233
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,699
Maybe it's time to bring Glenn back.
He's been out on a limb
since punk hasn't he?

234
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,019
Thousand year old Glenn Fiddich?

235
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,459
Yeah, fucking perfect. He'll love it.
Olly, look, I'm feeling
very exposed here.

236
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,660
I've got my cock out,
it's covered in breadcrumbs

237
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:07,939
and the fucking pigeons
are circling.

238
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,260
Look, please, just,
just ring me back.

239
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,219
Mr Cullen, we would like you
to leak... wow... this.

240
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,579
Don't worry. Nothing major, just an
email that puts a bit of distance

241
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,458
between Fergus and the Tickel affair.

242
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:24,420
What? I go from being
a turnip to a leak.

243
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:26,619
Still a fucking vegetable
to you though, eh?

244
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,579
You want to bring Mannion down
a peg or 12, don't you, Glenn?

245
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,099
Well, of course I do.
The up-his-arse Kensington Butcher.

246
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,859
Well, this is the cyanide capsule
we'd like you

247
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,698
to break into his afternoon brandy.

248
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,460
This is it, Glenn,
you're off the bench

249
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:42,139
and back on the pitch to score
the golden goal in extra time.

250
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,139
Come on, mate.

251
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,380
Pick it up.

252
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,539
Fuck it. Why not? I'll do it.

253
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,379
Good man. Thank you.

254
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,339
I don't need to shake your hand.

255
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,620
All right. Touchy but not feely.
Go. I'll have a look.

256
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:57,899
You are a brilliant bullshitter.

257
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,820
Yeah, well. Two years doing press
for npower, it never leaves you.

258
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,820
Hello, Malcolm.

259
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,579
Are you telling me he's still
in a fucking ba... Sorry, excuse me.

260
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,019
Hello, Charlie Bucket.
Hang on a sec.

261
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,739
Tell him to get out of the fucking
bar, or I will come along

262
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,180
and personally set fire
to the whisky-soaked bastard.

263
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:19,899
Hey-hey! You're missing all the
excitement. Yeah, no, no.

264
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,139
I've been following developments
on Sky News,

265
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,739
where they have actually
stitched Dan Miller's head

266
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,459
to Usain Bolt's body.

267
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,419
Yes, well, get in a cab and
get over here right now.

268
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,139
What me? You want me over there?

269
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,939
Of course I want you here.
You are now my right hand man.

270
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,659
Is this one of those jokes where
I turn up and you go

271
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,018
"Ha-ha, my right hand, that's
what I wipe my arse with"?

272
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,940
That's a risk you're
going to have to take.

273
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,779
All right, well, as soon as I'm
signed off by a consultant, I'll...

274
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,579
Oh, who cares about the opinion
of some golf-obsessed prick
in a bow tie?

275
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,979
Just scoop your guts up, put them in
a fucking wheelbarrow and come over.

276
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,900
Love you too.

277
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,899
Robyn. Carer's Pass
has timed out, yeah?

278
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,939
Bundle the Munchkins out of the
building, get them in tomorrow.

279
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,819
Right. Can we get them
something for their travel?

280
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,979
Well, thanks to the Carer's Pass
they get free travel!

281
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,059
But it hasn't come in yet.

282
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,780
So no.

283
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,579
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

284
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,219
Umm, it looks like we're not going
to launch the Carer's Pass today.

285
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,419
Um, but we were wondering, could you
come back at the same time tomorrow?

286
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,819
I don't know. Erm...

287
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,099
Have you got anything on?
I mean, you know,

288
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,459
apart from the full-time
round-the-clock

289
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,099
medical care of your families?

290
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,019
Ah ha! It's his Ollyness!

291
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,459
Olly, whose initiation rite into our
little cabal of shitty devils here,

292
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,699
will be to go over and visit Fatty,

293
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,539
and to present him with this
as a means of getting him

294
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,459
to shelve his ludicrous
leadership ambitions.

295
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,539
Show him this. Oh!

296
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,619
Jesus, Malcolm! You could have
left it in the envelope.

297
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,979
OK, come on everybody!
Let's get to it.

298
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,739
I want Dan to wake up to the news
that any opposition is Brian Jones.

299
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,859
Meaning?

300
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,138
Dead in the water.

301
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,300
Oh, yeah, right.

302
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,539
Could you?

303
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,220
Glenn!

304
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,980
What are you doing at my computer?

305
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,059
I'm just doing Bradford &
Bingley a favour.

306
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,179
I'm bringing down Mannion
by leaking an email.

307
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,860
A leak! Coming from my computer?
No. No. Get off. Get off.

308
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,499
Take that... whatever it is, out of
the... whatever it is. Take it. Out.

309
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,779
No-one will think it's you. Nobody
leaks from their own computer.

310
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,980
Look, you do this for me,

311
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,579
and I'll make sure that you get
the full severance package.

312
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,939
No questions asked,
with full pension.

313
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,739
And a lump sum.

314
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,980
Yeah. I guess. Yeah.

315
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:53,459
The thing is, Glenn, I've got my eye
on a tea shop near Ludlow.

316
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,259
Without a lump sum,
no tea shop. No can do.

317
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,859
OK, right. This can go straight to
Geoffrey at The Guardian. Yeah?

318
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,899
OK.

319
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,379
Right. Can we do it together?

320
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,699
What?

321
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,299
Please. Just your hand on mine, my
hand on yours. Just to it together.
Like, um...

322
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,020
Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.

323
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:11,179
Yes, OK.

324
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,739
Not that I'm saying you're butch.

325
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,980
No, of course not.

326
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,979
One, two, three.

327
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,460
Just send the email.

328
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,579
Ah, Team Peter. Come on, guys.

329
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,619
Let's take a little
imagination stroll

330
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,459
through a virtual enquiry, huh?

331
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,739
Oh, dear God,
not another whiteboard session.

332
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,579
I've got a note from my mother,
I have a verruca.

333
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,180
I just want to get an overview,
Peter.

334
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,299
A helicopter shot of where
we currently are.

335
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,979
Who's most to blame
in the blame garden.

336
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,139
OK, the onion is PFI,
let's peel back some layers.

337
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,619
Murray resignation. How do we feel
about that? What's Tickel's
M records?

338
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,419
Medical.
It's his leaked medical records.

339
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,659
Leaked? I thought they were
common knowledge.

340
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,098
Well, they are now.
Because they have been leaked.

341
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,218
Did you know this? Number 10 knew,
so I knew, yeah.

342
00:15:58,219 --> 00:15:59,500
What about you?

343
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,699
Yeah, I thought Tickel
leaked them himself.

344
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,339
Who would voluntarily leak
their own medical records?

345
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,979
You'd have to be mad to do that.

346
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,579
He was mad. That's precisely
what his records said.

347
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,899
Exactly. He was a male nurse.
That's not just mad, that's mental.

348
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,260
Phil! Did the last 30 years
only happen to other people?

349
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:17,539
Why didn't I know about this?
Leaking medical records is illegal.

350
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,139
Now I look guilty
and incompetent.

351
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,420
Ah! Peter, incompetent.

352
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,499
Look! Don't write that down!
I'm not on your sodding onion!

353
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,859
What is GFU? Good for us. Mmm?

354
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,059
Oh, shit with a capital shit.
We've got to go.

355
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,299
Great.

356
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,659
No, no, no. Sit.

357
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,620
The Guardian have
received an e-mail from Fergus.

358
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:37,139
Actually, do you know, strike that.
Chain of emails.

359
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,179
Oh, perfect. With all of our
comments about Mr Tickel underneath.

360
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,779
Oh, God. Not the one where we all
piled in with the Mr Men jokes?

361
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,219
Yes, that one, Phil.

362
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,739
Oh, you kid me.
Jesus!

363
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,859
I kid you not!

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,819
Oh my giddy fuck.

365
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,660
They've leaked all
the bloody emails.

366
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,619
"Mr Tickel sounds like a gropey
clown at a kid's party".

367
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,139
I can't see! Can I make it bigger?

368
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,179
Go to settings. "Poor Ickle Mr
Tickel, perhaps he's meant
to be sickle".

369
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,380
That's from Fergus.

370
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,819
Is this settings?

371
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,340
Ah! I think I've just taken
a picture of my feet.

372
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,499
Yep?

373
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,779
What? Where?

374
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,139
Right. I don't know.

375
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,099
OK. Rugby tackle him, or, or taze
him. Gaffer tape him to a seat.

376
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,499
He can't come up here.

377
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,699
Er... Glenn is in reception.

378
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,059
Hoddle? Miller? Close? Morangie?

379
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,940
Cullen. Glenn Cullen
is in reception.

380
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:25,979
Glenn?

381
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,019
Yeah.

382
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,898
Why are you even fucking
telling me that?

383
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:31,338
When the Queen's butler finds
a cockroach in the pantry,

384
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,620
he just stamps on it.

385
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,859
Yes. She doesn't even know.

386
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,379
OK, OK. I'll go and stamp
on the cockroach, Malcolm.

387
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,339
'..The whole enquiry into the
whole culture of leaking...'

388
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,259
Sam, Sam! Get me
Stewart Pearson on the phone!

389
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,019
Olly, shouldn't you be in bed?

390
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,499
Shouldn't you not be here?

391
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,499
Whoa, stop, stop, whoa!
You can't go up there.

392
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,259
No, I have to.
I can't go back over there.

393
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,819
It's like Alien versus Predator.
I want back in! Here!

394
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,659
Everybody is tremendously
appreciative of what you've done.

395
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,179
It was a noble sacrifice, but...

396
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,259
What do you mean, sacrifice?
I thought we had a deal?

397
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,979
Sacrifice sounds very one sided.

398
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,219
Piss off sounds one sided,
but there we go.

399
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,939
Hey, Malcolm.

400
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,859
Why is he still here?
Can you not perform a simple task?

401
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,939
When there is a shit on your
doorstep, you hose it off.

402
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,619
You don't try and talk it
into leaving of its own volition.

403
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,380
I got rid of Nicola for you.
You owe me.

404
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:25,899
I owe you? Your act of treachery
wiped the slate clean.

405
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,139
Rudolf Hess's fucking
senile older brother.

406
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,900
Look, I know you think I screwed up,

407
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,900
but I came here on my hands
and knees, Malcolm.

408
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,900
You, my friend.
You don't exist to me any more.

409
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,059
I can't even fucking hear you.

410
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,499
Do you want me to beg?
Is that it?

411
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,299
Because I will.

412
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,819
Listen, Mary Queen of fucking Shits.

413
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,220
In the old days we would have
just slit you up the middle

414
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:48,259
like a fucking Cornish pasty.

415
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,419
Hang your steaming entrails all
around the Tower of fucking London.

416
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,060
Catch you later, you fucking traitor.

417
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,859
Sam, what is it?
A call from Stewart Pearson.

418
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,499
Stewart Pearson. I'm the fucking
wanker's lodestone today!

419
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,020
Stewart, yes. The goatee-bearded
guru-boy of Company B.

420
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,540
It's a no, Glenn.

421
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,539
Yeah, Malcolm can this wait, Mmm?

422
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,259
Word is the PM's considering an
inquiry into the culture of leaking.

423
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,179
No, no. Do you really think he's
going to invite everyone into

424
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,058
our complex network of
secret burrows?

425
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,980
Open up the whole
of Watership Down?!

426
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:23,179
OK 'Bright Eyes'.
I'm massively fucking reassured.

427
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,338
Look, you may as well have
an inquiry into gravity.

428
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,538
Now, I have to go, Malcolm,

429
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,940
because I've got like a whole
country to govern, yeah?

430
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:31,099
Could I use your pass to go
to the loo again?

431
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,059
Thing is, if my swipe card is being
monitored, then it's either

432
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,900
going to look quite like I'm skiving
or have a bladder condition.

433
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,058
The primary thing I want
to say first and foremost

434
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,820
is you can't blame me
for this, Peter.

435
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:48,659
If anything, it's the culture
of blame that's to blame for this.

436
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,059
Great to see you again.
Such crucial work you do.

437
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,420
Meeting room!

438
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,099
Right. Sit down.

439
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,059
I can't resign.
No.

440
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,418
And I'm not going to resign.

441
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:01,380
I had the perfect moment to,
right early on,

442
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:04,219
when I could have resigned in a
dignified and statesman-like way,

443
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,379
and you both advised me
not to resign.

444
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,819
So now, I. Can't. Resign.

445
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,659
You shouldn't resign, Peter.

446
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
This is going to happen.
One of you has got to go.

447
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,860
I want both of you to give me
reasons why you shouldn't resign.

448
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,219
Erm, because, because, I'm a Special
Advisor to... a... senior cabinet.

449
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,819
That's a job description, Philip.
That's a job description.

450
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,980
That is not a reason.

451
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:28,499
That's just your job, from which I'm
asking you why you shouldn't resign.

452
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,699
I...know... everything about you.

453
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,219
I am a, a world expert in, in,
in Peter Mannion.

454
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,019
From, er... pin number
to inside leg measurements.

455
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,499
I'm, I'm, I'm there, you know...

456
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,699
What's his inside leg measurements?

457
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,099
34. I've, I've given you
everything, Peter.

458
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,899
You can't, I mean, I don't have
anything else. That's the point.

459
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,459
I don't, I don't have any friends.
I don't have any life.

460
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,179
I haven't had sex for five years,
and I, I don't even enjoy it.

461
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,699
So, you know, I'm not going
to get anyone pregnant.

462
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,899
I'm never going to get anyone
pregnant, OK? I'm fucking seedless.

463
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,699
Where as she's just,
just a fucking baby bomb! OK?

464
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,019
And she's going to go off all over
the office and, and leave you!

465
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,379
I'm going to be here!

466
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,099
I'm sorry, but my good name
is at stake here. Oh, Christ.

467
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,139
Peter, you must understand. I am an
innocent woman. I'm the "DoSac One".

468
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,540
That's it. I've had enough.
I've had enough of all of you.

469
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,379
You're all shit.
I'm going to sort it out, by myself.

470
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,139
Did you hear that?

471
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,419
I can't bear that you think about me
like this. Don't follow me.
No, please!

472
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,458
Stop following me.

473
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,178
I insist, I insist.
Peter, please.

474
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,018
All right, I admit it.
I'm in love with you.

475
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,300
Now fuck off to your office
and organise the wedding.

476
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,059
Mannion goes Mel Gibson.

477
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,419
Spot it.

478
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,939
You know what you've done?
Yeah?

479
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,698
You bought a fan.
You've plugged it in,

480
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,618
you've turned the dial up
to maximum...

481
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:42,780
It wasn't a weak fan.
Not one of those office fans.

482
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:45,659
It was a Dyson.
And I stood the other side of it...

483
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,979
Did a liquid shit on it.
Trousers down.

484
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,980
And where did the shit go?
All over Mannion.

485
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,500
That's just priceless.

486
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:53,859
Fuck, hang on.

487
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,899
What?

488
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,499
Uh, check the fucking emails.

489
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,740
What are you talking about?

490
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,099
What the fuck did you give to Glenn?

491
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,180
Just the email...

492
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:04,059
But it's the whole... We're on
the email! Oh, fucking hell.

493
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,299
Why did you, why did you leave us
on the dongle?

494
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,780
No, no, no no, no. No! No!

495
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:11,779
Because he's only supposed to send
the fucking top part of it!

496
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,499
Why did you give him the choice?

497
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,099
Because an email has a chain,
Fergus. It has a chain, and it
goes all the way down.

498
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,340
Adam, there is now shit all over me!
Oh, Jesus Christ!

499
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:22,139
How come there is shit on me?
Thanks, Adam!

500
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,459
Look, it's not my fucking fault!
He's supposed to redact it!

501
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,539
I just wanted one solid shit,
to go in one direction.

502
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,099
Not Madras, fucking everywhere!

503
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,539
Alastair, yeah, it's Peter Mannion.

504
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,579
I just wanted to give you
a nudge on this.

505
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,219
The real story here isn't
all this jokey email nonsense,

506
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,940
it's that Mr Tickel's medical records
were illegally acquired.

507
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,180
Yeah.

508
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,340
He's been the victim of Mr Blag.

509
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,860
OK. Bye.

510
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,299
Hi. I just... needed a pen.

511
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,899
Would you like a pen?

512
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,299
As a small recompense for the vital,
vital work that you do...

513
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,779
I'll tell you what I'd like.
I'd like a departmental in
ten regarding leakage.

514
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,819
And as of now, your
department's in lockdown.

515
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,619
No emailing, no Diving Bell
and Butterflying,

516
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,499
no communication, nada!

517
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,780
Just a little piece of electric
paper, that's all.

518
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:19,299
Off the record,

519
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,939
there are a number of machines
that emails can be set to.

520
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,020
Why would I know anything about this
email? Why me? Thank you.

521
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,580
Comms. Off the phones. Now.

522
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,660
Oh, my... I think I've just
perjured myself.

523
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:37,420
Can you perjure yourself on the
phone, or is it only a court thing?

524
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,299
I'm so sorry for the delay.
I promise it won't be much longer.

525
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,019
And that's not a political promise.
That's a real promise. Ha-ha-ha!

526
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,339
Hey!

527
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,460
2,000-year-old man! Why the fuck did
you send the whole email?! Huh?

528
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,060
You were supposed to redact it,
send the top email,

529
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,779
not the whole fucking exchange.

530
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,219
Jesus Christ on a
crystal meth binge!

531
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,419
Terri and I sent what you gave me.

532
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,779
Terri?!

533
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,539
Why the fuck... The only reason
I'd ever ask Terri for help,

534
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,139
is to shoot me,
if I ever ask Terri for help!

535
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,459
Same reason you gave it to me.
Distance.

536
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,059
Two people! Twice the distance!

537
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,339
Terri doesn't give us any distance!
Terri gives me a twitch! Right here!

538
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,460
Laugh it up, Glenn. I've got
a twitch called Terri!

539
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,859
I am actually here, you know.

540
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,979
Yeah, and that, in a nutshell,
is the whole fucking problem!

541
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,259
♪ Fuck you very much. ♪

542
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,019
Five minutes guys, yeah?

543
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,140
Thanks.

544
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,699
Glenn, what about my tea shop?

545
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,100
It got closed.
There's been a murder.

546
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,379
An inquiry into all of leaking.
All of leaking.

547
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,539
We are so... we are so screwed.

548
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,179
He's done it.

549
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,939
That chinless horse fiddler,
our fucklustrious PM has opened

550
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,979
Pandora's fucking Box and curled
a massive steamer right into it.

551
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,419
In the time it has
taken for Terri to extract

552
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,259
herself from her Bluetooth,
this little inquiry has fused!

553
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,979
It is now growing faster than
the speed of bloody light!

554
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,699
It's not going to be something
that we can see from space.

555
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,419
It's going to be space!

556
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,139
Brian Cox is going to phone me,
and ask for the film rights!

557
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,579
But what leak, what leak,
what fucking leak?!

558
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,379
Anything! If I find out that anyone
from here has leaked anything,

559
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,059
I will make sure they have to
emigrate after this, to a country

560
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,500
where they don't speak English
and there's no internet.

561
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,019
But everyone who leaked anything,

562
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,139
that would fill the
fucking Caspian Sea!

563
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,259
We're just a drop in the ocean here.

564
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,659
No, no, what you are Peter,
is leak zero. It started here.

565
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,419
You have presided over a shambolic
showering of info. Peter Mannion.

566
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,300
"Singin' in The Rain"

567
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,699
Oh, Christ. Hello, Malcolm!

568
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,299
Right, was this your idea?

569
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,740
Because I don't remember
signing any suicide pact.

570
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:55,699
Malcolm, look. I'm as shocked
about this as you are.

571
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,259
Yes, you sound really shocked,
you big fucking spunk lolly.

572
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,580
I don't even know what that is.

573
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:03,539
But I, you know, I think we all need
time to, to process this data, yep?

574
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,900
What the fuck is going on?!

575
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:07,579
All right, Fergus.
What the fuck is going on?

576
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,939
The Ark has been opened.
And your face is going to melt.

577
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,420
There's going to be an inquiry.

578
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,659
Have I just stepped through
a portal into a sausage machine,

579
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,419
because this is making mince
meat of my head.

580
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,340
It's the end of the world
as we know it.

581
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,460
To paraphrase a popular fucking
Bangles song.

582
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,659
It's... it's REM.

583
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,100
Don't start contradicting me
on that kind of shit.

584
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:38,619
OK, Robyn, it's over to you.
It's show time.

585
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,179
Let's just give it another
five minutes.

586
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,019
There's still a blogger from
the Huffington Post to come.

587
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,099
Is that it?

588
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,299
It looks like a paedophile's
funeral.

589
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,899
It doesn't matter.
We've got to get out of here ASAP.

590
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,939
Leaking is a fundamental component
of our governmental system.

591
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,859
If a government can't leak,
do you know what happens?

592
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,939
Dark shit builds up
and then it bursts.

593
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,659
And that's something you
don't want to see.
You think your appendix was bad.

594
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,659
Hi, and welcome to the launch
of Carer's Pass.

595
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,099
You know, we thought long
and hard about how,

596
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,779
in these straitened times,
we could help those

597
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,739
who don't help themselves,
but rather help others.

598
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,179
Please give it up for The Carers.

599
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,459
This is the gift that's going to go
on giving, believe you me.
So you better keep your head down.

600
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,659
I don't mean just when you're
frequenting your favourite
glory holes.

601
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,099
Well, whereas your closet is
completely free of skeletons
isn't it, Malcolm?

602
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,539
Cos you've buried
them in a landfill in Essex.

603
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,179
Oh, yeah, sorry, and just to say
that we're very proud to say that

604
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,099
this, this policy has been
pushed through by our party.

605
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,019
We do have a voice in this
coalition, and it is being heard.

606
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,659
When this inquiry lands, you'd better
have developed a very flat,

607
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,659
stony face with no expression.
But that'll be easy for you.

608
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,340
It's your fucking come face,
isn't it?

609
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,859
Hi, my name's Rohinka.

610
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,299
OK, when they dry up, just jump in.
Do a quick Q&A and wrap it up, yeah?

611
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,299
Who am I? Fucking Kirsty Wark?

612
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,379
No.

613
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,660
Lead a normal life. So, this
Carers Pass is a blessing, really.

624
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,780
I, Malcolm Tucker, do declare that
the evidence I give

625
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:32,340
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.
