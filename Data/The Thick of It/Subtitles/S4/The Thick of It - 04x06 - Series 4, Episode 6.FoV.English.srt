2
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:07,200
Tickel's dead!

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:10,920
I need to have the e-mail.
I'll do it.

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,359
Are you for the chop, Mrs Murray?

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,601
Ha-ha! Very funny!

6
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:17,400
Quiet Batpeople
on every fucking paper!

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,400
What are you doing at my computer?!

8
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:21,800
I'm bringing down Mannion
by leaking an e-mail.

9
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:24,960
Mr Tickel's medical records
were illegally acquired.

10
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,120
I have decided
to stand down as leader.

11
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:29,680
The Guardian have received
an e-mail from Fergus

12
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,919
with all of our comments
about Mr Tickel underneath.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,361
You were supposed to redact it,
send the top e-mail,

14
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:36,000
not the whole fucking exchange!

15
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,720
If a government can't leak,
do you know what happens?

16
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:40,440
Dark shit builds up.

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,360
What the fuck is going on?
There's going to be an inquiry.

18
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:46,560
And then it bursts!

19
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:50,600
This is an inquiry into the death
of Mr Douglas Tickel,

20
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:55,760
and the practice and culture
of the dissemination
of confidential information

21
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:58,760
between political parties
and the public media.

22
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:00,120
Mr Weir.

23
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you, Lord Goolding.

24
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,080
Our first witness today is,
er, is Mr Stewart Pearson.

25
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,761
No, it's... It's fine.

26
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,920
Er, yeah, um, I, Stewart Pearson,
do sincerely declare and affirm

27
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:14,840
that the evidence I shall give
will be the truth, the whole truth,

28
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,201
and, and nothing but,
er, the truth.

29
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:23,120
On page 235
of your witness statement,

30
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:27,920
you describe yourself as the,
the human router in government.

31
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,840
Can you, er, can you explain
what you meant by that?

32
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,160
Um, I'm a-a router

33
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:38,000
in the sense that I control
the governmental, informational

34
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,160
ingestion and egestion process.

35
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,640
Mr Pearson just to clarify...

36
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:46,040
your job is to make sure
that the public perception

37
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,400
of your government's programme
is a positive one. Is that fair?

38
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,280
It's not about perception. Yeah?

39
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:54,200
I believe in government
as a transceiver, hm?

40
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,800
Transceiver.

41
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:59,880
Yeah, it's really important, sure,
to give out a strong signal,

42
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:02,720
but to be effective,
you've got to listen for an echo.

43
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:05,320
Could you possibly
speak in plain English?

44
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,720
I'm sorry, I-I thought I was.

45
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:12,800
So what IS clear is that
you are an important man, Mr Pearson.

46
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm just a lad from Leeds
with a lust for life, yeah?

47
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:20,640
There's an African proverb
that's stuck with me, yeah?

48
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,081
"If you think you're too small
to make a difference,

49
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,120
"you've never spent a night
with a mosquito."

50
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,840
So... part of your job...

51
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:33,120
is to make sure that the government's
message gets across clearly?

52
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,920
Is that right?

53
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,360
That's correct.

54
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:41,760
And despite the sarcasm marinating
that question, I'm very successful
in that endeavour.

55
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,600
No, there was no sarcasm
intended at all, Mr Pearson.

56
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:49,280
Sorry, I must have
misread your... face.

57
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:51,960
Does your job
intrude on your home life?

58
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,360
No.

59
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:55,960
No, when I close the front door,
I...

60
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm no longer Stewart Pearson.

61
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,440
When you, when you...

62
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,480
I mean, when I... when I close
it from the... from the inside.

63
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:05,400
You know, when I close it
from the outside then I...

64
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:07,760
then I very much AM Stewart Pearson.

65
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:10,080
So who are you at home?

66
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,280
Er, I'm a husband,

67
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,920
I'm a... pardon me, a lover,

68
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm a carpenter, I'm a cook,
I'm a flautist.

69
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,680
A-a...? A flautist.

70
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,960
Right. I play the flute.

71
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,361
And I dabble on the Irish bodhran.

72
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:31,320
Erm, and would you like to express
any remorse for Mr Tickel's death?

73
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:33,640
What would you like to say
to his family?

74
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:37,480
Er, I would like to offer them
maximum respect, you know?

75
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,400
And maximum remorse.

76
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,000
And maximum assurance that Mr Tickel
did not die in vain.

77
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,840
We're here. You know?

78
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:49,360
How can we make the government
and the media inclusive
without being intrusive? Yeah...

79
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,000
And if we can answer that,

80
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:54,640
at least we can make sure
there are no more Mr Tickels.

81
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:57,720
I mean that... I mean that
not in the sense of, you know,

82
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,680
wiping out the Tickel family name.

83
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:03,360
I mean it in the sense that nothing
like this will ever happen again.

84
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,840
Hello, Mr Pearson. Hi.

85
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:09,321
Tab 28 in your bundle there,
page 263...

86
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:15,760
a paper that you presented in
2006, The Iconography of Consensus.

87
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,840
Would you care to summarise
the argument you present there?

88
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:24,040
Sure, yeah, the main thrust...
Bearing in mind Lord Goolding's
desire for plainness and clarity.

89
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,040
Right. OK.

90
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,721
Er, I hypothesise that...

91
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,840
Sorry.

92
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,521
I say...

93
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:37,720
that the design structure
for a parliamentary democracy

94
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,760
should be that
of the Pompidou Centre.

95
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,280
Morally and structurally
explicit and open,

96
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,120
a porous membrane.

97
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:48,121
Maybe just a little bit plainer,
Mr Pearson.

98
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,720
People...

99
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,441
should know, er...

100
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,080
what politicians are doing.

101
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:58,720
Brilliant.

102
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,520
Thanks.

103
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,920
Government should be porous?

104
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,840
Yes. But not leaking?

105
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,000
Come on. If someone is determined
to leak information,

106
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,680
there's nothing that anyone
can do about that.

107
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,520
So as Director of Communications,

108
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,040
you are unable to prevent
sensitive material

109
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,120
being communicated to journalists?

110
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:23,160
If someone chokes on a packet
of crisps, do you issue an arrest
warrant for Gary Lineker?

111
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:25,760
Is it fair to say that you
have in fact changed nothing,

112
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:30,480
and government communications
carries on exactly as they did
before, by leaks and whispers?

113
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:32,200
No, it is not fair to say that.

114
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, as you disapprove
and condemn these practices,

115
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,800
are they not more covert
and more hidden and more secret
than ever before?

116
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:41,440
I think that is also
an unreasonable assertion.

117
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,840
In spite of your desire to create
a political Pompidou Centre,

118
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:47,520
haven't you created
the opposite, Centrepoint?

119
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:51,840
Everybody sees it looming over them,
but nobody has any idea what happens
inside.

120
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,400
I think there's some kind of club
on the top floor.

121
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:59,600
So, Mr Pearson, have you identified
the source of the leak...

122
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,280
No... of Mr Tickel's records?

123
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,120
No. Have you ever leaked yourself?

124
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,040
No.

125
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,000
No, I was, I was over that
pre-Britpop.

126
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,600
Do you have any idea where the leak
might have come from?

127
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,080
Well, you know,
if this was CSI Miami,

128
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:19,240
I guess we'd be looking for the
person who had the most to gain
from the leak being made public.

129
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:22,961
Well, er, despite your shirt,
this ISN'T CSI Miami.

130
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:27,440
Who do you think would benefit
most from the leak?

131
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:32,201
Well, I guess I'd be sending
David Caruso knocking on the door
of Mr Malcolm Tucker.

132
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:36,280
Can I ask you,
how would you describe yourself?

133
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:39,040
Er, I'm a media strategist.

134
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,800
So you would be Stewart Pearson's
opposite number?

135
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:45,680
Er, well, I'd be
Stewart Pearson's opposite

136
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,440
in every possible way, I think.

137
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:51,480
You have a lot of control and power
over your party, don't you?

138
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:53,560
Ah-ha!

139
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,080
I wish, yes! Um, no.

140
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,000
I think that that's been overstated.

141
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,520
So this reputation you have
as an enforcer,

142
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,040
that's completely
misrepresenting you, is it?

143
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,840
It's baloney. Politicians who have to
do things that they don't want to do,

144
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,240
such as resign...

145
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:11,960
er, because they've been caught
with their fingers in the till,
or, you know,

146
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,680
with their knickers up a flagpole
or whatever, they...

147
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,640
sometimes it's very convenient
for them to have a bogeyman.

148
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:21,040
"Malcolm made me do it."
Well, I didn't make them do it.

149
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,080
These are people who just find
themselves stuck in a room
with one exit,

150
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,640
and I simply show them the door.

151
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:29,400
I've highlighted some quotes.

152
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,360
The Guardian.

153
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:35,320
"Malcolm Tucker
has the physical demeanour
and the political instincts

154
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,840
"of a velociraptor."

155
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:39,321
Yes, The Guardian,
the newspaper that hates newspapers.

156
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:41,281
Telegraph... The Telegr-arse.

157
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,840
"Tucker's writ runs through
the lifeblood of Westminster

158
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,960
"like raw alcohol,
at once cleansing and corroding."

159
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,160
The Times.

160
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,680
"If you make eye contact
with Malcolm Tucker,

161
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,680
"you have spilled his pint."

162
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:58,120
The Spectator.
"Iago with a BlackBerry."

163
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,960
I mean, you're saying these
quotes are, what, misguided?

164
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,080
The Spectator...! Um...

165
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:07,080
No, I'm saying you're taking these
out of context,
you're not contextualising these.

166
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:11,320
If you were to put them
into a perspective, if you were
to place them into the landscape,

167
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:14,920
you would see that there might be
a lot of axes being ground here.

168
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't see the difference between
what you have just done and a leak,
by the way.

169
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:22,400
The difference is that
what I've just read out
was not obtained illegally.

170
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,681
How do you know that?

171
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:26,640
You don't know what confidences
have been breached

172
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,521
in order to form these opinions,
for that is what they are.

173
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,880
So, you accept leaking
as part and parcel
of the political media machinery?

174
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,240
Yes, I mean if you didn't
have leaking,

175
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:41,000
the newspapers would just be
full of long-lense bikini shots,

176
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:45,320
and adverts for sheds,
and offers to buy three pairs
of trousers for a tenner, etcetera.

177
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,240
It's just... It's the way it is.
Big deal, no-one dies.

178
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:52,161
One person did die, Mr Tucker.

179
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:59,360
Would you tell us how it works?
You know, you do me a favour,
I do you a favour. Yeah?

180
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,201
And what might you expect in return?

181
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,560
Anything. What?

182
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,800
Well, a Kit-Kat, you might get.

183
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:08,840
I've had a Kit-Kat,
I've had, er, a-a big meal.

184
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,560
Could you give us an example?

185
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:12,921
Um... Well, yes.

186
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,000
I...

187
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,281
This is The Daily Mirror,

188
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:20,520
and I could get drummed out of the
Magic Circle for showing you this.

189
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,360
Anyway, this is The Daily Mirror...

190
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:27,680
about the Quiet Batpeople,
er, policy of Mrs Nicola Murray.

191
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:31,160
I was there that day. You can't see
me cos I've been cropped out here,

192
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:35,720
but this information here,
I made sure that those notes
were in that place,

193
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:39,680
that they were available,
and that the picture editor
knew where to find them.

194
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:43,200
Sorry, I'm just trying to...
trying to get this clear.

195
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:47,640
Was Mrs Murray not the subject of
huge derision as a result of this?

196
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,761
Er, no she was a subject
of huge derision before this.

197
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,840
But it was...

198
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:57,160
You were, you were trying to
undermine the leader of your party?

199
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,400
I was...

200
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:01,640
Would you say you were a loyal man,
Mr Tucker?

201
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm loyal, yes.
I'm loyal to my party

202
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:08,720
and I feel that Mrs Murray's policies
were turning the party into...

203
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:12,960
I don't know if you've seen those
calendars with pictures of dogs
that are dressed up in...

204
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:15,560
They've got little dresses
and hats on?

205
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:19,120
She was turning my party into that,
she was humiliating my party,

206
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:22,440
so I thought it was
absolutely vital

207
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:25,120
to focus the public's attention
onto that.

208
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:29,640
And yet you maintain that
you had great, I don't know, what,
respect for Mrs Murray as a person.

209
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:33,800
Yeah. Yes. She was a great laugh
occasionally. Great dancer.

210
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,080
She's got terrific... hair.

211
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:38,040
She did a good job at DoSAC.

212
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,880
A much better job than her successor,
who, let's not forget,

213
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,880
was playing on a slide when the news
of Mr Tickel's death came out.

214
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you, Mr Tucker,
we're well versed in the events
surrounding the death of Mr Tickel.

215
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,240
So tell me,

216
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:58,360
the PFI e-mail that led to the... to
the resignation of Nicola Murray.

217
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:01,281
Did you... Did you engineer that?

218
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,201
Mr Tucker? No. No.

219
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:09,680
No, I didn't.

220
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:11,961
And, er, the leaking of Mr Tickel's
health records?

221
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,600
I mean, do I detect your hand
in that, for instance?

222
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,920
No. No, no, no, no, no.

223
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:18,280
Look, politics is a war,
and politicians,

224
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:20,720
sometimes they lose
ideological limbs. Right?

225
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,800
They get media shrapnel
right in the face.

226
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,240
Sometimes they get a bullet
right in the brain.

227
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:31,040
Civilians know there is no way that
I would ever attack a civilian,

228
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,760
a real person,
and especially not somebody

229
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,560
with a history of mental illness.

230
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,680
Because that sort of thing...

231
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:40,120
makes me queasy.

232
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:43,040
So you're an ethical... leaker?

233
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:47,240
I use leaking to show up corruption,
to show up hypocrisy,

234
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,040
to show up idiocy.

235
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,040
And also the fourth horseman
of the political apocalypse,
duplicity.

236
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,800
For instance, Fergus Williams...

237
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,400
He's coming up next, right?
Mm-hmm.

238
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:02,240
This is a guy,
he's a member of the junior party
in this coalition, right?

239
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:05,600
This guy has already opened
a private channel to Dan Miller,

240
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,440
the Leader of the Opposition,

241
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:11,040
in order to talk about possibly
setting up a coalition with him,

242
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,080
because he knows very well
that this coalition government
that he is lumbered with

243
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:18,600
is being torn to pieces,
like a bread stick at a picnic.

244
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,760
Mr Tucker,
you have just used this inquiry

245
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,840
to commit a leak in front of us!

246
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:28,360
I've not committed a leak!
Everybody in Westminster knows these
talks have taken place. Everyone.

247
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:31,800
You're supposed to be investigating
this, discovering this stuff.

248
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:35,080
Now, you cannot not know what I
or anyone else tell you. Right?

249
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:38,080
You can't not know that. You cannot
not know what you now know.

250
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:41,680
Mr Tucker, are you familiar with
the rules of association football?

251
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:45,280
I understand if you're going
to have an affair you'd better
take precautions,

252
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:49,600
like getting a superinjunction.
I ask you because this is me
giving you a yellow card.

253
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:53,600
You're not to use this inquiry
to score political points.

254
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:55,640
Sorry, I'm... I apologise.

255
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,360
Did you see Mr Malcolm Tucker's
evidence earlier?

256
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:02,880
Er, yeah, I, er, saw it
out of the corner of my eye.

257
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:07,520
Do you want me to read what he said
about you? No, that's fine.
That was the bit that I saw.

258
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,960
Embarrassing, I imagine.
Er, no, not at all.

259
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,880
Er, it was,
er... almost flattering, yeah,

260
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,960
to get, er, to get Tuckered.

261
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,560
It's a right of passage
in... in... in politics.

262
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,080
It happens to all of us, it's...

263
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:22,720
You know, it's like when
you're in a Russian jail,
you get your face tattooed.

264
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:27,040
Mr Tucker mentioned meetings
between you
and the Leader of the Opposition.

265
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,761
Did these take place?

266
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:34,040
They did, yes. Er, myself and Adam

267
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,640
were part of a team who had very
general, non-committal discussions

268
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,560
with, amongst others... Mr Miller.

269
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:42,960
And you discussed a potential
future coalition with his party

270
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:46,320
and the removal of your own party
leader, is that correct?

271
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:50,520
Sorry, could I... possibly answer
that question with another question?

272
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:53,480
I mean, not THAT question I'm just
asking but a further question.

273
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,480
Go on.

274
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,160
You do realise that YOU'RE being
spun here? You do see that?

275
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,120
Spun? Cos, you know...

276
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:03,840
Malcolm Tucker's not your common
or garden spin... doctor, right?

277
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,800
No, he's the, he's
the chief medical officer of spin.

278
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,560
He is Spinoza, you see,
so he'd... He had...

279
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:12,280
He didn't come here in order
to answer your questions,

280
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,480
he came here in order to get
you to then ask HIS questions...

281
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:19,960
Mr Williams, I don't want you to
answer with another question, I want
you to answer it with an answer.

282
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,481
He's conducting you like, um...

283
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:25,640
Goldie.

284
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:28,560
Did you talk to Mr Miller
about removing your party leader?

285
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:32,680
Sorry, are you getting
Tucker's questions sort of beamed
straight into your brain?

286
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:34,760
Mr Williams.

287
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:37,920
Finally,
on the subject of frustration,

288
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:43,240
would you say it's difficult to steer
policy ideas through your department?

289
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,321
Huh...

290
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,281
Er, yes, there are...

291
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,920
blockages. There is one person
in particular,

292
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:54,040
and, well, you know, I don't want
to identify her... or him,

293
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,640
if she was a man,
but this particular person, er...

294
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:00,080
is... er, rather inept,

295
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,760
and has hampered
a lot of our initiatives,

296
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:05,961
and she, or her-him, is,
um...

297
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:09,280
very difficult to remove.

298
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,640
And so she's a... He is a...

299
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:15,360
They are a stubborn blockage,
shall we say,

300
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:20,840
like, you know, when you get hair
and, um, soap in a plughole,

301
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,680
with... skin flakes.

302
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:25,720
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Williams.
That's, that's fine.

303
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:28,360
Sorry, can I just say...
We are very pressed for time.

304
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,600
Yeah, but I really didn't want
the last thing that I said, erm...

305
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm sorry... to be skin flakes.
Thank you.

306
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:37,320
When did you first
become aware of Mr Tickel?

307
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:41,680
When he became the only, erm,
key worker

308
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:45,080
to refuse our offer
of alternative accommodation.

309
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:48,040
Then he sort of dropped off my radar.

310
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,360
The next thing I knew,
he was sewing badges on his tent

311
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:54,640
and shouting abuse
through a loudhailer.

312
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:57,760
Did you ever feel yourself
to be culpable in any way for his...

313
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,760
for his homelessness?

314
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:03,641
Look, he was homeless only in
the sense that he had no home. Er...

315
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:10,520
No, no, a housing association
flat was found, which he declined.

316
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,640
The POLICY didn't make him homeless.

317
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:16,600
The policy of selling off
the block of flats where he lived.

318
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,000
He made a positive decision
to be homeless.

319
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:23,441
It's the difference between
being punched in the face
and punching yourself in the face.

320
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,320
Um...

321
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,840
Well, and why do you think,
to use your phrase,

322
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,920
he punched himself in the face?

323
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:34,400
Why? Well, because he was mentally,
er, er...

324
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,960
Because he... he had, er...

325
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,640
mental issues.

326
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:41,120
The e-mail leaked to The Guardian,

327
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:45,560
which you'll find on pages
276 to 277 in the evidence,

328
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:50,200
one of your advisers
describes Mr Tickel as...

329
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:52,680
erm, "fucking Florence Shiteingale".

330
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:55,400
Do you not feel that's, er,
a little callous?

331
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:59,240
This is, this is
rough and tumble office banter,

332
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:03,320
schoolboy showers stuff,
and schoolgirls' showers, er...

333
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,601
Not that... I mean, not,
not literally, but, er...

334
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:11,120
Are you familiar with the phrase
"data smuggling"?

335
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,480
Data... what?

336
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:17,120
Passing on data from a closed system
to an unauthorised source
in exchange for money.

337
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:20,120
Oh, yes, I... I...
Well, seems everyone's at it.

338
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,000
A...are you at it, Mr Mannion?

339
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,520
No, I'm... I'm... I'm not very good
with technology.

340
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:31,600
The Papermate pen is still
cutting-edge technology
as far as I'm concerned.

341
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:34,360
Writes upside-down, you know!

342
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:38,440
You've told the enquiry
that you didn't feel at all guilty

343
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,680
over Mr Tickel's death.

344
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:43,880
Well, I... I felt bad.
B... but not guilty.

345
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,720
I didn't kill him,
I've never killed anyone.

346
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:49,800
Noted, but I mean, do you think
you could've made a difference

347
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:52,520
if you had been contactable
that day? Why?

348
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:56,040
He wasn't trying to call me.
I... I'm not The Samaritans.

349
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,400
In fact,

350
00:17:57,401 --> 00:18:01,960
apparently, tonally,
I have a very depressing voice.

351
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:05,080
Mr Mannion,
do you know Mr Alastair Leyton,

352
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,641
a senior executive at The Times?

353
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,320
Yes.

354
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,680
Did you ring Mr Leyton on 25th April

355
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:16,880
to tell him that Mr Tickel's medical
records had been unlawfully obtained

356
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:20,280
and that this might form the basis
of an explosive news story?

357
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:23,200
Did I, er, ring him on that day,
do you mean?

358
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,000
I, well, I can't remember.

359
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:27,920
Well, did you ring him
on any day telling him?

360
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:30,880
Look, I came into politics
to make a difference,

361
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,760
t...to dare, to get things done,

362
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,920
n...not to leak things,

363
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:38,920
or... or spin, or... or blag,

364
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:41,080
or... smuggle,

365
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:44,160
but to serve, with honest, hard work.

366
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,480
To do.

367
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:49,441
And did you DO something? Did you
contact your friend at The Times?

368
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:52,361
No, I... I didn't do that.

369
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:56,680
Perhaps we could start
by just giving us an idea

370
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:59,721
of what a... You know,
what a special adviser does?

371
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:03,360
Um, er...

372
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:07,240
Well, technically, essentially,
we just advise a minister.

373
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:11,160
Erm, sort of, media strategies,
political strategies...

374
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,401
that sort of thing.

375
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:16,120
But you're not permanent
members of the Civil Service?

376
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,040
Er, no, they're like the...
the worker ants.

377
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,720
We're more like...
Er, well, not the queens.

378
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:25,840
That would be, er, Peter Mannion and
to a lesser extent Fergus Williams.

379
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:30,600
We're more like the solider ants
that defend the queens.

380
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,600
Would you like to add anything,
Mr Kenyon?

381
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,960
Yes, I'm not sure
that the ant analogy helps...

382
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,441
at all.

383
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:45,081
Mr Smith, how would you characterise
your relationship with Mr Kenyon?

384
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:51,280
Er, well, I... I... I think
when you get two silverbacks
like Adam and I in a room,

385
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:55,120
there's always going to be
a certain amount of chest-beating,
but, erm...

386
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,640
there's a mutual respect.

387
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,721
Would you agree, Mr Kenyon?

388
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:01,601
Yes.

389
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:04,840
What about data smuggling?

390
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:07,800
I...is that something
that you were aware of?

391
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,840
Yeah, I mean of... of course I was
aware of it. I think we all were...

392
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:12,121
Absolutely. Yeah.

393
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:15,800
But I would say, I would say
it was, er, it was endemic,
it happens every time.

394
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,760
Endemic?
It's commonplace.

395
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:21,400
Hospitals, er,
anywhere with public information.

396
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:24,800
GPs, passport offices,
you know, you name it,

397
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:27,560
they've all been known
to slip information for money.

398
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,840
Do any of you know
of specific individuals

399
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:34,360
who will offer this...
this information trade?

400
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,800
No. I don't, no. No.

401
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,520
Right, so just to clarify,
you say that it's endemic...

402
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,040
Rife, absolutely.

403
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,920
But you don't know anyone
who actually does it?

404
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:43,960
No. No.

405
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:46,360
No, I mean, I could if I needed to.
I...

406
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,440
have a very wide web of contacts.

407
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,680
Right, but it's not contacts...

408
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,040
not contacts that you use? Er, no.

409
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,000
My position is,
if you leak, you're weak.

410
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,880
If I'm going to come at you,
I'm going to come at you head on...

411
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,160
man-on-man.

412
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,921
That's how I like it...
Er, politically speaking.

413
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:09,320
You yourselves were subject to
a leak, weren't you, in The Guardian?

414
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:13,800
How did you feel about the e-mail
containing your thoughts

415
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,000
about Mr Tickel's death?

416
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:20,000
Um, it was, it was shameful
and it was insensitive...

417
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:23,320
Absolutely... and we would like
to apologise for that.

418
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,520
It's, it's dreadful. I agree.

419
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:30,240
I mean, their comments were
absolutely unforgivable, mortifying.

420
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:35,440
"How many Mr Tickels does it take
to change a lightbulb?"

421
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:38,480
"He doesn't have a lightbulb,
he's in a tent."

422
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:39,800
Mmm...

423
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,600
"How do you turn Mr Tickel
into Mr Happy?"

424
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,480
"Lithium."

425
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:47,760
"What's the difference between
Mr Tickel and Captain Oates?"

426
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:50,080
"Captain Oates
has a less stupid name."

427
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:54,160
And one feel that is particularly
cruel, Ms Messinger,

428
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,960
given... Mmm.

429
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,560
Mr Tickel's mental health, erm,
issues.

430
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:01,040
"The fucker's a nutbag."

431
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,160
I'm s... sor... I... I... I...

432
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,600
It... That is not OK.

433
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,160
Sorry.

434
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:10,720
If I could add a... a... a...
a mea culpa here,

435
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,760
rather than-than dancing around it.

436
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:17,240
Others may choose to attempt to
wriggle off the hook of, er, shame,

437
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,640
but, um, I cannot.

438
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:22,000
I cannot deny that my name
is on those e-mails,

439
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:24,520
and yet I do not recognise that man.

440
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:29,480
It is me and yet it is another,
and for that I am, um, truly sorry.

441
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,840
This has been a humbling moment
in my quest

442
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:35,681
to become the man I know I can be.

443
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:42,000
How did you react to the news
of Mr Tickel's death?

444
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:45,160
Shock. Absolute shock.
Fell to pieces. Devastation.

445
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,880
Awful, I mean we couldn't believe
it, it was... tragic...

446
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:49,880
Can I just refer you
to Dr Tara Strachan,

447
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:54,400
who I believe was in your department
for a meeting at that time,

448
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:58,000
and she described
the atmosphere in the office

449
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,360
as an atmosphere of elation,

450
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:04,600
and you, Mr Smith,
were seen to be punching the air.

451
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,400
Do you remember doing that?

452
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,440
I, er... I do not remember to that.

453
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:12,801
S... Well,
if you weren't punching the air,
do you remember what you were doing?

454
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:16,120
I...I cannot say to that.

455
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:19,600
Is it fair to say that information
coming in and out of DoSAC is...

456
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,200
sticky, for want of a better word?

457
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:25,240
Yes. I would certainly agree
with that... to that.

458
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:28,440
If I... if I may speak freely
at this point,

459
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:33,240
I...I think the reason for a lot of
leaks coming out of DoSAC is that

460
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:36,720
it's very hard to get information
out of the official channels.

461
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:39,001
There's a kind of blockage,
is there? Exactly that.

462
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,880
Um, and an information blockage.
Er, and it... and it...

463
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,400
and it has to find its way out
through other... routes.

464
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:49,520
No, it is actually Terri Coverley,
um...

465
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:52,120
who is Head of Press, in name only.

466
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:55,281
Good, yes. It's Terri, definitely.
Yep.

467
00:23:56,801 --> 00:24:01,000
I, Teresa Jessica Coverley,
do sincerely declare and affirm

468
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:04,120
that the evidence I shall give will
be the truth,

469
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:07,200
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

470
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:09,920
Please be seated, Mrs Coverley.
Thank you very much.

471
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,440
Mr Hodge has some questions.

472
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:14,601
Very good to see you this morning,
infamous Terri Coverley.

473
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,201
Why are you smiling?
I'm not smiling.

474
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:23,640
Yeah, or rather I'm smiling,
but it's something I do
when I'm nervous, erm...

475
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,520
And you have a guilty conscience?
No, no. No, no.

476
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:29,480
No, I don't have a guilty conscience
but I do have a guilty face.

477
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,600
Um, I... I...

478
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:35,640
I do blush a lot
and that's a circulation thing,
not a moral thing,

479
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,681
though I do ACT guilty, um...

480
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:41,000
When I was a child, um...

481
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:44,960
my brother's hamster was put
into a remote control... aeroplane.

482
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:48,800
Tragic consequences, and, um...
unfortunately I was blamed for that,

483
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:52,480
though I had nothing to do with it.
It was... it was that I just looked
guilty,

484
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:54,520
so I would ask you...
to bear that in mind.

485
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:59,080
Can you explain to us how
communications works in government?

486
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,040
Well, um, I use an analogy.

487
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,960
Erm...

488
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,560
I like to think that dealing
with the press

489
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:09,400
is not so much herding cats,
it's more herding sheep,

490
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:14,160
and I am the shepherdess,
um... if you like.

491
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:17,800
It's, it's... In order to be
an efficient shepherdess,

492
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:20,041
one needs a number of things,
I mean...

493
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:24,960
Firstly, one needs a whistle,
that's my voice.

494
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:29,160
Secondly, one needs a coat,
and that's my coat.

495
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,400
And thirdly, one needs a dog,

496
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:34,720
and that, in my case,
is a lady called Robyn.

497
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:37,520
How was your relationship
with Nicola Murray?

498
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:39,440
Professionally or personally?

499
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:41,241
Professionally. Not good.

500
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,840
And personally?

501
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:48,320
Not good. No, I mean she resented
me, she was jealous of me, I think.

502
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:49,801
I mean, a lot of women are.

503
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:54,080
It's no secret that... Well,
she's a woman who has issues, er...

504
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:56,000
Major issues.

505
00:25:56,001 --> 00:26:01,000
I felt... If you want me to be
truthful, I felt very sorry for her.

506
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:03,200
And your relationship
with Peter Mannion?

507
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:05,280
Oh...

508
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,680
Yeah, very, very, very good.

509
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:11,320
Um, yes.
Both professionally and personally.

510
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:15,680
Although of course, I... I draw
a... you know, between the two.

511
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:20,920
But he's a lovely man to... work
with, to be... to be with,

512
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:24,360
to be close to, and...

513
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:27,040
Several others have referred
to you as a blockage.

514
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,520
Perhaps they meant...

515
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,201
"buffer".

516
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:35,680
Because I am a buffer
between their heads...

517
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,960
and things
that want to hurt their heads.

518
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,640
Who, in your opinion,

519
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:43,360
was responsible for the PFI e-mail
being leaked?

520
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:45,280
Well, it's not for me to say,

521
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:49,400
and I don't want to be accused
of telling tales before school...

522
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,400
But I think it was Malcolm Tucker.

523
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,120
Why do you think that? Erm...

524
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:55,720
Feminine intuition.

525
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:57,280
Feel it in my water.

526
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,320
Any reasons beyond your bladder?

527
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:04,040
Well, Malcolm can be very, very
tough. I mean, that's no secret.

528
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,720
Can you give me an example?

529
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, he can send
very forthright texts.

530
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,240
Would you say he was bullying?

531
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:12,360
Well, I can look after myself.

532
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:16,160
I mean, I wasn't bullied at school.
I was very popular.

533
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:20,680
But if you were somebody w... who...
who had been bullied at school,

534
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:23,560
somebody who was weak
or not popular,

535
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:27,200
someone like Robyn, for example,
yes, I think Malcolm Tucker

536
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:29,960
would be very, very intimidating
indeed, yes...

537
00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:32,681
You're happy to go on record
saying Malcolm was a bully?

538
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,921
Um... Malcolm is a bully?

539
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,520
Mmm...

540
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:40,841
We'll need a yes or a no.

541
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:44,520
Well, yes, then. Yes.

542
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:48,320
Mr Tucker is in next.
I can't imagine he'll be very happy
about that.

543
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:50,360
No, he won't. No, he won't.

544
00:27:50,361 --> 00:27:53,880
Right... Well, I think we can
leave it there, Mrs Coverley.

545
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,280
Oh, good. Sorry, I mean, thank you.

546
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:59,041
Thank you, thank you very much...

547
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,440
Your Lordship.

548
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:04,240
We may need to call you back,

549
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:07,480
as I feel there are some issues
that still need clarification.

550
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,320
Very good, yes, of course.

551
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,800
Thank you for agreeing to return to
us at such short notice, Mr Tucker.

552
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:16,240
It's no problem. You only appear in
front of the Goolding Inquiry twice,

553
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:18,800
once on the way up and once on the
way down. Let's hope not.

554
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:21,320
Glad to see you again, Mr Tucker.

555
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:23,120
Nice to be here.

556
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:26,120
Did you watch the evidence
given by Terri Coverley?

557
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:30,680
Yes. And I found her quite funny,
without resulting to vulgarity.

558
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:34,960
She was very clear
that she regarded you as a bully,

559
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,440
something you denied
in your first testimony.

560
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:38,841
How do you respond to that?

561
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,640
Um, well, I respond thusly.
That's slander.

562
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:46,080
We're trying to clarify
the culture of communications

563
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,560
over which you presided.

564
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,760
And we have a contradiction
between participants.

565
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:54,520
Well, I would say that I'm someone
who lives and breathes
communication,

566
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:58,240
so I would lend more weight
to my words,

567
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:01,440
rather than to someone who
is just in it for the pension.

568
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:04,160
And how is that not slander?

569
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,160
Well, because that's true.

570
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:10,400
She wants a pension more
than Richard Hammond wants
a punch in the face.

571
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:12,720
You know, she sat here for an hour.

572
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:17,201
You can't have looked at her
and thought this was not a person
who isn't mentally unrobust?

573
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:22,000
I'd like to return to
the Batpeople photograph, if I may.

574
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:25,560
Why not? Yes, one of my triumphs.

575
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:28,041
You said you were cropped
out of the original photo.

576
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,280
Sadly, yes.

577
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:32,840
But they have enlarged.
Can we show the enlargement?

578
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:34,920
They've enlarged that photograph
for us.

579
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:38,240
Now, could we go to the close-up
of the folders

580
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,081
that you're carrying...

581
00:29:41,161 --> 00:29:43,200
in that photograph, there we are.

582
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,920
Who enlarged this? Er...

583
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:47,480
Was it The Guardian that did this
for you? I believe so...

584
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:51,000
I didn't know they were offering
that service. They should do
passport photos.

585
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:54,840
Thank you. They'd double
their revenue if they did
passport photos a couple of times.

586
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:57,520
This is the folder that you are
carrying in your hand,

587
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:00,760
and you see there there's a document
poking up out of the top,

588
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:02,041
on the notepad.

589
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:06,120
Um, there's a series of numbers
written across the top there.

590
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:09,040
Would you be able to tell us
what the first two numbers are?

591
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,840
I don't... Well, they look like
telephone numbers, I don't know.

592
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:15,240
Yes, they are Mr Tickel's
mobile phone number

593
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:17,361
and his ex-wife's landline number.

594
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:19,761
Yeah.

595
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,360
Well, there's nothing untoward
about me having those.

596
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:27,920
Well, actually Mrs Tickel's phone
number was ex-directory.

597
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,520
But let's just leave that
to one side for a moment.

598
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:31,560
Very wise.

599
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:33,920
The bottom set of numbers.

600
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:36,520
Do you have any recollection
as to what they might be?

601
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:37,641
No.

602
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:40,801
Really? You didn't even look.

603
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:43,761
Where are we going with this?

604
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,960
They are Mr Tickel's NHS number

605
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:51,401
and his National Insurance number.

606
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:54,320
Mr Tucker.

607
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:55,441
Ffff...

608
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,521
So why would you have that?

609
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,161
I don't, I don't recall...

610
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:14,600
Sorry, can I just clarify that?

611
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:17,360
Are you saying you don't recall
having them,

612
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:19,321
or you don't recall
how you obtained them?

613
00:31:19,322 --> 00:31:20,681
Um...

614
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:27,201
I don't... recall having them!

615
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:32,880
But it... It appears to me that
you have been rather careless

616
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,640
in this instance, Mr Tucker.

617
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,080
Not at all.

618
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:40,520
No? You were photographed
with these papers,

619
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:44,400
you flaunted your ruse
to puff yourself up,

620
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:47,040
thereby drawing attention
to this photograph,

621
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,720
this photograph which
is now implicating you

622
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,241
in a rather troubling way.

623
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,039
Sorry, I didn't hear
a question there.

624
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,241
Is there a question here?

625
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:58,800
It was an observation, Mr Tucker.

626
00:31:58,801 --> 00:31:59,881
It's an observation,

627
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:02,920
so what are we, is this an inquiry
or an observatory?

628
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,560
It's an opticians.

629
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:07,680
You'd like a question.
Here is a question for you.

630
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:11,401
Do you have an explanation
for having these numbers?

631
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:23,401
Those numbers are not necessarily
what you say they are.

632
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:27,441
Did you request this information?

633
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:30,161
Um...

634
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:37,840
Because, Mr Tucker, if you didn't
request the information, the only

635
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:42,520
other way that it could have come to
you would have been if somebody had

636
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:46,720
supplied you with his NHS number,
which would, of course, be illegal.

637
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:47,800
Yes.

638
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,680
Yes. As would obtaining
his health records

639
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:52,480
and releasing them to the press.

640
00:32:52,481 --> 00:32:55,040
Which you denied all
knowledge of earlier,

641
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,921
and you would have
committed a crime.

642
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:58,000
Well, I...

643
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,680
Mr Tucker, a very serious crime.

644
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:01,161
Well, as you say, I denied it.

645
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:02,921
Yes. And, um...

646
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:05,961
Do you repeat that denial here?

647
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm not sure that you know exactly
how this all works.

648
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:18,441
Mr Tucker,
are you repeating that denial?

649
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,521
Yes, I'm...

650
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:23,641
I... I am.

651
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:26,961
I deny it. I do deny it.

652
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:30,200
Thank you.

653
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:33,240
Of course you were, until quite
recently, Leader of the Opposition.

654
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:34,681
You led your party for...

655
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,000
For two years, yes.

656
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:37,720
For 22 months and nine days.

657
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:39,720
Yes, I was rounding up.

658
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,881
How does it feel to lose that
position so abruptly,

659
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:43,401
and so publicly?

660
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:48,120
Um, horrible. It feels horrible.

661
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:50,840
I think I felt as I would feel

662
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:54,720
if I were being strangled to
death by somebody I trusted.

663
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:57,960
Yes, er, the press have been
unkind to you over

664
00:33:57,961 --> 00:34:01,000
much of your recent career,
haven't they?

665
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:03,240
Well, when you're
a high-profile politician,

666
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:07,800
you expect to be in the public gaze.
Um, I would say that there's a...

667
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:12,080
there's a certain level of extra
scrutiny that is afforded

668
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:15,601
to women in the public gaze,
I'm sure you would agree.

669
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:19,561
Well, you were, um, followed around
for six months

670
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:21,800
by a man dressed as a pork chop.

671
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:24,600
Is that the particular
kind of scrutiny that,

672
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:26,760
that you're saying is reserved
for women?

673
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,481
No, that was just reserved for me.

674
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:33,240
If we, um,
just could turn to tab 16.

675
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:37,160
We have some articles,
there's quite a few, actually.

676
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:40,640
On top of the second page here there
is an exploded view of your face.

677
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:42,841
Yes, well they have, um...

678
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:47,880
They have magnified
a picture of my top lip,

679
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:51,080
er, in the hope of finding
a moustache, which I do not have,

680
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:54,240
I never have had a moustache, so...

681
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:59,801
If we, er, yes, again, if we turn
to the fourth page of this tab.

682
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:03,920
"Frumpy, grumpy and dangerous
to know."

683
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:07,840
"How Nicola Murray went from
gold to lead in six months."

684
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:11,400
I mean, this is typical of, er,
of many of the pieces

685
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,841
printed about you at the time,
about a year ago, wasn't it?

686
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:14,880
Yes, it was.

687
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:17,520
Over 35 major articles.

688
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:19,080
Yes. Yeah.

689
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:23,480
I mean, I suppose the point I'd make
is that we're sitting here

690
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:27,760
in our ivory, um, inquiry.

691
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:32,680
And out there, in the real world,
there is actual news happening.

692
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:36,160
You know, we've got the chief whip's
office, you know,

693
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:39,840
during the course of this morning has
come under very particular scrutiny,

694
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:43,400
there are funding issues, there's
the justice minister crisis

695
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:45,801
that's suddenly sort of spiralling
out of control.

696
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:49,280
I just, I don't quite know why we're,
we're focussing on my moustache.

697
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:50,840
Which I don't have.

698
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm afraid both of those very
recent developments

699
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,640
may well be the subject of police
investigations,

700
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:58,720
so cannot be discussed in this room.

701
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:01,160
Which shows they've done the job.

702
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,200
Done the job?

703
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:06,240
Well, it just seems to me that
somebody is engineering

704
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:11,800
this flurry of press reports in order
to divert attention from the, er,

705
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:15,840
shall we say dramatic revelations
of this inquiry. I mean, it just,

706
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,880
it just seems like there's another
story every five minutes.

707
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,721
And who would that somebody be?

708
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:25,801
Well, um. I...
Maybe we should ask Taggart!

709
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,761
Would you care to make a specific
allegation against someone?

710
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:33,480
Er, no I wouldn't care to, no.

711
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,560
On a completely unrelated matter,

712
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:40,400
Malcolm Tucker was pleased to see
you go, is that a fair statement?

713
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:43,880
Yes, I think that would be
fair to say. Yes.

714
00:36:43,881 --> 00:36:44,960
Mmm.

715
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:49,480
Did he engineer the leaking of the
e-mail that led to your resignation?

716
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:54,600
Er, well, I don't have
any solid evidence

717
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:57,401
that he did that. Um...

718
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:03,600
Sounds like somebody else's career
has just gone into the shredder!

719
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:07,640
I have asked for all mobile phones
to be turned completely off, please.

720
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm sorry, Mrs Murray.

721
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:10,360
Yes, it is...

722
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,880
Mr Hodge.

723
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:14,560
Mrs Murray, we spoke earlier about
your husband's interests

724
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,281
in the key worker, er,
housing sell off.

725
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:18,960
Yes, we spoke about his lack
of interest in fact, to be precise.

726
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:21,480
Yes, well, I've no wish to retread
that particular ground.

727
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,679
No, I've no wish to either,

728
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,961
I mean, I really do want to make that
quite clear.

729
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:28,040
I'm finding this constant reiteration
of my husband's, er,

730
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:31,880
innocent position to be wearing
in the extreme.

731
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:33,081
Mrs Murray, may I remind you

732
00:37:33,082 --> 00:37:35,480
that you did ask for this inquiry
to be set up.

733
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:37,680
I didn't not want an inquiry.

734
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:40,800
Well, presumably there was something
that you feel that needed

735
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,880
to be said, needed to be asked,
about, er, about PFI, about leaking.

736
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:48,400
I think, er, that it's a good idea
to have an inquiry

737
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:50,801
every now and then.
I just think it, um...

738
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,720
Livens things up a bit.

739
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:56,600
On that subject, was it, um,

740
00:37:56,601 --> 00:38:01,640
Mr Tucker who persuaded you call for
an inquiry into Mr Tickel's death?

741
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:04,480
Er, I called for the inquiry

742
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:08,880
after Mr Tucker had spoken to me.

743
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:13,120
Is there a better party
happening elsewhere?

744
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm sorry Mrs Murray, in view of
events developing

745
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:19,160
outside of this room, some of
which may be subject to police

746
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:23,080
investigations, and consequently
to re-examine the parameters

747
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:26,880
of this inquiry, I think we'll leave
it there for the moment, Mrs Murray.

748
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:29,840
Well, yeah, I have actually prepared
a very brief statement,

749
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,920
which I think will
clarify my position on...

750
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,721
I'm afraid we don't have
the time for that.

751
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:37,800
It is very brief. Um, I think it was
Gandhi who once said

752
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:40,840
that an honest man is a gift
from God and a gift to...

753
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:45,200
I'm sure a written submission will
suffice. Thank you so much.

754
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:47,201
I'm now going to adjourn
for a short period.

755
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:51,721
Fuck's sake.

756
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,841
Please be seated. Thank you
for your attendance, Ms Murdoch.

757
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:01,200
Um, Mr Weir has some questions.

758
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:03,681
If I can turn to you, Ms Murdoch.

759
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:08,000
How would you describe your
relationship with Ms Coverley?

760
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:10,400
Do you, do you get on well with her,
with her?

761
00:39:10,401 --> 00:39:11,481
No.

762
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:17,161
Can you, um... Can you expand
on that for us a little?

763
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,840
No.

764
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:23,320
I do not...

765
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:25,560
get on with her.

766
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:28,560
Um, we do not get on.

767
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:29,761
I think we do!

768
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:36,560
There may have been times when we do
get on, and have got on.

769
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:38,921
Um, I do not recall to that.
Thank you.

770
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:45,560
Ms Coverley, you compared Ms Murdoch
to a dog and described her as weak

771
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,680
in our last interview.

772
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:51,201
Yeah, er, I like, I like weak dogs,
I have, I have one myself, so...

773
00:39:56,121 --> 00:40:02,320
Would you say that there is a
culture of bullying within DoSAC?

774
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:05,120
If I could ask you first,
Ms Murdoch.

775
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:08,440
Um, I'd say there was a culture
of bullying ME at DoSAC.

776
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,280
You've experienced bullying there?

777
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:13,360
Well, you know, I, I see them
all standing around, you know,

778
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,321
chattering like squirrels
on Red Bull.

779
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:17,680
When I ask them
what they're talking about,

780
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,520
they usually bark a tea order at me.

781
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:24,560
Or, you know, or call me, er,
the blonde bombshite,

782
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:28,760
if I can use that word,
or some other horrible sweary thing.

783
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:31,320
That's the form that
the bullying takes?

784
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:34,280
And if you refuse to make
your boss's tea, you know,

785
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:36,800
they, they call you
Mariella Shitstrop.

786
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,241
Or Flouncy Sinatra, which,
which doesn't even really work!

787
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:45,080
And can I ask you both about
the leaked Guardian e-mail?

788
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:46,120
Oh, yes!

789
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:49,040
Ask anything you like, I don't
know anything about that bit.

790
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:52,760
Yeah, thank you, Robyn. The e-mail
was leaked from my computer,

791
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:56,040
which is proof that it was not me
that sent it, um,

792
00:40:56,041 --> 00:41:00,400
people do not leak from their own
computers, that's not how it's done.

793
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:01,920
How is it done then, Mrs Coverley?

794
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:03,560
I don't know.

795
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,960
Well, you've just said
something that implies

796
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:07,520
you do know how it's done.

797
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:09,160
I don't know.

798
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:10,560
How do you know, then,

799
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:12,841
that leaking is done from other
people's computers?

800
00:41:12,842 --> 00:41:14,880
Do you learn this from
a leakers' charter?

801
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:17,560
Is it perhaps put up on
a staff notice board?

802
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:20,720
Mr Glenn Cullen informed me.

803
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:26,320
He, er, he told me that if leaking is
done, it's done from other computers.

804
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:27,640
Glenn Cullen.

805
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:30,840
Yeah, I'm not saying anything about
Glenn Cullen himself, you understand.

806
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:34,640
You know, he is a very,
very trustworthy individual.

807
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,480
Borderline priest.

808
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:38,841
No, Terri's right.
I heard it was Glenn who did it.

809
00:41:38,842 --> 00:41:41,240
No, I did not say that
Glenn Cullen did it.

810
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:45,760
No, I, when I, I meant that Glenn
told you, not that,

811
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:48,800
that I meant that Glenn did it.

812
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,999
To return for the moment to
the subject of bullying,

813
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,881
where did Malcolm Tucker
stand in all this?

814
00:41:52,882 --> 00:41:55,840
The department's a horrible place,
and when Malcolm was there

815
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:59,360
he was part of that, you know,
he was the big bully.

816
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:02,480
The other people are horribly rude,

817
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,840
and the rudeness is unnecessary,
but, you know,

818
00:42:04,841 --> 00:42:07,840
I don't get any sense that they've,
they've got a big plan or anything.

819
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:08,921
You know, to be honest,

820
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:11,480
I think they're just trying to get
through the day without

821
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:15,320
cocking up, and drink as many hot
drinks as possible in the process.

822
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:18,720
Moving on, do you know
anything about Malcolm Tucker's

823
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:22,280
involvement with data smuggling?
Specifically private NHS details.

824
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:24,000
I think...

825
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,880
Er, no, no, I'm afraid we don't.

826
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:29,840
I don't. Um, would it be
possible for me to revise my,

827
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:33,040
the opinion that I gave of Malcolm
Tucker on my first appearance?

828
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,600
Your Lordship? Yes?

829
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:37,760
You may revise it, but of course
it will stay on the record.

830
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:40,280
OK, um, well, I just wanted to make
it absolutely clear that

831
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:42,800
having thought about it in the grand
scheme of things,

832
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:46,880
I don't think it is fair to say that
Malcolm is a bully or he's brutal.

833
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:49,880
Certainly not when you compare him
to some of his fellow countrymen.

834
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,080
Well, I think Malcolm's really
difficult, and you do too, Terri.

835
00:42:53,081 --> 00:42:57,000
Don't know why you're being so coy.
It's not like he'll do a... you know.

836
00:42:57,001 --> 00:42:59,600
A you know? What's, what's this?

837
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:01,880
You know,
that story about you in the papers.

838
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:06,520
A story involving me
in the newspapers is not the subject

839
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:10,480
of this investigation, so we are not
going to discuss it any further.

840
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:13,320
Now, er, Miss Murdoch, what
about the use of data smuggling,

841
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:16,040
er, within government?

842
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,280
Do you know anything about that?

843
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:22,640
Yeah, loads. Um, there are dodgy
people in the NHS

844
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:27,001
and the benefits office who talk
to investigators all the time.

845
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:31,681
Do you have experience of this?
Yeah, I've been on the receiving
end of it.

846
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:37,360
I didn't know that the
notes your GP makes are available

847
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:40,160
to your local pharmacist.

848
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:44,440
I went to see my mother's
doctor about her alcohol problem,

849
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:46,440
which is a private family matter.

850
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:48,760
Next thing I knew,
it's all round the village.

851
00:43:48,761 --> 00:43:51,280
Yes.
And now it's all round the world.

852
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:52,401
Exactly.

853
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:56,680
She's saying that that's your fault.

854
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:57,761
How?

855
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:01,240
Oh.

856
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:03,400
As you can see,
Baroness Sureka is not with us

857
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:06,920
and will remain absent while she
deals with the personal allegations

858
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:09,000
published in the Sunday Times.

859
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:12,560
This in no way invalidates
the inquiry, nor does it compromise

860
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:16,800
the integrity of any questioning
conducted by Baroness Sureka.

861
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:17,881
Mr Hodge.

862
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:20,440
Thank you.

863
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:23,520
Er, Oliver Reeder, you were a senior
advisor to Nicola Murray

864
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:26,720
during her time as
Secretary of State at DoSAC.

865
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,920
Yup. I was, er, the senior advisor.

866
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:33,160
Good, and when Ms Murray became
Leader of the Opposition,

867
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:35,081
er, you were also one of her
senior advisors?

868
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:37,160
Yeah. Again, the,
the senior advisor, yeah.

869
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:40,880
I see, and now you're a senior
advisor to Mr Dan Miller?

870
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:43,880
Yeah, yeah, slight, a slightly less
pivotal role with, with Dan,

871
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,320
but part of a, kind of,
larger pivot, really.

872
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:48,880
Mm-hmm, thank you.
Er, well, Mr Reeder,

873
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:51,200
they say that in politics
knowledge is power.

874
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:53,760
True, yes, although that doesn't
mean that Carol Vorderman

875
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,281
should be Prime Minister!

876
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:00,081
Or should I say Stephen Fry,
cos Carol's just maths, but yeah.

877
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:05,440
You've known Malcolm Tucker for,
for some years now.

878
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:06,561
Yes, I have, yes.

879
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:11,200
He seems like a,
an intimidating person. Is he?

880
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,080
Er, well, I mean not, not to me.

881
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:14,360
No?

882
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:16,960
No, er, no, er, no,
although he doesn't,

883
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:19,920
he doesn't suffer fools gladly,
I think that's fair to say,

884
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:22,600
or, um, or clever people,
to be honest.

885
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:24,640
So he's never, er, bullied you?

886
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:28,160
Well, do I, do I look like I could
be bullied by Mr Tucker?

887
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:29,401
I could... No.

888
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,040
Could you turn to tab nine?

889
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:35,241
You'll find it in your,
in your folder there, yeah.

890
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:40,440
Um, we have some, er,
some quotes here.

891
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:45,040
Some evidence from several
civil servants who, who all

892
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:51,960
independently suggest that Mr Tucker,
in fact, regularly did bully you.

893
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:54,840
"Mr Tucker threatened to remove
Mr Reeder's appendix,

894
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:57,400
"throw away Mr Reeder,

895
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:00,840
"and appoint the useless flap
of colon as special advisor."

896
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,040
Yeah.

897
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:05,040
Um... Well that's, yes!

898
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,040
That's banter.

899
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:10,560
"Mr Tucker told Mr Reeder that he
would have him smothered,

900
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:14,720
"eviscerated, stuff, fitted with
wheels, and donated to an orphanage."

901
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:16,639
That's, what... cos this
is out of context,

902
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,599
what you don't have there
is my reply.

903
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,799
And so, you know, it's just him.
And what was that?

904
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,199
Er, well, I don't remember
what it was on this occasion.

905
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,679
It would have been, but it would
have been a, you know, kkk!

906
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,121
It would have been a zinger, because
I gave as good as I got,

907
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:30,000
so it's not bullying.
Very good.

908
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:33,320
Is there anything about the leaking
of the so-called PFI e-mail

909
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:36,440
that you feel that this inquiry
should, should be aware of?

910
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:38,161
Oh, God, um...

911
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:40,921
I mean, um...

912
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:43,640
I mean, to be brutally frank,

913
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:45,720
I'm, I'm struggling to
remember here, but...

914
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,720
Well, please take your time.
There's no hurry.

915
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,000
Of course, yeah, I mean I think,
you know, what,

916
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:53,080
what you have to remember,
in this instance, is that on the day

917
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:57,200
that all of that stuff took place,
um, I was in hospital.

918
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,160
So I'm, you know, I'm cut off,
essentially, I didn't have a phone.

919
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:03,040
But I mean, I hadn't mentioned, er,
the use of a phone, I mean...

920
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,520
Yes, no, I know,
I'm simply saying I was...

921
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:08,320
You weren't working
remotely from the hospital?

922
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:11,680
No, no, not remotely, um, er, in,
in either sense. No. No.

923
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:13,360
Did you have any visitors?

924
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:14,401
Erm...

925
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:18,241
You must be able to remember that.

926
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:21,440
Well, if you're not completely sure,
Mr Reeder,

927
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:24,280
you can always check with
the visitors' records.

928
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:27,960
Well, don't, let's not do that, um,
let's not do that for the moment,

929
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:34,000
let me just, if, just give,
bear with me, er, but I did, yes,

930
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:38,760
I think I was visited
by colleagues from the office.

931
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:40,281
Can you give us a name?

932
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:47,240
Er, Malcolm is, um,
is his name, Malcolm's name,

933
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:49,640
Malcolm, Malcolm Tucker visited me.

934
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:52,480
I'm assuming this wasn't a social
visit, what did, er,

935
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:55,800
what did he,
what did Mr Tucker want?

936
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:58,721
He wanted to, he, I mean,
what, what, OK.

937
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:03,400
I mean, I'm really, I'm,
I'm anxious, I'm keen,

938
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:06,120
I'm trying my best to answer your,
er, questions truthfully...

939
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:08,400
I should remind you
you are under oath, Mr...

940
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:12,441
Absolutely, yes, I'm under oath,
so this is... but, but, er...

941
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,680
What you have to understand is,

942
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:18,560
everybody has something on
everyone here, right?

943
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:24,320
So in this circumstance, if you
inadvertently say or do something,

944
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:29,360
um, er, you know, you shouldn't,
then that's it, that's it,

945
00:48:29,361 --> 00:48:32,760
that's it, it's done,
your career is done.

946
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:36,080
You know, look what happened to
a member of this inquiry, right?

947
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,040
So you have to...

948
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:41,080
This is not the place to discuss
those allegations. No, of course.

949
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:42,441
Mr Reeder, if you feel... Yeah.

950
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:46,840
You feel under pressure, am I right?
Is that because of something
that you know?

951
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,080
Yes, no, er, general pressure,
I feel under a, a sort of,

952
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:51,839
just that, it's the jitters of work.

953
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,241
Who leaked the e-mail, Mr Reeder?

954
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:54,880
Glenn, er, Cullen.

955
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:57,800
Er, he was in DoSAC at the time,

956
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,600
and he, er, still had access to
the e-mail, and he hated his life,

957
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:04,360
he, he, you know, he hated Nicola
Murray because she'd previously

958
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:07,880
destroyed his chances
of standing as an MP.

959
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:10,000
Most helpful,
Glenn Cullen is our next witness.

960
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:11,399
Most interesting, thank you.

961
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,161
Oh, well, OK.
That's fine, thank you.

962
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:14,880
Mr Cullen.

963
00:49:14,881 --> 00:49:18,440
I wonder if I could start by taking
you back to that time two years ago.

964
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:22,160
You left Nicola Murray, and you went
to work for Fergus Williams.

965
00:49:22,161 --> 00:49:23,680
Yes, yes I did, that's right.

966
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:27,280
And you found yourself in a
coalition with the very party

967
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:29,960
that you opposed. That must have
been extremely distressing.

968
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:33,200
Er, no, not at all, as a matter
of fact. I was very invigorated

969
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:37,280
by the idea of, er, trying to forge
a new way in politics.

970
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:39,440
Mm-hmm, so all was rosy?

971
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:42,440
Well, um,
can't think of any negatives.

972
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:43,920
No friction?

973
00:49:43,921 --> 00:49:47,481
No, the only F word was fun.

974
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:51,440
Thank you, Mr Cullen.

975
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:52,560
Mr Cullen.

976
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:56,040
Would you say there's a culture
of leaking in the government?

977
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:59,400
Yes, I would. Yes, leaking and lying.

978
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:03,200
To your knowledge have any of your
colleagues lied to this inquiry?

979
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:06,120
Well, I mean, that's a bit like
asking, you know, um,

980
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:07,640
does a cow drink milk?

981
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:09,640
Does it?

982
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:11,520
Probably.

983
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:14,320
But what I meant to say was, er, yes,

984
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:19,761
um, my colleagues lie constantly,
it's a professional necessity.

985
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,360
Have you ever leaked, Mr Cullen?

986
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:26,640
First of all, may I just say, er,
welcome back, Baroness Sureka,

987
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:29,640
big hugs, I'm sure
I speak to everyone here

988
00:50:29,641 --> 00:50:33,480
when I say that we're all thinking of
you, er, and, er, you have been...

989
00:50:33,481 --> 00:50:37,240
I'd rather you, um, swapped the
ham-fisted flattery for actually

990
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:40,640
answering my question,
which was have you ever leaked?

991
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:42,840
Right. No, it's a very simple
question

992
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:45,081
and it's got a very simple answer.
No, I haven't.

993
00:50:45,082 --> 00:50:48,120
Um, you'll be aware of Ollie
Reeder's testimony to the inquiry

994
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:51,080
where he said that you were, in
fact, responsible for the PFI leak.

995
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,281
Yes, I am.

996
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:57,200
But, no, which means to say
I am aware of, of that.

997
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:01,560
But, gosh, you've got to be careful
what you say here, haven't you?

998
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:04,039
You certainly do, Mr Cullen.
Let's hope we're up to it.

999
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,279
Is there any truth at all
in Mr Reeder's accusations?

1000
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,641
Absolutely none whatsoever.

1001
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:12,080
He's talking out of his...
out of his other cheeks, if you...

1002
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:14,361
Why would Oliver Reeder
suggest that you were behind

1003
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,240
the PFI e-mail leak, then?

1004
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,800
I've absolutely no idea.

1005
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:21,680
It's very difficult for me
to get into the mindset of somebody

1006
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:27,320
so entirely self-serving and,
um, spiritually ugly.

1007
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:30,360
I mean, anyone who's been unfortunate
enough to have come across

1008
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:33,281
Ollie Reeder will know that
he is a genuinely...

1009
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,920
atrocious person.

1010
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:40,480
Mmm. Do you believe Mr Reeder was
trying to cover himself
in that case?

1011
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:43,760
Well, I do believe he has the
emotional tools for the task.
Yes, certainly.

1012
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:46,561
Do you believe that Ollie Reeder
was behind the leak?

1013
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,400
No.

1014
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:51,161
You see...

1015
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:56,880
A leak of this magnitude
would require

1016
00:51:56,881 --> 00:51:59,880
one essential item
that Ollie lacks.

1017
00:51:59,881 --> 00:52:02,000
And that's a spine.

1018
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:06,520
He is a man without a spine,
he is a man worm,

1019
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:10,520
he's a writhing mollusc without
any strategies or convictions,

1020
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:15,120
he simply slimes his way into
the nearest crack every night,

1021
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:18,440
and I would like to put on record
that I apologise to this committee

1022
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:22,120
for being the man who brought him
into the world of politics.

1023
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:24,880
The whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

1024
00:52:24,881 --> 00:52:27,520
Thank you for returning to this
inquiry, Mr Tucker.

1025
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:29,120
That's no problem, no.

1026
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:32,000
I had a hair appointment, but I
think they can fit me in next week.

1027
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:34,401
There's no need to be so flippant
about this inquiry.

1028
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:37,240
Well, it's just, you know, you keep
asking me the same questions,

1029
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:40,400
I can't really help it
if you don't like the answers.

1030
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:42,561
Maybe you could try a little
harder in answering.

1031
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:45,160
I'm amazed you've stayed at the top
of politics for, for quite

1032
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:48,280
so long with such apparently
poor powers of recall.

1033
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:50,400
Maybe it's my age.
It's good to see you back.

1034
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:52,521
Thank you. Nice to see you too.

1035
00:52:53,521 --> 00:52:55,560
At your last appearance
at this inquiry,

1036
00:52:55,561 --> 00:52:57,961
you admitted that you have leaked.
Is that correct?

1037
00:52:57,962 --> 00:53:01,440
Well, everyone leaks. Many, many
people who appeared here in

1038
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:05,840
front of you, er, have leaked, but
they've just lied about it to you.

1039
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:09,360
Mr Tucker,
that's an incredibly serious charge,

1040
00:53:09,361 --> 00:53:12,080
do you have any evidence to
substantiate that allegation?

1041
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:14,640
Well, you will forgive me
if I don't do your job for you.

1042
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:17,360
Because if you can't spot
a sprayed-on halo

1043
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,240
while someone doing a, you know,
"What me, guv?" panto act,

1044
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:23,600
maybe you shouldn't be sitting
behind that desk.

1045
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,720
At your last appearance
we asked you very specifically

1046
00:53:26,721 --> 00:53:31,680
how you came by Mr Tickel's NHS
number and National Insurance number,

1047
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:33,400
and you could not recall.

1048
00:53:33,401 --> 00:53:35,281
Have you had any more time
to think about it?

1049
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:36,960
Yes, I have.

1050
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:38,480
And could you tell us any more?

1051
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,240
No.

1052
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,840
You've got no recollection at all?

1053
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:45,480
No. By the way, you should not be
talking to me about this,

1054
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:47,401
because you've been
a victim of a leaking,

1055
00:53:47,402 --> 00:53:50,480
a very unfortunate victim,
and I have every sympathy with you.

1056
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:53,240
How can you possibly give me
a fair hearing when you've been

1057
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:55,521
a victim of the very crime that
you are accusing me of?

1058
00:53:55,522 --> 00:54:01,281
You are prejudiced, this entire
inquiry, therefore, is prejudiced.

1059
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,160
I can see what you're doing.

1060
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:06,520
It smacks of desperation
and it will not work.

1061
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:07,880
Does it?

1062
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:09,920
No, listen, there you go again,
see that's it,

1063
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,480
you're just rushing to judgment.

1064
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,600
You are totally discredited here.

1065
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:18,320
I am obliged to remind you,
Mr Tucker, that you are under oath,

1066
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:23,800
and if you lie to this inquiry, it
may result in a criminal prosecution.

1067
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:29,040
Sorry, please don't insult my
intelligence by acting as if

1068
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:32,360
you're all so naive that you don't
know how this all works.

1069
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:38,040
Everybody in this room has bent
the rules to get in here,

1070
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:42,240
because you don't get in this room
without bending the rules,

1071
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:45,680
you don't get to where you are
without bending the rules,

1072
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:47,520
that's the way it is.

1073
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:50,120
Mr Tucker, I'm going to give you
one more chance

1074
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,280
to respond to my question.

1075
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:55,880
How did you acquire
Mr Tickel's NHS number

1076
00:54:55,881 --> 00:54:57,840
and his National Insurance number?

1077
00:54:57,841 --> 00:55:00,200
Who said I acquired it?

1078
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:02,120
A photograph.

1079
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:05,960
No, no, the photograph
shows me holding it.

1080
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:07,720
Doesn't show me acquiring it.

1081
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,001
You'd have to ask the person
that gave me the folder.

1082
00:55:10,002 --> 00:55:12,401
Who gave you the folder?
I don't remember.

1083
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,681
You are being deliberately evasive.

1084
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:22,681
I...

1085
00:55:24,281 --> 00:55:25,321
I don't...

1086
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:29,520
recall, you know. I don't,
I don't know, I can't remember.

1087
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:30,680
Very well.

1088
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:35,600
Regardless of how you came by
Mr Tickel's mental health records,

1089
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:38,201
did you then leak them to the media?

1090
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:40,761
I can't recall.

1091
00:55:42,161 --> 00:55:45,281
So that's not a denial?

1092
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:48,161
Je ne remember rien.

1093
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:51,480
Well, if you can't recall,

1094
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:54,640
it leaves open the possibility
that you did leak them.

1095
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:56,560
Let me tell you this.

1096
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,520
The whole planet's leaking,
everybody is leaking.

1097
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:03,120
You know, everyone's spewing
out their guts onto the internet.

1098
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:05,920
Putting up their,
their relationship status,

1099
00:56:05,921 --> 00:56:08,800
and, er, photos of their vajazzles.

1100
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:12,120
We've come to a point where there
are people, millions of people,

1101
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:15,920
who are quite happy to trade a
kidney in order to go on television.

1102
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:19,600
And to show people their knickers,
to show people their skid marks,

1103
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:23,560
and then complain to OK Magazine
about a breach of privacy.

1104
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:28,560
The exchange of private information,
that is what drives our economy.

1105
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:30,360
But you come after me

1106
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:34,160
because you can't, you can't arrest
a land mass, can you?

1107
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:37,081
You can't, you can't cuff a country.

1108
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:39,801
You might as well just go and go,

1109
00:56:39,802 --> 00:56:43,240
you can't lynch that guy there,
can you?

1110
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:45,481
But you decide that you can sit
there, you can judge,

1111
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:47,840
and you can ogle me
like a Page Three girl.

1112
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:51,320
You don't like it?
Well, you don't like yourself.

1113
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:54,320
You don't like your species,
and you know what?

1114
00:56:54,321 --> 00:56:57,361
Neither do I, but how dare you come
and lay this at my door.

1115
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:03,761
How dare you blame me for this.

1116
00:57:05,241 --> 00:57:08,321
Which is the result
of a political class...

1117
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:11,521
which has given up on morality.

1118
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:15,961
And simply pursues popularity
at all costs.

1119
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,601
I am you, and you are me.

1120
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:24,120
Are you finished?

1121
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:26,440
Ah, I'm finished anyway.

1122
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,600
You didn't finish me.

1123
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:30,001
Would you like to stand down?

1124
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:35,321
Thanks.

1125
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:38,679
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

1126
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:40,098
Are you not the human router?

1127
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:42,149
The human router, yes.

1128
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,669
But I think you'll find that leaking
is very much a 3G business.

1129
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:50,349
You know? It's, it's off
the house wi-fi grid.

1130
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,710
I assume you're referring to
the leaking of Mr Tickel's

1131
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:55,589
medical records, and I would like to
say, I find that disgraceful,

1132
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,629
and I would like that on the record.

1133
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,069
Everything we say here
is on the record,

1134
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,229
Mr Williams, that's how this works.

1135
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,310
Well, that's great.

1136
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:07,509
When I was a journalist, OK,
when I, when I was a journalist
at the Mail, I used leaks.

1137
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,829
Now I'm in government,
I do not leak.

1138
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,709
Wayne Rooney, for example,
he used to score goals for Everton.

1139
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,709
And now he plays for,
for Manchester United.

1140
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,349
Now, nobody expects him to score
goals for Everton any more, do they?

1141
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:21,589
I mean, if he did that,
United would give him the sack.

1142
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:25,030
Although you did previously
describe yourself as a shepherdess.

1143
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,869
Now, did you have something
to add to that?

1144
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:32,429
I just, shepherdess, did she say,
did you say shepherdess?

1145
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,349
Yes, I was, I was giving an analogy,
I mean to be, to be fair,

1146
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:37,790
Perhaps it would be more
accurate to describe myself

1147
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,309
as a sheep in shepherdess's
clothing.

1148
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:41,776
Do you follow?

1149
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:44,596
Err, no, not, not, er, completely.
No.

1150
