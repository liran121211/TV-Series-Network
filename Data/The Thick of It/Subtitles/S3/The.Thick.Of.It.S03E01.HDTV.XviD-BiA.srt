1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,840
Ed!
Get Tom Rudd in. Now.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,685
Were offering him Northern 
Ireland, the lucky sod.

3
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:06,865
I think he's expecting 
to be offered Transport.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,615
Well, tell him he's taking the bus 
to George Best airport, right?

5
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:11,975
He's making Paul Remmington
a cabinet minister. 

6
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,145
Rem-tard Remmington.

7
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,455
I mean the guy is an epic... 

8
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:15,385
Fuck-up.

9
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:18,215
He's so dense that light 
bends around him. 

10
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,590
Come on, people! 
Let's get going here. 

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,635
I've got a to-do list 
here, that's longer 

12
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:24,180
than a fucking 
Leonard Cohen song.

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,610
Rem-tard at Energy and Climate change.

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,260
Really? 
I'm not getting that. 

15
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,145
It's not on here. How did you get that?
About Remmington? 

16
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,145
Refresh the page!

17
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:36,145
Yeah... Ah yeah... 

18
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:38,545
Oh, look! Fatty's staying put. 
They're not moving Fatty!

19
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,545
Yeah, well, That's because they don't have
five big blokes and a winch.

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,070
 They couldn't really demote Fatty, 
because he knows too much.
He doesn't know where the Ryvita is kept, does he? 

21
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,280
I've got this re-shuffle going on. 

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,720
The Lemmington Spa 
by-elections coming up.

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,905
I've got more on my plate 
than a spinster at a wedding. 

24
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:55,700
That wasn't a reference to your 
daughter, by the way, Andrew. 

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,690
Well. That's Hugh gone then. 

26
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,955
- That's so sad, isn't it...Hugh.
- Yeah. 

27
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:05,060
You don't give a shit! 

28
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,640
No, I...perhaps I don't. 

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,535
Northern Ireland office - Tom Rudd.
Who's Tom Rudd? Tom Rudd?

30
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:11,765
Isn't he in Harry Potter? 

31
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:16,110
Tom Rudd is army slang 
for standing up buggery. 

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,255
Doug, Doug - Douggie! 

33
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:19,990
Look at you - cock the size 
of Pink Pather's tail. 

34
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,890
Come, have a Kit Kat. 

35
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,330
Uhm... I'm afraid I turned it down, Malcolm. 

36
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,910
You know that 90% of household dust is 
made of dead human skin?

37
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,630
That's what you are. 

38
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,815
To me. 

39
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,720
Doug Hayes is a massive abortion. 

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,345
Again, not a reference to your daughter. 

41
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:35,825
We need somebody to plug 
this DoSAC hole. 

42
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:38,745
Anybody. 
Fucking mammal with a head. 

43
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:41,235
Have you two finished 
emptying your desks yet? 

44
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,925
Yes, don't worry Terri, 
we're all ready to go.

45
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:46,325
I'm just trying to get 
everything organized 

46
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:47,875
for whenever whoever arrives.

47
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,465
They are gonna have 
their own people. 

48
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:52,095
It's gonna be very embarassing if your 
handcream's still in the drawer. 

49
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,460
Handcream?

50
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,020
Yeah, or whatever men have.
I don't know... 

51
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,750
Electric nose-hair trimmers...
...Ex-lax...

52
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,350
Awww... Look at Glenn...
Your face.

53
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,920
On the scrapheap 
at the tender age of 76

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,910
that is no life for you, 
is it - Glenn-nes.

55
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,775
Hey, do you want me 
to call Dignitas?

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,210
I could call Indignitas.

57
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,615
They could come around and shove you out 
of the window, dressed as a clown. 

58
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:15,885
Sam, Sam... 

59
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,555
Get me uhm... 
Nicola Murray. 

60
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:22,335
If she says no, the only other 
candidate is my left bollock ... 

61
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:23,850
... with a fucking smiley face 
drawn on it. 

62
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,965
Ladies and gentlemen... 

63
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,935
May I introduce the 
new Secretary of State ...

64
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:30,290
-Hello
-for the Dept. of Social Affairs

65
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,475
... and Citizenship, 
Nicola Murray. 

66
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:35,320
- Thank you. 
- Hello. Lovely to meet you. 

67
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,840
- Hello, hi. 
- I'm Glenn. 

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,260
- Glenn Cullen. 
- How lovely to meet you. 

69
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,275
-These are just...
Hugh's previous incumbents. 

70
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:46,055
- Ken and Ollie? 
- No Glenn...

71
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:47,485
- Ollie Reeder.
- Right.  

72
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:48,885
- Are you an Ollie or an Oliver?

73
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,155
- I'm whichever you prefer, in fact. 

74
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:52,675
Well okay, Oliver. I like
the name Oliver. 

75
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:54,600
- Well, Ollie. I don't know... 
- Oh, you are an Ollie. 

76
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,275
... don't know why I said that. 

77
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:57,565
- Thank you. 
- Good. 

78
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,910
I'm the ideas man. 

79
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,810
- Sorry... I've gotta...

80
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,845
Thank you. 
Just need a .. one second. 

81
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:06,240
Uhm.. Yes I know. 
But they frog-marched me into it. 

82
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,010
I didn't know...
I had no idea. 

83
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,665
James, be fair! I left
seven fucking messages for you. 

84
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:15,040
Your secretary or whoever 
it is, is useless. 

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,565
I don't think the school thing 
is gonna be a problem. 

86
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:19,185
It's not going to be a problem, cause 
they have vetted me at Number 10.

87
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:22,380
And obviously nobody has 
soiled themselves ... or shot me. 

88
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,260
Great, well I take your warm 
congratulations as implied. 

89
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,865
Fucking... arsehole.

90
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:31,955
- You alright?
- Yes, it's all a bit crazy. 

91
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,940
just feels like my head is made 
entirely of smoke alarms. 

92
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,645
It's all just a bit - ugh! 

93
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,255
Yes, well it was all a bit of 
a shock for us all, you know.

94
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:41,255
- In a good way, in a good way. 
- Good.

95
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,370
Well like twins or tax rebate ... 

96
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,270
Yes, let me continue with the tour. 

97
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,350
That's such a nice chair...

98
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,475
This was Glenn's office. 

99
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:50,045
Is there a chance of getting 
something like that?  

100
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:51,620
Would you like me to have 
it moved to your office? 

101
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,190
- Great, could you do that?

102
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,890
- Right.. Ollie... ?
- Ollie, that's right.  

103
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,735
Glenn and Ollie, what 
I need to know from you... 

104
00:03:56,735 --> 00:04:00,335
All the stuff that Terri's 
not gonna tell me

105
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,040
- the stuff she's gonna keep from me. 
- Oh, huge list. 

106
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,110
- Where the bodies are buried. 
- Exactly. 

107
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,445
- Yes, the plate pits. 

108
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,855
The big cardboard boxes with 
bits of old junior minister. 

109
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:10,620
Just going to sort out 
that policy digest. 

110
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,855
- Lovely. 

111
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,530
Urban renewal is a bit 
of a running sore. 

112
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,375
- In what way? 

113
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,660
Well, it's very woolly and big. 

114
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,440
Like a mammoth. 
(laughter)

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,295
Right... Okay, so uhm... 

116
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:29,110
My big thing... Come in actually. 
Come in to my office

117
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,170
with nowhere to sit 
or put anything.

118
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,360
My primary focus is 
social mobility. 

119
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,915
- That's very much my big thing. 
- Right. 

120
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:40,210
I'm really telling you that really, 
partly to get your take on it

121
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,940
and also so that you can 
start spreading the news  

122
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,485
and printing the posters. 
And, you know.

123
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,390
Fire up the turbo charges, 
set the phasers to equality. 

124
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,710
- It's Murray time! 
- Well, the thing is

125
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,350
and Ollie, please, correct me 
here if I'm wrong

126
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,860
-Oh, I will certainly do that.  

127
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,685
Social mobility and making people 
richer, costs money

128
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:03,175
Yes, and we don't have 
any of that. 

129
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:05,105
If you speak to 
Nick at the Treasury

130
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,320
he will tell you the same

131
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:07,820
with his annoying lisp. 

132
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,180
What you're telling me basically is that 
I'm going to be a woman

133
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,000
with a computer and some pens. 

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,620
Well, it's just the pen budget. 

135
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,035
I mean I have just as 
much real power

136
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:19,830
as those twats who sit on 
either side of Alan Sugar.  

137
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,935
Well... Yes. 

138
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:25,670
Secretary of State, we have some 
clothes for you to look at

139
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,470
- for a press photograph later. 
- Oh.

140
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,980
- We can do this later, maybe?
- Definitely. 

141
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,275
- You're size 16?

142
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,355
- I'm 12. 

143
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:37,455
I'm so sorry, I will get those changed. 
Right away. 

144
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,945
At the moment 
I've got nobody at all. 

145
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,720
Apart from Hugh's guys

146
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,235
who are just kind of 
so fucking patronizing

147
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,640
And cold. Seriously, one of them 
looks exactly like 

148
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,130
he works at menswear at Selfridges. 

149
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,320
I don't know what 
the fuck to say to him. 

150
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
Secretary of State?

151
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,150
- Yes?
- Your fruit salad. 

152
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,980
- Thank you. 

153
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,900
Oh I've just had a couple 
of press calls

154
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,740
Couple of the papers asking about 
your husband and the PFI. 

155
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:12,560
Already? My God.
They're so on it. 

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,755
Could you brief me? 

157
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,895
Yes, sorry... It's honestly nothing. 

158
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:19,550
James works for Albany, 
which is the company 

159
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,895
that was awarded the PFI prison's 
contract by this departement. 
-Yes, I remember.

160
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:26,830
I know that sounds bad, 
but actually James wasn't at Albany

161
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,085
when the contracts were awarded 
and I wasn't here, so

162
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:31,460
- Yeah, maybe.
- It's not a conflict of interest. 

163
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,335
I think you could just run 
that by Malcolm. 

164
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,855
He's on his way. 

165
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:37,210
Not Malcolm... He's what now? 
Coming in? 

166
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,050
Yes, he'll be up in 25 seconds.

167
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,845
Okay... Fuck. 
Right. 

168
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,570
So Malcolm Tucker, Malcolm Tucker,
Malcolm Tucker! 

169
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,875
Malcolm.... I'm not nervous, 
you know, it's just... 

170
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,545
Malcolm's sort of one of those 
things that I'm aware of

171
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:53,180
without ever having really 
come into contact

172
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,365
... with. Like a rat. 

173
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,245
No, he'd hate that. 
He thinks of himself as a sort of 

174
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:00,095
thin white Mugabe. 

175
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,740
Do you think? 

176
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,945
Because if you are 
worried about Malcolm

177
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,700
we have amassed a few tips

178
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,620
how to deal with him, 
over the years. 

179
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,695
We have worked out when he's 
gonna give you a verbal colonic

180
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,335
and some avoidance maneuvers. 

181
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:14,585
Tai-kwon-spin! 

182
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:16,960
Is this the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency? 

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,140
- Malcolm Tucker! 
The real deal. 

184
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,090
- Hello. 
- The real deal. Good to see you. 

185
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,880
You're looking great. 

186
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,745
All right, hens and bracket. It's time 
to hang up your lady cocks. 

187
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,045
Nicola Murray. Here you are. 
Secretary of state. 

188
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:31,305
For the Departement of Social Affairs 
and Citizenship. 

189
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:34,360
Yep, I now have one the of the longest 
job titles in Western politics. 

190
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,295
Thank god I don't have to wear 
a lapel badge. 

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,660
It's a pity we couldn't just make 
an abbreviation of it, you know

192
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,810
like PFI. 

193
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,595
Which I think stands for 
Pretty Fucking Embarassing. 

194
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,520
If you're a bit sloppy 
with the details. 

195
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,705
Which clearly your 
fucking husband is. 

196
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:51,955
Okay, look. 
James works for Albany, fine. 

197
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,845
He wasn't even working there when
the contract was awarded.

198
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:57,235
- Don't worry... That was just me.
- Okay, right. fine. 

199
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,380
That's the sort of thing 
the press will throw at you. 

200
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,005
I mean - you step out of line, 
they'll be all over you. 

201
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,410
Like a pigeon on a chip. 

202
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:04,680
Is that you chair? 

203
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,955
Oh god, yeah. It's cool, 
isn't it? 

204
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:09,860
It's got lumbar support. 

205
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,930
Bin it. 

206
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,560
People don't like their politicians 
to be comfortable. 

207
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,220
They don't like you having expenses, 
they don't like you being paid

208
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,475
they'd rather you lived in 
a fucking cave. 

209
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,120
Okay, fine. So... 

210
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,325
What should I be sitting on? 
Should I just get an upturned KFC bucket?

211
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:26,175
A fucking normal chair. 
Right?

212
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:29,160
Not a fucking massive 
vibrating throne

213
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,555
Malcolm must be hating this. 

214
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:33,325
All these bright fresh new 
ministers to blood in. 

215
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,140
and to plan a by-election. 

216
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,155
If it's any consolation to you 

217
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:38,115
a little bit of you will always be 
in this departement 

218
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,600
because she's got your chair. 

219
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,405
Doesn't she? She has got your chair, 
and in fact your dandruff. 

220
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,100
Hahaha. If I go, that chair
is coming with me.

221
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,800
You know those old men you see 
who go to the park to read the paper

222
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,025
That'll be you. 

223
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,360
You could go in your chair. 

224
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,050
They'll make you king of 
all the tramps. 

225
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,460
So uh... You have three kids, yeah? 

226
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,410
- I've got four. 
- Four? 

227
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,730
Katie's sixteen, she's the oldest. 
She's just left school. 

228
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,740
Not going to a college, 
to a university ?

229
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,985
Uhm, she's a bit of a rebel.

230
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,175
What sort of a rebel? 

231
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:09,695
What are we talking here
Are we talking a pierced navel 

232
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,675
or holidays in Pakistani 
training camp? 

233
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:15,105
It's chiefly heroin. 

234
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:17,950
Although she has cut down since 
getting pregnant 

235
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,380
by that Nigerian people 
smuggler, because

236
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,500
the track marks would have 
affected her porn carrier. 

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,580
- I'm sorry to disturb. Uhm.

238
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,785
- Morning Malcolm
- Morning, Terri. 

239
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:28,765
Just wanted to give you 
a few things - here

240
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,565
that's change from 
the fruit salad 

241
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:33,350
this is this morning's paper 
- do excuse me -

242
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,735
I'm surprised that you 
hadn't vetted me

243
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,040
I thought you'd know 
about the kids. 

244
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,155
It's just that you were a sort of 
late-ish kind of appointement. 

245
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,165
That didn't quite give 
me the time to

246
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:46,880
to fuck the i's and 
fist the t's

247
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,745
as Robert Robertson might say. 

248
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:52,705
Sound to me like, she's only bringing
in one other person, so 

249
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:56,340
I wonder whether she might keep
one of us on permanently.  

250
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,865
Thank God I'm safe. 

251
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,915
Gee! We know you're safe, Terri! 

252
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,020
How do we know you're safe? 

253
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,830
We know you're safe, because
you keep using the word "safe" 

254
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,300
like bloody Jim Bowen. 

255
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,650
You've got a dull sack, 
that's safe

256
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,735
do you want to go for 
the treasury, young lady. 

257
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,480
Okay. This is Walton. 

258
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,620
What about these other kids. 

259
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,595
What ages are they? 

260
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:16,355
They're 11, 9 and 5. 

261
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:17,970
Eleven? 

262
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,095
-Uhm.

263
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:21,570
So that's a secondary school? 

264
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,545
No, she's still at a primary - 
state primary. 

265
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:28,080
Lovely little school 
with terrible SAT results, 

266
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,130
but a really good kind of 
broad demographic. 

267
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,345
and steel band. 

268
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:34,795
She will be going to a secondary school,
what - in September? 

269
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,290
Yeah, yeah. 

270
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,020
So... uhm... 

271
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,070
I can see where 
this is going. 

272
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,535
Uhm.. it's not 
an issue. 

273
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,375
Great! If it's not an issue I can
just fucking toddle off then

274
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,210
I will go and have a nice relaxing
wee sleep under my duvet. 

275
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,005
Probably will have to tug myself off 
cause I'm so fucking relaxed about that. 

276
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:52,925
Cause I know there is
no fucking issue here. 

277
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,425
Right? 

278
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,570
She's not going to 
a comprehensive, Malcolm. 

279
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,535
She's going to a local
independent school. 

280
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,710
Jesus H... fucking Corbett. 

281
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,240
Do you honestly think... 

282
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,465
Do you honestly believe that as a minister 
you can get away with that? 

283
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:12,240
You are saying that all your 
local state schools 

284
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,945
ALL the schools that this governement 
has drastically improved

285
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:19,485
are knife-addled 
rape sheds 

286
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:20,520
and that's not 
a big story? 

287
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,455
For fuck's sake! 

288
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:25,050
Sort it, or abort it! 

289
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,440
Let's get this clear. 

290
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,570
My family is off limits. 

291
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,605
Alright? This job is not going to get 
anywhere near my husband

292
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:34,405
and my kids. 
Just doesn't. 

293
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:34,960
Of course it fucking does. 

294
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,785
as per the wee bar code

295
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:39,030
and the serial number 
under your right armpit

296
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,320
you are now built and owned
by the state 

297
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,150
and you're under the spotlight 
24 hours a day, darling! 

298
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:49,110
You know what you are? 

299
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,630
You're a fucking 
human dart-board. 

300
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,675
and Eric fucking Bristow's on the oche 
throwing a million darts

301
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,365
made of human shit 
right at you. 

302
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:58,690
Can you take that? 
Can you? 

303
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,880
Okay, look. You - 
the all-swearing eye -

304
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,155
You didn't even know how 
many kids I had 

305
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,175
You had to ask me. 

306
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:08,080
So who on Earth in the press is 
gonna even know or care? 

307
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,770
Do you remember 
The Big Breakfast? 

308
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,295
- Remember that program?
- Yes! 

309
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,995
Remeber how Chris Evans started that? 
D'you remember it was a big success?

310
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:16,425
And then they had that guy 
Johnny Vaughan - remember him? 

311
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:19,090
Everybody loved him. Fuck knows why
but they loved him. 

312
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,600
Do you know what 
this is here?

313
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,495
This here - 
is fucking series 10. 

314
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,190
of the Big Breakfast. 

315
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,400
And you know 
what you are?

316
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,820
You're the fucking 
dinner lady

317
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:31,050
that they've asked to come
to present the show. 

318
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,925
The reason I didn't know 
about you and your children

319
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:37,130
is you are so low

320
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,175
down 
on the list

321
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,145
of candidates for this job 

322
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:44,065
I didn't even have the chance 
to look into you. 

323
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
So low. 

324
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:52,225
Waaaaay waaay waaay way 

325
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,745
... low. 

326
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:59,010
You are now being scrutinized for 
what you wear, what you say. 

327
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,730
For your hair, 
your shoes 

328
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,790
your fucking earrings, 
your fucking cleavage

329
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,415
and your dress - which
by the way 

330
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,050
is way too loud. 

331
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,890
- Too loud?
- Yeah! I'm getting fucking tinnitus here. 

332
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:11,460
Look. 

333
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,145
Your crooked husband -
I can make go away. 

334
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,835
But your crooked husband combined 
with you being worried about 

335
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:24,070
your underaged daughter coming 
home up the duff

336
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,615
from some truanting bastard -
I cannot. 

337
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,570
She goes to the comp - okay? 

338
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:36,540
Oh, God. 

339
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,500
You Glenn, yes 
and or Ollie. 

340
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,230
Terri! 
Just a quick update really.

341
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,115
- How did it go?
- It was all very positive

342
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,050
we sort of know where 
we all stand now

343
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,855
the PFI thing you know about
- not a problem, Malcolm's fine.

344
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:52,145
Second little thing I've 
just apprised Malcolm of

345
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,245
is that my eleven year-old daughter 
will be going to a private school. 

346
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:56,995
- Oh, for fuck's sake! 

347
00:13:56,995 --> 00:14:00,905
- Sorry...
- It's a personal issue 

348
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:02,440
I'm not Education Secretary, so

349
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,700
Nor will you be!

350
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:05,860
Secretary of State - with respect -

351
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,550
this is political suicide. 

352
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,115
- Thank you very much 
for your support, Glenn.

353
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,290
I was hoping there was 
another way around it. 

354
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,450
Sorry, there is no way around it, 
it's horrible, 

355
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,910
It's a bit like Dover. 

356
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,285
You know, if you wanna
go to France

357
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:18,475
you've got to go through it. 

358
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:20,190
We don't have to go through 
Dover to get to France

359
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,925
you can go through Weymouth, 
through Portsmouth, there's plenty ...

360
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:22,705
I don't want to go to Dover.

361
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:24,280
I don't want to go to 
fucking Dover or France!

362
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,970
I just want my daughter to 
be happy at school. 

363
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,450
Great, well that's good, 
that's excellent. 

364
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,300
That's .. you've got principles, 
the common thing ... 

365
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,405
For fuck's sake Ollie, 
there is no point

366
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,150
telling her just what she
wants to hear, is there?

367
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,080
So Terri? 

368
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,040
Yes? I'm sorry, but personal 
issues are not my brief. 

369
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,635
Okay, thank you 
for that. 

370
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,670
The chair -
the lumbar chair

371
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,870
has to go to skip,
Malcolm insisted. 

372
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,735
Oh, okay. 

373
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:47,585
Not now, cause I've got
work to do

374
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:50,450
but if you could get somebody...
Apparently, if you have a nice chair

375
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,030
it turns you into 
Saddam Hussein. 

376
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,030
The entire building 
smells of cold sores.

377
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,760
Ah, so -
first cabinet meeting.

378
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,700
How do you feel? 

379
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,615
Anxious, nervous,
worried?

380
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:05,040
Well she probably wasn't until you said
"anxious, nervous, worried?"

381
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,275
Now you are an advert 
for Tarmazipan. 

382
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,795
Going sick all over the Foreign Secretary
- would that look bad?

383
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:12,660
No - Jeffrey House shat himself on
his first morning. 

384
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,690
Ollie, please! 

385
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,490
Well I find that kind of tomfoolery 
very tiresome. 

386
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,335
Sorry - Terri,
what's the driver's name?

387
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,470
It always makes you look more human
if you know their name

388
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,095
I am human, so.

389
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:22,970
It's Elvis. 

390
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,310
Seriously, what's
his name. 

391
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,440
No, it's Elvis. 

392
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,040
He's from the Ukraine, 
you see. 

393
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,985
And nobody can pronouce
the real name

394
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:34,370
So they call him Elvis on 
account of the - uhuhuh. 

395
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,175
What?

396
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,870
Take a peak. 

397
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,620
Hey, what's wrong with you? 

398
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,770
You look like you've shat 
a lego garage or something. 

399
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,765
Jim Lane's daughter is standing as an 
independent in Lemmington Spa. 

400
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:47,560
(noises)

401
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,610
This is going to split
our vote. 

402
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,635
Do you thing we're 
in trouble?

403
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,180
Maybe we should have chosen
her over Liam Bentley. 

404
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,710
No - she thinks just because her 
dead fat-ass dad was an MP

405
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,525
that gives her the right to be 
our candidate. 

406
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,275
No no no. This isn't 
tsarist Russia.

407
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,395
This isn't fucking Dimblebys.

408
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:00,040
What do we do?

409
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,665
We'll send everyone up there. 

410
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:03,990
To support Liam Bentley, 
including the Prime Minister.

411
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,150
You want to send Tom
up there?

412
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,785
Yeah, fuck it, he'll be alright, as 
long as he doesn't do the smile.

413
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,445
You hit the phones, right? 

414
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,805
I'll be with you in two shakes 
of a crying baby. 

415
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,855
Wow. 

416
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,505
Black widow. 

417
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,595
Malcolm. 

418
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:20,150
Congratulations - first cabinet. 
I heard you wowed them.

419
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,490
The meeting's literally just finished,
how would you know that? 

420
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,425
PM texted me - he's
very impressed. 

421
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:26,455
You could be nominated for 
best newcomer. 

422
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:27,015
Really?

423
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,215
No. 

424
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:30,605
You knew Jim Lynn, 
didn't you?

425
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,240
The dead fucker. 
God rest him. 

426
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,830
Yeah, I did a bit
back home. 

427
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,725
Very sad - all those weeks
on life support. 

428
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:37,990
Nice chair. 

429
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,185
Sad? Lying on you back, getting fed 
nutrients through a tube?

430
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,875
It's my idea of a fucking
holiday. 

431
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:45,035
How would you like to 
go to Lemmington? 

432
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,700
When?

433
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,980
This morning. 

434
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,525
It's never too soon
to go to Lemmington. 

435
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,390
I've just taken over a departement,
I have a hell of a ...

436
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,805
You've been asked by the PM

437
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,725
specifically to pop 
along to Lemmington 

438
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,365
and do some photo-ops 
with Liam Bentley. 

439
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,720
Supporting him, yeah?

440
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,710
I don't really have any 
choice, do I?

441
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,280
Of course you have
a choice. 

442
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,660
You can decide exactly 
how you say "yes".

443
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,280
You can do it with a voice. 

444
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,155
Have fun with it. 

445
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,960
Yes.

446
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,875
In my own voice. 

447
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,470
I look forward to 
toasting your success. 

448
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,045
Have a lovely time in 
Lemmington, yeah?

449
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:20,335
Can I go?

450
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,065
Of course you can 
fucking go. 

451
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,165
Jesus.

452
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,785
Never easy. 
Never fucking easy. 

453
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:32,765
- Yeah, hi. 
- Hey. 

454
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,240
Um, yeah. 

455
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
- Glenn.
- Glenn ... 

456
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,375
What do you think of 
Glenn?

457
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,350
Huh. Well it's sort of like asking
what do I think of skirting boards

458
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,895
I mean - I assume that we need them
but I'm not really sure why. 

459
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:47,785
I'm finding him
very old-school. 

460
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,625
Well, yes. 
He's ancient school, really. 

461
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,340
Glenn - he used to get his packed 
lunch nicked by Plato

462
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,755
he's an old ...

463
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:55,615
So I'd like you to come up to
Lemmington with me. 

464
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,430
Oh great, yeah.
Well, it's a... 

465
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,195
it's my favourite of 
the spa towns. 

466
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,035
Apart from all 
the other, so.

467
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:05,175
Okay, lovely. So if you could 
just get

468
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:07,050
uhm, Terri in. 
Please.

469
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,875
Sure! 

470
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,720
- Terri!
- Yeah? 

471
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,065
You're on. 

472
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:13,505
What? 

473
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:17,375
What were you and Bravo Two Zero 
talking about in there? 

474
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,795
- Who?
- Her, you know.

475
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,015
Her in there. 
Bravo Two Zero. 

476
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:23,130
Well, I don't know what 
that means, Glenn. 

477
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,580
Yes you do - no, 
I don't mean that, I mean

478
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,525
Juliet Bravo. 

479
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,545
You've completely lost me, 
Glenn. I really ...

480
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,615
Juliet Bravo! She was a 
lady policeman. 

481
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:36,440
A lady policeman? Did the last 30 
years not happen to you?

482
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,595
- What?
- Have you been asleep

483
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:40,775
in a box of straw like a Blue Peter tortoise

484
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,810
Lady policeman. 

485
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,470
I've asked Ollie to come up
to Lemmington with me. 

486
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,475
- Ollie?
- Yeah. 

487
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:48,960
I can't really connect
with Glenn. 

488
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,935
You think I shouldn't have 
asked Ollie?

489
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,580
No no - I didn't say that. 

490
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,500
You sort of did with 
your face. 

491
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,770
No no, Ollie has got
plenty of good points. 

492
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,705
It's just he's ...

493
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:05,490
well he's a little bit morally bankrupt
and massively self-centred.

494
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,905
And a tiny bit dangerously
unreliable. 

495
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,605
But he has got a lot of good points, 
as I say. 

496
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:11,740
Great - well 
thank you. 

497
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,125
Can you just send
Glenn in for me?

498
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,815
Glenn! 

499
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,440
Nicola would like
to see you. 

500
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,545
- Hi Glenn, take a seat. 
-Thank you. 

501
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:30,320
You ever worked in 
retail, Glenn?

502
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,430
No, never have.

503
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,070
Oh, just... 

504
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,070
Uhm, so what do you
think of

505
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,570
Terri - do you 
trust her? 

506
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,020
No. 

507
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,160
Right - cause she just told me she 
sort of prefers you to Ollie. 

508
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:49,290
When I say I don't
trust her - 

509
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:54,535
What I mean is I don't 
trust her around money. 

510
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,605
Really?

511
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:57,265
Blimey, what - she
steals? 

512
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:59,650
No no no no - I'm 
not saying anything like that. 

513
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,385
Cause actually - I got very little
change from my fruit salad. 

514
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:05,005
No no no - let me just
roll back a little bit here. 

515
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,350
Perhaps, uhm... 

516
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,760
all the way to the boathouse. 

517
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,305
Actually, I do 
trust Terri. 

518
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,590
Okay. 

519
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,030
Your chair's gone. 

520
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,375
Oh yes, yeah... 
I had to 

521
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,055
bin it - Malcolm insisted. 

522
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:21,575
But it was my chair. 

523
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:25,020
Oh right, I...
It was 

524
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,475
It was decadent, Glenn.

525
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,435
It was a chair 
gone mad. 

526
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,700
Do you know where
it's gone?

527
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,490
Skip. 

528
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,040
Skip. 

529
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm sorry - for your loss.

530
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,665
I paid 600 pounds 
for that chair. 

531
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,430
How's her hair? 

532
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,785
Terri, you'll be delighted to know 
that the Secretary of State is now

533
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,780
checking her hair 
in my glasses. 

534
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,215
You're on TV live. 

535
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:56,855
What now? 

536
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,835
You're on now -
apparently.

537
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,740
Why are you 
squatting down?

538
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,250
Ah - there she is. 

539
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,145
Malcolm - Nicola
will be there in a minute. 

540
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:05,665
No, you're in the shot 
actually, Ollie.

541
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,335
Why am I in the shot?

542
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,445
* Nicola Murray! *

543
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:11,575
Hi everybody, 
well - uhm

544
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:13,340
I'm very pleased 
to see

545
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,365
a number of familiar 
faces here - Hello! 

546
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:16,750
Isn't see good 
with the people?

547
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,605
Yeah, she is. 

548
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,125
But then - so is Kate Thornton

549
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,805
and she's wanted
for war crimes. 

550
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:21,585
Ladies and gentlemen

551
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:24,600
let's take a look at Liam 
Bentley's election poster.

552
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,475
Mrs Murray, do you feel 
your husband's involvement

553
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:29,525
in the PFI's prisons contract 
compromises your position? 

554
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,490
Well, I'm just here to support 
Liam Bentley

555
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,070
You don't think there's
a conflict of interest?

556
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,865
No - I really don't.

557
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:37,770
- Excellent.
- She's handling this very well, Malcolm. 

558
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:39,980
You think?

559
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,990
Will you resign,
minister? 

560
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,040
Oh shut up, 
you twat!

561
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,795
... and I think they're 
interested also in

562
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:48,405
greater opportunities 
for social ...

563
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:49,715
Looking terrific, Ollie. 

564
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:50,820
What? Sorry?

565
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,700
A little bit edgy. 

566
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,510
Can you please make sure

567
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,180
Nicola's right in the middle. 

568
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,230
She doesn't look 
important enough

569
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,415
could you just -
move her over. 

570
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
- Could you move for a second. ?
- Right here?

571
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,140
Perfect! 

572
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,540
- Perfect, that looks terrific. 
- No no no ... 

573
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,330
No! 
Jesus - Terri!

574
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,465
The letters!

575
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:06,210
That's great.

576
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,565
What does is say, 
Terri?

577
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:08,960
- It says Liam...
- No it doesn't 

578
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,725
- ... Bentley. 
- Not there it fucking doesn't!

579
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,265
- Back where you were -
please, stay 

580
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,170
This is obviously 
the hot spot. 

581
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,900
Well okay, if you crop the ...

582
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,230
Well of course if you crop 

583
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,590
Malcolm! 

584
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,480
You tried. 

585
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,695
You really tried. 

586
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:24,935
Did your best, 
mate. 

587
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:25,875
Very happy with it. 

588
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,945
You both did
your best. 

589
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:27,915
Thanks. 

590
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,750
Big smile! 

591
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,560
Hi darling! Did you see
mommy on the telly? 

592
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:36,260
I know, 
did I look funny? 

593
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,975
It did, good boy.

594
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:40,525
It said "I am bent".

595
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,375
Have you uhm...

596
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,400
Yes. 

597
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:52,415
Yeah, is this now official 
news that's calling?

598
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,980
Great - someone's just sent 
me a Youtube clip

599
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,200
which is me, in front of
the "I am bent" sign

600
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,645
randomly intercut with 
bits from Family Guy. 

601
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,710
It's not even funny! Why do people
fucking do that on Youtube!

602
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,155
Look - let's learn and grow 
from this experience.

603
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:07,500
We can make a blacklist 
of words

604
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,525
you should never 
stand in front of. 

605
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,420
In case the press gets 
to do something like that. 

606
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,490
- Peacock. 
- Peacock, of course.

607
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,865
Shuttlecock. Spatchcock.

608
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,280
Anything with cock, really. 

609
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,400
You remember that
folk singer - Tim Hardin. 

610
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,975
Well you'd be able to get
"I'm hard."

611
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:20,900
Out of that. 

612
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,595
Coarsefishing - that  could be 
arsefish if you crop that.

613
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:26,425
And walkie-talkie could be 
cropped to say

614
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:27,935
alkie - twice.

615
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:29,080
There are no 
walkie-talkie

616
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,215
why would I stand in front 
of a walkie-talkie sign?

617
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:31,790
Malkie-Malkie.

618
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,940
Well you know, Howard,
she's not bent

619
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,050
neither in the sense of 
being corrupt or being gay.

620
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,950
And by the way, that's an
incredibly homophobic 

621
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,615
headline - you massive puff. 

622
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:41,470
You've got egg on your 
face, Howard. 

623
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,025
You over-easy 
piss-bag. 

624
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,740
Oh hey Yoko Ono and
the two remaining Beatles

625
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,750
piss off. 

626
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,755
Right - any chance we could just
skip over the usual abuse bit

627
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:52,695
and move on to the part where
we sort this out. 

628
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:53,685
Yeah. 

629
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:55,060
You need to make 
a decision. 

630
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,605
Are you still going ahead
with the private school

631
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,900
because if you are, we need
to draft a statement

632
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,260
saying that your husband
is leaving his job. 

633
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,800
Are you taking a piss? 

634
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
You're expecting me 
to choose between

635
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,425
fucking up my 
daughter's life

636
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,990
and fucking up 
my husband's life? 

637
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,630
Yeah.

638
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,430
So I just have to choose
between them. 

639
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,615
Like they're on some fucking
cosmic dessert trolley. 

640
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:17,385
Listen darling - I can't fight on
two fronts, you know? 

641
00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:19,615
If the press run with both
of these stories

642
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:20,975
you're fucking dead.

643
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:22,305
You set this up, 
didn't you? 

644
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,835
What? 

645
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:27,525
To put me in 
my place?

646
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:28,730
Or get back at me 

647
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,675
for ignoring your advice?

648
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:33,990
Or some other weird
perceived slight

649
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,490
that doesn't in any way merit

650
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,105
this massive fucking out-of-proportion
Isreali-style response. 

651
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:42,000
You don't realise - I'm your
fucking fairy godfather - right?

652
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,390
Jesus - God 
help me!

653
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,785
I'm your fairy 
fucking godfather. 

654
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:45,980
I've got 
a magic wand

655
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,290
that I can wave about

656
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,395
but I've got a fucking Blackberry
and a chiff. 

657
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:50,520
You've got a decision to make,

658
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,080
You make it -
talk to you later. 

659
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,365
Malcolm! 

660
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:56,880
Sorry - can we just carry on
talking about that thing?

661
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,445
Was it you who positioned
me there?

662
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:01,160
Do you know what the first 
sign of madness is? 

663
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:03,605
Paranoia. 

664
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:04,910
Have you seen that film - 
A Beautiful Mind

665
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,225
the one with that
Russell Crowe? 

666
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,405
The one with 
the maths guy

667
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:11,460
he thinks the CIA are 
working away in a shed 

668
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,980
at the bottom of his garden.

669
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,075
That's you. 

670
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:15,470
No. I am not 
the mad one here. 

671
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,855
You are the mad one. 

672
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:17,800
You're Russell Crowe. 

673
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,760
Oh no no no. 
You are Russell Crowe. 

674
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,065
And you need to fucking 
listen to me, Russell

675
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:27,275
you fucking antipondean, fucking 
kangaroo-loving fruitcake. 

676
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,755
See this poster stuff

677
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:30,730
that's fucking 
small fry

678
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,700
The really horrible stuff

679
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,750
that's all still about to fucking 
happen to you - right?

680
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:39,545
Right you're coming in here so
we can carry this on? 

681
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,160
- Now?
- If you can spare the time! 

682
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:46,060
Uh, no. 

683
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:47,775
I - no. I can't... 

684
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:49,545
I don't use lifts, 
I'm claustrophobic. 

685
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,175
You're what? 

686
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:57,515
Not hugely - 
I can be in rooms

687
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,420
you've seen that - I just
don't do lifts - that's all. 

688
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,505
This lift is - I mean it's
fucking huge! 

689
00:26:04,505 --> 00:26:06,625
I mean this is bigger
than some rooms

690
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,825
this is bigger than
some people's flats. 

691
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:10,255
It's about not being able
to get out.

692
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:12,455
Oh, well that's great. 

693
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:13,695
That's fucking great. 

694
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:15,715
That's another fucking thing 
right there. 

695
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:17,605
Not only you've got a fucking 
bent husband 

696
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:19,440
and a fucking daughter that
gets taken to school 

697
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,570
on a fucking sedan chair. 

698
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,275
you're also fucking
mental!

699
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:24,605
Jesus Christ,
see you 

700
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:27,385
you are a fucking omni-shambles
that's what you are. 

701
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,060
You're like that coffee machine, 
you know 

702
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,730
from bean to cup,
you fuck up. 

703
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,490
He so is Russell Crowe. 

704
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,395
- Who?

705
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,195
Nicola, I did want to tell you
that I

706
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:43,035
I tried to get a message through
to Ollie ... 

707
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,690
- I know.
- I have been doing this 

708
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,725
a long time now,
by which a mean, you know

709
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:50,480
in an experienced - firm hand on
a tiller sort of way. 

710
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,025
Not in a clapped hard 
over the hill kind of way. 

711
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:56,190
- Yeah I know.
- I've learned to look out

712
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,275
for these sort of things

713
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:01,850
I have developed a kind of
sonar for them now

714
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,615
like a bat. 

715
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:04,310
Glenn, do you want to... 

716
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,790
would you want to maybe
stay on

717
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,105
I could use that sonar. 

718
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,410
Batty man. 

719
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,760
Right. 

720
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,865
Uhm, forgive me... 

721
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,850
I think that's 

722
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,980
Jamaican slang for 
"homosexual".

723
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,580
Yes, I was thinking that
as I said it

724
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm really sorry - 
I didn't. 

725
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,560
No no no no.

726
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,670
I'm on my way down -

727
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,140
see you by 
the front door, Elvis. 

728
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,355
Have you decided?

729
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:32,355
Oh, shit. 

730
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:34,220
Yes, Malcolm, 
you know I have decided

731
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,875
the minute you told me
I had to decide. 

732
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,105
I'm gonna change
Ella's schools. 

733
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:38,855
Good for you. 

734
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:42,025
Listen - I'm gonna try and get
your social mobility thing moving. 

735
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:43,655
I talked to the chancellor

736
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:45,915
I'm gonna keep banging 
away at it - you know

737
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,405
like Charles Haughtry 
on a sleeping guardsman.

738
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:49,400
Okay. 

739
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,105
I mean she's ...
She's very bright so

740
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:54,460
- Yeah?
- They say if you're very bright

741
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,500
then it sort of doesn't matter 
what school you go to. 

742
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
That's true. 

743
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,430
That is very true. 

744
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,550
Hey! 

745
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,565
See you later -
state educator. 

746
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:11,355
It's a highly expensive lumbar 
support chair, for God's sake. 

747
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,920
Oh don't be ridiculous. 

748
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,315
I mean that's paper recycling, it's 
not gonna be there - is it? 

749
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,830
I'm gonna call you in the morning
and if you're not there

750
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,270
you're in big trouble. 

751
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,170
Glenn.

752
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,385
See this... 

753
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,730
Dickensian hysteric
who's just gone home?

754
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,385
Here's what you do -
right?

755
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:29,590
You're made out of great aw's - yeah?

756
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,955
You make a big noise

757
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:33,365
to impress Nicola. 

758
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,465
But secretly, you're wanking 
behind the curtain to me all the time.

759
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,200
You want me to 
pass information onto you? 

760
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,685
Don't kill yourself though - 

761
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:42,910
well, not over this 
you know. 

762
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,525
I just want you to make
her feel good - you know? 

763
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,960
You can be a friend of 
Dorothy's - can't ya?

764
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:54,000
Then we'll all get some fucking
peace around here!

765
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,230
Right! 

766
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,520
I'm on my way 
to wipe my arse

767
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,355
on pictures 
of Nick Robinson.

768
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,135
I'm getting good
at getting my queef. 

769
