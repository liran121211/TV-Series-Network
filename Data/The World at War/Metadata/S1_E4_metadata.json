The following days Great Britain carries out the biggest evacuation in history. 330.000 French and British soldiers are picked up by boats and brought over the channel to England. German aircrafts start bombing English airfields, but the Royal Air Force wins this part of the battle of Britain. G\u00f6ring orders his Luftwaffe to bomb London instead. During 76 successive nights German aircrafts bomb London and other cities by night. 40.000 people are killed, half of them in London. Suddenly Germany changes focus, and attacks Eastern Europe instead. The British strategy is now to fight its way through the Middle East and Balkan towards Germany. They quickly conquer the Italian Army in North Africa, but the Germans stop their attempt to make a breakthrough via Greece and Yugoslavia. In May 1941 German and its allies control most of continental Europe.\u2014Maths Jesperson {maths.jesperson1@comhem.se}"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1129864", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 543, "number_of_episodes": 26}
