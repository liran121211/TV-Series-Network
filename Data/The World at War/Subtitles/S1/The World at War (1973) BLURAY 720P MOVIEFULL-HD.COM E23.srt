1
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,478
(narrator) This tiny island,
less than one square mile,

2
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,481
cost more than 4,000 lives.

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,694
This is Tarawa, typical of some of the
most concentrated fighting of the war

4
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:32,406
as the Americans drive the Japanese
back island by island

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,075
across the Pacific.

6
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:49,691
ln February 1942, Japanese bombers
attacked the Australian mainland.

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,489
The raid temporarily knocked out
the naval base of Darwin.

8
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,117
With the Japanese
advancing across New Guinea,

9
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,286
some Australians thought
this was the prelude to invasion,

10
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:05,415
but the Japanese army and navy
were unable to agree.

11
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,877
Their invasion plans were shelved.

12
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,341
ln fact, the Japanese found
they were overextended.

13
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,594
ln the appalling conditions
of the New Guinea jungle,

14
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,180
the Australians, with American support,

15
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,852
turned back the Japanese advance
on the vital base of Port Moresby.

16
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,856
Along the Kokoda Trail
the Allies counterattacked.

17
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,905
Sickness and disease were obstacles
as formidable as Japanese bullets.

18
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:53,255
By the end of 1942, the threat
to Australia had been removed.

19
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,091
The stage was set
for the long and bitter struggle

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,262
to push the Japanese back
to their homeland.

21
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:04,933
The Allied oftensive came under
the separate command of two rivals,

22
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,061
General Douglas MacArthur
in the southwest Pacific

23
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,608
and Admiral Chester Nimitz
in the central Pacific.

24
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,236
American strategy was to mount
a two-pronged attack on an enemy

25
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,113
whose conquests extended

26
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,367
over thousands of square miles
of land and ocean.

27
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,331
MacArthur's task was to thrust upwards
from the Solomons and New Guinea

28
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,249
to the Philippines.

29
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,043
The forces under Nimitz

30
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,047
were to make a series of giant leaps
from island to island -

31
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:40,135
the Marshall lslands,
the Marianas, lwo Jima, Okinawa.

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,474
They would start in the Gilberts
in November 1943 at Tarawa.

33
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:53,732
Each one of you
is much better than the Jap.

34
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:58,612
You're better physically. You're better
mentally. You have better weapons.

35
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,658
You'll have better support so that
you'll be able to lick him hands down

36
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,245
when it comes to individual fighting.

37
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,914
Let me repeat again
what the general said.

38
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:13,126
lf you have to run any chances
whatsoever to get a prisoner,

39
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,503
then don't get him.

40
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,672
(laughter)

41
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,723
(narrator) The first objective

42
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,477
of Nimitz's island-hopping armada's
Tarawa atoll

43
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,688
had become a Japanese fortress

44
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,566
from whose airstrip planes
could strike at the US fleets.

45
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,819
Tarawa had to be taken.

46
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,115
This was the first time
a seaborne attack had been launched

47
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,453
against a heavily defended atoll
protected by a coral reef.

48
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,224
No one in the initial assault force
of 5,000 marines realised

49
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,020
just how strong
the defences of Tarawa were.

50
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,898
(man) They thought they would level
the island and demolish everything,

51
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,236
that there wouldn't be
a living soul on the island.

52
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,198
(man #2) l remember him telling us,

53
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,202
"This is gonna be the easiest invasion
we ever had."

54
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:37,002
He says, "We'll only need two men -
one with a rifle and one with a slate."

55
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,005
"One to shoot 'em,
one to chalk 'em up."

56
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,760
"lt's gonna be real easy."

57
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,223
(man #3) l turned to the major standing
next to me on the deck and said,

58
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,852
"Some of our people
aren't aiming very well today."

59
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,064
He said, "You don't think
those are our shells, do you?"

60
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:02,069
l realised then that we're being shot at
and there were Japanese on Tarawa.

61
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:11,495
(man #4) Everyone was confident that
you could kick hell out of the Japanese.

62
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,789
The marines would have no problem
with them

63
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,876
if we could get our feet on the beach.

64
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,257
(soidier) Let's go! Let's go!

65
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:36,061
(man #1) Remember that the island
was only 800 or 900 yards wide

66
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:42,067
and when you put 20,000 men on
an island like that, it's quite crowded.

67
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:53,120
There were Japs in front of the lines,
behind the lines, all over.

68
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,718
(man #5) We were told
that perhaps we could take this island

69
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,637
within a very short time

70
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:16,226
and it was quite evident within hours
of landing that this would not be so.

71
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,159
(man #4) The foxholes that had been
covered up with the naval gunfire,

72
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,745
the next morning,
within about 20 yards of where l was,

73
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,790
l watched the Japanese digging out.

74
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,587
They were digging the sand out of
the place so that they could see out.

75
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,722
(narrator) The battle raged
for three days

76
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:59,227
with the Japanese gradually pinned back
into one end of this tiny island.

77
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,446
The Japanese commander boasted that
Tarawa could not be taken in 100 years.

78
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:58,203
(man #3) lf you can imagine the eftect
of nearly 6,000 dead men

79
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,789
on an island this small,

80
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,417
and considering it's one degree
from the equator,

81
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,546
the amount of heat you have there,

82
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,716
you can imagine the smell you get
within a day or two

83
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,510
from all this rotting flesh.

84
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,931
lt was a sort of sweet smell -

85
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,726
sickly sweet, l described it -

86
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,813
and l don't know anywhere
in World War ll

87
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,066
where there was such a concentration
of death.

88
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:40,078
(narrator) When it was all over,
of 3,000 Japanese, only 17 surrendered.

89
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:44,833
The Americans lost over 1 ,000 dead
and 2,000 wounded.

90
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,005
Public opinion in the United States
was shocked

91
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:56,344
that such heavy losses had been incurred
in so short a period of fighting.

92
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,892
After Tarawa, American invasion forces
headed for the Mariana lslands

93
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,521
of Saipan, Tinian and Guam.

94
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,065
The naval task force
protecting the landings

95
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,986
was positioned to the west of Saipan.

96
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,365
Approaching from Okinawa in June 1944
was Japan's mobile fleet,

97
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,037
looking for a naval success that
would yet turn the war in their favour.

98
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,337
Suddenly, from their radar,
the Americans realised

99
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,214
that they had been spotted
by the Japanese.

100
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,604
Every available American fighter
was put into the air

101
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:52,400
to meet wave after wave
of Japanese carrier-borne planes.

102
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:32,524
Many Japanese pilots were comparative
novices with no battle experience.

103
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,154
Their aircraft were poorly armoured.

104
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,660
For the American flyers
swooping down on their opponents,

105
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,746
it was as easy as shooting turkeys.

106
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:11,855
After the first encounter, all but one
of the American planes returned.

107
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,011
Rearmed and refuelled, the Americans
were ready for the next Japanese move.

108
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,847
There were two more onslaughts
to be faced.

109
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,768
However, the Americans had
nearly 900 carrier planes,

110
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,771
twice the number of the Japanese.

111
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:01,321
The Marianas turkey shoot
lasted just eight hours.

112
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:08,119
ln one day, Japanese naval air power
was virtually destroyed.

113
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,208
The original force of 430 planes
was reduced to about 100.

114
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,347
American losses
were comparatively light.

115
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,683
Pilots mattered more than machines.

116
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:07,554
At the end of the day,
the Americans had won the air battle,

117
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:12,392
but had yet to locate
the Japanese fleet, now retiring.

118
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,318
The following day, the Americans
continued their search for the enemy.

119
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,884
lt was not until late afternoon

120
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,554
that their aircraft sighted
the mobile fleet over 200 miles away,

121
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,057
at the extreme limit of the range
of the American bombers.

122
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,227
But the order was given - attack.

123
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,878
ln the fading light,
the principle objective of the strike -

124
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:26,299
the Japanese carrier force -
was badly mauled.

125
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,316
One carrier was sunk
and two others damaged.

126
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,029
This great naval battle, in which
neither fleet fired on the other,

127
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,491
ended with the Japanese
reduced to only 35 aircraft

128
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,327
retreating to their bases in Japan.

129
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:07,048
The American planes now faced the
problem of getting back to the carriers.

130
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,053
The decision to attack had meant
that they might easily run out of fuel

131
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,681
on the journey home.

132
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:22,855
First to return were the fighters which
had been protecting the task force.

133
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,097
Landing in the dusk
was difticult enough,

134
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,725
but later on
the torpedo planes and bombers

135
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,395
would have to find their carriers
in pitch darkness.

136
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,772
Some would never make it.

137
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,410
Then it turned into probably the
blackest night l've seen in my life.

138
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:04,332
And over the ocean... l guess we were
at about 7,000 feet flying home,

139
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:09,420
kind of our best altitude for fuel,
and it was black as the ace of spades.

140
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:14,217
And we could hear nothing,
just ourselves, except the cries of...

141
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,262
l won't say "cry",
but a very perfunctory call,

142
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,182
"l'll have to land in the water.
l'm out of fuel."

143
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,392
And this continued just constantly

144
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,814
until all the torpedo planes that had
surVived the strike went into the water.

145
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:32,693
Then about 100 miles from the force, the
dive bombers began to run out of fuel

146
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,196
and they called out, "This is..."

147
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,616
whatever the call was.
l don't really remember.

148
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,369
"l'm going in. Out of fuel."

149
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,207
And then it became quite quiet
until we got within range of the force

150
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:52,672
and then you could start to make out
what was happening at the task force

151
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,174
and what the recovery course
would be -

152
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,844
we'd not yet seen it
as the ships were blacked out,

153
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:02,306
which was a normal operating procedure,
so it couldn't be detected from the air.

154
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,060
The admiral knew that we'd have
an awful problem getting aboard.

155
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,189
We didn't have time to really look
for the force. A decision was made.

156
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,860
The command was given to the carriers
to turn their lights on.

157
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,994
(narrator) The task force succeeded in
rescuing the majority of the air crews

158
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,830
who had been forced down in the ocean.

159
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,833
Victory in this,
the Battle of the Philippine Sea,

160
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,377
meant the Mariana landings
could go ahead

161
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,339
without interference
from the Japanese navy.

162
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,522
At a cost of 3,000 American dead,
Saipan fell.

163
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,823
Tinian was less heavily defended.

164
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,868
Guam held out for three weeks.

165
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,463
Get out of there! Move back quick!

166
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,425
(narrator)
Moving west from the Marianas,

167
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,387
a US amphibious force was switched
by Nimitz to MacArthur's command

168
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,474
as the two rival prongs
began to come together.

169
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,352
The objective was
the Palau group of islands.

170
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:33,314
These had to be taken
before the invasion of the Philippines.

171
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:49,038
On one island, Peleliu, the Americans
again ran into fanatical resistance

172
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:53,084
from a crack force
of 10,000 Japanese troops.

173
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,099
lnstead of meeting the Americans
on the beaches,

174
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,353
the Japanese had withdrawn
into a labyrinth of caves and tunnels.

175
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,287
The Americans had to contest
every yard

176
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,665
against an enemy
determined to fight to the death.

177
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,214
ln the bloody battle for Peleliu,

178
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,219
four out of every ten Americans
taking part were killed or wounded.

179
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,696
lt was months before all the Japanese
had been winkled out.

180
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:59,335
There were no easy victories
on these Pacific islands.

181
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:05,674
Some of the dead marines could only
be identified by their fingerprints.

182
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:15,393
On October 20, 1944,
MacArthur fulfilled his promise.

183
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,521
He returned to the Philippines.

184
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,066
The landings were virtually unopposed.

185
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,945
The Japanese had retired inland
to their main defences.

186
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,155
But the invasion
touched oft the largest

187
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,908
and most complex naval battle
in history.

188
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,537
The Battle for Leyte Gulf
was to last for four days.

189
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,124
Four Japanese forces converged
on the Philippines

190
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,294
from Borneo, Formosa
and mainland Japan.

191
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,340
The Americans had two fleets -
the Seventh and the Third.

192
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,844
The Japanese aim was to destroy
the American invasion shipping

193
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,637
in Leyte Gulf.

194
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,349
After a series of confused engagements
hundreds of miles apart,

195
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,311
the lmperial Japanese Navy
suftered heavy losses.

196
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,232
lt ceased to be an eftective
fighting force.

197
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:14,535
On land, torrential rain had delayed
the progress of MacArthur's men

198
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,915
fighting against a Japanese army
numbering nearly 400,000.

199
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:25,296
By February 1945, three months
after the Leyte landings,

200
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:31,093
the Americans were closing in
on the Philippines capital Manila.

201
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,148
For the first time in the Pacific war,

202
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:48,402
the Americans were fighting
their way into a big city.

203
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,176
The battle raged from street to street,
house to house.

204
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,815
Many civilians lost their lives,

205
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,653
some executed
by the retreating Japanese.

206
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:59,765
MacArthur's second hour of triumph -
his return to the Philippines capital.

207
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,229
Americans taken prisoner
during the Japanese invasion

208
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:09,358
were released
after three years in captivity.

209
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,926
With the capture of the Philippines,

210
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:40,180
supply routes carrying war materials
for Japanese industry would be cut.

211
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,018
The Japanese command knew
that when they had lost the Philippines,

212
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,854
they had lost the war.

213
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:58,282
After liberation, revenge.
The settling of personal scores

214
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,784
against Filipinos
accused of collaborating

215
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,370
during the years
of Japanese occupation,

216
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,748
now at last at an end.

217
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,114
February, 1945.

218
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,451
lwo Jima,
eight square miles of volcanic rock

219
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,329
only 600 miles from the coast of Japan,

220
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:50,125
was the target for the next leap
across the central Pacific.

221
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,543
From lwo Jima,

222
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:56,715
American bombers could raid
Japanese cities almost at will.

223
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,718
From the dominating heights
of Mount Suribachi,

224
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,972
the Japanese could see practically
everything that moved on lwo Jima.

225
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:10,104
Once again, the main Japanese forces
were inland, away from the beaches.

226
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:16,944
For 76 days before the landing,
the Americans had bombarded lwo Jima.

227
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:28,747
(man) The waste,
the barrenness of the place...

228
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,710
lt was like a nightmare. lt was
the closest thing you could see to hell.

229
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,756
lf ever hell looked like anything,
it must look like lwo Jima.

230
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,474
(man #2) The minute you got in
those boats you were scared.

231
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,145
You were scared
until you hit the beach.

232
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,066
(man #3) You realise that
you're going in to kill

233
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,861
and we were taught
that we had to kill or be killed.

234
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,656
lt was either us or the Japanese,
one or the other.

235
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:07,494
And when you're faced
with this situation as a young man -

236
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,663
l was only 19 -

237
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,957
it's confusing.

238
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:17,254
You're built, in the Marine Corps,
to take orders and obey orders,

239
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:22,009
but at the same token you're still
a human being and you're only 19 or 20.

240
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,721
Most of us were only 18, 19, 20,
during those days.

241
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,232
l think the public has the idea
that marines are supermen,

242
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,861
but l don't think there was a marine
in the amphibious landing craft

243
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:45,157
that wasn't afraid,
including the ofticers.

244
00:29:56,377 --> 00:30:00,506
l was always taught to hate them
in the Marine Corps, to detest them,

245
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,302
and that they were animals.
We were the men, they were the animals.

246
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:10,891
By the same token, we were taught
that they would die for the emperor.

247
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,519
We weren't taught to die
for our president.

248
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:18,065
And to fight or to come up against
an individual who wants to die,

249
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,820
or who doesn't care about dying,
is a tough thing to combat in your mind.

250
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:28,408
We wanted to live. We wanted to kill him
and we wanted to surVive.

251
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,877
(man #2) You keep your head down
because there's too much fire above you

252
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:45,217
and it's that constant wondering, is
somebody gonna drop a lucky one in there

253
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:50,097
and you're too far out to swim
with all that gear on?

254
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,308
And what are you gonna get into
when you get there?

255
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,936
That's a hell of a place to be.

256
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,417
(man #1) And as you hit the island

257
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,379
and you saw the ash and nothing living,

258
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:26,633
it was... if there's ever been hell,
this was it.

259
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,144
Well, we hit the beach itself.

260
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,314
Actually, there was a little incline

261
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,943
and everybody clung to the incline
because the fire was that heavy.

262
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,321
And everything that hit the beach

263
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,865
was blasted out of the water
as fast as it hit.

264
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,586
(man #4) l was young then.
This was my fourth operation. l was 18.

265
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,172
My first operation, l was 16.

266
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,639
(man #1) They lay and waited for us

267
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:19,269
and rhythmically just kept on tattooing
every man along the line.

268
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:24,691
And you just couldn't avoid it.
The slaughter was fantastic.

269
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:29,404
We just walked into a web
and there was no way out.

270
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,657
You couldn't get oft the beach.

271
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:38,956
(man #5) And getting in to the beach
was a depressing scene.

272
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:45,337
lt knocked your morale when you started
to see people from your own team dead.

273
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:50,926
From the water's edge
to a sort of a rise,

274
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:56,431
there was a tremendous amount
of bodies just lying there.

275
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,785
(man #6) We moved about...

276
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,372
possibly 300 yards in,

277
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:25,585
just as far as they, meaning
the Japanese, decided for us to go.

278
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,553
(man #1) There was no way of getting
oft the island, not that first night.

279
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,264
lt was just too congested.

280
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:43,020
There was nothing that could
move oft that island the first night.

281
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,944
(narrator) Dug in on Mount Suribachi,

282
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,033
the Japanese commander
had concentrated his artillery.

283
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:05,542
The preliminary bombardment again failed
to knock out the Japanese strong points.

284
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:10,797
They could only be taken one at a time
by the men on the ground.

285
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,008
lt would take longer to capture lwo Jima

286
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:17,929
than the five days allowed for
by the American command.

287
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,942
(man #6) The entire vegetation
was gone completely.

288
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,402
You woke in the morning

289
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,448
and you'd look out across
this expanse of no-man's-land

290
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:40,660
and it was bubbling and seething
with steam coming out of the ground.

291
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,455
ln fact, we had to use cardboard
from C ration packs

292
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:49,002
to put down in the foxhole
so that your ass wouldn't burn up.

293
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,301
lf there is a hell,
l'm living through it now,

294
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:01,848
so l don't have to worry about going
to hell in the future. l've been there.

295
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,198
One of the guys came up to me.
He was a man with a family.

296
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,911
l never did even know him, just
meeting him at that particular day.

297
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,372
l said, "We're in the mortar outfit
back here."

298
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,582
"Fairly well safe, no problems."

299
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,879
Before the day was over,
he and half of my other squad was dead.

300
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,762
(man #7) l think the worst part was you
get callous to dead and bloated bodies,

301
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:44,766
but you never get callous
to your own friends in that way,

302
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,728
and l think that perhaps was
the most terrible thing of lwo Jima.

303
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,357
(man #3) lf everybody remembered
all the tragic things that happened,

304
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,110
you'd go crazy.
You wouldn't surVive it.

305
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,405
(man #2) Oh, you always think
you're gonna make it.

306
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:03,285
You're scared, but you still think
you're gonna make it.

307
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,661
(man #1) lt was just one of the biggest
messes l myself had ever seen.

308
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,039
l don't know who the beach master was,

309
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:54,794
but he probably had the roughest job
of any man l've ever heard of.

310
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,428
(narrator)
lt may have looked confusing,

311
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:07,933
but the supply organisation backing the
assault force was proof of the factor

312
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,685
that made America's victory
over Japan inevitable

313
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,106
from the day of Pearl Harbour -
her overwhelming industrial strength.

314
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,617
(man #1) Only one thing
seemed to permeate the men -

315
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,496
get that million-dollar wound
and get oft this damn place.

316
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,451
(narrator) lnland from the beaches,

317
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,746
lwo Jima
became another battle of attrition.

318
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,893
Day after day,
the Americans inched forward

319
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,647
against Japanese
who preferred death to surrender.

320
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:43,445
Their leader still hoped the Americans
might tire of their losses and the war.

321
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,990
(man #7) Oh, my Lord.
On lwo, it was hand-to-hand fighting.

322
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:51,077
You didn't know who was even
in the hole with you half of the time.

323
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,163
(man #6) You went into the caves.

324
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:57,334
We lost most of our people
in this particular fashion.

325
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,337
You went into the caves
and fought it out with the guy.

326
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,673
One of you came out.

327
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,680
(man #4) l don't think anybody realised
they were underground so deeply.

328
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,726
You know, it was so heavily defended,
really.

329
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,372
(narrator) After three days' fighting
on Mount Suribachi,

330
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,249
the Stars and Stripes
flew on the summit.

331
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:42,087
(man #1) One of the boys started
to holler, "There goes the flag,"

332
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,714
and l don't care where you were
on that island,

333
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:50,011
you could see right up to Suribachi
that the flag was raised.

334
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,764
And everybody started to howl,

335
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,476
because we figured,
well, the island was secure.

336
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,020
lt was far from secure.

337
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,189
We had a long way to go yet.

338
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,318
But it was nice to see
the flag up there anyway.

339
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,869
(man #4) They always told you
to take prisoners,

340
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,206
but we had some bad experiences
on Saipan taking prisoners.

341
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:22,961
You'd take 'em and as soon as they'd get
behind the lines they'd drop grenades

342
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,130
and you'd lose a few more people.

343
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,424
You're a bit leery
about taking prisoners

344
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,469
when they're fighting to the death
and so are you.

345
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,599
OK, you can kick oft right now!

346
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,813
(man #9) Very few of 'em came out
on their own. When they did,

347
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,482
one in the front would come out
with his hands up

348
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,736
and one behind him,
he'd come out with a grenade.

349
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:59,914
(man #2) One of the West Virginia boys,
he was sitting against a stone wall

350
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,879
with his knees up under his helmet,
as we used to sit quite often,

351
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,675
when one of the enemy ran out
onto the top of the stone wall

352
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:15,763
and held a small explosive charge
to his abdomen.

353
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,226
And a chunk of his torso,

354
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,145
the lower torso,

355
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:27,317
went spiralling into the air
and came down on John's knees

356
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,404
with the absolute posterior
devoid of any clothes

357
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,365
staring him right in the face.

358
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,161
And he looked at that and he says,
"God, am l hit that bad?"

359
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,872
(laughs)

360
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:47,629
And that was the trigger that released
the tensions of the previous night.

361
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,547
And there were several of us

362
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:54,093
that were perfectly useless
for as much as an hour.

363
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,389
We were just laying on the ground
in convulsions.

364
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:12,445
(narrator) Of 21 ,000 Japanese troops
on lwo Jima when the attack began,

365
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,989
only 200 were taken alive.

366
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,791
(man #5) l was on the island
a total of six days

367
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,627
and it seemed like 6,000 years.

368
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:34,884
(narrator) lwo Jima's airfields were
functioning before the island was taken

369
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,972
thanks to the American
construction battalions, the CBs.

370
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:46,354
They played a key role here
and indeed in the whole Pacific war.

371
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:52,026
Now the time had come to penetrate
the inner ring of Japan's defences.

372
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,823
350 miles from the mainland
was the last great barrier

373
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,535
between the Allies and the planned
invasion of lmperial Japan -

374
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,413
the Japanese island of Okinawa.

375
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:07,208
On April 1 , 1945,
the Americans attacked.

376
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,502
Japan's young suicide pilots,
the kamikazes,

377
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,006
swarmed to the defence of Okinawa.

378
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:04,932
Many flew their fatal missions
in obsolete aircraft, even trainers.

379
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,371
(man) So many things were happening
and so quickly,

380
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,957
that it was a little bit
like a big boxer in a ring

381
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,670
when he's being hit to the chin, face,
body and everywhere else,

382
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:38,257
cos we were catching it
from so many difterent angles.

383
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,309
ln a regular attack,
it's a sporting chance you've got.

384
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:52,271
With regular bombs and bullets,
you think you've got a very good chance,

385
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:57,944
but war is not so much of a sport
when you're fighting human bombs.

386
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,078
(narrator) Over 2,000 kamikaze pilots
met their deaths.

387
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:12,291
But they destroyed 30 US warships
and damaged 200 more.

388
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,431
(man) You were praying
that you could surVive

389
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,434
whatever kind of explosion
would come about.

390
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,561
Your life flashed in front of you,

391
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,230
as you didn't know
if it would be seconds or minutes

392
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,858
until your life would be snufted out.

393
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,152
(narrator)
US casualties were so severe,

394
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:45,324
at one point it seemed the invasion of
Okinawa might be stopped in its tracks.

395
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,536
(man) The gunners can't turn it oft.

396
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,915
Once they gear themselves up
to fight man against man bomb,

397
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,463
even though the plane is down,
it's hard for the gunner to stop.

398
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,909
One man,
he was in a 40 millimetre mount,

399
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:32,163
and he had been fighting against quite
a number of planes that had come in,

400
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,208
but we had been hit in his area
also two or three times,

401
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,961
and all of a sudden,
with nobody understanding why,

402
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,506
he yelled, "lt's hot today,"
jumped over the side

403
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,925
and that's the last we ever saw of him.

404
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,928
But had he stayed aboard,
he might have surVived.

405
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,598
But of course, we couldn't find
his body or anything after that.

406
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,434
But it was an unusual type of reaction.

407
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,481
He stayed with it just as long
as he could, until he broke.

408
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,150
And then that was the end
of his fighting.

409
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,779
But every man, l believe,
has a breaking point.

410
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:08,449
And the kamikaze, l would estimate,

411
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:14,247
probably tests that breaking point
more than any other form of combat.

412
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,338
(narrator) lnitial landings on Okinawa
were unopposed,

413
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,173
but as they pushed inland,

414
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,343
they came up against
a Japanese army of 100,000 troops,

415
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:31,806
withdrawn into a heavily fortified
central area.

416
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,952
The steep hills and narrow ravines
of Okinawa

417
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:57,164
formed a natural citadel
for Japanese defenders.

418
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,793
Outnumbered two to one,

419
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:05,214
they made the Americans pay in blood
for every foot of Japanese soil.

420
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,547
With Japan herself close to surrender,

421
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:51,510
not every Japanese soldier
wanted to fight on to the end.

422
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,700
(narrator) The civilians of Okinawa
suftered appalling losses.

423
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:42,621
24,000 were killed.
Many thousands more injured.

424
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,915
(man) Once they found out

425
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,335
we weren't going to do the things
that they had heard,

426
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,131
they could understand,
"Hey, this is just another human being."

427
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,717
Possibly they felt the same as we did,

428
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,554
that we weren't there
because we wanted to be there,

429
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:02,892
we were told
that this is what we had to do.

430
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,602
(narrator) To many Americans,

431
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,688
at the end of their great advance
across the Pacific,

432
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,982
it now seemed that the animals,

433
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:14,528
the faceless fanatics
eager to die for their emperor,

434
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:18,157
were human beings like themselves.

435
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,620
(man) They showed kindness to their own
people, which we didn't really think.

436
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:27,208
We thought life was cheap to them,
but that's not true.

437
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,586
They showed a lot of kindness
to their own wounded

438
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,589
and would tote 'em on their back,

439
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:40,513
and two or three would carry 'em,
although they were weak themselves.

440
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,349
So they were people just like us.
