1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,179
(narrator) The Atlantic.
Britain's lifeline.

2
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,892
Treacherous enough in peacetime,

3
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,104
in war, black with menace.

4
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,277
U-boat packs stalk through the night.

5
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,990
Knowing the danger,
their victims still plough on.

6
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,578
(speaking German)

7
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,651
(narrator) Ships and cargoes go down.

8
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,571
Their crews - some of them - surVive,

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,699
but early in 1943
it is Britain's surVival

10
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,287
and the Allied hopes for victory
over Germany which are in doubt.

11
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,017
When war began,
Britain saw Germany's big ships

12
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,186
as the main threat to her sea trade.

13
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,065
So did the Germans.

14
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,665
Germany's surface raiders
savaged the merchant fleet

15
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,918
on which Britain depended
for much of her food,

16
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,005
most of her raw materials,
and all of her oil.

17
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,267
Germany's U-boats
were to operate in coastal waters,

18
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,687
sweeping up anything leff
by the battleships.

19
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,692
Both Britain and Germany were wrong.

20
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,279
The real naval menace
was to be the U-boat.

21
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:22,159
At least one man knew this -
Karl Doenitz, chief of the U-boat arm.

22
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,997
He could've been wrong too, if Hitler
had delayed his war with Britain

23
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:31,752
until all the battleships planned
for the German Navy had been built.

24
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,588
As it was, Doenitz was certain

25
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:39,843
that with enough submarines,
he could win the war at sea.

26
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,346
He had proved it to himself
20 years before.

27
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,807
ln October 1918,

28
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,437
(Doenitz) l was captain of a submarine

29
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,899
in the Mediterranean near Malta.

30
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:59,196
ln a dark night l met a British convoy

31
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,741
with cruisers and destroyers

32
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,993
and l attacked

33
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,996
and l sank a ship,

34
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,501
but the chance would have been
very much greater

35
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,462
if there had been a lot of submarines.

36
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:22,636
That's why the idea of a wolf pack,

37
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,308
to put the submarines together
that they could attack together,

38
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,603
was very impressive,

39
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:37,985
and that's why in all the years
from 1918

40
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,406
until the year 1935

41
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,660
when we had the first submarines again
in the German Navy

42
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,996
l never had forgotten this idea.

43
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:55,127
(narrator) Underwater,
the 1939 U-boat was slow.

44
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,968
On the surface, it was faster
than any convoy of merchant ships.

45
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:08,515
With its low silhouette it could not
be seen easily, especially at night.

46
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:20,068
But its targets were outlined clearly
against the sky...

47
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:27,242
and with radio, the U-boats could
quickly assemble into hunting packs.

48
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,630
Doenitz knew Britain would try
to protect essential Atlantic trade

49
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,760
by a system of convoys
escorted by warships.

50
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,305
To attack these convoys,
Doenitz wanted 300 U-boats.

51
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,766
When the war started he had only 26.

52
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,227
And these boats had long,
dangerous voyages from base

53
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,938
before they could reach their targets.

54
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,775
When France fell,

55
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,528
Doenitz gained new bases
much nearer the shipping routes.

56
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:13,372
His Sea Wolves returned
to these French ports as heroes.

57
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,793
One especial hero was Otto Kretschmer.

58
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,214
ln all, Kretschmer sank over a quarter
of a million tons of British shipping.

59
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:26,676
ln October 1940,
he joined the first real wolf pack.

60
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:32,474
l remember that there was a signal
that a convoy was coming in

61
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,726
from America to England

62
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,648
and that its position was not known

63
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,611
and that Doenitz ordered
all the submarines there,

64
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,905
to the west of lreland,

65
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:52,702
to form a sort of recce line,
a stationary recce line,

66
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,123
to let the convoy pass through.

67
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,043
And when the first submarine was sighted

68
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,380
the convoy made a signal,
its contact signal,

69
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,883
and this recce line
was dissolved automatically,

70
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,303
and every boat was free
to go in for the attack.

71
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:16,101
(narrator) Convoy SC-7 ,
on the night of 17 October 1940,

72
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,270
was passing Rockall.

73
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:23,066
34 merchantmen, four small escort ships.

74
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,360
Seven U-boats attacked on the surface.

75
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,323
The attack took the same form
as that we were used to,

76
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,578
which was a single ship being struck.

77
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,249
Very shortly affer
that a second one was struck,

78
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:44,713
and then, within a matter
of five to ten minutes,

79
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,841
further ships were struck.

80
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:53,013
l tried to get through the escorts
into the convoy,

81
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,517
which was my own peculiarity
of attacking,

82
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,980
and failed the first time.

83
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:07,444
They saw me and shot star shells
so that l had to draw away again.

84
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,324
But the second time l succeeded
and was inside the convoy

85
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:18,580
going up and down the lanes looking
for the most important, valuable ships

86
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,459
and had the opportunity
to expend all torpedoes.

87
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,503
l had 12 in all.

88
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,260
(Sherwood) l could see ships
in various stages of sinking.

89
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,347
A Dutch ship had stopped

90
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,642
and was attempting to pick up surVivors,

91
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,645
and whilst l actually
watched her doing this

92
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,231
and was considering what to do about it,

93
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,776
she also herself was torpedoed.

94
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,821
This, along with another torpedoing,

95
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,742
set the whole place ablaze.

96
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,957
(narrator) That night 17 merchantmen,
exactly half the convoy, were sunk.

97
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,126
The escorts had not been able
to damage a single U-boat.

98
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,215
l don't think l had ever seen more
than one ship sunk at a time before,

99
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,718
and this was something
very different indeed.

100
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,681
This really was the first time

101
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:23,228
that these tactics could be
experienced by all of us

102
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,689
and also by Doenitz himself,

103
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,568
who, of course, knew it
only from our peacetime training.

104
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,654
And the whole night, l think,
was a success.

105
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,782
lt was called
the Night of the Long Knives

106
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,326
because so many ships were sunk.

107
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,874
(narrator)
ln the first nine months of the war,

108
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,212
the Allies lost over 2 million tons
of merchant shipping.

109
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,217
ln the next six months,
with the U-boats operating from France,

110
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,721
nearly 2.5 million tons more went down.

111
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,857
There were medals galore.

112
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,749
U-boat crews called this
"the happy time".

113
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,252
(man) l saw the ship going up,
the stern going underwater.

114
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,796
She went right up on end,
then backwards.

115
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,966
And l went down with her.
Affer a bit l came to the surface,

116
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,345
and l was still sitting
on the overturned bridge boat,

117
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,722
when l saw the submarine surfacing.

118
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,476
He went round and started picking up
cases out of the water -

119
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,231
general cargo, possibly spirits,
foodstuff and so forth.

120
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,193
They looked at us,
circled round for a bit,

121
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,945
laughed at us
and went away to the northeast.

122
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,116
They never asked if we had any water,
if we had any damages or anything else.

123
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,828
And we were leff
floating amongst wreckage in one boat.

124
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,415
We were halfway
between Brazil and North Africa.

125
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,834
The only thing l could think about

126
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,380
was trying to get to the land
as near as possible,

127
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,133
so l set the course
as near as l could to the northeast.

128
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,388
All we had was the one lifeboat,
which was made for 48 people.

129
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,015
We picked up 58.

130
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,311
There wasn't really room enough
for anybody to sit down.

131
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:34,234
The boat was leaking badly through
being on the chocks for some time.

132
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,196
You had quite a bit of trouble getting
the crew to move so you could bail,

133
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,907
and you bailed for nearly two days

134
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:46,329
until the wood of the boat
started to swell and to tighten up.

135
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,082
Affer that it wasn't so bad.

136
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,876
The worst days, of course,

137
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,379
were when there was no wind.

138
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,424
Absolutely becalmed.

139
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,384
The sun was terrific.

140
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,012
So we started off
by giving 4oz of water -

141
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,225
2oz in the morning and 2oz at night -
and one biscuit.

142
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,353
There was a lot of noise in the boat.
There were Chinese.

143
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,397
l said, "What's all the bobbery?"

144
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,358
Which is a lot of talky-talky,
you know.

145
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,862
He said, "l think number one
fireman go crazy."

146
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:24,409
So he eventually jumped over the side
with a lifejacket on.

147
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,121
And affer a wee while
we got him back again.

148
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,711
And later that night in the darkness
he jumped again.

149
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:39,090
We didn't get him back
because the sharks got him.

150
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,884
On the morning of the 13th -

151
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:45,138
l'd sit on the water barrel
to make sure nobody helped themselves -

152
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:49,642
and somebody shook me and said, "Hey,
Captain, we see lights, green lights."

153
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,771
"Oh," l said,
"you're dreaming, you're dreaming."

154
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,565
And l looked round
and l saw some green lights.

155
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,235
lt looked to me like New Brighton pier.
l couldn't make it out.

156
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,613
So l said, "Well, burn a flare."

157
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,700
They burned a flare. Jimmy said,
"Burn another flare."

158
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,786
They burned another flare.

159
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,166
And affer a bit l saw the green lights
getting closer. More visible.

160
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,419
Then affer a bit
l saw a red light above the green,

161
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,881
and then it dawned on me
that it was a hospital ship.

162
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,761
(narrator)
The U-boats had eyes in the air.

163
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:29,390
Focke-Wulf Condor aircraff
could range 1,000 miles out to sea

164
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,100
to scout for convoys.

165
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:40,693
When used to bomb shipping,
the Condors sank 30 ships in two months.

166
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,111
Luckily for Britain,

167
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:46,241
this partnership with the U-boat
was never properly exploited.

168
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,456
But Doenitz did exploit the fact
that German naval intelligence

169
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,459
had broken the British codes.

170
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,090
We were aware that the intelligence
for some reason was good,

171
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:07,929
but l myself put this down
to very superior hydrophone equipment

172
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,973
that the submarines had,

173
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,934
that the U-boats had in their boats,

174
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:17,188
probably being able to pick up
the noise of a convoy's propellers

175
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,692
up to 80 or even 100 miles.

176
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,861
But in addition,

177
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,489
l know that they would place
their U-boats

178
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:32,120
in a line across, at right angles
to the expected line of the convoy.

179
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:38,710
And this line for, say, five U-boats,
could be 100 miles from end to end.

180
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,004
And so with good hydrophones,

181
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:46,342
very little disguise of the position
of a convoy could be effected.

182
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,555
lt was only affer the war that we knew
that they were breaking the codes

183
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,891
and that they knew very well

184
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,102
the time of leaving port
that the convoys had

185
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,438
and how many escorts there were

186
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,566
and how many merchant ships
in each convoy.

187
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,651
(ticking)

188
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,155
(explosion)

189
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,373
(narrator) The Royal Navy,
searching for U-boats underwater,

190
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,711
had pinned its faith on asdic,
an echo-sounding device.

191
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,487
But U-boats were attacking convoys
on the surface.

192
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,656
The navy was not prepared for this.

193
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,033
(man) Convoy defence
is not very glamorous

194
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,744
and between the wars,
l think rather naturally,

195
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:59,290
the navy were inclined to concentrate
on more glamorous activities

196
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,960
like great mass torpedo attacks

197
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,920
and that sort of thing.

198
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,006
All the information about the lessons

199
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,467
of World War l were available.

200
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,137
For those who wanted to read them,
the lessons were there.

201
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,181
But l'm afraid no one bothered.

202
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,894
And as a result trade defence
as a whole, was very badly neglected.

203
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,438
(narrator) The neglect continued.

204
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,192
ln the early days,
convoys could only be escorted

205
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,696
for about 300 miles
from each Atlantic coast.

206
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,245
There just weren't enough escort ships.

207
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,833
Those available lacked endurance and
their crews were virtually untrained.

208
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,420
(Sherwood)
My officers were RNVR officers.

209
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,424
One was a civil engineer by profession.

210
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:54,512
The other two were
Canadian sublieutenants,

211
00:16:55,597 --> 00:17:00,727
both of the age of between 20 and 21 ,

212
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,063
who had come from Canada as passengers

213
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,401
and that was their seagoing experience.

214
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:12,947
The heads of department were regulars -

215
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,117
some of them had retired
and called back -

216
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:21,039
and there were two or three seamen
who were of the pukka serVice,

217
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,459
and the rest were straight in.

218
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,596
(narrator)
Air cover was to prove all-important,

219
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,349
but surprisingly the navy's carriers
did not at first supply it.

220
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,353
That task went to the RAF, although
Coastal Command was ill prepared.

221
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,983
(man) With the exception of Sunderland
flying boats, a very small number,

222
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,528
all the other aircraff
except the Anson were lash-ups.

223
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,741
They were borrowed
from entirely dissimilar functions

224
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,160
in order to do this job
in Coastal Command.

225
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,497
Secondly, the navigation aids
were not there.

226
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,041
lt was entirely dead-reckoning
navigation.

227
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,336
And whereas an experienced navigator
can look at the sea,

228
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,881
estimate the wind and where
he's likely to be in an hour's time,

229
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,884
this is very difficult for a new boy.

230
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:21,015
And since the point to be navigated to,
the convoy, was offen equally at error,

231
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,976
it was no wonder that we failed
to meet many convoys.

232
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,898
So lack of equipment,
lack of training and unsuitable aircraff

233
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,360
were certainly severe handicaps
at the beginning of the war.

234
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,447
What is more, cooperation between
the navy and the air force in the field,

235
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,743
while they're at sea,
was very bad indeed,

236
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:45,331
mainly due to stupid quarrels
between senior officers in Whitehall.

237
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:52,171
lt took nearly two years before we had
anything like the right cooperation

238
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,549
between ships and aircraff.

239
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,759
lt was a disgrace and a tragedy.

240
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,429
So many ships were sunk
and so many lives lost unnecessarily

241
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,348
during those first few years.

242
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,767
(narrator) So seamen suffer

243
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:09,939
from quarrels in Whitehall,
from the U-boats and from the sea.

244
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:14,443
(man) Now by popular request,
the Western Approaches signature tune.

245
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,199
♪ Someone's rocking my dream boat

246
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:24,912
♪ Someone's invading my dream

247
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:30,334
♪ We were sailing along
so peaceful and calm

248
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,339
♪ Suddenly something went wrong

249
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:41,596
lt's very hard to describe to someone
on the land affer a tough convoy -

250
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,890
by tough l mean bad weather,

251
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,559
especially in the wintertime -

252
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,103
what just over two weeks at sea is,

253
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,856
living on corned beef and hard tack.

254
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,151
And this is not a fallacy.

255
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,986
We used to do this quite offen

256
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,072
when the seas came in
and put the galley fires out.

257
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,117
You couldn't just cook anything hot.

258
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,911
The lucky ones had hammocks

259
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,080
and the unfortunate ones
had to lie on the lockers,

260
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,082
and it was very discomforting.

261
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,795
You used to get chaps coming down
from the middle watch, four o'clock,

262
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,715
wet through,
just cgambering on a gocker

263
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,260
and the poor chap already
trying to sleep would get soaked.

264
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,304
There was no hygiene there.

265
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:28,643
We really started smelling affer
about a week if you didn't watch it.

266
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,103
We had a feeling
that it was a necessary job.

267
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,440
l'm not sure we realised
that it was all that important.

268
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,817
To us it was a very boring job.

269
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:43,115
We were on lookout for anything that
might come up and it was bitterly cold.

270
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,577
lt was an open bridge,
open to all weathers,

271
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:51,249
and we were more, really,
trying to keep warm,

272
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,336
trying to keep the cold out,
trying to keep dry,

273
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,215
rather than realise
that we were doing an important job.

274
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,010
(narrator) But they were
doing an important job.

275
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:12,103
They brought the cargoes, without which
Britain could not have kept going.

276
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,735
(man) You sit down in the cabin.
That's when you think:

277
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,738
"We're in the open sea,
we can catch a pack at any moment."

278
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,871
(Butler) Many times
we saw little lights in the water

279
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:36,711
and we assumed these were surVivors,
but we couldn't stop and pick them up.

280
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,008
(man) The normal comparison
that seamen made with their wage

281
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:46,262
for the hours that they worked
was with the ammunition workers,

282
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,140
who were making
a fabulous amount of money,

283
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,935
with no more risks
than our housewives leff at home.

284
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,736
(Eyton-Jones) We lost one out of every
three men, and without them

285
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,781
this nation wouldn't have surVived
more than three or four months.

286
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,494
(narrator)
But the Germans were still celebrating.

287
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:17,251
ln the first half of 1941 they sank
nearly three million tons of shipping.

288
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,421
Ships were harder to replace than cargo.

289
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:26,427
lf they could be sunk faster than they
could be built, Britain would starVe.

290
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,687
But now the Canadian navy,
tiny at the outbreak of war,

291
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,440
was expanding to 50 times
its original size.

292
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:45,821
lt would take on nearly half the burden
of convoy escort in the north Atlantic.

293
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,753
More and more convoys
were leaving Canada,

294
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,923
decks laden with tanks,
holds full of supplies

295
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,385
from the neutral United States
under lease-lend.

296
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,562
Alarmed at continuing losses,
the British war cabinet

297
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:23,067
set up a new Western Approaches
Command to reorganise convoy defence.

298
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:29,407
For the first time, the RAF and the navy
worked closely together.

299
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:39,333
And in March 1941 ,
Doenitz lost three of his ablest men.

300
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:50,177
Günther Prien, who had sunk
the Royai Oak at Scapa Flow...

301
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,014
depth-charged and killed.

302
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,393
Joachim Schepke, rammed and drowned.

303
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:05,317
And Kretschmer,
depth-charged to the surface...

304
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,409
and taken prisoner.

305
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:22,251
Only one third of Doenitz's fleet
could be on patrol at any one time.

306
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,337
His best captains had suddenly gone.

307
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,757
Now he could only keep
some half dozen U-boats at sea.

308
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,427
With this small number of U-boats,

309
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,306
of course any decisive success

310
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,934
in the battle of the Atlantic
was not possible.

311
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:45,524
That's why it was necessary
for the building of submarines

312
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:51,697
to get first place
in the German armament plan.

313
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,325
But this was not done,

314
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,162
in spite of all the requests

315
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,081
made by Admiral Raeder,

316
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,668
who then was chief of the German navy.

317
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,088
(narrator) Worse was to come for him.

318
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,550
The United States
was still officially neutral.

319
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,179
(PA) General quarters,
general quarters. On the double.

320
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,808
(narrator) But affer Churchill's
Atlantic meeting with Roosevelt,

321
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:24,104
September 1941 , America announced she
would protect ships of any nationality

322
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,358
plying between her shores and lceland.

323
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,949
There were now enough warships

324
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,910
to provide continuous escort
across the Atlantic.

325
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,870
lt was time to counterattack.

326
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:45,042
l got hold of
a number of escort commanders,

327
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,128
who l asked the question:

328
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,341
"When a U-boat is known
to be attacking a convoy,

329
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,510
as they do now by night",

330
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,638
l asked them what they did,

331
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,518
and the answer in most cases was,
"Well, what can you do?"

332
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:06,021
"lt's a very tiny little thing
and we can't see them."

333
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:12,486
Radar, of course, in those days was very
elementary and we had very few sets.

334
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:17,283
But in fact there was
one escort commander

335
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,994
who had the idea,

336
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,454
which is still absolutely relevant,

337
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:28,794
that when an attack, of which
there is no warning, takes place,

338
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:33,382
that all of the escort
should do the same sort of thing

339
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,051
on a planned line

340
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,554
at exactly the same time

341
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:45,185
so that it has the maximum effect
over the broad ocean around that convoy.

342
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,315
And this, of course,
was the then Commander Walker.

343
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,984
(narrator)
Although he did not surVive the war,

344
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,112
Walker was to sink more U-boats
than anyone else.

345
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:59,366
At the end of 1941
he set a new style for convoy defence.

346
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,369
The convoy was HG-76.

347
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,873
ln it were 36 merchantmen
from all parts of the world.

348
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,586
They assembled in Gibraltar
for the trudge to Britain.

349
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,472
The navy knew there were at least
six U-boats on the convoy's route -

350
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,100
their signals had been picked up
by the admiralty.

351
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:32,024
When HG-76 sailed
on 14 December 1941 ,

352
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:37,279
it had an exceptionally large escort -
17 ships commanded by Walker.

353
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:42,201
Among them, for the first time,
an auxiliary aircraff carrier,

354
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,327
the Audacity.

355
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,958
Three days out,
Audscity's plane spotted U-131 .

356
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,800
The escorts quickly sank her.

357
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,771
Doenitz homed five more U-boats
on the convoy.

358
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,235
Walker's team soon sank one.

359
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,406
But that night
the U-boats attacked again.

360
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:27,329
An escort and a merchant ship were sunk.
Walker counterattacked.

361
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:44,221
Walker's own ship
rammed and sank U-574.

362
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,601
ln the air, Audscity's fighters
harried the German Condors.

363
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,481
One was destroyed. Others were damaged.

364
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:01,238
But some escorts were running
out of fuel. They had to leave.

365
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,616
A U-boat penetrated the gap.

366
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,244
Audscity was the next victim.

367
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,879
Another hectic night followed.
The convoy lost one more ship.

368
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:21,383
But Endrass, another U-boat ace
was sunk in U-567.

369
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,887
Next day, for the first time,
a long-range Liberator

370
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,513
appeared and attacked.

371
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,561
Doenitz decided he must withdraw.

372
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,400
Walker had justified his tactics.

373
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,403
Aircraff had proved their worth.

374
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,617
Four U-boats had been sunk.

375
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:51,789
But Doenitz was about to be given
his greatest opportunity.

376
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,460
(♪ "Moonlight Serenade")

377
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:01,048
ln December 1941 , the United States
came fully into the war -

378
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,258
but leff her peacetime lights on.

379
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,438
(explosion)

380
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,651
Doenitz's U-boats never had it so good.

381
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,323
This was the second "happy time".

382
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:34,248
The Americans did not have enough
warships available for offshore escort

383
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,667
so there were no convoys there.

384
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,920
Many ships were convoyed
safely across the ocean

385
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:44,174
to be torpedoed
alone and unescorted offshore.

386
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,057
The slaughter went on.

387
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,934
ln the second half of 1941

388
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,354
nearly 1 .5 million tons of shipping
were lost.

389
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:03,235
ln the first half of 1942 over
4 million tons of shipping were lost -

390
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,113
1 ,000 ships.

391
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,410
At this rate,
the Allies would lose the war.

392
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:16,498
We had to sink as many ships as possible

393
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,961
before our Anglo-American opponent

394
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:27,801
could develop
an effective antisubmarine defence

395
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:33,682
and could replace the merchant ships
which had been sunk.

396
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,564
(narrator) But most of Germany's
U-boats were not in the Atlantic.

397
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,902
They were patrolling off Norway,
defending Germany's supply lines,

398
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,987
or confined in the Mediterranean.

399
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,115
These dispositions infuriated Doenitz.

400
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,661
He had no doubts
where the U-boats ought to be.

401
00:31:54,746 --> 00:32:01,126
(Doenitz) The German submarines
must not be used for any other purposes.

402
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:07,341
Their main strategic purpose
was to sink as many ships as possible

403
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,509
in the Atlantic.

404
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:16,099
But Hitler and the high command
would not listen.

405
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,770
(speaks German)

406
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,325
(narrator)
Although preoccupied with the Pacific,

407
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,870
the US naval staff were now willing
to rethink Atlantic tactics.

408
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,000
They finally established
a system of offshore convoys.

409
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,801
Sinkings of merchantmen dropped off.

410
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,387
Sinkings of U-boats began.

411
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,898
Doenitz now switched his boats
to the Caribbean,

412
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:09,111
where many ships
were still sailing independently.

413
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:33,593
(narrator) ln two months,
78 ships were sunk,

414
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,805
more than half of them oil tankers.

415
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,475
(man) lt was a very long time ago,
but l can see it now -

416
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,479
the people that lived aff
running around on fire

417
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,442
and throwing themselves
straight over the side into the oil

418
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,485
which was on fire all round.

419
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,448
ln the meantime, l shouted
to the remaining people in the boat

420
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,492
to get the oars out
and push her off from the ship's side

421
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,538
because the rivets of the ship's side
had burst out and they were on fire.

422
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,542
We rowed around for a wee while
and we heard some screams for help,

423
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:12,257
and we pulled out of the water
a fireman, or greaser as we call them,

424
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:17,054
and he was terribly burned,
so much so that when we pulled him in

425
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,808
the skin of his body and arms
came off in our hands like gloves.

426
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:28,148
We set sail and course for Trinidad.
l had a rough idea where it might be.

427
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,443
And so we tidied up the boat
and set off.

428
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,696
But shortly affer that the greaser,

429
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,575
who'd been in terrible agony all night,
he died,

430
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,453
and we laid him on the thwart
for a wee while.

431
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:47,667
And then shortly affer that they told me
that the third steward had died too,

432
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:53,256
so l went to have a look at him,
and he was wrapped up in a blanket,

433
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,175
and l took the blanket away

434
00:34:55,259 --> 00:35:00,013
and the whole of his stomach was
severely damaged and hanging out.

435
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,265
He'd been very patient during the night

436
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,060
and the only thing
he'd complained of was cold.

437
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:10,982
So we laid him on the thwart and covered
him with a blanket for about an hour,

438
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,361
because l wanted to really make sure
that they were dead,

439
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,322
because we had nothing to indicate...

440
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,534
Everything l did indicated
that they were so.

441
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:25,288
Eventually, affer about an hour,
we committed them to the deep.

442
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,750
Morale in the boat at this time
was very low

443
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:35,215
because these were all young boys -
17, 18, 19, 22.

444
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:41,555
And by this time it was a boat-load
of miseries, pain and death.

445
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,477
(narrator) Only eight men surVived
from the San Emiliano's crew of 40.

446
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:58,446
To Allied seamen
the U-boat crews were heartless killers,

447
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,032
but the Germans were brave men too.

448
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,619
They needed courage when depth charges
exploded around them,

449
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,914
sometimes for 12 hours at a stretch.

450
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:16,381
Eight of every ten U-boat crewmen
were to die in action.

451
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,550
(explosion)

452
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,096
(man shouts in German)

453
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,698
They called their U-boats iron coffins.

454
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:46,203
(German man)
The destroyer l met had radar

455
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,539
so he had me on his screen

456
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:54,085
and with full speed ahead

457
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,006
he rammed me for the first time.

458
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,551
And when l saw him
it was too late to dive.

459
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,304
l tried to torpedo him,

460
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:10,852
but the distance, 150 yards round about,

461
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:16,608
was too close,
so the torpedo wouldn't explode.

462
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:21,738
So l tried to get a bigger distance

463
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,241
between the destroyer and the boat.

464
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:29,913
And he was shooting during one hour
or two hours with machine guns.

465
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:34,125
An officer next to me was dead

466
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,880
and another officer,
he had got a bullet through his throat

467
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,675
and l had got a bullet in my chest

468
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:47,973
and l had some 30 shell splinters
in arm and leg

469
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,267
and a bullet in my head.

470
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,228
Affer one hour of stress

471
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,897
the sailors were very anxious

472
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,609
and one of the petty officers,
he lost his nerVes

473
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:04,864
and said, "Oh, this madman!"
and, "Why don't we surrender?"

474
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,908
But this was the only one.

475
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:11,371
(narrator) But the time was coming
when courage was no longer enough.

476
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,540
(speaks German)

477
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,713
Radio had remained essential
to wolf-pack operations.

478
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,883
But new Allied direction-finding
equipment could pick up German signals

479
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,761
and plot where they came from.

480
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:53,079
With short-wave radar, escorts could now
locate a U-boat on the surface...

481
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,294
offen sighting the U-boat
before her crew could see them.

482
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,132
The low silhouette
was no longer such an advantage.

483
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,800
(rings)

484
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,886
(speaking German)

485
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,022
(narrator)
Asdic equipment too was improving.

486
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,775
Escort ships
could track a submerged U-boat

487
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:26,196
as she twisted and turned
at low underwater speed.

488
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,706
There were new weapons,
like the hedgehog, for the kill.

489
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:59,562
The Germans did not realise the extent
of British and US technical advances,

490
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,439
nor did they match them.

491
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,234
The Germans had some very
high-class scientists

492
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,111
and some excellent engineers,

493
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,656
but they didn't achieve the results
they ought to have done.

494
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,492
Firstly, l think,
because they were mucked around,

495
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,078
and the Germans kept
altering the priorities,

496
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,665
and secondly because
l don't believe they were ever allowed

497
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,502
to take any interest
in the operational side,

498
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,588
as opposed to what happened with us,

499
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:30,593
where the scientists were made to feel
full members of the operational team.

500
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:34,722
l believe this, much more than
the question of weapons and devices,

501
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:40,103
was the reason why the Germans fell
so far astern in technological matters.

502
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,690
(narrator) And the Allies
were still behind in using

503
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,943
what would be the most effective
counter to the U-boat -

504
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,987
aircraff with radar.

505
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:03,877
Convoys could seldom be given
continuous long-range air cover.

506
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:09,716
When they were, losses were reduced
and U-boat kills increased.

507
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:26,357
The problem was range. Planes now flew
to the convoys from North America,

508
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:30,069
from lceland, from the United Kingdom.

509
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,198
But there was a vast gap
in mid-Atlantic

510
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,659
which these escort planes
could not reach.

511
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,245
The U-boats could and did.

512
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:46,878
ln the second half of 1942
over 3.5 million tons went down,

513
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,965
nearly 700 ships,
many of them in the Atlantic gap.

514
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,679
To close this gap,
escort carriers were needed

515
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,932
to sail with the convoys.

516
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,229
But few were yet available.

517
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,025
Or very long-range planes
like the Liberator.

518
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:13,905
But in 1942 the Americans needed
most of these in the Pacific.

519
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,117
Or Lancaster bombers,
but despite admiralty appeals

520
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,538
the RAF kept them all bombing Germany -

521
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,708
although they did release
other aircraff.

522
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,879
Bomber Command diverted
six squadrons to Coastal Command,

523
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,841
and if you'd said it would've been
better if they'd made that ten, yes,

524
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,553
but the line had to be drawn somewhere.

525
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:41,724
As a Coastal type l would've liked to
see a few more squadrons in Coastal,

526
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,228
but Bomber Command were pitifully short
of aeroplanes, too,

527
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,771
for the job they had to do.

528
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:51,526
Surely, if there had been
more Liberators allocated from America

529
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,529
we could have improved
the situation much earlier

530
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,740
and have saved the lives
of a lot of seamen.

531
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:07,834
(narrator) More and more, the war
effort depended on the United States.

532
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,720
Merchant ships and escorts
were mass-produced

533
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,765
to carry the material and men
for the invasion of Europe.

534
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,145
Unless the Atlantic was secured,
all else could fall apart.

535
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,940
ln January 1943,
Roosevelt and Churchill decreed

536
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,527
that the defeat of the U-boat
be given top priority.

537
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,075
lmproved escort vessels were built.

538
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:50,043
There were now enough of these
to go over to the attack.

539
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:56,549
But also in January 1943, Doenitz
took over as chief of the German navy.

540
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,843
He paid off most of the big ships

541
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,889
and released their crews
for the submarine serVice.

542
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,523
At last he could have U-boats
mass-produced.

543
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,569
17 new U-boats
were commissioned each month.

544
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:31,376
By early spring 1943,
Doenitz had over 400 U-boats in serVice.

545
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,382
Once again,
the convoys might be overwhelmed.

546
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,974
ln May came what was to prove
the decisive battle,

547
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,726
around convoy ONS-5.

548
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:54,107
ONS-5 was a rather small, very slow

549
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,985
and, of course, unladen, empty convoy.

550
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,279
And we had a lot of trouble.

551
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,951
The weather was very bad,
the ships got disorganised,

552
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,663
and south of lceland
affer three or four days

553
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,999
we had several attacks by submarines,

554
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:17,714
most of which we drove off successfully,
and only had one ship sunk.

555
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:23,970
Then affer a spell we had a long series
of very bad gales indeed,

556
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:29,642
combined with a little nip
into the ice pack off Greenland,

557
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,731
and at this stage
my ship was running short of fuel,

558
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,943
l couldn't fuel from the tanker because
of the weather, and l had to leave.

559
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,028
l got the signal from Gretton

560
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:46,659
that he had to push off
to Newfoundland to get fuel

561
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,204
and would l come back
and take over the escort?

562
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,458
Well, he didn't say "would l?",
he said, "You're in charge."

563
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,129
(narrator) May 3.
Four escort ships have leff to refuel.

564
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,299
ln bad weather
ten merchant ships have lost contact.

565
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,968
A line of U-boats is waiting.

566
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,636
As they move in on 4 May,

567
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,223
aircraff from Canada
sink one and damage another.

568
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:13,853
At about half past four to five o'clock
in the affernoon

569
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,939
the torpedoing started.

570
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,650
Well, l torpedoed two ships,

571
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,069
each with two torpedoes,

572
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,031
and one of these ships...

573
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,951
Well, it didn't explode,

574
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:34,749
but affer the explosion of the torpedoes
another big explosion happened.

575
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,834
l looked back and l saw the captain.

576
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,338
l would suggest the bridge
was probably...

577
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,841
oh, 10 or 15 feet,
might be a little more, off the water

578
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,761
when he jumped off
the wing of the bridge into the sea.

579
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,263
There was a life raff nearby,
l know that.

580
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,058
Well, l couldn't stop and pick him up.

581
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,061
And, well, it was in...

582
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,816
l suppose a matter of half a minute
that l got one myself.

583
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,111
Once more l was lucky
by slipping through into a gap

584
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,073
between two of the escort vessels

585
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:12,203
and closing into the port column
of the convoy,

586
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,456
and l fired the two torpedoes

587
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,502
and both torpedoes hit the target ship.

588
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:26,509
(narrator) May 5. The U-boats
make 25 attacks in eight hours.

589
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,511
More ships are sunk.

590
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:34,725
The outlook for the convoy is grim
as Doenitz orders in still more U-boats.

591
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,146
We picked up quite a lot of signals
from other submarines

592
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,900
also getting contact with this convoy.

593
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:48,030
And so we thought that this convoy
would be absolutely dead

594
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,116
during the next night.

595
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,080
Somewhere in the region of 10 o'clock
the attack started

596
00:47:56,164 --> 00:48:00,293
and they became fast and furious.

597
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,713
(Looks) Suddenly dense fog came up

598
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:09,135
and so it was nearly impossible
to find the convoy again.

599
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,931
l tried to do it,
but we couldn't find the ships again.

600
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:19,353
(Sherwood) Escorts were reporting
submarines coming in,

601
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:23,232
not ships being torpedoed,

602
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,904
and this, of course, was absolutely...

603
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,781
lt was the first time it happened,
certainly to me.

604
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:37,121
Staying on the surface during
the dark time, now in the dense fog,

605
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,916
of course it was very dangerous.

606
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,126
They were coming up
all the time saying

607
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,879
that a submarine
was bearing so-and-so on radar

608
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:49,091
and then the next thing you'd get:
"Submarine close alongside."

609
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:54,305
Another one: "Submarine
just ahead of me. l'm ramming."

610
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,265
And this went on all night.

611
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,019
l got a very firm asdic contact

612
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,395
about 800 yards

613
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,482
from the nearest ship in the convoy.

614
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,900
My immediate reaction,

615
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,860
which l think was the correct one -

616
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,904
in fact l know was the correct one -

617
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:15,409
was to increase speed and give it
a five-charge pattern straight away

618
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,453
to keep the chap's head down

619
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:21,749
so that it would put him off his stroke
if he was going to fire torpedoes.

620
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,961
But l was short of depth charges
at that stage

621
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,589
and l thought the conditions
were perfect -

622
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:32,343
the night was relatively calm,
a bit of fog -

623
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,887
perfect for a deliberate attack.

624
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:40,518
And so l decided on a deliberate attack
with our forward-throwing weapon,

625
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,936
the hedgehog.

626
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,939
We saw two distinct flashes

627
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,818
a few seconds
affer the hedgehog bombs hit the water,

628
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,071
and as we passed over the position

629
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,491
where our hedgehog bombs
had hit the water,

630
00:49:55,575 --> 00:50:01,372
we were virtually... our bow
was virtually liffed from the water

631
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:07,378
as a result of the U-boat breaking apart
and escaping air.

632
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,464
And there was great exhilaration
on the bridge

633
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,592
because this was our first kill.

634
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:19,056
We had no feelings at the time,
l'm afraid, of destroying 70-odd people.

635
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:26,647
One had control of one's emotions
by then, affer three years of war

636
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,567
and it was just the thought
that it's us or them,

637
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,736
and on that occasion it was them.

638
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:36,073
(narrator) May 6.
Although 11 merchantmen have been lost,

639
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:41,245
the escorts have beaten off the largest
wolf pack Doenitz can send against them.

640
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,165
Seven U-boats have been sunk,
others damaged.

641
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,418
Demoralised by their failure
to destroy the convoy

642
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:51,297
with the odds so much on their side,
the U-boats withdraw.

643
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:57,136
l think we really felt that at last
our training and technology

644
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,889
had got on top of the U-boats.

645
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:06,353
We sailed for the next convoy, SC-130,
on the top of the wave,

646
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,816
and despite the fact that we had
a very heavy battle

647
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:16,906
with about 20 U-boats, we sank three of
them and didn't lose one single ship.

648
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:30,044
(narrator) That month, May 1943,
41 U-boats were sunk.

649
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:38,052
ln one of them,
Doenitz lost his younger son.

650
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,304
(Doenitz) ln May 1943,

651
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,933
the German submarines had lost

652
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,645
the operational and tactical quality

653
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:51,857
of surface manoeuvrability.

654
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,068
(narrator) They never regained it.

655
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:59,949
Unable to range freely on the surface,
the wolf packs were beaten.

656
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:05,538
lt was time to celebrate a victory
in North Africa and in the Atlantic.

657
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:11,335
More than 30 U-boats were certainly
destroyed in the month of May,

658
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:17,299
foundering in many cases with their
crews into the dark depths of the sea.

659
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:22,638
Staggered by these deadly losses,
the U-boats have recoiled

660
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:26,433
to lick their wounds
and mourn their dead.

661
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,479
Our Atlantic convoys
came safely through.

662
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,524
And now,
as the result of the May victory

663
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,527
and the massacre of U-boats,

664
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:41,198
we have had in June the best month
from every point of view
