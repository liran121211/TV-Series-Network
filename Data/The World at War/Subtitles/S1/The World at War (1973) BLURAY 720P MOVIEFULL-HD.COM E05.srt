A bewildered, uncertain country.

3
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:31,196
Rumours abounded
of invasion by Hitler's Germany.

4
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,969
Here in the Kremlin, Russia's leaders
seemed oblivious of the Nazi threat,

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,096
or if not oblivious, then complacent,

6
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,267
as if, by ignoring it,
it might disappear.

7
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,235
Yet already, millions of German troops
were poised along Russia's border

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,238
to launch the bloodiest land battle
in history -

9
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,367
the battle that was eventually
to decide the Second World War.

Adolf Hitler had written:

"When we speak of new territory,

(narrator) The ordinary German,

35
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,845
like the ordinary Russian
or ordinary person anywhere,

36
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:28,767
had been surprised by Hitler's pact
with Stalin in August 1939.

37
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,521
To him, as to them, it had seemed
the least likely about-face

38
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,524
by the world's bitterest rivals.

39
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,245
The Nazi-Soviet Pact
had serVed its purpose for Hitler.

40
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,749
He had not been hindered
while he dealt with Poland and France.

41
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,627
Stalin, for his part,
gained a breathing space

42
00:04:55,712 --> 00:05:00,090
while he put his army in order affer
the blood-letting purges of the '30s.

43
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:06,430
He had gambled, too, on a lengthy
struggle between Germany and the Allies.

44
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,565
But the German victories in the west
had been swiffer than he had expected.

45
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:22,195
(man) Hitler wanted to attack Russia
already in the fall of 1940,

46
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,410
and let himself, for once, be persuaded

47
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:33,790
that it would be impossible
to go to war at that late time

48
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,127
on account of the weather in Russia,

49
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,005
and for the reason that it would be

50
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:45,344
urgent and necessary

51
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,637
to enforce the German army,

52
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,182
as well as the German air force,

53
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,435
before entering into this new campaign.

54
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,067
ln August '39, when Hitler
had signed the pact with Russia,

55
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,277
in the evening, there was a movie,

56
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:08,450
and this movie showed the parade of
the Russian troops before the Kremlin.

57
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:13,497
He was very much impressed and
was relieved that now, with the pact,

58
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,875
this army is neutralised.

59
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,633
But afferwards, when the German troops
met the Russian ones

60
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,803
in occupying Poland,

61
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,389
officers reported to Hitler

62
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:38,188
that the equipment
of those Russian units were very poor.

63
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,982
He first didn't believe it so much,

64
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,277
but then when the Russians
attacked the Finns

65
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,906
and they didn't have any progress,

66
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,577
he was convinced
that this was really the truth

67
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:58,750
and he was now considering
the Russian army

68
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,002
no more as strong as before.

69
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,761
(narrator) Doubts about the Red Army's
strength had been raised inside Russia.

70
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,848
The purges of the '30s
had decimated its leadership.

71
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:18,145
90% of its generals, 80% of its colonels
and well over half its corps commanders

72
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,565
had been put to death at Stalin's whim.

73
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:33,201
Every single commander
of a military district was eliminated.

74
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,622
Every single commander
of an army division has been eliminated.

75
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,877
Every single commander of a regiment,
with some exceptions here,

76
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,712
also eliminated.

77
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:49,259
Now, you see, this is a little more
than political weakness.

78
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,137
The army was beheaded, so to speak.

79
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,201
(narrator) Affer the Red Army's
poor performance against the Finns,

80
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,204
steps were taken to reform it.

81
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,874
When news reached Moscow of
the Wehrmacht's crushing of the French,

82
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,710
these reforms were accelerated.

83
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,589
They were still incomplete
by the summer of 1940.

84
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,841
All the same, Stalin seized his chance

85
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,928
while Hitler was preoccupied
with the battle for Britain

86
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:39,142
to grab first the Baltic States
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,

87
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,311
and then, within the same month,

88
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:46,441
those parts of Romania known as
Bessarabia and northern Bukovina -

89
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,985
a move that, to Hitler,
brought Russian troops

90
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,781
uncomfortably close
to the Romanian oil wells at Ploesti,

91
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,116
Germany's only oil supply,

92
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,162
vital for its tanks and planes
and ships.

93
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,838
But with the bulk of his forces
still in the west,

94
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,675
Hitler did not interVene.

95
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,052
lnstead, he stepped up
diplomatic pressure

96
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,014
to woo the Balkans into the German fold.

97
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,066
First, King Boris of Bulgaria
was invited

98
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,403
to visit Hitler that autumn
at Berchtesgaden,

99
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,197
and he was followed
by Prince Paul of Yugoslavia

100
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,284
and by young King Michael of Romania.

101
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,202
Michael was already under the sway

102
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,539
of his pro-German prime minister,
Antonescu.

103
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:49,713
When news broke that Romania
and Hungary had joined the Axis,

104
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,923
the Russians reacted sharply.

105
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:57,304
They accused Berlin of violating
the spirit of the August 1939 pact.

106
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:03,310
The frail Soviet-German friendship
was beginning to fall apart.

107
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,608
Hitler, that same month,
further strengthened the Axis.

108
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,778
He signed a new military alliance
with ltaly and with Japan -

109
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,364
the Tripartite Pact.

110
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:22,162
lt was aimed, allegedly,
at only the United States and Britain.

111
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:27,334
The Russians thought otherwise.
They protested angrily.

112
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,013
Hitler invited Stalin's closest adviser,
Molotov,

113
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,141
to Berlin that November 1940,

114
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:47,562
to help, as he put it,
"clarify the situation".

115
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:54,152
lt was a disastrous visit
for Soviet-German relations.

116
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,749
(Speer) When Molotov visited Berlin,

117
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,795
he was obviously afraid of
being poisoned by bacteria

118
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,425
and he asked that all the plates,
all the glasses he used

119
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,471
are boiled before they came in use.

120
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,224
(man) He was blunt in his remarks

121
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,018
and he didn't spare Hitler at all.

122
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,854
Very uncompromising,

123
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:34,859
hardly smiling at all,
reminding me of my mathematics teacher,

124
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,572
with the spectacles -
hostile spectacles -

125
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,827
looking at his pupil, Hitler,
and saying,

126
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,537
"ls our agreement -

127
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,747
last year's agreement - still valid?"

128
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,041
Hitler thought it was a mistranslation.

129
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,960
He said, "Of course. Why not?"

130
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,837
And Molotov said, "Yes,

131
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,715
l ask this question
because of the Finns."

132
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,551
"You're on very friendly relations
with the Finns."

133
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,638
"You invite people from Finland to
Germany and send the missions there."

134
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:08,768
"The Finns are very dangerous people.
They undermine our security."

135
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,062
"We'll have to do something about that,

136
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,481
and we are going
to do something about that."

137
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,652
Whereupon Hitler exploded and said,
"l understand you very well."

138
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:22,574
"You want to wage war against Finland,

139
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,286
and that is quite out of the question,
do you hear me? lmpossible!"

140
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,124
"Because my supplies
of iron and of nickel

141
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,253
and of other important raw materials
would be cut."

142
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,589
lt was a very tough,

143
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:42,802
almost a heavyweight championship
in political discussion.

144
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,764
(narrator) Even while Molotov
was still in Berlin,

145
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:51,436
Hitler ordered his generals to plan
an attack on Russia for May 15, 1941 .

146
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,108
They responded with a detailed scheme
which he named "Operation Barbarossa"

147
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,612
affer the red-bearded Prussian emperor
who, centuries earlier,

148
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,573
had crusaded against the Slavs.

149
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,618
Hitler's generals had taken
some convincing.

150
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,663
To attack Russia with Britain resisting
was to fight a war on two fronts,

151
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,374
something that
even Mein Kampfmaintained

152
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,211
to be the gravest of military mistakes.

153
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,507
But Hitler argued,
and with some truth that winter of 1940,

154
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,469
that Britain, although not beaten,
was not a threat,

155
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:31,059
so an eastern campaign would be the only
front, provided it was over quickly.

156
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:38,733
Years earlier, Hitler had written,
"Armies do not exist for peace."

157
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,905
"They exist solely
for triumphant exertion in war."

158
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,634
The Wehrmacht's morale
was at its height.

159
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,763
Where was it to march next?
lt couldn't move against Britain on land

160
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,599
and amphibious warfare
was not to Hitler's liking.

161
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,977
Magnetism alone, it seemed,

162
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:18,022
must draw it against its sole
remaining antagonist within Europe,

163
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,026
draw it in the same way
as Napoleon's armies had been drawn

164
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,655
when they, too, had been leff
champing at the bit along the Channel -

165
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,283
eastwards, ever eastwards,

166
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,327
to the boundless motherland of Russia.

167
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,658
The Red Army in 1941
was the largest in the world.

168
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,493
ln tanks, it outnumbered,

169
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:18,041
in airplanes, it equalled the rest
of the world's armies put together.

170
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,261
Despite its shortcomings,
the Red Army was better equipped

171
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,889
than previous Wehrmacht victims,

172
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:37,936
and its reorganisation since the fiasco
of the Finnish war was well under way.

173
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:42,148
But what of its morale?
Hitler felt sure he knew the answer:

174
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,942
"You have only to kick in the door

175
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,321
and the whole rotten structure
will come crashing down."

176
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,700
Russia's leaders still thought
they could buy time

177
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,037
while their army made ready
for the struggle.

178
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:09,509
By March 1941 , Russian troops were
already being faced by German troops

179
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,846
along the borders of Hungary
and Romania, and even Bulgaria.

180
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,725
Yugoslavia, too, looked like
becoming a German satellite until,

181
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,811
encouraged by British intelligence,

182
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:24,524
a popular uprising in Belgrade
pushed out the Nazi puppets.

183
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:29,195
lncredibly, Moscow
concluded a pact with the rebels.

184
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,449
The very next day,
Hitler attacked Yugoslavia.

185
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,625
lncensed by the revolt,
he named the operation "Retribution".

186
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:27,045
Operation Retribution
meant postponing Operation Barbarossa

187
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,756
by five crucial weeks.

188
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,928
But now Russia stood by while
the Wehrmacht overran her newest ally.

189
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:57,366
Hitler marched into Greece, again
without Moscow so much as protesting.

190
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,833
This inaction made Hitler
even more headstrong

191
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,003
as his armies swept on
to further easy victories.

192
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,682
Stalin's spies had been
sending back reports

193
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,477
of German troop concentrations
along his borders,

194
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,146
reports which he chose to ignore.

195
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,441
When Western diplomats warned him too,
he shrugged them off.

196
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,068
He argued to his cronies

197
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,238
that however inevitable
a Nazi-Soviet conflict might be,

198
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,491
these present reports
were simply a British ruse.

199
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:43,204
(man) The interesting thing was
that both Roosevelt and Churchill

200
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,458
informed Stalin
that Hitler was going to attack Russia.

201
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,335
Stalin thought that was a trick

202
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,962
on our part

203
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,924
to get him to mobilise and to divert,

204
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,801
to provoke Hitler into attack.

205
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,512
Stalin was very conscious that

206
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,389
in World War l,

207
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,476
it was the Tsar's mobilisation

208
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:10,439
that caused the German -

209
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,359
the Kaiser - to attack Russia,

210
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,987
and he wasn't going
to have any part of it.

211
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,699
There is a traditional
pathological mistrust.

212
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,660
When the British say something,

213
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,874
Stalin's philosophy used to tell us,
"You must think the opposite".

214
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,042
lf the British warn us,

215
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:36,174
that must mean that
they try to put us against the Germans.

216
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:41,721
For that reason - the main reason -
he neglected all the warnings.

217
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,140
(narrator) May Day in Moscow, 1941 .

218
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,976
(♪ rousing, patriotic song)

219
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,566
A particularly impressive
military parade,

220
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,776
as if to reassure the Russian people

221
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,448
in the face of all the rumours
of impending invasion.

222
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,500
Russian diplomacy
was aimed at appeasing Hitler,

223
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:17,840
hoping to delay any attack until the
Red Army's reforms would be complete.

224
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,887
And so, while the generals lectured,

225
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,682
the diplomats rushed grain and
much-needed raw materials to Germany,

226
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,394
turned a blind eye to the incursions
of German reconnaissance planes

227
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,063
over Soviet territory

228
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,566
and even slowed down
their building of frontier defences

229
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,402
so as not to offend Berlin.

230
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,450
Yet even as Stalin's defence commissar

231
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,703
shook hands with
Hitler's military attaché in Moscow,

232
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,958
three million German troops
were moving up to the border.

233
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,337
The biggest land battle in history
was about to begin.

234
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,045
The shock was all the greater
when it came.

235
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,506
l remember that night, l'd been out

236
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,759
and came home rather late
and turned on the radio,

237
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,928
and l got onto, l think it was Kharkov

238
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,638
or Kiev or somewhere like that,

239
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,933
and there were accounts going on

240
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,019
of bombing and attacks and things,

241
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,314
which l thought was
a sort of Orson Welles programme,

242
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,359
like when he bombed New York,
remember?

243
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,903
Then we checked around
and found it was real.

244
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:19,170
We were told that the Red Army
will never fight on its own territory,

245
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,965
that the very first shot
will be made on enemy's territory.

246
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,925
Then, suddenly, on the 22nd,

247
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,512
we were told that Sevastopol
is being bombed, Kiev is being bombed,

248
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,725
Smolensk, bombed.
The enemy smashed, wiped out our forces.

249
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,161
(man) Affer the success
of the other campaigns,

250
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:57,917
we had confidence
that Barbarossa would be successful too.

251
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:08,260
(man #2) The first period
of the advance was very quick.

252
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:13,391
We made more than 100km per day.

253
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:23,818
(man #3) We hadn't lost a battle,
so we were used to being victorious.

254
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,529
(narrator) Hitler's plan
was for three armies

255
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:31,617
to seek out and destroy
the Russian forces within four months.

256
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,703
(man #4) l never was in a war before.

257
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,289
We had no fear

258
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:42,503
because we thought
we will win the war against Russia,

259
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:48,843
because the wars against
Poland and France,

260
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,347
we had ended with victories for Germany.

261
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,105
(narrator) As well as surprise,

262
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:05,818
the Germans had overwhelming superiority
in men and fire power

263
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:09,530
at those points
chosen for their armoured thrusts.

264
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:14,577
Three Russian infantry divisions
were annihilated that first day,

265
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,663
and another five cut to pieces.

266
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,217
(man #2) During the River Bug crossing,

267
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:37,516
we were attacked
by several obsolete Russian aircraff

268
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,269
that were shot down immediately

269
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,563
and we were very impressed

270
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,525
by the superiority of our air force
at the beginning.

271
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,787
(narrator) During the first two days,

272
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,666
2,000 Russian planes were destroyed,
mostly on the ground.

273
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:11,050
The world's largest air force
had been well-nigh eradicated.

274
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:18,807
Their air cover gone, the Russian
frontier armies wilted and disappeared.

275
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,907
ln a week, the Wehrmacht
was already halfway to Moscow.

276
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,454
ln a month, the Germans had won an area
double the size of their own country.

(narrator) Like the French
the summer before,

296
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,509
the Russians used their tanks
in penny packets

instead of the mass formations

littered the battlefield.

6,000 Russian tanks were lost

301

in just two engagements
at Minsk and Smolensk in July.

302
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,663
(♪ lively German song)

303
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:06,308
(narrator) Half a million Russians
were killed in the first fortnight,

304
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,228
and nearly a million taken prisoner.

305
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:16,777
As the weeks went by, the Russian losses
mounted, bewildering the Germans,

306
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:21,031
who refused to believe such profligacy
in human life could possibly continue.

307
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,913
As in France the year before,

308
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,583
Hitler was concerned more
to destroy enemy forces in the field

309
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,546
than to capture cities
or to conquer territory.

310
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,969
His generals
didn't always see it that way.

311
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,179
Tempted, perhaps, by golden spires,

312
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,100
they vied with each other to be
the captor of this or that great city,

313
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,519
especially Moscow.

314
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,837
To capture the Russian capital
without delay, the generals argued,

315
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,672
would be decisive.

316
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,217
Hitler preferred to destroy
the Russian forces in the south first,

317
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,679
hoping for a decisive battle there.

318
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,433
Moscow was not his first priority.

319
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:34,021
ln August,
he ordered his panzers to swing south.

320
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,483
Kiev,

321
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:42,321
the capital of the Ukraine,
was taken in mid-September.

322
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,036
ln one of the most spectacular
encircling movements

323
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,662
in military history,

324
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,540
the German panzers
took prisoner at Kiev

325
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,169
nearly
three quarters of a million Russians.

326
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,184
German newsreel cameramen

327
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,479
made great play of these
long columns of luckless Russians

328
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,982
for whom frontline fighting
was now over.

329
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,568
But ahead lay another hell -

330
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,863
imprisonment at the hands of the Nazis.

331
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,617
Of every hundred Russian prisoners
seen here,

332
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:32,579
only three would ever return alive.

333
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,305
By the end of September '41 ,

334
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,766
affer just three months of war,

335
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,853
the Russians had lost
nearly three million men.

336
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,607
But Russian resilience
before such fatal-seeming blows

337
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,819
was to astonish the world.

338
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,630
The German was told
to regard his Russian foe as subhuman,

339
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,342
but it was not long before
the German frontline soldier, at least,

340
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,555
came to think of him
as more superhuman than subhuman.

341
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,642
The Russians seldom cried out
when wounded

342
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,813
and there always seemed to be
more of them on the horizon.

343
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,399
One Wehrmacht colonel wrote:

344
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,568
"ln fighting Russia,

345
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,322
the German army is like an elephant
attacking a host of ants."

346
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,366
"The elephant will kill thousands,
maybe millions,

347
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:55,704
but in the end,
their numbers will overcome him

348
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,874
and he will be eaten to the bone."

349
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,796
(man) Orientation in Russia

350
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:09,801
is as difficult as it is in the desert,

351
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,388
only you don't see the horizon.

352
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,140
You are lost.

353
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,352
The immense space here was so immense

354
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:23,565
that we had many soldiers

355
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,069
who became melancholy.

356
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,614
The valley -

357
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,660
flat valleys, flat hills,
flat valleys, flat hills -

358
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,537
endless. There was no limit.

359
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,790
We could not see an end

360
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:44,628
and it was so disconsolate.

361
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,090
We saw the big fields -

362
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,342
the cornfields -

363
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,511
from the horizon to the horizon.

364
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,680
We never saw it before.

365
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,932
lt's very large.

366
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:03,814
Unimaginable vastness of this country,

367
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,733
and we advanced
from one river to the other,

368
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,737
from one position to the other,
and there was no end to it.

369
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:42,602
(narrator) "Trade space for time"
was the traditional Russian strategy.

370
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,688
Time was not on Hitler's side

371
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,650
if he was to achieve
his decisive victory before winter.

372
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,486
(Russell) I remember
flying back from Kuibyshev

373
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:56,867
and there was this great tank trap they
were digging all round, outside Moscow,

374
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:02,039
and one saw what looked like ants
moving around it,

375
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,208
and it was practically
the entire population of Moscow -

376
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,627
man, woman and child - digging.

377
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:12,716
l think they did tap every emotional
resource that was available to them.

378
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,635
l remember, for instance,
a lot of churches being open

379
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,681
that had been shut for a long time.

380
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,559
(Tokaty) ln that very situation,

381
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:26,146
something else appeared among us -

382
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,774
the tradition of Borodino.

383
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,194
Borodino is the place
where Napoleon was defeated.

384
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:38,033
And suddenly, religious feeling
just appeared from nowhere

385
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,328
and that helped to unite people.

386
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,749
(narrator) With the Ukraine subdued
and Leningrad surrounded,

387
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,586
Hitler now turned his attention
to the biggest prize of all,

388
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,962
Moscow,

389
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,799
something his generals
had been beseeching him to do

390
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,219
since the start of the campaign.

391
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,810
Moscow in October '41
was already a frontline city.

392
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,647
German troops had been
only 200 miles away since August,

393
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,691
when Hitler had diverted his panzers
southwards.

394
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,489
Rumours had been rife
of early capitulation.

395
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,617
The city had long been placed
under military rule.

396
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:26,623
Hardly a day went by
without a visit from the Luffwaffe.

397
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,019
The battle for Moscow
began in earnest in early October.

398
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,440
Straight away,
things went wrong for its defenders.

399
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,740
(squealing)

400
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,494
ln two vast pincer movements,

401
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,373
the Germans captured
another 700,000 Russian troops.

402
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,543
Goebbels summoned
American war correspondents to Berlin

403
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,754
to announce Moscow's impending fall.

404
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,382
(man #3) We had had
a very beautiful summer.

405
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:21,970
No problems - climatic problems -
or anything of this sort.

406
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:28,685
As l remember it, it started snowing
and becoming cold around October 10,

407
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:35,817
and then we knew immediately that we
were totally unprepared and unequipped

408
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,528
for what was lying ahead of us.

409
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,114
(narrator)
When one panzer commander asked

410
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,241
when he could expect winter clothing,

411
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:48,038
he was told not to make further
unnecessary requests of this type.

412
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,249
On the day the first snows fell
before Moscow,

413
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,002
its defenders received a new commander,

414
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:59,132
Zhukov, something German intelligence
didn't consider worth telling Hitler,

415
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,718
although Zhukov had led
Leningrad's defence

416
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,804
with enormous energy
since mid-September.

417
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:09,726
But Moscow's defence was to be
a bigger test of Zhukov's generalship.

418
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,522
The first snows soon melted,

419
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,776
turning roads into quagmires.

420
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:24,741
(man #5) Only a few roads in Russia
were paved.

421
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:31,164
Therefore, in autumn,
the terrible period of mud was beginning

422
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,210
and the roads became deeply soffened,

423
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,922
and therefore useless for motorcars,

424
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,675
except tanks.

425
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:54,312
(man #1) We had, as infantry,
to march along the sides of the roads

426
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,441
to let pass cars and the tanks.

427
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:06,992
(man #6) The wheels of my guns
were broken.

428
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,829
(man #2) And within a period
of two or three days,

429
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:14,708
we had to improvise mobility

430
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:21,131
by requisitioning pannier horses
and wagons.

431
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:31,308
We all were quite happy about the
success of the German armies in Russia,

432
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,519
but the first inkling
that something is wrong

433
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,565
was when Goebbels
made a big action in all Germany

434
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:43,778
to collect furs and winter clothes
for the German troops.

435
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,574
Then we knew something was ahead
which was not foreseen.

436
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:55,832
(man #7) We had no warm mantles
and nothing,

437
00:38:55,958 --> 00:39:00,462
only the things we had
also in summertime.

438
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,548
(man #3) And we were actually angry

439
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,843
that we didn't have better equipment.

440
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,805
(narrator) The weather worsened.

441
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,142
Many German commanders
favoured halting for the winter.

442
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,769
Hitler would have none of it.

443
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,938
Convinced victory would be his
before winter proper,

444
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,232
he ordered his generals on, on,

445
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,904
as soon as the ground
had hardened enough to bear his panzers.

446
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:33,828
The welcome delay allowed Zhukov
to organise Moscow's defences.

447
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:48,593
The Russians had less than
400 tanks leff to defend Moscow.

448
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,721
Space was running out fast for Zhukov,

449
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,224
but time was still on his side

450
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:58,770
as the cold winds of winter
swept in from the north.

451
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,944
But, on October 14,

452
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,696
a panzer group broke through
and took Kalinin,

453
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,825
less than 100 miles away to the north.

454
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:16,454
A few days later, another unit
took Mozhaysk, 60 miles west,

455
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,918
while an infantry division
reached Gorki, just 40 miles away.

456
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,339
Panic gripped Moscow's citizens.

457
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,802
Those who could, leff - two million,
including most government departments.

458
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:34,889
Even Lenin's coffin was evacuated,
along with other Kremlin treasures.

459
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,852
(Russell) lt was a bit of a shock
when, in those two or three days -

460
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,272
l suppose they were just
the advance spear tip probably -

461
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,066
a few chaps on motorbikes or something
got to within

462
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,694
40 or 50 kilometres of Moscow.

463
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:52,073
Then there was, l must say,
considerable shock in Moscow.

464
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,825
People were trying to get out.

465
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,661
They thought
the German army was going to roll in.

466
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,872
(Tokaty) ln fact, l should imagine,

467
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,499
from October 16

468
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,502
to about October 20,

469
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,505
an average citizen of Moscow
probably expected

470
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,176
that Moscow will fall
within the next few days,

471
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,179
and that was what
the panic was about, really.

472
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:19,225
People used just to stop
top-ranking secret serVice officers

473
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,479
and shout insults at them
without any fear.

474
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,273
ln normal times,
you couldn't do anything like that.

475
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:30,278
These were the only times when,
probably, a very weak force of Germans,

476
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:35,074
if they would manage to drop a unit
of some kind of parachutists inside,

477
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,077
we would have real trouble.

478
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,539
(narrator) But while Hitler plotted
his final attack on Moscow,

479
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,251
Zhukov, too, planned an attack.

480
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,045
But with what?

481
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,715
He had already withdrawn as many troops
as he dared from other sectors

482
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,718
to defend Moscow.

483
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,597
But there was one reserVe
the Russians had not yet touched,

484
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,933
nor ever thought they would be able to.

485
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,769
The 40 divisions of the Siberian front,

486
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:08,233
among the best troops in Russia,
trained to fight in winter conditions.

487
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,154
Since June, they had been expecting
a Japanese attack.

488
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:21,287
Midway through October,
Stalin's master spy in Tokyo

489
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,083
reported Japan's eyes were elsewhere.

490
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,503
This time, Stalin believed his spies.

491
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,048
He moved the Siberian divisions
to Moscow.

492
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,387
Even at this moment of crisis,

493
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:41,683
Moscow took time off to celebrate
the anniversary of the revolution,

494
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,769
and Stalin showed himself to his people.

495
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:51,234
(Tokaty) We could say,
in spite of all his shortcomings,

496
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:58,575
that Stalin rendered a very great
serVice to the USSR by that presence

497
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,743
because it showed two things:

498
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:05,665
one, the supreme commander
did not run away,

499
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:10,211
secondly, Stalin retained his nerVe.

500
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:16,009
That sense of nerVe spread at once
into all the armed forces.

501
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:21,723
All the commanders began saying,
"Stalin himself, he is here."

502
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,272
(people cheer)

503
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:48,416
(narrator) The ground had hardened.
The panzers were able to roll again.

504
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,795
On November 26, they entered lstra,

505
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,089
just 30 miges west of Moscow,

506
00:43:55,215 --> 00:44:01,179
and four days later had taken
Krasnaya Polyana, just 25 miles north.

507
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,229
As yet,
Zhukov had not used his Siberians

508
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,316
and German intelligence
had not stumbled on the presence

509
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,735
of such numbers of fresh troops.

510
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:20,198
But the Germans
were having troubles of their own.

511
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:27,664
(man #1) And one morning,
it was finished.

512
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,042
All was frozen,

513
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:34,962
and the cars were sitting in the mud,
frozen,

514
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,757
and the tanks could not roll

515
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,594
and, in this moment,
my heart broke down.

516
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,723
And there was, in the distance,
a large town,

517
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:50,687
and l think that was the first time
and the last time l have seen Moscow.

518
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,567
(narrator) Temperatures were down
to minus 40 degrees centigrade.

519
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:00,697
Oil solidified
in the sumps of lorries and tanks.

520
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,491
The intense cold
affected the soldiers, too.

521
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,911
There were more casualties
from frostbite and stomach troubles

522
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,579
than from fighting.

523
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,832
(man #3) We had no winter shoes.

524
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:18,840
We had no equipment whatsoever
to fight or stand the cold.

525
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:23,052
And l think this became
a very, very big problem right away.

526
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,140
We lost a considerable part
of our equipment -

527
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,519
guns,
heavy and light equipment in general.

528
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,188
We, of course, due to the cold,

529
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:38,735
lost a lot of people
who got frostbitten,

530
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:43,948
and we had not even
the necessary amount of ointments

531
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,744
or the most simple and primitive things
to fight it.

532
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,998
Of 900 men in my battalion,

533
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:56,544
200 fell out because of freezing

534
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,714
in the first 14 days.

535
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,092
(man #3) As it became colder,

536
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:07,263
towards the end of November
and early December,

537
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:12,643
most of our artillery
had become completely unusable.

538
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:20,693
(man #6) We had not the lubrication oil
suitable for this winter war.

539
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,154
Nevertheless, the Russians had it

540
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:28,201
and suddenly our soldiers realised

541
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,287
that from one moment to the next,

542
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,332
the weapon didn't shoot any more.

543
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:42,924
(man #3) Well, the worst memory was
if the vehicles got frozen in the ground

544
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,260
and the motor oil was thick
so we couldn't move.

545
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:51,349
And we needed and we wanted to move.
l think that was the worst.

546
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:58,147
(man #1) ln Russia, there were
no signposts to mark the ways.

547
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,983
To find our roads,

548
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:06,113
we had set the frozen bodies of horses

549
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,783
along the snow walls

550
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:12,578
to find the way during the snowdriffs.

551
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:18,501
And the scenery was so disconsolate -

552
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:22,129
always snow and snow.

553
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,968
(man #4) We always were alone,

554
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:31,430
dreaming what time
we will be back in Berlin.

555
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,269
(narrator) But the powers that be
in Berlin refused to believe the worst.

556
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,064
The newsreels
made it all seem great fun.

557
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,286
The reality was different.

558
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:02,169
(man #2) At that time,
we had advanced almost 2,000 kilometres.

559
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,932
Hitler, at first,
did not want to conceive

560
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:19,812
that this crisis was the end
of all his strategical planning,

561
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:23,441
but the army knew better,

562
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:28,696
and the Russians did

563
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,948
the most important part

564
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,701
in convincing Hitler, too,

565
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,370
that the Russian campaign
of this first year

566
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,040
had failed and had come to an end.

567
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,048
(narrator) December 6.

568
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:50,134
With the Wehrmacht's morale
at its lowest,

569
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:53,846
although some German troops
were just 15 miles from the Kremlin,

570
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,265
Zhukov unleashed his Siberians.

571
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,102
(man #4) lt was astonishing this time -

572
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:05,149
the first time -
l saw the Russian tanks,

573
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,109
34,

574
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:11,113
running through the fields
and through the snow.

575
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:17,203
Our own tanks couldn't drive,
couldn't shoot,

576
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,997
because it was too cold.

577
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,389
(man #6) When l wanted to go back,
l met Russians everywhere,

578
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,017
and so this was the first impression

579
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,938
that there was no victory any more.

580
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,775
(narrator) As the Russians
regained territory,

581
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,904
they began to uncover
the horror of the Nazi occupation.

582
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,748
"Comrade, kill your German"
became the catch phrase.

583
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,417
ln the first month
of the counteroffensive,

584
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:32,004
more than 300,000 Germans
were killed or captured.

585
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:36,217
(man #4) The worst memory
of this retreat

586
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,427
was the fear,

587
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,596
every day and every night,

588
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,933
to come in captivity.

589
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:50,523
(man #3) We had seen enough of the
enemy to know that in cases like that,

590
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,692
prisoners were hardly taken.

591
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,990
(man #1) lt was the first time
that our soldiers remarked

592
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:44,285
the dark shadows of the coming times.

593
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,302
(man #4) When we must retreat
from Moscow,

594
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:07,474
the Russian population
and the Russian soldiers must think:

595
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,478
"lt's possible to defeat
the German army."

596
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,569
(narrator) Two days
affer the Russian offensive began,

597
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,197
the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbour.

598
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:25,075
The war was taking
a very different turn.

599
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:36,124
