1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,304
(narrator) October, 1940.

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,183
Winston Churchill
to the defeated French people:

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,394
(Churchill) Good night, then.

4
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:24,398
Sleep to gather strength
for the morning.

5
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,775
For the morning will come.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,571
Brightly will it shine
on the brave and true,

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,075
kindly on all who sufter for the cause.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,244
Vive la France!

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,749
Allons, bonne nuit.

10
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,752
Dormez bien.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,798
Rassemblez vos forces pour l'aube,
car l'aube viendra.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,220
(narrator) Now, at last,
after nearly four years,

13
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,848
that dawn was about to break.

14
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,685
The invasion of the Continent
was at hand.

15
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,164
(narrator) Dieppe, 1942.

16
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:11,713
The first major attempt to land
Allied troops in France was a disaster.

17
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,718
Almost half the assaulting force
of 7,000 was lost

18
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,013
trying to storm
the port's powerful defences.

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,228
Many troops never got
beyond the beaches.

20
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,440
Hundreds of others
walked straight into captivity.

21
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,945
(man) We learnt so much from Dieppe
that l think it was quite invaluable

22
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,240
as far as the final invasion
was concerned.

23
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,286
l think everything that could go wrong
went wrong with that operation.

24
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,706
The result of it was that, by the end,

25
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,959
one was appallingly impressed

26
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,129
by the dangers and the hazards

27
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,423
of any kind of combined operation

28
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,966
on that kind of scale.

29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,470
We'd never attempted to do a combined
operation on that scale before.

30
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,764
And, really, nobody knew how to do it.

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,810
There are three conditions necessary
for a successful invasion.

32
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:11,481
First, obviously, to get ashore
against no matter what opposition.

33
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,400
Secondly, having got ashore,

34
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,862
to stay ashore no matter
what the weather conditions.

35
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,488
Thirdly, to stop the enemy

36
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,201
from building up his forces
against you quicker than you can,

37
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,078
otherwise he'll throw you
back into the sea.

38
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,623
(narrator) Given these essentials,

39
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,792
the two likeliest landing areas
were the Pas-de-Calais,

40
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,213
across the English Channel
at its narrowest point,

41
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,131
and Normandy to the west.

42
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,885
The choice was the first task
of Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan

43
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,555
and his special Allied staft,
known as COSSAC,

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,727
appointed in 1943
to frame the initial invasion plans.

45
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,814
Tentative invasion planning
had gone on since 1941 .

46
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,692
COSSAC's choice in the end
was Normandy,

47
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,989
a 50-mile stretch of shore
just east of the Cherbourg peninsula.

48
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,453
Normandy had several advantages
over the Pas-de-Calais.

49
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:11,541
Though farther from England,
it was less strongly fortified.

50
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,127
lts beaches, mostly without clifts

51
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,130
and with a minimum
of clay and depressions,

52
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,384
were more suited
to the landing of troops and supplies

53
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,928
and to rapid deployment inland.

54
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:27,683
And it was close to Cherbourg
and the Brittany ports.

55
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,440
At Quebec, in August, 1943,

56
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:41,280
COSSAC's outline plan for invasion
was approved by Churchill and Roosevelt.

57
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,992
The cross-Channel assault
was now, at last, to become reality.

58
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:50,497
lts codename - Overlord.
lts target date - May, 1944.

59
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,671
The springboard for invasion
would be England.

60
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,758
Britons, displaced once by
Hitler's bombs, were on the move again.

61
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,179
This time, to make way
for the great invasion armies.

62
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,101
For many, this meant upheaval,
financial loss, personal problems.

63
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,562
But the cause was momentous -

64
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,523
the long-awaited second front.

65
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,359
(♪ Little Brown Jug)

66
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,043
Already from the United States,

67
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,421
the packed troop ships
were streaming across the Atlantic.

68
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,488
By now, the number of Americans
in Britain

69
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,740
approached one and a half million,

70
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:10,786
and London's streets
displayed every known Allied uniform.

71
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,918
ln this great floating barracks,
morale was all-important.

72
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,716
We've had some grand trips.

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,636
But it's been wonderful.
l'm very thrilled to be here.

74
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,055
l have nothing new to report
from the States.

75
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,183
You know, the States -
that's where Churchill lives. l...

76
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,023
But he really travels.
Boy, he's been around.

77
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,277
He's been to Casablanca
more than Humphrey Bogart.

78
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,823
(narrator) On a difterent stage,
another American,

79
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,866
General Dwight David Eisenhower,

80
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:54,162
named by Roosevelt
Overlord's supreme commander.

81
00:06:54,247 --> 00:07:00,127
Eisenhower had commanded the Allied
North African expedition in 1942.

82
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,089
As well as generalship,
he would need the finesse of a diplomat

83
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:09,177
because he was now
to lead a huge multinational force.

84
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,639
You always have problems,
but General Eisenhower,

85
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,977
being the supreme Allied commander,
he had this wonderful knack

86
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,856
of getting along with people
of all difterent nationalities.

87
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,442
He didn't think of himself
as an American,

88
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:29,156
he didn't think of himself as British
or French or Polish or anything.

89
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,826
He just thought what was best
for the whole Allied eftort.

90
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,038
(narrator) Best known
of lke's commanders-to-be

91
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,749
was General Montgomery,
victor of Alamein.

92
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,419
Famous for his plain speaking
to his troops,

93
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:46,882
Monty now urged the war workers
to maximum eftort.

94
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,972
Why is it...
why is it that today the tide has turned

95
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,350
and we are beating the Germans

96
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,938
and coming towards
the final climax of the war?

97
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:08,236
l'll tell you why it is. lt's because
we've got far the best equipment

98
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:13,325
and we've got far the best men.
And women too. Far the best.

99
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:24,252
lf the battle front and the home front
really get down to it this year,

100
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,005
we can get the thing almost finished,

101
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:32,302
we can get it so tight,
that next year we just topple it over.

102
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,554
Goodbye to you all.
Thank you very much.

103
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,558
(narrator) Monty's optimism was
infectious, but Britain, like America,

104
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:43,021
was already working at full pressure
with or without music.

105
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,024
(♪ "Calling All Workers" by Eric Coates)

106
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,249
The massive eftort was straining
towards the final Overlord targets.

107
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,584
Aircraft - 13,000.

108
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,128
Tanks and vehicles - 17,000.

109
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,925
Parachutes - 90,000.
Bombs and shells in millions.

110
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,300
And Overlord would also need
4,000 assault and landing craft.

111
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,719
But, at first,
they simply weren't there.

112
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,055
(Mountbatten) The absolutely
crucial thing for an invasion

113
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,182
is to get the troops across the water.

114
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,560
For that you want
landing ships and craft.

115
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,104
They had to be built
in large quantities,

116
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,773
at a time when
all ship-building facilities

117
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,651
were required
to fight the Battle of the Atlantic.

118
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,115
(narrator) By the spring of 1944,
the landing craft were built

119
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,286
and ready for intensive,
constantly rehearsed, invasion training

120
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,080
in tough battle conditions.

121
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,854
Many Overlord troops
would invade from the air.

122
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,023
More than 20,000 were earmarked

123
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,276
for the biggest airborne operation
of the war so far.

124
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,116
Some assault troops
would have to scale clifts.

125
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:06,247
Training in rough Channel waters
could be as deadly as the real thing.

126
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,843
Across those waters,
Von Rundstedt and Rommel

127
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,555
had divided views
on how to meet the invasion.

128
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,351
Von Rundstedt, the commander-in-chief,

129
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,188
wanted a mobile reserVe
kept back to fight inland.

130
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,274
Rommel, commander
of the anti-invasion forces,

131
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,777
wanted to repel the assault
on the beaches.

132
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,826
But Hitler's Atlantic Wall, a chain
of steel-and-concrete fortifications

133
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,913
planned to stretch from Denmark
to the Spanish border, was incomplete.

134
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,505
Rommel made belated eftorts
to fill the gaps

135
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,508
by laying lines of formidable
underwater obstacles,

136
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,927
including millions of hidden mines.

137
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:18,111
To overcome these defences, the Allies
evolved various ingenious contraptions.

138
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:22,031
To help tanks over sand
and mud and concrete,

139
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,201
the Swiss Roll and the Carpet Layer.

140
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:44,512
The Panjandrum, supposed to destroy
beach obstacles, was not successful.

141
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,120
Pluto - PipeLines Under The Ocean -

142
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,998
a flexible pipeline miles long.

143
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:19,756
Pluto would minimise the hazards of
transporting petrol to France by tanker.

144
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,763
lt could carry over a million tons of
fuel daily to the continent, underwater.

145
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:31,434
Shore pumping stations
were innocently camouflaged.

146
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,149
Still more remarkable was Mulberry,

147
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:43,238
two artificial harbours
each the size of Dover harbour.

148
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,826
All the components
had to be towed across the Channel.

149
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,329
(Mountbatten) The problem
of staying ashore was a difticult one,

150
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,873
because of weather conditions
in the Channel.

151
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,043
You couldn't expect
more than three or four consecutive days

152
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,796
of weather fine enough
to supply across the beaches.

153
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,549
So, obviously, we thought
we'd have to take a port.

154
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,133
That's why we tried Dieppe.

155
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,970
But we found in Dieppe
that we couldn't capture a port

156
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,305
without using such heavy bombardment

157
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,058
as would destroy the facilities
we wanted to use.

158
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:16,271
So the obvious thing was to bring
our own artificial harbour with us,

159
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:21,317
which we called Mulberry, and which
everybody thought was absolutely crazy.

160
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,530
(narrator) Eisenhower met constantly
with his commanders

161
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,156
to coordinate strategy.

162
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,327
His deputy, Air Chief Marshal Tedder,
Admiral Ramsay,

163
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,788
Generals Bradley and Montgomery,

164
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,291
and Air Marshal Leigh-Mallory.

165
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,711
A major preoccupation was the weather
that could be expected

166
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,838
for the start of Overlord.

167
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,924
(man) General Eisenhower
made it clear quite early

168
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,802
that he wanted to build up confidence,

169
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:52,140
not only in what we could do
as forecasters,

170
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,436
and l in particular for him personally,

171
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,772
but he wanted to know what reliance

172
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:04,319
he could put on the very words l used

173
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,696
and the tone of voice l used.

174
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,992
He could tell,
even before l presented the forecast,

175
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:15,288
almost each time
what l was going to say.

176
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,042
He used my face, l think,
as a kind of hall barometer.

177
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,838
(narrator) Deception plans
also occupied Supreme Command.

178
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,009
Among the most elaborate were fake
preparations for an attack on Norway,

179
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,178
to be launched from Scotland.

180
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,098
And, more credibly, for a main assault
on the Pas-de-Calais

181
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,100
from the southeast ports.

182
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,353
Also crucial was the bombing plan

183
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:43,191
to cut German communications
to invasion areas - interdiction.

184
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,654
What one had to do was to
interfere with the communications.

185
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,615
Again, l think this was
a lesson learned from Dieppe.

186
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,661
That we hadn't realised at Dieppe

187
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,746
how absolutely essential it was

188
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,334
to have an absolutely overwhelming
weight of firepower

189
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,296
both from the air and from the land.
The result of this was,

190
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,384
and l think this caused a good deal
of difticulties at high level,

191
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,971
was that Air Marshal Harris,

192
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,224
who still thought
that he could win the war on his own,

193
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,894
had to be persuaded
to use his heavy bombers

194
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:25,066
to attack the German
road and rail communications.

195
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,152
And l think he resisted very strongly.

196
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,031
He thought it was really a diversion
from the whole point of the war.

197
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:37,537
But he was made to do it,
and it was done enormously eftectively.

198
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,965
(narrator) Spring 1944
saw widespread air attacks

199
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,343
on road and rail targets
and on airfields.

200
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,563
At the same time, all over the South
of England, camps were springing up,

201
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:08,609
ready for the tens of thousands
of invasion troops.

202
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,072
The staging areas for Overlord

203
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,159
were spread the length
of England's south coast,

204
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:23,124
round the ports of Falmouth, Dartmouth,
Weymouth, Portsmouth and Newhaven.

205
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,639
All was now prepared
for the great move south.

206
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,601
The lines were cleared
for invasion traftic.

207
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,384
Amid the rash of military notices,
one telltale sign stood out.

208
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,391
The vast concentration
reached its Channel rendezvous.

209
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,185
Some wit claimed
that only the barrage balloons

210
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,272
floating overhead
kept Britain from sinking.

211
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,240
Late May, 1944.

212
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:23,327
The assault troops were sealed within
their marshalling areas, ready to go.

213
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,580
Now - a pause.

214
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,208
(man #1) Fear feeds on delay, of course.

215
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,712
And we didn't really know
just when we were going.

216
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,259
(man #2) Shot crap, played cards,
lost all our money.

217
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,636
Some people won money.
l lost all mine.

218
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,557
Didn't do me any good. l had no place
to spend it when l got on the beach.

219
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,313
(narrator) Rations, currency,
ammunition, kit.

220
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:54,483
Packing and repacking,
checking equipment.

221
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,486
The exact invasion date
was not yet revealed.

222
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,115
Most men still did not know
the beaches they were going to attack.

223
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,870
Only ofticers and NCOs
had been told the precise landing areas.

224
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,915
100 miles across the Channel
in Normandy,

225
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,335
these landing areas
comprised five beaches.

226
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,923
From west to east, Utah and Omaha
waited for the Americans.

227
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:21,844
Gold, Juno and Sword
for the British and Canadians.

228
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,639
But all now depended on the weather.

229
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,227
(Stagg) On the evening
of that Wednesday, 31 May,

230
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,313
even then l advised General Eisenhower

231
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,857
that conditions
for the oncoming weekend,

232
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,860
especially over Sunday night
and Monday morning,

233
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,862
the crucial times for Overlord,

234
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:46,160
were going to be stormy,
but we went on with the meetings.

235
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,997
l had to go before General Eisenhower
and his commanders,

236
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,877
who met for nothing else twice a day
during those fateful days -

237
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,963
1 , 2 and 3 June.

238
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,636
(narrator) On 3 June, despite Supreme
Command's concern about the weather,

239
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,846
embarkation went ahead.

240
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,391
The troops knew nothing
of a possible hitch,

241
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,770
though some men thought
it was just another exercise.

242
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,484
(man #3) When we first went aboard,
we had no knowledge of the actual day.

243
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,778
We had been aboard ship so many times.

244
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,782
For six months,
we were constantly on and oft ships.

245
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,291
(narrator) ln the ports and harbours
of England's Channel coast,

246
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,670
the vast and complex process
of loading and embarkation went on.

247
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,880
ln the Channel, the worsening weather

248
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:44,385
now faced the supreme commander
with a grave crisis.

249
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,179
(Stagg) lt was a time
of dreadful tension.

250
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:51,809
We all knew that there could be
only one day's deferment.

251
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,061
lf there had to be another day,

252
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,982
then all the landing craft
would need to return to base,

253
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,068
so it couldn't be done
on a second day's postponement.

254
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,863
lt would have to be deferred
for a whole fortnight

255
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,907
until the next tides were right.

256
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,203
And at that time, our charts
were so black in the Atlantic

257
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,581
that there didn't seem
to be any prospect

258
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,876
of getting this operation going at all.

259
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,379
(man #4) We didn't know how long
it was going to be postponed.

260
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,383
Because the weather looked so bad,
we wondered if it would ever clear up,

261
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,927
and whether the whole thing
would be called oft

262
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,555
and we would be taken back oft the ship.

263
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,021
(narrator) Troops primed for action.

264
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,190
An armada ready to sail.

265
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,860
And, then, anticlimax.

266
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,697
(man #1) We were then told

267
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,785
that the invasion had been put back
for at least 24 hours.

268
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,246
Of course,
this increased our apprehension.

269
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,917
And we used to have
these long conversations with each other

270
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,711
about the kind of things
that might happen,

271
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,298
whether we'd ever
get oft the beach alive.

272
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,638
(narrator) Routine continued
under a cloud of uncertainty.

273
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,516
All the troops could do was wait.

274
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,525
(♪ "Don't Get Around Much Anymore")

275
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,041
As the hours passed, it seemed that only
a miracle could get Overlord going.

276
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,964
(Stagg) Then, mercifully,
the almost unbelievable happened

277
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,675
about midday on that Sunday.

278
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,889
We spotted that there might be
an interlude between two depressions.

279
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,641
By the evening, my own confidence

280
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:43,898
in the forecast for this quieter period

281
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,735
had so increased from
further reports that had come in,

282
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,780
that l convinced General Eisenhower
and his commanders

283
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,951
that it would indeed arrive
later on Monday,

284
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,580
after the storm of Sunday night
and Monday morning.

285
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,500
lt would indeed arrive late on Monday,

286
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:07,087
continue through Tuesday
and probably into Wednesday.

287
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,342
The next morning, early on 5 June,

288
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,054
they met again to confirm this decision.

289
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,724
When l could tell them
that we were even more confident

290
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,935
than we had been the previous night

291
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:26,732
that the fine, or improved, quieter
interlude would indeed come along,

292
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,567
the joy on the faces

293
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,071
of the supreme commander
and his commanders

294
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,366
after the deep gloom
of the preceding days,

295
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,828
was a marVel to behold.

296
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:46,377
l remember it very well.
4:15am on the morning of 5 June.

297
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,381
l wasn't at the meeting,
but l drove him there,

298
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:55,511
and he came out and he really looked
so serious as he got in the car.

299
00:25:55,595 --> 00:26:00,140
And he said, "D-day is on.
Nothing can stop us now."

300
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,814
(narrator) lt was an historic decision.

301
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,734
Overlord's further postponement
might have meant total cancellation.

302
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,241
(man #2) The troop commander
read a message from General Eisenhower.

303
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,744
"God speed" and all that sort of stuft.

304
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,414
(man #1) We read this
great message from Monty

305
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,251
about "good hunting in the fields
of Europe" and all this rubbish.

306
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:32,715
Naturally, being a soldier, we thought
what a load of old cods it was.

307
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,218
(narrator) Never had Channel waters
seen such a mighty force.

308
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:40,180
Heading for France
were some 6,500 vessels of all types,

309
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,101
marshalled and escorted
by the Allied navies.

310
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:48,981
Glider fleets were waiting,
wearing their D-day markings.

311
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,192
The first division would go in
by glider and parachute,

312
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,321
dropping behind the invasion beaches.

313
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:59,199
Their losses were expected to be
as high as seven out of every ten men,

314
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,785
as Eisenhower well knew.

315
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,497
(Summersby)
They all had blackened faces.

316
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,751
They were going to jump Nazi-occupied
Europe in a short time.

317
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,046
You kept thinking, "l wonder
how many are going to come back."

318
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,922
Later, General Eisenhower said,

319
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,885
"You know, Kay, it is very hard
to look a soldier in the face,

320
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,597
knowing you might be
sending him to his death."

321
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:33,317
(narrator) ln the last hours of 5 June,
the airborne troops set out for France.

322
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:37,279
(man #5) Butterflies in your stomach.
You wonder what you're doing here.

323
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,032
"Why am l here? Why did l volunteer?
Am l crazy?"

324
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,242
Everything is going through your mind.

325
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,829
You're worried.
You know it's coming up soon.

326
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:54,380
l was afraid.
l was 19, and l was afraid.

327
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,466
(narrator) Many men
were afraid that night.

328
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:04,306
They were storming Hitler's vaunted
Festung Europa - Fortress Europe.

329
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,393
Across the water the Germans waited,

330
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,480
not knowing when or where
the blow would fall.

331
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,528
D-day.

332
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,947
Ahead, the Normandy beaches.

333
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,535
After four years,
this was the road back.

334
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:31,208
(man #1) lt was a fantastic sight to see
so many ships of all shapes and sizes,

335
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,544
and all going one way.

336
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,759
(man #4) Quite a few boys wrote letters
and gave it to friends

337
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,805
so that they'd take them home
or see that their parents got them.

338
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,224
lt was their farewell letter.

339
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,352
(man #6) The sea was rough.

340
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,147
They'd put their gas capes
over them to keep dry,

341
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,693
and it made them sick
cos they didn't get enough fresh air.

342
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,574
(man #3) l had several men get seasick,
and they upchucked,

343
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,201
and they had to use their helmets
to catch it in.

344
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,828
We'd throw them over the side.

345
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,456
They were washed out
and given back to the men.

346
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,792
(man #1) One felt absolutely dreadful,
physically,

347
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,337
just wishing to God
that the whole thing would be over,

348
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,923
or at least
that we could get onto dry land.

349
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,314
(narrator) At 5:30 the armada
was oft the French coast.

350
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,736
After a massive air assault,
a devastating naval bombardment.

351
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,166
(man #7) As far as your eye could see,

352
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,169
you were surrounded
with craft of some sort,

353
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,089
and it was just sending out
shell after shell out of its turrets.

354
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,721
(narrator) The Germans
were surprised and stupefied,

355
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,265
but some batteries soon recovered.

356
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,567
(man #3) lt was far just more
than sickness.

357
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,986
Men loaded their pants
and everything else.

358
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,489
l had rarely seen that before.

359
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,450
l know the men were sick,
many of them were very sick.

360
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,796
(man #3) By this time the waves

361
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:45,759
were pitching the craft up and down,
l would say, six or seven feet.

362
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,471
(man #4) A lot of boys
got caught in the nets.

363
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:54,852
We had quite a time getting them loose.
Their legs got caught in there.

364
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,356
(man #2) Smoke, smoke. There were
a lot of shells coming over us.

365
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,402
All smoke, black smoke,
just like a volcano from afar

366
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,696
that one would see in the movies.

367
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,012
(narrator) The run-in to the beaches -

368
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:34,641
6:30 for the Americans,
7:30 for the British and Canadians.

369
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:39,313
After all the waiting,
the training, the toughening,

370
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,481
this was it.

371
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,945
(man #9) We were the first attackers,
we were the initial wave.

372
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,781
There's always great losses
in an initial wave,

373
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:55,078
so each of us had to be given at least
30 minutes to live on the beach.

374
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,680
(narrator) Protected by total
air supremacy, the first assault waves

375
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:18,018
raced and scrambled
for the five invasion beaches.

376
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,772
(man #1) The soldiers were so glad
to get oft the landing craft,

377
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,857
to escape the seasickness,

378
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,111
that they were just ready
to go anywhere by that time.

379
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,161
(narrator) For the men
of the five assault divisions,

380
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:42,042
those first hours of D-day
were hours of death, fear, courage,

381
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,046
of plans gone wrong,
of rapid improvisation.

382
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,842
(man #10) We expected a clear beach

383
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,845
with an indication
as to exactly how we should proceed.

384
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,807
We were even told
the military police would greet us.

385
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:01,311
lt became quite obvious that the beach
was in a considerable state of chaos.

386
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,565
On the run-in, craft ran into
underwater obstacles and into mines.

387
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,111
One of them went over a mine.
The front half of the craft,

388
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,155
with the personnel in it,
went straight up in the air.

389
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,368
The sea was quite a difterent colour
when that craft blew up.

390
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,042
(narrator) Some units
landed in the wrong area.

391
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,920
Some met unexpectedly light resistance,

392
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,132
others were cut down
almost on the shoreline.

393
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,718
The Americans got the worst of it.

394
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,680
(man #6) l didn't think l'd make it.

395
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,976
l didn't think there was any way
to get across that beach and surVive.

396
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,104
l really thought it was my last day.

397
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,865
(man #4) The first man, the sergeant,

398
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,577
raised up to see how far
we had to go to reach land,

399
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,163
and fell back dead.

400
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,043
(man #3) We had been told
that the air force would come in

401
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,544
with the heavy bombers

402
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,757
and would crater the beaches for us
to give us a place to hide.

403
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,384
And this did not take place.

404
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,475
(man #3) lt was bloody awful.
Every time l got up,

405
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,103
l thought that it was pure terror
that was making my knees buckle,

406
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,981
until l finally hit the shale
and l realised

407
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,109
that l had about 100lbs of sand
in those pockets.

408
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,120
l remember taking my trench knife
and pressing it in people's backs

409
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,538
to see if they were alive.

410
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,957
lf they were, l'd kick 'em
or say, "Let's go."

411
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,210
lt dawned on me
after l checked two or three

412
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:52,506
that some were alive but they wouldn't
turn around. Just absolute terror.

413
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,311
(narrator) On the three British
and Canadian beaches, opposition varied.

414
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:11,108
On Gold, while one unit was hammering
at a strongpoint for eight hours,

415
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,194
another was oft the beach in 40 minutes.

416
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:20,033
On Juno, the Canadians suftered
heavy losses but advanced.

417
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,079
On Sword, the fighting
was bloody but brief.

418
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:28,625
Many defenders emerged
from their bunkers to surrender.

419
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:33,421
And on Utah, by the end of the day,
the Americans were doing well.

420
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,883
They had taken prisoners,
established a firm foothold,

421
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,761
driven five miles inland.

422
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,017
But on Omaha,
the Americans ran into difticulties -

423
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,187
rough seas, strong defences

424
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,107
and a newly arrived
German fighting division.

425
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,280
(man #11) From where l was,
it seemed a failure.

426
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,868
(man #3) At that time there were
so many people on the beach

427
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,288
you could literally walk on the bodies
from one end to the other,

428
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,582
either the dead or the wounded.

429
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,585
(man #6) l saw people laying out there
with no head,

430
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,962
and some with arms blown oft.

431
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,632
Some of my friends.
lt was pretty sickening.

432
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,639
(narrator) At Omaha it took all day,
with grievous losses,

433
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,434
to gain a beachhead a mile deep.

434
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,731
(man #11) lt was the most
heartrending experience that l ever had.

435
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,276
l hope l never have another one like it.

436
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,365
Look back and see the remains of
a crack battalion strewn over the beach.

437
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,870
And men floating in the water, face-up.

438
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,706
(man #3) Perhaps it was better
that we were green,

439
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,584
because if l'd have known then
what l know now,

440
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,503
l'd have got on that boat
and went back to England.

441
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:06,223
(man #4) A day of continuous thinking
thoughts of home.

442
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,143
A day of prayer.

443
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,397
And, without a doubt,
the longest day of my life.

444
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:24,241
You feel that you're...
Well, you've accomplished something

445
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:29,454
that you didn't think you would probably
end up being around after it was done.

446
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:34,251
l think we were proud in some way
that we'd done it

447
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,380
and that the army
we'd been in for so long,

448
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:44,177
and with all sorts of experiences
of how they could bungle things,

449
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,139
had actually managed this invasion.

450
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:52,686
Oh, we feel very happy. Very happy.

451
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,816
Ah, the best day of my life. l think so.

452
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,735
La plus grande joie.
How you say in English?

453
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,155
The biggest joys in our life.

454
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,994
And we admire those courageous soldiers.

455
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,789
They came from so far away
to liberate us.

456
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:17,377
And we gave to them
everything we could give them.

457
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,879
Cider and so.

458
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,465
Calvados, also.

459
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,721
And our... our friendship.

460
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,473
And...

461
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:35,061
lt was very... emotional.

462
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,604
And...

463
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,025
We, we feel... we became free.

464
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:45,071
(narrator) By midnight,
130,000 troops had got ashore.

465
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,033
Footholds had been gained
on all five beaches.

466
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,535
Casualties: 9,000.

467
00:38:55,791 --> 00:39:00,045
D-plus-one saw the first laying
of the Mulberry harbours.

468
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:04,466
The early build-up of supplies
was vital for the success of Overlord.

469
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,134
lt was essential to pour in

470
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:10,096
the reinforcements of men and material
faster than the enemy.

471
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,973
And pour in they did.

472
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,279
By D-plus-seven,
miles of vehicles were ashore,

473
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,449
stretching inland from the beaches
bumper to bumper.

474
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:34,412
At some points,
traftic jams extended 15 miles.

475
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,084
At this critical phase,
Mulberry's two harbours -

476
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,921
Arromanches for the British,
Saint-Laurent for the Americans -

477
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,883
were the only ports
available to the Allies.

478
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,428
ln the four days before 18 June,

479
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:54,516
the average daily landings were
troops: nearly 35,000,

480
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,479
vehicles: 5,000, stores: 25,000 tons.

481
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:09,197
lf a single device invented for Overlord
produced results, it was Mulberry.

482
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,080
Only the insistence of Eisenhower
and the king himself

483
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,166
had stopped Churchill
from coming over on D-day.

484
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:24,754
Now, within days of the landing, he was
there to see how things were going.

485
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,464
The top commanders were aware

486
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,050
that the Overlord timetable
was falling behind.

487
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,679
They were anxious now
about phase two of the operation -

488
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,806
the battle of the bridgehead.

489
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,702
The Allies were fighting bitterly

490
00:40:55,828 --> 00:41:00,582
for space to deploy the mass of men
and materials assembling behind them.

491
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,500
lt was a slow, dogged advance

492
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,337
against an enemy
who had recovered strongly.

493
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:18,349
The close-hedged bocage countryside
was difticult for the Allied tanks.

494
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:24,063
By 10 June, the Allies were opposed
by only three panzer divisions.

495
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,232
The other seven available divisions

496
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,194
had not been released
by the German high command.

497
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,781
Despite this, the invaders
were little more than inching forward.

498
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,754
By 12 June, the five beachheads
had been linked

499
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:53,718
to give a lodgement 60 miles long
and up to 20 miles deep.

500
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,262
The ancient town of Bayeux

501
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,891
now welcomed the leader
of the Free French, General de Gaulle,

502
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:04,938
setting foot in France
for the first time since 1940.

503
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:13,488
19 June, and the unpredictable
English Channel struck again.

504
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,412
For four days a raging storm,
the worst in June for over 40 years,

505
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,582
battered Mulberry almost to destruction.

506
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,628
Vessels dragged anchor.
Vital equipment foundered.

507
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:34,926
Unloading was drastically curtailed.
Tonnage was down by four fifths.

508
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,222
Frantic eftorts were made
to repair the damage,

509
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:43,393
for the disruption had threatened
the very continuance of Overlord.

510
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,271
Soon the traftic was rolling again.

511
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,025
The Overlord lifeline was restored.

512
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,116
A prime objective
to supplement the Mulberry harbours

513
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,327
was the port of Cherbourg
in the American sector.

514
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,747
By 19 June the Americans
had cut oft the Cherbourg peninsula

515
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,250
and were driving north towards the port.

516
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,795
Cherbourg was strongly fortified.

517
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:15,425
The Germans hoped to delay the Allies
by staging a long resistance there.

518
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,677
But by the 21st, after tough fighting,

519
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,847
the Americans
reached the port's outskirts.

520
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,154
On the 26th, the garrison surrendered,

521
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,407
leaving only a few strongpoints
to be mopped up.

522
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:44,662
Prisoners streamed out,
among them the garrison commander.

523
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:57,342
Cherbourg was the first major objective
to be captured in the campaign.

524
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:01,846
25,000 prisoners
were taken in the Cherbourg area.

525
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:14,275
Some French women
were losing their German lovers.

526
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,910
Right across the front from Cherbourg
was the town of Caen.

527
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,914
Caen was the centre for German troops
moving to the beachhead.

528
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:32,168
Montgomery had been
attacking towards it since D-day.

529
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:40,093
Now at last, in early July,
he prepared for the assault.

530
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,554
First the bombers went in.

531
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:48,476
On 18 July over 2,000
heavy and medium bombers hit Caen

532
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,315
with nearly 8,000 tons of high explosive
and fragmentation bombs.

533
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,697
lt was the heaviest
and most concentrated air attack

534
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,700
in support of ground forces
ever attempted.

535
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,486
Caen was christened "the crucible".

536
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:46,284
When it fell, the troops entered
a bomb-cratered town choked with rubble.

537
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,913
Half of it was destroyed,

538
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,960
several thousand of its inhabitants
killed or wounded.

539
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:13,060
For the people of Caen,
it was liberation - at a grievous price.

540
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,992
Now, after seven grinding weeks,
the start of the break-out.

541
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,953
The Americans broke through
at AVranches.

542
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:35,124
They fanned out west and south
into Brittany and east to Mortain,

543
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,127
and swept up to Argentan.

544
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,131
From the north,
the British and Canadians

545
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:46,052
edged south towards Falaise,
in an attempt to close the neck of a bag

546
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,764
now threatening to trap
the German forces.

547
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,478
There were very great
practical difticulties

548
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:59,023
in this closing
of the Falaise Gap quickly.

549
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,234
And it was difticult for the one side,

550
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,985
British, Canadian, Polish,

551
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,530
to appreciate the point of view

552
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,782
of the other side, the Americans.

553
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:11,327
We were coming down from the north,

554
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:17,959
launched from the congested, bombed
and difticult areas of the Caen sector.

555
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:24,215
Secondly, the Germans facing us
on that north side of the corridor

556
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,093
they were trying to keep open
for their escape,

557
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:32,181
were in areas where
they had been fighting against us

558
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,392
for two months or more.

559
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:38,521
The Americans were coming up
to meet us from the south

560
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,690
in more open country

561
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:45,111
and against much less prepared
and organised German resistance.

562
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,118
(narrator) Falaise, one of the bloodiest
battlegrounds of the campaign.

563
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,412
This was Montgomery's next target.

564
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,635
Hundreds of rocket-firing Typhoons

565
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,555
strafed enemy communications
and transport,

566
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,516
leaving a trail of burning vehicles.

567
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,276
On 6 August, the Canadians
were on the outskirts of Falaise.

568
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,418
They entered the town on the 16th.

569
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:56,724
By now only a narrow corridor separated
the Canadian and American spearheads.

570
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,606
The remnants of the German 7th army,
some 15 fighting divisions,

571
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,400
were pressed into a tiny sack.

572
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,655
At last the trap closed.

573
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,450
10,000 died. 50,000 were captured.

574
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:21,874
For the Germans, Falaise was one of
the worst disasters since Stalingrad.

575
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:31,968
The toll of prisoners rubbed in
the magnitude of the defeat.

576
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,179
But 40,000 German troops escaped,

577
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,307
and this caused friction
between the Allies.

578
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,604
(American man) Had the British
and Canadian forces

579
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,481
been able to move faster,

580
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,859
we might have trapped many more
Germans in the Falaise pocket.

581
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,195
Very little of their equipment got out,

582
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,489
but quite a number of the Germans

583
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,701
were able to escape
toward the Seine river.

584
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,246
And this was too bad.

585
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,249
l think perhaps the basic reason

586
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:08,754
was that Britain had been in the war
for much longer than we

587
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,257
and had taken very heavy casualties.

588
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,218
And the Americans were fresh,

589
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:17,555
and they had had
practically no casualties in comparison.

590
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,433
So while we were anxious
to drive forward

591
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,310
and were not too concerned
about the casualties

592
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,646
as long as we could get our objectives,

593
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:29,316
it was natural, l think,
that the British and Canadian forces

594
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,570
did it in a more orderly, pacing way.

595
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,823
And perhaps this was part
of Monty's characteristic,

596
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,742
and one of his drawbacks.

597
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,662
ln other words,
that he never did quite drive

598
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,665
the way the American commanders did.

599
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,502
This was part of his nature, l guess.
He was a more cautious man,

600
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,922
combined with the fact
that he couldn't aftord the casualties

601
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,717
that we could take
if it was necessary to take them.

602
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:06,520
(narrator) Falaise earned
the name of "the killing ground".

603
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,525
The carnage and destruction
were appalling.

604
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,701
Eisenhower visited the battlefield
and wrote:

605
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:25,206
"lt was literally possible to walk
for hundreds of yards at a time,

606
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,919
stepping on nothing
but dead and decaying flesh."

607
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,491
Paris.

608
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:04,620
The main Allied drive
was going to bypass the French capital.

609
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,998
The Parisians,
under Nazi domination for four years,

610
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,708
sensed liberation at last.

611
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,752
As the Germans began to pull out,

612
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:16,298
the Resistance forces emerged
into the open to take revenge.

613
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:27,059
Remembering the oppression,
indignities, humiliations,

614
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,521
Parisians gave vent
to long-stored hatred.

615
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,947
ln 1940 they had seen Paris fall
without a shot.

616
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,282
Now they made up for it

617
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:45,828
in a burst of violence
not seen in Paris throughout the war.

618
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,998
Parisians had one thought -

619
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:54,003
reprisal against the enemy,
the settlement of old scores.

620
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,851
Morning had come.
