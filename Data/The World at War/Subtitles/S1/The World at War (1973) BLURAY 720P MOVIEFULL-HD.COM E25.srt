1
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,433
(narrator) The bombing has stopped.
The fires are out.

2
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,102
Europe lies in ruin.

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,813
The dead are gone forever.

4
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,982
The living carry on.

5
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,202
Everywhere the same:

6
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,540
no gas, no water,
no telephones, no trams.

7
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,885
Time to count the cost.

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,554
Time to start again.

9
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,039
Springtime 1945.

10
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,042
The end of the war in Central Europe.

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,254
The end of the thousand-year Reich.

12
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,521
Untidy. Messy.

13
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,232
A time without pity.

14
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,822
A time of brutality,

15
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,699
rape.

16
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,492
revenge.

17
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,138
The Germans come back from the eastern
lands they'd tried to conquer,

18
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,558
where some had lived for generations.

19
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,144
They'd been bad masters.

20
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,147
Now they pay the price.

21
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,150
At least they are alive.

22
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,762
The last hours of the Wehrmacht,
an army in dissolution.

23
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,056
lt has made war on the world.

24
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,017
Now it saves what it can.

25
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:51,396
(man #1) The mood of the German troops
who were surrendering was one of relief.

26
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,651
They were happy, for the most part,
to surrender.

27
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,946
They were interested in
getting to the American lines,

28
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,034
in preference to surrendering
to the advancing Russian line.

29
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:33,522
(narrator) A defeated army - but even
at the end, not always a broken one.

30
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,072
The habits of a lifetime die hard.

31
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,036
But at last, the blood-letting
is nearly over.

32
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,220
(man #2) You had a European civil war
that began in 1914.

33
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,931
There was a long armistice in that war.

34
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,185
lt finally comes to an end in 1945.
ln the process of coming to the end,

35
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,648
what happens is that
sweeping into Europe from the outside

36
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,817
are the Russians and the Americans.

37
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:24,406
And they meet at Torgau
on the Elbe River in May of 1945 -

38
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,120
with the result that no European nation
wins the European civil war.

39
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,290
The winners in the European Civil War
are outsiders:

40
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,793
the Russians and the Americans -
most of all the Americans.

41
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:42,174
So that you have
the physical control of the Continent

42
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,887
in the hands of three outsiders -
because the British were a part of it,

43
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,805
although they only contributed 25%

44
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,892
of the whole total
to Eisenhower's Anglo-American force.

45
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,395
Britain, the United States and Russia
now control the Continent,

46
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,522
and they will decide what happens to it.

47
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,987
(narrator) Neither Russians
nor Americans had wanted this war.

48
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:09,076
Now comrades in arms,
they have won a great victory.

49
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,702
When their generals meet,

50
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,581
they can speak the language
of combat, of tanks and guns.

51
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,335
But have they anything in common
except soldiers' talk?

52
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,311
(man #1) The Russians were overjoyed -
but we also -

53
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,148
and there was handshaking
and back-slapping

54
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,859
and the exchange of souvenirs.

55
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,196
l have a Russian watch

56
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,949
and somebody's gold wedding band.

57
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,327
And l lost my watch.

58
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,540
l lost all sorts of insignia
from the uniform.

59
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,335
All the Russians were very friendly.
A lot of them didn't speak English.

60
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,505
Yet there were a few
that spoke beautiful English -

61
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,674
educated at Oxford and Cambridge.

62
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,300
l remember speaking to one,

63
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,887
and l thought, "l'll never forget
your face as long as l live."

64
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,265
"l'll never forget you."

65
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,061
He was rather young. He was quite
young. And he was very pleasant.

66
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,565
But you always kept feeling
that they really hated us,

67
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,024
which l'm sure they did.

68
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,125
(Ambrose)
The United States during the war

69
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,962
had been propagandised
into seeing Russia as a democracy,

70
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,505
a land of freedom lovers,

71
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,718
with essentially broad social aims
about the same as those of the West -

72
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,428
which seemed to make sense,

73
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,764
since they were clearly an enemy
of the Nazis, as we were.

74
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,434
Thus, it appeared
we had a great deal in common.

75
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:04,900
Fellow delegates, the President
of the United States of America.

76
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,652
(applause)

77
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,824
(narrator) San Francisco, April 1945,

78
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,076
a month before V-E Day:

79
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,121
the United Nations Organization is born.

80
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,792
The Charter of the United Nations,
which you are now signing,

81
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,464
is a solid structure upon which
we can build for a better world.

82
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,092
There was great hope in the world
that this would happen -

83
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,136
that this was the last war.

84
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,389
That the victors would now be able
to cooperate in peace,

85
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,310
as they had in war,
to see to it that "the four policemen",

86
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,146
Britain, France, the USSR
and the United States,

87
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,483
sometimes "the five policemen"
with China thrown in,

88
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,527
would be able to see to it

89
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,114
that there would be
no more aggression in the world.

90
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,243
That the war had meant something,

91
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,497
that it had been fought for something,
rather than simply against Nazism.

92
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,917
There is a time for making plans,

93
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,378
and there is a time for action.

94
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,839
The time for action is here, now!

95
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,679
(newsreel) Nation by nation,
the delegates stand up

96
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,014
for the great new charter
they hammered out.

97
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,893
50 nations standing side by side,
unanimous for peace.

98
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,729
Now final signing of the charter.

99
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,900
China signing first, as the first nation
attacked in this war -

100
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,113
Dr Wellington Koo's signature
topping the long list to come.

101
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,452
For Russia, Ambassador Gromyko
commits his country also

102
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,746
to the agreements and objectives decided

103
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,375
after days and nights
of compromise and cooperation -

104
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,004
four main agencies upon which
the world now puts its hope.

105
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,841
(Ambrose) A better world
was going to emerge -

106
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,637
a non-colonial world,
a world of self-determination.

107
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,849
And this was felt very deeply in 1945,

108
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,352
even by the most cynical
of the world's leaders.

109
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,479
l suspect even Stalin felt it.

110
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,024
l'm sure that Harry Truman felt it.

111
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,861
And Winston Churchill felt it.
The common people everywhere felt it.

112
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,453
(narrator) Germany remains,
even in defeat,

113
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,955
the key to the problems of Europe.

114
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,917
She started the war,
so her leaders have to be punished.

115
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,545
The Germans themselves
have to be made to pay

116
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,797
for the suftering they have caused.

117
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,384
But they cannot pay
if Germany remains a heap of rubble,

118
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,971
or if the country is dismembered,
as some wish.

119
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,891
No one wants Germany to be strong again,

120
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,354
yet no one can face the consequences
of keeping her a ruin forever.

121
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,026
The answer: military control.

122
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,280
Four armies of occupation
will superVise Germany's recovery.

123
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,325
The watchful Allied generals
will build her up,

124
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,454
but only in order to make good again
what she has destroyed.

125
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,917
Germany can remain whole, united,

126
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,672
but must never be able
to threaten the peace again.

127
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,095
July 1945.

128
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,683
The military administration
gets under way.

129
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,310
American troops have occupied Leipzig,

130
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,313
a city well within
the Russian zone of occupation.

131
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:35,110
Now the Americans pull back -
west, across the River Elbe.

132
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,879
The Russians move in.

133
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,452
The Germans -
wary, watchful, nerVously smiling -

134
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,913
see their Russian conquerors
for the first time.

135
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,633
When the fighting stopped,
the armies ended up here.

136
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,511
But the occupation zones
had been decided earlier,

137
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,930
at the Big Three conference at Yalta.

138
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,974
There were to be four zones.

139
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,894
The Russian zone
had the food and raw materials.

140
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:55,732
The Western zones - American,
British, French - had the industry.

141
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,193
For the occupation to work as intended,

142
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,779
there would have to be trade
between them.

143
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,783
Berlin, the capital, became the home
of the Allied Control Council -

144
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,119
a testing ground
for the plan to work together.

145
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,208
There's been some question as to
whether we weren't a little premature

146
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,837
in fixing these zones until we saw
how the armies were going to come out.

147
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,675
And there's some evidence to indicate
that our leaders underestimated

148
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,721
the striking force of the Anglo-American
armies that invaded Europe,

149
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:31,100
because when we adopted
the zonal positions

150
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,562
we gave up Saxony and Thuringia.

151
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,317
But on the other hand, we got back
good pieces of Western Austria,

152
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,861
which had been occupied by the Soviets.

153
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,571
The thing that stands out here

154
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,033
is that the Russians
do let the West come into Berlin

155
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,202
which is 80 miles within their zone.

156
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,329
They didn't have to do it.

157
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,541
They could have acted in Berlin
as they acted in Poland.

158
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,378
They could have just said, "To hell
with you. We're not letting you in."

159
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,923
"We're not going to live up to
the agreements we signed at Yalta."

160
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,842
"We're going to hold on to Berlin -

161
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,762
after all, we captured it, we paid
the cost. 100,000 Russians died."

162
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,766
(narrator) Berlin, July 1945.

163
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,644
The Big Three meet
for the Potsdam Conference.

164
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,857
A crowded agenda
for this first meeting of victors.

165
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,322
But for the West,
one question dominates:

166
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,033
what does Stalin want?

167
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,288
(man) At our first meetings,
Stalin put forward at once

168
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,583
the demands
which the Russians maintained

169
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,961
right through until the meeting
at Potsdam.

170
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:47,594
What he wanted was basically to ensure
the security of his own country,

171
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,555
regardless of the interests
of his neighbours.

172
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,266
l'd seen a good deal of him
during the war.

173
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,437
l went up to him and said, "This must be
a great satisfaction to you,

174
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,566
after all the trials
that you've been through

175
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,153
and the tragedy that you've
been through, to be here in Berlin."

176
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:09,699
He looked at me and said,
"Tsar Alexander got to Paris."

177
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,289
(narrator) The conference
takes no new decisions.

178
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,876
lt simply confirms what was decided
at Yalta six months before.

179
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,296
What is new is the mood.

180
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,883
Despite smiles for the newsreels,

181
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:31,304
the Western leaders
and Stalin do not get on.

182
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,140
(Ambrose) The feeling -
especially in the States,

183
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,893
and most especially
with President Truman -

184
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,354
was that Stalin was another Hitler.

185
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,024
They didn't think,
"We made a great mistake in the war

186
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,068
and backed the wrong side."

187
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,780
They were perfectly clear that Hitler
was much the greater menace.

188
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,990
Hitler had to be crushed,

189
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,827
and the crushing of Hitler absolutely
depended upon the Red Army.

190
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,289
(narrator) The Red Army
has 300 divisions in Europe.

191
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,625
They are Stalin's trump card,

192
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,796
the source of his strength
at the conference table.

193
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,929
(Ambrose) Suddenly you were faced
with the fact

194
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,348
that the Americans were demobilising -

195
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,643
or rather, at the time of Potsdam,
they were redeploying,

196
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,854
pulling the army out of Europe,
taking it back to the States

197
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,856
and getting it ready to send to Japan,

198
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,609
as they expected
to have to invade the home islands

199
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,319
for the final defeat of Japan.

200
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,364
l was invited to see President Truman.

201
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,118
And he shut all the doors
and told me in great secrecy

202
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,495
the greatest secret of the war:

203
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,248
the fact that the Americans
had an atomic bomb,

204
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,334
which they were going to drop
very soon,

205
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,212
and which he thought
would bring the war to an end.

206
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,673
The reason for his decision

207
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:53,011
was this would save thousands
upon thousands of Allied lives,

208
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,430
which would otherwise be lost

209
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,851
in a frightful massacre
on the shores of Japan itself.

210
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,896
He warned me l might find myself
suddenly in the position

211
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,400
with the Japanese having surrendered.

212
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:13,823
Then l saw Churchill,
and Churchill told me the same thing.

213
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:18,619
He said, "They will surrender.
What are you going to do about it?"

214
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,873
l said, "You've only just told me.
l haven't thought."

215
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:35,720
(narrator) August 1945.
The bomb is dropped.

216
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,639
The Japanese do surrender.

217
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:45,229
Their cities, too, have been laid waste,
their dreams of conquest shattered.

218
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,566
They, too, are at the mercy
of their conqueror.

219
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,903
They do not know what lies in store.

220
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,203
(Ambrose) The Americans wanted Japan
rebuilt as quickly as possible,

221
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,706
and a highly industrialised Japan
to emerge from the war -

222
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,417
well within the American orbit.

223
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,296
Truman decided at Potsdam
that no one would be allowed into Japan

224
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,465
except for American troops.

225
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,010
The Aussies weren't let in,
the British were not let in,

226
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,932
and of course, most of all,
the Russians were not let in.

227
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,477
(narrator) The conqueror comes -

228
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,188
General MacArthur
with his American advisers,

229
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,774
his American court.

230
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,862
He will try and remake Japan
in America's image.

231
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,826
(cheering)

232
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,456
The prisoners are freed -

233
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,044
US airmen who burnt
Japan's cities to the ground.

234
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,296
They are the masters now.

235
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,354
ln Europe it is still summer.

236
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,818
There are 700,000
concentration camp surVivors.

237
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,487
lt may be enough to be alive,

238
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,531
to be reunited,

239
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,616
to have surVived,

240
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,452
to go home.

241
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,789
Six million former slave labourers -

242
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:14,879
Poles, Russians, Yugoslavs,
Estonians, Czechs, French -

243
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,423
free to pick up
the threads of their lives,

244
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,927
now that their German masters have gone.

245
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,654
Prisoners of war
with no country to go to -

246
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:44,116
deportees, Germans, soldiers, deserters.

247
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,329
(man) lt was very difticult
to tell the difterence

248
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,998
between a German refugee
and a Polish refugee

249
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,126
in the part of Germany
that l was located in -

250
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,254
l wouldn't know which were which.

251
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,047
You could be pretty well sure,

252
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,550
if they were humping things
on their back and carrying bags

253
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,554
but hadn't got a truck,
they were almost certainly refugees.

254
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:11,477
(narrator) Or perhaps SS guards
in stolen prison clothes.

255
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,409
Some choose death.

256
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,912
Himmler, lord of the SS, takes poison.

257
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,581
Some surrender or are caught.

258
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:37,670
Von Rundstedt, Hitler's general,
in full dress uniform.

259
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,050
Admiral Dönitz,
last leader of the Third Reich.

260
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,802
Albert Speer.

261
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,221
What to do with these broken monsters?

262
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,391
Stalin, at the Yalta Conference

263
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,853
that was attended
by President Roosevelt and Mr Churchill,

264
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:57,690
said that he thought 50,000

265
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,485
of the German general staft and ofticers

266
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,696
should be gathered together

267
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,657
and summarily executed.

268
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,951
He wasn't joking.

269
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:15,624
President Roosevelt thought he was,
and said, "Well, perhaps 49,000."

270
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,754
But Churchill said that he'd rather be
taken out into the garden

271
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,842
and shot at once
than be a party to such an iniquity.

272
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,596
But the Russians persisted
almost until the end

273
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,640
in saying that
there should be no trial -

274
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:36,103
these men were criminals
and should be immediately executed

275
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,730
the moment they were caught.

276
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,362
(narrator) There is a war crimes trial
at Nuremberg, Hitler's city.

277
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:49,742
The charges: crimes against peace,
crimes against humanity,

278
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,119
waging aggressive war.

279
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,747
The defendants are all German.

280
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,835
Göring is called
to plead guilty or not guilty.

281
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,933
(speaks German)

282
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,567
(judge bangs gavel)

283
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,197
(judge) l informed the court

284
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,617
that defendants were not entitled

285
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,703
to make a statement.

286
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,834
You must plead guilty or not guilty.

287
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,879
(speaks German)

288
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,642
Rudolf Hess.

289
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,190
Nein!

290
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,785
(judge) That will be entered
as a plea of not guilty.

291
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,414
(Shawcross) l think you'd say
the purpose was a twofold one.

292
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:23,210
The first was retribution -
the punishment of people

293
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,547
who had launched this war
against the world.

294
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,050
And not only the war, but who,

295
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,721
prior to the commencement
of the war and during it,

296
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,975
had committed the most terrible crimes
against humanity -

297
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:44,106
as, for instance, by exterminating
certainly seven million Jews.

298
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,984
The second purpose of the trial

299
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,321
was, as we hoped,

300
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,909
to lay down the rules
of international law for the future -

301
00:24:54,993 --> 00:25:00,831
not only making
the waging of aggressive war unlawful,

302
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:05,211
but, for the first time,
making the statesmen

303
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,339
who led their countries
into an aggressive war

304
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,675
personally responsible
for what they'd done.

305
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:17,973
12 million men, women and children
have died thus -

306
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,434
murdered in cold blood.

307
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:26,607
Millions upon millions more today
mourn their fathers and their mothers,

308
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,652
their husbands, their wives
and their children.

309
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,947
l was rather surprised
at the appearance of the defendants.

310
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:38,577
l thought, "Well, if l'd seen
these people in the Clapham omnibus,

311
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,871
l wouldn't have looked at them twice."

312
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,916
l think that was true of all of them,

313
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,295
except perhaps Hess and Ribbentrop,

314
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,340
who both looked
pretty miserable creatures,

315
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:57,054
and Göring, who looked
a very remarkable personality.

316
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,223
He did dominate the court.

317
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,893
He was the outstanding personality
in the court.

318
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:10,943
And sometimes, in the course of a long
trial like that, lasting over 200 days,

319
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,112
something would go wrong.

320
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,281
You would ask a witness a question,

321
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,617
and the answer you expected
would be "yes",

322
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,704
and the witness would answer "no".

323
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:26,667
At that point you had to be very careful
not to catch Göring's eye.

324
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,671
He was sitting at the corner
of the front row.

325
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,591
lf you glanced across at him
or caught his eye

326
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,801
when there was an incident like that,

327
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:40,931
he would raise his eyebrow and shake
his head in a rather smiling way,

328
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,767
and it would be very difticult
not to smile back.

329
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,406
(narrator) Göring cheats the gallows
with a cyanide pill.

330
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:02,328
The rest are hanged,
or imprisoned, or set free.

331
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,165
They have brought
their revolution to Germany,

332
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,917
and death to Europe.

333
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,462
Their mad adventure over,

334
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,758
now they pay their reckoning
for Hitler's Reich.

335
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,854
The British come back to Asia
in triumph.

336
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,648
An empty victory -

337
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,484
lndia's no longer docile.

338
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:37,363
Two million of her troops
fought for Britain in Britain's war.

339
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,824
Now they want their own country
to be free.

340
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,912
His Majesty's African troops,
they want freedom, too.

341
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,915
Malaya, Burma.

342
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:53,003
Britain is too weak to hold them,
even if she wants to.

343
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,843
The main eftect of the war against Japan
in the Far East

344
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:05,391
was the nourishing
of the spirit of nationalism in Asia.

345
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,310
A large part of Asia
had been under British rule,

346
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,938
and most of that
that was not under British rule

347
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,732
was under Dutch rule
or some European rule,

348
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,443
and the people were beginning to aspire

349
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,906
to the creation
of their own political institutions.

350
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,159
The demonstration by the Japanese

351
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:28,122
that the British could be beaten,
and beaten very severely,

352
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,459
naturally encouraged in the eyes
of the people of Southeast Asia

353
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,546
the belief that they, too,
might be able to secure

354
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,048
a much stronger position
against the British

355
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,925
than they'd dreamt possible.

356
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:44,346
This had a great eftect on opinion
in lndia and all over Southeast Asia.

357
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:49,393
Suddenly l found myself responsible,
as the supreme commander,

358
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,772
for an enormous area of the globe,

359
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,441
with a distance

360
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,317
of 6,000 miles across it -

361
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,404
as far as from London to Bombay,

362
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:05,868
with 128 million starVing
and rather rebellious people

363
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,745
who'd just been liberated,

364
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,416
with 123,000 prisoners of war
and internees,

365
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,545
many of whom were dying and whom
l had to try and recover quickly.

366
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,422
And at the very beginning,

367
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:23,385
l had some 700,000
Japanese soldiers, sailors and airmen

368
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,389
to take the surrender, disarm,
put into prison camps,

369
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,768
awaiting transportation back.

370
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,938
lt sounds a big problem, but l had
no idea what l really was in for.

371
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,818
What in really was in for
was trying to re-establish civilisation

372
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,070
and the rule of law and order

373
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,616
through this vast part of the world.

374
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,702
We didn't even know
what the conditions were going to be.

375
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:53,707
l had no staft
really trained or qualified

376
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,375
to help me in this task -

377
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,253
except some professional
civil aftairs ofticers

378
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:02,090
from various countries concerned,
whose one idea was to go back

379
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:06,220
and carry on where they left oft
three or four years before.

380
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,725
(narrator)
The police are not ideal either.

381
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,229
lndonesians do not want the Dutch back.

382
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,899
lf order must be maintained
in the East lndies,

383
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,361
there is only one force to do it:

384
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,571
the Japanese army.

385
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,409
Mountbatten uses them there,
and in Singapore as well.

386
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,415
(Mountbatten)
lt may sound odd now, after the war,

387
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,796
but at the time - and it still didn't
make sense - what was l to do?

388
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,966
lf l was to order them
to lay down their arms

389
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,426
and concentrate themselves
in prison camps,

390
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,931
and leave the outside world
without policemen or anything at all,

391
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,267
that would have been very odd.

392
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,186
No, l think they had to carry on
as they were

393
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:00,107
until they were eftectively relieved -
that's the only order l gave.

394
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,234
l didn't consciously employ them.

395
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,653
They carried on until
l could relieve them

396
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,574
with Allied soldiers
as soon as possible.

397
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,872
(narrator)
Americans are in Japan to stay.

398
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:19,042
Almost everywhere else in Asia,
white men prepare to leave.

399
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,672
Reluctantly, uncomprehendingly,
the Dutch go.

400
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,465
The French are difterent -

401
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,759
they will not give up lndochina.

402
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,267
They send troops to take it back,
commanded by General Leclerc,

403
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,185
a hero of the European war.

404
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,898
(Mountbatten) When l spoke to Leclerc
when l was about to turn over

405
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,693
the military responsible for
the south of French lndochina to him,

406
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:51,074
l urged him to try and make friends with
local inhabitants, local insurgents.

407
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,827
l said, "That's the way
for France to come back -

408
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,704
with a friendly relationship."

409
00:31:55,788 --> 00:32:00,417
"l don't think you can impose by
military means your old colonial rule."

410
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,670
He said, "l see the point.
l'm sorry, l'm a soldier."

411
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,673
"My instructions are to take over
the military way."

412
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,760
And that, of course, is what he did.

413
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,769
(machine-gun fire)

414
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,150
(narrator) So the killing goes on.

415
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,987
lt goes on there to this day.

416
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,539
Berlin in the first months
of occupation.

417
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:44,503
Cheery Frauieins, once the handmaidens
of Hitler's new order.

418
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,816
Some of the victors
have the time of their lives.

419
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,957
(man #1) Germany was on
a cigarette and chocolate-bar economy

420
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,585
right after the war, right after combat.

421
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,755
As a consequence,
there was little an American soldier

422
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,966
couldn't buy if he wanted to buy it -

423
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,968
including serVices of all sorts.

424
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,059
(man #2) lt's the same old story -

425
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,395
if a boy and a girl
want to get together,

426
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:47,441
there isn't any law that says you can't
or you're not going to do it.

427
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,362
The black market was blooming.

428
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,865
We had nothing. A piece of soap

429
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,284
was a most valuable possession.

430
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,703
So...

431
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,289
you practically prostituted yourself,

432
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,959
just to get a piece of soap,
maybe a can of coftee,

433
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:11,173
or maybe even some cigarettes -
people who smoked. l didn't.

434
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,800
But you just did everything.

435
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:23,226
l know people - very, very fine people -
who just would have done anything.

436
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:27,647
And you lose some of your human dignity
when you are so hungry,

437
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,735
when you are so without food,

438
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,321
without clothing, without everything.

439
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,241
(man) How could you blame
a starVing girl?

440
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,703
She might not want stockings,
she might not want cigarettes,

441
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,205
or a bicycle, or butter,

442
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,124
but she did want badly something,

443
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,959
which could be provided

444
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:53,131
by the appropriate,
typically, British or American Gl.

445
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,845
l had to give up
smoking in the streets.

446
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,223
ln those days l was a cigarette smoker.

447
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,767
Carelessly, you'd throw your cigarette

448
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,060
on the floor.

449
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,269
Before you knew it,

450
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,188
a fellow had almost caught it.

451
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,150
He'd been trailing you
because he saw you were smoking.

452
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:18,698
l remember that in one of the cinemas
in one of the big towns

453
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,786
there was going to be a performance
for the American Gls.

454
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,705
They had queued up before it started.

455
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:31,545
The Americans don't allow smoking,
but they were all smoking in the queues.

456
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:38,051
Practically opposite every smoker,
there was a line of hungry-looking men -

457
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,513
hungry for tobacco -
waiting until the doors opened.

458
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,642
And then as the cigarettes fell
into the street, there was a rush.

459
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,646
The key place in that queue
was just at the entrance to the cinema,

460
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,441
because that's where
most of the cigarettes came down.

461
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:07,455
(man) ln retrospect, being a conqueror
seems very dubious to me,

462
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,250
but at the time it seemed quite right.

463
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:14,462
We were convinced of our virtue
and the German vice,

464
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:19,718
and it was very pleasing
to be able to tell them what to do.

465
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,103
(narrator) Time to rebuild.

466
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:34,816
Time for Germany to recover,
so it can start to pay.

467
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,907
The Russians want
20 billion dollars in reparations.

468
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,452
Americans think that's more
than Germany itself is worth.

469
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,956
The West won't help the Russians
collect that much.

470
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,502
They stop sending
goods and hardware to the East.

471
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,923
The Russians send little food
and raw materials to the West.

472
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:04,054
The Allies are starting to fall out
with each other.

473
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:27,744
The Germans, caught in the middle,
get on with rebuilding themselves.

474
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,706
There are no slave labourers now.

475
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,815
(Spencer) They had cleared the street,
and trams went by.

476
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,775
l'd have hated to ride on one.

477
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,819
They were packed to the roof -

478
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,572
there were people hanging
on the outside, though it was cold,

479
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,158
there were people standing
on the bufters.

480
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,161
And there were patient queues
to get on these trams,

481
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,331
but nobody ever seemed to me to get oft.

482
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,595
(translation)
Horst Gerlach, born 4 May...

483
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:35,395
(narrator) The Suchdienst -
the missing persons register.

484
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,861
12 million Germans,
driven from the eastern lands,

485
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,779
trying to find each other.

486
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,657
They're not alone.

487
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,203
60 million Europeans have been uprooted.

488
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,956
Some never find their way home again.

489
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,430
November 1945.

490
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,642
The Germans live
on 1500 calories a day -

491
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,936
a third of what the American troops get.

492
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:22,942
(woman) lt was a very hard time,
because we suftered from hunger.

493
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,780
The Americans had much food.

494
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,076
My mother decided to work for them.

495
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,415
And l decided to work for them, too.

496
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,918
My mother was in the kitchen,

497
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,420
and l was a waitress.

498
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,094
Well, it was rather hard for me,

499
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:56,851
because the Americans ordered
that l had to smile always.

500
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:02,190
And l couldn't smile, because l...

501
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:10,240
The American ofticers were so proud,
and they treated us as Nazis.

502
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,286
(narrator) No peace conference
ever takes place.

503
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,123
There is no new Versailles.

504
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,500
Germany is divided.

505
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,628
The occupation zones become frontiers -

506
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:28,007
unintended, unwelcome and permanent.

507
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,012
(Ambrose) lf you have a unified Germany
that belongs to the Russians,

508
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,724
you have Russian domination
of the whole of the Continent.

509
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:42,147
lf you have a unified Germany that is
in the hands of the Anglo-Americans,

510
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:46,067
then you have
a Western domination of the Continent

511
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,069
that would cheat Russia

512
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,489
out of her just claims to the security

513
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,034
that was Stalin's number-one concern

514
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,370
all through the war and afterwards.

515
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,999
So dividing Germany along the Elbe

516
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,127
was probably the best solution.

517
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,880
One's tempted to use words
like "fair" and "just",

518
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,382
but l don't think they apply here -

519
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,634
it's the workable solution.

520
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,097
Wherever the Red Army was
in a contiguous territory,

521
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,725
they would install a Sovietised system -

522
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,810
and there was no argument about it.

523
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,521
We did the very best we could on Poland.

524
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,817
The tragedy of Poland is that she's got
Germany for a neighbour on one side

525
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,821
and Russia for a neighbour on the other
side. lt's a terrible position.

526
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,116
lt's always been the Polish dilemma
and the Polish tragedy -

527
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,994
Poland has to fall into the orbit
of one or the other.

528
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,414
Given those choices, and given
the natures of Hitler and Stalin,

529
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,916
l suppose if l were a Pole,

530
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,628
l'd say, "We're better oft under
Stalin's heel than under Hitler's."

531
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,630
Soldiers of Poland,

532
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:55,970
l wish you all a speedy and safe return
to your home country.

533
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,765
(band plays)

534
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,865
(narrator) Poland's tragedy.
Russia's triumph.

535
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,159
Victory Day in Moscow.

536
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,622
(Ambrose) The Russians paid
an enormous price for victory,

537
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,499
but they did gain from the war -

538
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,585
security for themselves,
control of East Europe,

539
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,630
and the opportunity,
which they took advantage of,

540
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,132
to exploit East Europe economically.

541
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:38,429
(narrator) A nation bled white by war
has somehow to rebuild.

542
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,140
The Soviet Union has surVived.

543
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:45,186
lt is one of the world's great powers,

544
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,313
and now everyone knows it.

545
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,247
London, 1945.

546
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,666
Eros comes home.

547
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:19,137
Britain has surVived, too.
But a curious victory.

548
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,853
You can picnic again,

549
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,939
but look out for unexploded mines.

550
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,798
No invasion, no occupation,

551
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,676
yet the nation's treasure is exhausted.

552
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:03,473
For six years it has fought
and been a workshop for war.

553
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,186
The bullets have been bought
with Britain's wealth.

554
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,812
They won't be needed now.

555
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,106
Britain has won the war,

556
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,109
and has nearly gone bankrupt doing it.

557
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,573
The British had as many problems,
if not more, in recovering from victory

558
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,076
as the Germans did
in recovering from defeat.

559
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,246
The British... What did Britain
get out of the war?

560
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:32,418
Not very much. Not very much.
She lost a very great deal.

561
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,213
l suppose, if you want
to look at it positively,

562
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,716
she got a moral claim on the world

563
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,595
as the nation that had
stood against Hitler alone for a year,

564
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,932
and had provided the moral leadership
against the Nazis

565
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,936
at a time when everyone else
was willing to cave in to the Nazis.

566
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,607
(narrator) America, 1945.

567
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,443
The boys come home - again.

568
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,218
(Ambrose) The big winner
in World War ll

569
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,887
is the United States
of America - by far.

570
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,391
We get much more out of the war
than anyone else.

571
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:32,645
There's a paradox here -
very quickly after the war was over,

572
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,108
Americans began to take the attitude:
"Aha! Here it is again."

573
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,445
"We got fooled once more,
as we did in World War l."

574
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,447
"We made this enormous eftort,

575
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,907
we beat the Germans,
we beat the Japanese."

576
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,661
"And who wins? The Russians.
The Russians get East Europe out of it."

577
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,997
"We were suckers."

578
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,916
This was very widely felt
in the United States.

579
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,545
lt was a strange attitude to hold
when you look,

580
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,465
with whatever objectivity
that one can muster,

581
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,842
at what the real results
of the war were.

582
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:09,348
(narrator) Americans come home
to a country untouched by bombs,

583
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:13,227
a country twice as rich
as when the war began -

584
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,396
more food than it can eat,

585
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,523
more clothes than it can wear,

586
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,818
more steel than it can use.

587
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,739
The only country in the world
with money to spare.

588
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,533
The country with the atom bomb.

589
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:02,193
The Germans, too, are victors -
though they do not know it yet.

590
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,779
The soldiers come home
from internment camps,

591
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:08,407
put on ordinary clothes,
go back to work.

592
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:13,120
Feudal, Prussian, peasant Germany
is no more.

593
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,374
ln its place,
the structure of a modern state.

594
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:21,212
lronically enough,
that was Hitler's work.

595
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,798
Now, in the West,
a new Germany will emerge:

596
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:28,052
rich and free and democratic -
and strong.

597
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,474
England, too, changes -
though some voices stay the same.

598
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,769
You will be taken
to the civilian clothing depot

599
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,729
to get your civilian suit.

600
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,108
After that, a bus
will take you down to the station.

601
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,070
You're free then
to push oft home as fast as you can.

602
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,615
(newsreel)
The procedure is comprehensive -

603
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,909
there are a lot of things
to be thought of

604
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,078
when a man or a woman
leaves the army.

605
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,914
Civilian life nowadays
is fairly full of snags,

606
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,500
and the ex-soldier
must be armed against them

607
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,419
when he marches into civVy street.

608
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,338
lnformation pamphlet.
14-day ration card.

609
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,508
- Good luck. Thanks for all you've done.
- Thank you, sir.

610
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,345
- AC Clott?
- Sir! 252.

611
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,475
(narrator)
Britain's soldiers come home,

612
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,312
to a land without much cheer,

613
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:24,734
to a land of ration cards, queues,
black markets and austerity.

614
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,362
But to a land of National Health

615
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,740
and the welfare state.

616
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,118
To a land of free men and women.

617
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,622
To a world no longer at war.

618
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:10,780
ln the first place,
if we hadn't won the war,

619
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:14,033
it would have meant
that the Japanese and the Germans

620
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,493
would have won it.

621
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:20,247
l think you can imagine what kind
of a world that would have been.

622
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:27,254
lt's true that the problem of Russia -
the Soviet Union, rather -

623
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,549
emerged sharply after the war.

624
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,385
But l would say on the whole

625
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:37,264
that that was the lesser of
the two evils that could have happened.

626
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:44,855
And the more or less principles
on which democracies operate,

627
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,608
on which societies are based,

628
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:52,571
certainly didn't get much satisfaction
out of the results of the war -

629
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,367
but l think this was inevitable,
given the Soviet system.

630
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,745
On the other hand, there's still
a large portion of the world

631
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,333
that still is able to exercise
a certain degree of freedom,

632
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,003
particularly in their internal aftairs.

633
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,171
Not that by any means

634
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,758
that everything that isn't communist
is perfect - far from it.

635
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,595
But l think the world
would have been quite intolerable

636
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,432
under Nazi and Japanese rule.

637
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,769
The principal eftects of the war
on people and political systems

638
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,772
bore upon the countries
in Eastern Europe -

639
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:33,904
Poland most of all, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Romania and those countries.

640
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,491
These peoples were hoping,
or some of them were hoping,

641
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:41,704
that the war would liberate them
from the threat of Nazi tyranny,

642
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:47,001
and in fact at the end of it they found
themselves in the communist bloc -

643
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,796
which l must say was far less sinister
than the Nazi bloc.

644
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,383
This was a very solid achievement
of the Second World War -

645
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,803
a very much less sinister
type of tyranny

646
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,264
replaced a highly sinister tyranny.

647
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:03,601
But this was not the freedom
for which they had hoped,

648
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,687
and for which, to a large extent,
we had fought.

649
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,565
The most important single result
of World War ll

650
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,234
is that the Nazis were crushed,

651
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,739
the militarists in Japan were crushed,
the Fascists in ltaly were crushed.

652
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,533
Surely justice
has never been better serVed.

653
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:22,596
(narrator) For 30 years now,
there has been peace in Europe.

654
