1
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:17,725
(narrator) Berlin in the summer of 1940
welcomed victory beyond belief.

2
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,318
The soldiers of the Third Reich
came home after only a year of war.

3
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,446
They had conquered France.

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,449
Central and northern Europe
had fallen, too.

5
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,786
These crowds were delirious
with exultation and relief.

6
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:44,710
They turned to their Führer
in a frenzy of gratitude.

7
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,516
They had not fancied war.
They had feared defeat.

8
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,728
Now they thought the war was over

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,272
and they rejoiced.

10
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,292
(narrator) The men came home.

11
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,879
They were brown and fit
and only a few of them had died.

12
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,139
(woman) l just went shopping

13
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,725
when somebody told me,
"Don't you hear the noise?"

14
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,313
And there l saw this part of the army
coming back just near us.

15
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:33,318
So l bought a bowl of cherries
and ran there.

16
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,907
We all were so glad.

17
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,662
We heard so much of the First World War
with those dreadful battles

18
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,123
and those many dead.

19
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:52,171
l felt a sort of national pride
we ended the war so quick.

20
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,093
(narrator) ln cities untouched by war,

21
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,805
the German people had hardly begun
to give up the ways of peace.

22
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,099
There was rationing, even shortages,

23
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,604
but to make up for it,
the regime preached enjoyment, luxury.

24
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,940
(♪ "Rosamunde")

25
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,579
While the British had declared
frivolous things immoral,

26
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,790
the Nazis tried to show
that luxury flourished.

27
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,876
Promises were their propaganda.

28
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,630
Those who ran the war eftort
came to believe their own promises.

29
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,840
Only a few saw further.

30
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,177
Just about August it was ordered

31
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,096
that a lot of production was stopped

32
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:47,059
or minimised or things like that.

33
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:53,649
And there was a kind of euphoria
that the war was, so to say, over.

34
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,817
l didn't believe in that at all.

35
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,196
No, l thought l knew the British

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,451
and l had the opinion
that they would see this thing through

37
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,246
and that the United States
would join the war,

38
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,541
and therefore
every eftort should be made

39
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,836
to prepare for a long blockade.

40
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,005
(crowd cheers)

41
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,718
(narrator) Hitler had no plans
for a long struggle,

42
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,515
no preparations for the total
mobilisation of all productive capacity.

43
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,060
German industry had been geared
to a blitzkrieg war.

44
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:35,482
The regime still let the factories
turn out peacetime goods.

45
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,862
The workers, subjugated
but not fully converted,

46
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,909
watched the comings and goings
of the Nazi princes without enthusiasm.

47
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,794
Wanting to be loved,
the Nazis gave and gave.

48
00:04:55,878 --> 00:05:00,424
For 1940, propaganda minister
Dr Goebbels was Father Christmas.

49
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,970
He gave to children. He gave to mothers.

50
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:09,266
(newsreeI) In BerIin wurde der neue FiIm
"Mutterliebe" uraufgefürht.

51
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,185
Auf VeranIassung
von Reichsminister Dr. Goebbels

52
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,146
lud die NSV 1 .200 Trägerinnen...

53
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,273
(narrator) Ladies with larger broods

54
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,568
were invited to the film premiere
of Mother Love,

55
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:24,281
the regime's hymn to family
and folk community.

56
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:29,036
Das heißt, er wird uns ja vom Himmel
aus helfen, so gut er kann.

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,288
Er wird mit dem lieben Gott sprechen.

58
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:35,042
Und weil er so lustig ist
und alle Engel lachen macht...

59
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,379
(narrator) On their breasts
they wore the Nazi Mother Cross.

60
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,968
The pram was the tank of the home front.

61
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,680
The government hoped
for a breakthrough on the birth rate.

62
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,891
Happy babies, happy future mothers

63
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,770
and very specially happy music
soused the nation.

64
00:05:54,896 --> 00:06:01,068
(♪ march)

65
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,820
The big smile glued across the face
of the people,

66
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:08,241
still often dubious and nerVous,
was stretched even wider.

67
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,163
(singing in German)

68
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:31,598
Everybody must learn to enjoy the happy
teamwork of Hitler's folk community.

69
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:41,483
Vierzehn Uhr und eine Minute.
Der Wehrmachtsbericht.

70
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,735
(narrator) Radio was the instrument

71
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,905
which the Nazis made their own
from the beginning.

72
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,157
Their foreign-language broadcasts,

73
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,619
technically marVellous
but grotesquely unconvincing,

74
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,415
reached greedily out to minds abroad.

75
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,751
Today's ofticial German war communiqué
reads as follows.

76
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,714
(narrator) But listening
to foreign radio was forbidden.

77
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,009
Many, like the propaganda comics
Tran and Helle,

78
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,763
argued the toss between getting
a glimpse of the outside world

79
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,891
and the risk of a jail sentence.

80
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:08,445
(woman) lf we listened to foreign radio,
which we always did,

81
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:14,409
we turned it very low and we used
to sit right up close against it.

82
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:19,915
And l remember one particular moment
when my son,

83
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,168
who was a little schoolboy,

84
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,547
told me that he had
a very funny story to tell me,

85
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,134
that his friend's mother
also listened to the radio

86
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,346
with her ear right up against it
the same as we did.

87
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,682
l suddenly realised
that l could have her imprisoned

88
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,809
and she could have me imprisoned,

89
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,939
because these two children
had been talking about it.

90
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,235
(narrator)
As well as geography and the rest,

91
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,321
Nazi schools were obliged
to add a special subject.

92
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,574
Children were taught
with pictures and measurements

93
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,245
the dimensions of a healthy Aryan race.

94
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,497
Ofticial films prepared the Germans

95
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,124
for the consequences
of keeping the race pure.

96
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,628
The mentally incurable,
condemned as the bad seed,

97
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,215
went to experimental gas chambers.

98
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,134
(man speaks German)

99
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,345
(narrator) But now, for once,

100
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,432
the Germans learnt what was going on
and protested.

101
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,894
Bishop Galen of Münster
attacked euthanasia from the pulpit.

102
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,356
For a time, the programme was stopped.

103
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,902
A controlled press
avoided such misgivings.

104
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,865
Some newspapers were
mere party sheets of hate and lies.

105
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,035
Some slipped criticism
between the lines.

106
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:25,373
None of them satisfied a people
which was still highly educated.

107
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,959
(man) lt was terribly frustrating

108
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,797
never to be allowed
to say your opinion openly.

109
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,008
l myself was quite happy

110
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,801
when l was called up,

111
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,929
early 1940, to the army,

112
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,976
and that suddenly left behind

113
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,771
all the oppression l had every day.

114
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,441
Being a soldier,
you don't read newspapers.

115
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,943
You don't listen to the radio.

116
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:59,032
You're not always under the stress
of the propaganda

117
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,785
which was pointed at you every hour.

118
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,293
(narrator) European war
became world war in June 1941 .

119
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:14,923
The Nazi leaders had secretly resolved
that the conquest of Russia must come.

120
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,177
(newsreel) Reichsminister Dr. Goebbels
verliest die Proklamation des Führers.

121
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,137
Deutsches Volk.

122
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:26,059
ln diesem Augenblick vollzieht sich
ein Aufmarsch, der...

123
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,562
(narrator) For many, the attack
on the Soviet Union

124
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,024
brought fear and bewilderment.

125
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:39,572
Of course l'd heard
of certain preparations

126
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:44,577
but it was all... well, hushed up,

127
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,957
and till the last moment,

128
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,043
l didn't think that the war
would come about.

129
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,464
(narrator) For a long war,

130
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,385
Germany would need to have the south
Russian oil fields for her own.

131
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,764
Russia had delivered
a million tons of oil the previous year

132
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,601
under the Nazi-Soviet Pact,
now flung away.

133
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,270
(Kehrl) As a matter of fact

134
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,982
we had the greatest trade agreements
with them that we ever had

135
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,192
and they delivered promptly,

136
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:23,616
and from an economic point of view
everything seemed to be in order.

137
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:30,415
l personally had, through my men,

138
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:37,422
negotiations with them of putting up
a synthetic fibre mill in Russia

139
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:43,553
and the treaty was signed
on 15 June, 1941 ,

140
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,849
and the first ten million marks in gold

141
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,020
should be shipped on July 1 , 1941 .

142
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,189
(woman sings in German)

143
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,407
(narrator) The Germans drove eastwards
over disintegrating Russian armies.

144
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,706
Victory looked like a matter of weeks,
another blitzkrieg,

145
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,959
and morale at home revived.

146
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,182
Göring inspected what was now
the German colony of Ukraine,

147
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,644
intended to be a serf region
of agriculture.

148
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,231
Nazi experts on the Slavs hoped
that this simple folk

149
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,819
with simple customs
would enjoy this prospect.

150
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,864
Six months later,
in the blinding snow before Moscow,

151
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,825
the Germans were stopped.

152
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,874
They lacked winter clothing

153
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,336
and the government appealed
for furs and warm coats.

154
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,756
An den letzten Tagen
der Sammlung drängen

155
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,801
drängen sich vor den Annahmestellen
die Gebefreudigen,

156
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,344
um ihre Spenden abzuliefern.

157
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,723
Tut Ihnen das nicht leid? So einen
schönen Pelz? Oh, ist das warm da drin.

158
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,393
(narrator) No amount
of rehearsed enthusiasm

159
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:18,398
could conceal that this was
the Reich's first military reverse.

160
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,450
The minister of munitions
and head of the war eftort Fritz Todt

161
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,872
flew to inspect the construction work
on the Eastern Front.

162
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,834
One of the men who should have been
on the plane was Hitler's architect,

163
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,921
the producer of the Nuremberg rallies,
Albert Speer.

164
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:47,260
l heard in the headquarters
that Todt's plane crashed.

165
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:53,182
He was dead. And half an hour afterwards
l was asked to come to Hitler

166
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,060
and to my great surprise he told me,

167
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:00,023
"You shall be
his successor in all his oftices."

168
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,530
Todt got the funeral
of a National Socialist hero.

169
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,592
By now nearly 250,000 Germans
had been killed on the battle fronts,

170
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:32,180
but Todt was the first of Hitler's
close comrades to meet death in the war.

171
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,768
Hitler was shaken.
The war had reached him personally.

172
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,116
Speer had already seen the chaotic,
disconnected way

173
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,118
that Nazi war industry worked.

174
00:15:54,203 --> 00:16:00,500
Transport, munitions - all had to be
brought under a single control.

175
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,217
One of his first targets
was the labour supply.

176
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,304
Nazi Germany had never mobilised
its full workforce.

177
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,351
(Speer) l tried to get the women
in the war production machinery,

178
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:23,564
but it was opposed by Sauckel
who was in charge of all the labour.

179
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,151
And the thing came to Göring
and Göring flatly denied, too.

180
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,487
Then it came to the decision of Hitler,

181
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,157
and Hitler also said,
"No, the women must be preserVed."

182
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:38,121
"They have other tasks. They are for
the family. They have to bear children

183
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:43,710
and it would spoil their health
and their morale

184
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,920
if they are working in the factories."

185
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,551
(narrator) But Ukrainian women
were being imported as maids -

186
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,929
foreign conscripts for slave labour.

187
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,515
Under Speer,
a great irony was fulfilled,

188
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:02,395
for Germany was becoming exactly what
the Nazis said it would not become.

189
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,066
They had promised a return to the land,
an end to great capitalism.

190
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,444
lnstead, the armaments drive

191
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,447
was strengthening
the vast industrial monopolies

192
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:17,535
and swelling the cities
with German and foreign labour.

193
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,078
ln two and a half years,

194
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,082
Speer multiplied armament production
nearly four times.

195
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,669
80% of industry came under his control.

196
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:32,133
He brushed aside bureaucracies
and worked through his own experts.

197
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:38,014
(Kehrl) He had ideas
and he put all his energy

198
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,266
behind these ideas

199
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,228
and put them through
with very much success.

200
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,606
He didn't know how things

201
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,941
had been done in the past.

202
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,277
He hadn't anything to do with it,

203
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,531
so he didn't know what was impossible
and what was possible,

204
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,535
and he succeeded sometimes
in doing the impossible, too.

205
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,956
(Speer) lt is astounding for everybody

206
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,168
who didn't live
in our authoritarian system

207
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:12,882
to hear that it was difticult
to get through with orders.

208
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,509
But it was difticult

209
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:20,515
because Germany was divided
into many districts, 32 districts.

210
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,309
At the head of every district
was a Gauleiter.

211
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:28,564
He was strong political man
and had absolute power in his district.

212
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,777
He was only subordinated
to Hitler himself.

213
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:37,198
So when my orders didn't please
one of the Gauleiters,

214
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,409
possibly they weren't carried out.

215
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:48,334
(narrator) Tank production showed how
even Speer failed to get all of his way.

216
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,379
He could not slice through
the competing hierarchies

217
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,798
in Hitler's chosen style of government.

218
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,093
There were too many types of tanks.
Too few tanks in all.

219
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,680
Too many calibres of gun
and difterent sizes of ammunition.

220
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,851
(Speer) Hitler thought he was
far superior to such problems

221
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,813
and what for others would have been
discussions of weeks and weeks

222
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,109
for him was a decision
of just a fraction of a minute.

223
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,027
Of course, there was a change, too.

224
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,447
One can never say
that a man is always the same person,

225
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,951
and Hitler changed a lot
from '42 to '43.

226
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,204
ln '43 he was more and more convinced

227
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,957
that he didn't need
any more advice of anybody

228
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:32,253
and he made the decisions
by himself without listening.

229
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,967
(narrator) Hitler spent
more and more time at the Wolf's Lair,

230
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,887
his melancholy, remote encampment
at Rastenburg

231
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,556
in the East Prussian forest.

232
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,642
Those around him were obsequious.

233
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,520
The better advisers lost touch.

234
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:58,279
Hitler's personal SS adjutant
was Richard Schulze-Kossens.

235
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,783
(Schulze-Kossens) Nearly all ministers
were stationed at Berlin

236
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:09,165
and some of them had contact ofticers
in the headquarters.

237
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:14,045
Only Ribbentrop, Himmler and sometimes
Göring had their own headquarters,

238
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,131
not so far from our headquarters.

239
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,093
Speer was very often in the headquarters

240
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:26,182
because his ministry
was very important for the war.

241
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:30,228
Only Bormann
was always in the headquarters

242
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:35,316
where there was
the only direct contact to Hitler.

243
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,778
(Speer) Bormann, as the secretary,
was the most powerful man -

244
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,824
more powerful, l think, than Hitler,
because when the power was divided,

245
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:49,622
all those men who were in power
had to go via him to Hitler.

246
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:54,669
Except me.
l had direct access to Hitler.

247
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,921
There wasn't much cooperation.

248
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:02,218
The cooperation was in the lower levels
of the smaller technocrats.

249
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,388
We didn't have anything like a cabinet.

250
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,517
Ministers met, if at all, very seldom

251
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,895
and didn't talk about
very important matters -

252
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,523
so was my impression.

253
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,943
Every ministry worked for itself

254
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:24,824
and sometimes they got orders
from Hitler, but very, very seldom.

255
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,954
(narrator) Foreign visitors
like Mannerheim, the Finnish leader,

256
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,040
could see that Hitler was living
in a world of illusion.

257
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,253
He still trusted the reassurances
of Göring, head of the Luftwafte.

258
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,005
Göring, a few months later,

259
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,300
claimed that his aircraft
could supply the Eastern Front

260
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,428
even when a whole army
was cut oft at Stalingrad.

261
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,473
(man #1) Achtung,
ich rufe noch einmal Stalingrad.

262
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,477
(man #2) Hier Stalingrad.
Hier ist die Front an der Wolga.

263
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,148
(man #1) Achtung,
die U-Bootfahrer im Atlantik.

264
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,775
(narrator) Christmas 1942.

265
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,779
(man #1) Achtung, Catania.

266
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,574
(man #3) Hier ist die Mittelmeerfront
und Afrika.

267
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,492
(narrator) The man at Stalingrad

268
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,287
had come through
on the radio link-up loud and clear,

269
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,958
but the brave words
were faked in a Berlin studio.

270
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,046
(♪ "Stille Nacht")

271
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,557
For the last time
the cathedral stood undamaged

272
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,018
as the Christmas fair
took place in Berlin.

273
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,813
But Stalingrad was still cut oft

274
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,484
and deep down the nation sensed
what was to happen.

275
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,111
(man) Dritter Februar.

276
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,366
Das Oberkommando
der Wehrmacht gibt bekannt:

277
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,160
Der Kampf um Stalingrad ist zu Ende.

278
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,956
(narrator) "The Battle of Stalingrad
has come to an end."

279
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,252
For once the radio spoke the truth,
and with some dignity.

280
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,298
91 ,000 surVivors surrendered.

281
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,677
Only a few thousand
ever saw Germany again.

282
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,722
l was not long in the headquarters

283
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:17,269
but l felt very significant
the atmosphere on this day.

284
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,899
All people were depressed

285
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,529
and Hitler himself was very serious

286
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:31,158
and he started on his soup

287
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,579
without saying any word, and...

288
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,918
He was... He was very depressed.

289
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,471
(narrator) The world realised

290
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,934
and the Germans realised
that this was the turning point.

291
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:01,063
This was the tragedy
which could not be hidden.

292
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,824
And Stalingrad did not come alone.
A week before the city fell,

293
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:18,164
the Germans learned that the Allies
would demand unconditional surrender.

294
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,502
There was, then,
to be no mercy for the Germans.

295
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,131
Nazi and non-Nazi
both lost some illusions

296
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,508
and drew a little closer together.

297
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,969
The escape hatches had been bolted.

298
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,931
This was to be a total war,
fought to the finish.

299
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,604
(Bieienberg) The general feeling was,
well, we can do nothing.

300
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,566
lt doesn't matter what we do.
We'd better stick it out.

301
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,987
Ausharren was the word,
l remember, on everyone's lips.

302
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:55,075
There's no alternative.
We've got to fight to the bitter end.

303
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,456
And this Goebbels used to the uttermost
in his propaganda.

304
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,378
(cheering)

305
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,173
(narrator) Two weeks after Stalingrad,

306
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,801
Goebbels brought a picked
Nazi audience to a last mass frenzy.

307
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,782
(narrator) lt was his supreme moment,
the proclaiming of total war

308
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,911
and the invoking
of the nation's hidden power.

309
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,605
(narrator) "Now, folk, rise up
and storm, break loose."

310
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,316
They were the words of 1812,

311
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,654
of the national uprising
against Napoleon.

312
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,489
They were empty now.

313
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,328
(♪ fanfare)

314
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,549
ln 1943 it was better
listening to music than to news.

315
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,305
(sings in German)

316
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,273
(narrator) lt was total war
and retreat on all fronts.

317
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,360
Total war meant that even
German women must work.

318
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,492
lt brought its own sour humour.

319
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:05,956
(Tucking) There was a slogan,
"Do enjoy war. Peace will be dreadful."

320
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,960
(narrator) There was a new equality

321
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,755
among the boys drafted
to the mines and factories.

322
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:18,260
The Hitler Youth was mobilised into
production and eventually into battle.

323
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:23,641
The barriers between people crumbled as
they had crumbled in the London Blitz.

324
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,855
People wanted to huddle together,
to sing and forget.

325
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,608
By the morning, they might be dead.

326
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,240
(gunfire)

327
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,831
By day the American bomber fleets
ranged over the Reich.

328
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,042
At night came the British.

329
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,461
ln the shelters
the people waited for dawn

330
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,255
and wondered if their cities
would still be there.

331
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,220
(Tucking) When we had the first bombs,
we were shocked.

332
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:06,350
We saw all the sky
lighted up from the fire.

333
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,396
lt was an enormous and a dreadful sight.

334
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,982
We were very angry when we saw

335
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:19,238
that so many residential areas
were destroyed.

336
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,032
There were so few men left

337
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:27,079
that everybody who had
the strength was firefighting.

338
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:42,177
(narrator) One by one the German cities
were incinerated by firestorms.

339
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:46,432
Ten days' raids on Hamburg
left 40,000 dead.

340
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,274
Goebbels noted, "The people in the west

341
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,026
are gradually beginning
to lose courage."

342
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,405
"Hell like that is hard to bear."

343
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,870
(Bieienberg) l think that the bombing

344
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,456
hadn't the eftect
one would have thought.

345
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,293
lt had the eftect
of bringing people together.

346
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,712
lf you were all under the same bombs,

347
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,631
it didn't matter whether your neighbour
was a Nazi

348
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,633
or what they were.

349
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,683
(narrator) To avoid seeing the ruins,

350
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,686
Hitler's rare visits to Berlin
were made by night.

351
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,690
And yet banners were ordered
for his birthday.

352
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:42,112
They read, "Our walls have broken,
but not our hearts."

353
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:48,285
(Junge) Hitler lost more and more
his sense of reality.

354
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,163
He never, never had the will

355
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:56,502
that he must see with his own eyes
what the war was.

356
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,466
We had no information from outside

357
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:08,388
and so l had the feeling
to live in a monastery,

358
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:13,435
in a concentration camp.

359
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,106
One of the generals once said,
"l feel like a concentration camp."

360
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,984
"We are included

361
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,697
and we all use the same phrases."

362
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,201
"We are all thinking the same.
We are all hearing the same."

363
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:33,956
"We are all led in our thoughts

364
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,708
and our feelings by Hitler."

365
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:42,339
We all were playing in a play,
each his role

366
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,343
and he was the only one
who knew the script.

367
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:51,265
He made us all do our play
and speak our text.

368
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,143
Nobody else knew how it would end.

369
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:05,779
Neither Hitler nor Göring nor Himmler
were seen in public. Only Goebbels.

370
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,201
Whenever there was
a very heavy bombing,

371
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:16,164
Goebbels stood there on the marketplace
and held his speeches

372
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:20,377
and tried to say ausharren.

373
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,131
l personally had respect,

374
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,260
because there was a sort of inspiring.

375
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,471
You were sort of in a trance.

376
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,144
(♪ "The Mastersingers of Nuremberg" -
Wagner)

377
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:47,863
(narrator) A strained, exhausted nation
could still lose itself in music.

378
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,662
The orchestras still gave
what was great and true

379
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,539
in the tradition of German art.

380
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,669
ln the galleries there was only
the empty grimacing

381
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,048
of Nazi painting, Nazi sculpture.

382
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,017
True Aryan models simpered and scowled,

383
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:22,105
their features carefully designed
to portray the victorious Nordic race.

384
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,866
Race was the empire
of Himmler and the SS.

385
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,703
But now the SS was itself an empire.

386
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,997
Himmler, the ex-chicken-farmer,

387
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,334
ruled the death camps
and the concentration camps.

388
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,547
The SS had its own schools
and factories and courts.

389
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,343
lt administered huge tracts
of the occupied east.

390
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:56,056
lt was the instrument of German dominion
over Europe. lt was even an army.

391
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,058
The generals had little control

392
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:02,938
over the hundreds of thousands
of elite troops in the Waften-SS.

393
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,275
lnto the SS training schools were drawn
Aryan-looking volunteers

394
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,111
from the occupied countries,

395
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:13,657
for the SS state was to be
not merely German but European.

396
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:18,328
(Schulze-Kossens) All had volunteered
for active serVice in the Waften-SS

397
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,708
because they regarded
the fight against Bolshevism

398
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,711
as the most important task in Europe.

399
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:32,134
New was the point of European education

400
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,303
because we were of the opinion

401
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:40,308
that only an imaginary contrast

402
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,979
existed between the nations

403
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:48,859
who had the same
or were from the same origin, yes.

404
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,158
(narrator) For those of difterent
race origin, there was no place.

405
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,619
For the Jews there was deportation
to eastern ghettos

406
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,081
and then the gas chambers of the SS.

407
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,917
The ofticial word was "resettlement".

408
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:10,672
Most Germans preferred to believe
that it meant no more than that.

409
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:15,886
(Speer) Hitler often mentioned
that he is hating the Jews

410
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:21,725
and he gave many examples already
in an early time when l was with him,

411
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:27,314
and l should have been warned
that he is serious about it

412
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:32,027
because he proved to be serious
about other things he predicted too.

413
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,321
(speaks German)

414
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:41,286
(translator) One night, it must have
been around midnight, the doorbell rang.

415
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,497
l opened it and in front of me

416
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,874
there stood a Jewish couple.

417
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,961
This was how l began
to help persecuted Jews.

418
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,924
All of a sudden l'd entered
into an invisible circle

419
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,968
of people who smuggled Jews about.

420
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,138
As soon as one hiding place
had been detected,

421
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,140
they were quickly passed on.

422
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,143
They'd always move about at night.

423
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:09,064
That's how l came to belong to a group
who had to put up Jews

424
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,691
when they were passed on like this.

425
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:16,863
l've never found out who it was who'd
sent them to me in the first place.

426
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,491
Decent people, l'm sure.

427
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:23,411
The problems started
with the feeding of the Jewish people.

428
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:28,291
They neither had food rationing cards
nor did they have any money,

429
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,920
so we in our turn made use of friends

430
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,506
who exchanged
their cigarette ration cards

431
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,301
for the odd potato or some bread.

432
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:49,646
One day a friend of ours who used
to collect food cards for these Jews

433
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,569
came to me and she came
with another woman

434
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,280
with dyed blonde hair.

435
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:03,660
l can see her sitting there now
twisting her wedding ring

436
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:07,706
and telling me
that it wouldn't be for long,

437
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:13,587
that she would help me in the house
and her husband need never go out.

438
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,840
He could live in the cellar or wherever.

439
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:20,051
(narrator) But Christabel Bielenberg's
husband was away

440
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,971
and was involved
in a plot to overthrow Hitler.

441
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,892
She consulted her trusted neighbour
and friend Carl Langbehn,

442
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,393
another conspirator.

443
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,396
Langbehn told her
compassionately but firmly

444
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,652
that the risks to herself and her family
and to the conspiracy were too great.

445
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,031
l was astonished - overcome, really -

446
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,034
at the response
that l got from my neighbour

447
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:49,706
who told me that under no circumstances
whatsoever could l house these people,

448
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,709
that housing of Jews
meant concentration camp

449
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:57,756
not only for myself but for my husband,
possibly also for my children.

450
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,510
l can remember going through
and out into the road

451
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:08,892
and out of the darkness came a voice -
l knew there was somebody there -

452
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,061
came a voice saying:

453
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:15,190
"Frau Doktor... Frau Bielenberg,

454
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,525
haben Sie einen Schluss gefasst?"

455
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,528
which means, "Have you decided?"

456
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,617
And l simply couldn't say no.

457
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:31,748
l just said, "Well, l can't
for longer than two days."

458
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:40,382
And l let him into the cellar.

459
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,179
They stayed for two days

460
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:51,142
and on the second day

461
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,853
or rather in the evening,
they must have left

462
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,315
because in the morning she was gone,

463
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,526
the cellar was empty,

464
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,822
the little bed l'd put up
all tidily arranged

465
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,157
and they had gone.

466
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,746
l knew later that they were caught

467
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,458
buying a ticket at a railway station

468
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,670
and were transported to Auschwitz.

469
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,092
And why l say this is
the most painful and terrible story

470
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,677
for me to have to tell

471
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,471
is because after they left

472
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:34,644
l realised that Hitler
had turned me into a murderer.

473
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,233
One day in '44,

474
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,946
Gauleiter Hanke came in my oftice
and told me

475
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:50,869
that he was visiting
a concentration camp in Upper Silesia

476
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:55,915
and warned me never to go
in a concentration camp there

477
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,085
because horrible things would happen.

478
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,381
This together with other hints l got

479
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:09,095
should have made my decision

480
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,307
to go to Hitler immediately
or to Himmler

481
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,185
and to ask them what is going on

482
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,189
and to take my own steps.

483
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:24,944
But l didn't do it and not doing it
was, l think nowadays,

484
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,448
the biggest fault in my life.

485
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,077
We felt that people should know

486
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,704
what was going on,

487
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,749
and maybe typical
is this little experience

488
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,667
which l had one day

489
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,880
standing in the line for vegetables
or something like that.

490
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,258
l told my neighbours standing around me

491
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:53,264
that now they start to kill the Jews
in the concentration camps,

492
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,434
that it is not true
that they only are brought there

493
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,438
and can live there as they live here,
as it was told them.

494
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,567
They are killed
and they even make soap out of them.

495
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,737
l know that.

496
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:13,034
And they said, "Frau Bonhoefter, if you
don't stop telling such horror stories

497
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,996
you will end in a concentration camp too
and nobody of us can help you."

498
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,082
"lt's not true what you're telling."

499
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,878
"You shouldn't believe these things.
You heard them from foreign broadcasts."

500
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,799
"They tell these things
to make enemies against Germany."

501
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:32,762
l said, "No, that's not from broadcasts.
l know that directly from first hand."

502
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,974
"You can be sure it is that way."

503
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:39,978
And coming home
l told my husband in the evening

504
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:45,066
and he was not at all applauding to me -
on the very contrary.

505
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,820
He said, "My dear, sorry to say,

506
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:52,782
but you are absolutely idiotic,
what you are doing."

507
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,452
"Please understand,

508
00:40:55,536 --> 00:41:00,123
a dictatorship is like a snake."

509
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,209
"lf you put your foot on its tail,

510
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,046
as you do it, it will just bite you

511
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,049
and nobody will be helped."

512
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,093
"You have to strike the head."

513
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,681
(narrator)
Only the commanders of the army

514
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,100
could strike eftectively at the head.

515
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:23,229
Others had struck bravely
at the tail and perished.

516
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,858
ln Munich, a few students around
the Scholl brother and sister

517
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,736
had protested with leaflets
and been slaughtered.

518
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,988
ln Berlin a communist spy team

519
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:37,327
led by Harro Schulze-Boysen
and the Harnacks had been crushed.

520
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:41,039
Communists, socialists, Christians,
anonymous men and women

521
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,708
defied the dictator in tiny groups.

522
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:50,131
150,000 Germans suftered prison or worse
for political resistance.

523
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,134
The plot against the snake's head
was a federation.

524
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,055
There were conserVatives like Goerdeler,
aristocrats like Moltke,

525
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:01,476
churchmen like Bonhoefter,
diplomats like Trott.

526
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,939
Faced with defeat,
many staft ofticers joined in.

527
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,442
All were slow to accept
that to strike at the head

528
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,362
demanded the physical murder of Hitler.

529
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,783
But in 1944, there appeared
a man for action -

530
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,620
Colonel Count Claus von Stauftenberg.

531
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,498
(man) All the difterence was brought in,
of course,

532
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,500
when Stauftenberg came to Berlin.

533
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,586
He had lost his left eye,

534
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,505
his left hand,

535
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,757
or three fingers of his left hand,

536
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,635
and his right hand altogether.

537
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,264
Originally he was only
the planner of the coup d'état,

538
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,433
but he had to report
to Hitler's headquarters

539
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,435
and to attend conferences there.

540
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,273
This enabled him to get near to Hitler
and then to make an attempt,

541
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:51,234
which he did on July 20, '44.

542
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,403
(explosion)

543
00:42:54,363 --> 00:43:00,243
(Junge) Suddenly there was
a very alarming bang.

544
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,496
We heard voices crying for a doctor

545
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:08,876
and we saw some generals
with bloodstained uniforms.

546
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,838
Then came one of the adjutants

547
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:16,843
and said, "There was a bomb explosion,
but the Führer is not hurt."

548
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,886
"He's still alive."

549
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,181
We went towards Hitler's bunker

550
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,642
and we met him.

551
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:29,439
Maybe it was an hour
after this explosion.

552
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:33,818
He looked funny

553
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:39,949
because his hair stood up like a brush

554
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,620
and his trousers were slit

555
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,456
in small stripes.

556
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,253
He said, "You see,
fate has saved me for my mission."

557
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,632
"l am to do what l must do."

558
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,345
(narrator) At the War Ministry
in Berlin,

559
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:04,724
the plotting generals
believed that Hitler was dead.

560
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:09,771
(John) When l came to the headquarters,
Stauftenberg was busy with telephoning

561
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:14,984
the various army commands, and Haeften
informed me of what had happened,

562
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:20,031
how they'd thrown the bomb,
and then he said, "Hitler's dead."

563
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,159
We did believe it
because Stauftenberg then came in.

564
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,579
We had a short talk with him -
he was much too busy to give details.

565
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,499
He said, "Hitler's dead.
Leave everything alone."

566
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,334
"We'll see what can be done."

567
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:37,382
(narrator) The man the plotters ordered
to occupy the city was Major Otto Remer,

568
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:41,094
a fanatical soldier programmed
to obey any superior order.

569
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:46,182
At first he obeyed the plotters,
then Goebbels got hold of him.

570
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,309
(Remer speaks German)

571
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:58,152
(translator) Goebbels was really
very pleased to see me. He was beaming.

572
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,906
He said, "Remer,
what do you know about all this?"

573
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,827
"What's going on here?
What orders have you got?"

574
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:12,041
l said, "Minister, l have come to you
so that you can clarify the situation."

575
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,962
Goebbels replied, "They're trying
to pull the wool over your eyes."

576
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:20,049
"Hitler's alive.
l've just spoken to him."

577
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,887
l was so astonished that l said,
"Please, let me speak to the Führer,"

578
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,724
and this was done.

579
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:33,146
On the other end of the line Hitler
said, "Herr Remer, you see l am alive."

580
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,817
"l am Adolf Hitler.
You recognise my voice."

581
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,403
"Now do you believe l'm alive?"

582
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,959
(narrator) Now Remer was reprogrammed.

583
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,796
He marched back to the War Ministry
and arrested everyone he found.

584
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:04,427
The plot collapsed.
The wavering army returned to its oath.

585
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,180
(man) Der Angeklagte von Witzleben.

586
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,767
(narrator) Many of the plotters,
after prison and torture,

587
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,810
were to face a ghastly sham trial

588
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:18,524
conducted by Roland Freisler,
the star judge of Nazi Germany.

589
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:23,446
Their families were seized
and their children sent to orphanages.

590
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,491
The luckier conspirators,
among them Stauftenberg,

591
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,660
had been shot out of hand
in the War Ministry courtyard.

592
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,747
Some attempted
to explain their motives in court.

593
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,709
Count von Schwerin was an ofticer
who had serVed in Poland.

594
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:09,200
(judge)

595
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:25,299
(narrator) The condemned were hanged
slowly on meat hooks.

596
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,804
A film of their agony was made
and shown later to Hitler.

597
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:33,558
But the plot left Hitler
a frightened, damaged man.

598
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:38,729
The repression after 20 July
broke the power of the aristocracy

599
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,607
and of the Prussian tradition forever.

600
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,945
But there was no ruling class
to take their place.

601
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,951
To Hitler, all generals
now seemed suspect.

602
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:57,123
Only Goebbels, Bormann and Himmler
could get close to him.

603
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:08,301
(Junge) Slowly but steadily
he became weak.

604
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:14,348
The doctors went in and out
and he became totally apathetic.

605
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,934
Not interested in anything.

606
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:22,106
lt was a very critical situation
on the West Front

607
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,483
and on the East Front, too.

608
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:31,866
And some days
it was like Hitler didn't exist.

609
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:37,330
He was deteriorating suddenly
in his health,

610
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,082
but l wouldn't go so far as to say

611
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:44,170
that he was no more responsible
for what he was doing.

612
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,840
ln some ways he was...

613
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,593
l have the experience
of a prisoner of 20 years.

614
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,387
ln some ways he was behaving
like a prisoner.

615
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:08,486
(narrator) Through the devastation
the Germans somehow kept going.

616
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,408
Down ruined streets, the workers
made their way to ruined factories

617
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,620
where a few machines
could still be made to turn.

618
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,259
Life retreated to the cellars.

619
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:38,557
People learned that eight bombs fell
in a row and then you were safe.

620
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,644
They learned to live a day at a time.

621
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,953
(Tucking) lt was really dreadful
to endure it.

622
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,164
We were so tired.

623
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,625
You were always in a hurry.

624
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:10,881
All the railways were destroyed
and the lorries had no petrol.

625
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,135
We had rations from the beginning

626
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,431
and step by step it was worse and worse.

627
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:23,769
(narrator) Germany itself
was near the end of its tether.

628
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,982
Seven million foreign forced labourers
were not enough.

629
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:32,695
Everything - oil, metal, food -
was running out.

630
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:38,117
Everything from clothes to planes
was patched and made to serVe again.

631
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,286
Men, too.

632
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,751
The war cripples were recycled
for the factories.

633
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,463
The brain-damaged soldiers
were taught to speak again.

634
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,091
Nun wollen wir einmal das hauchen.

635
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,553
Was ist das für ein Laut?

636
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,846
A.

637
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:04,560
Hauchen wir das A, dann heißt es?

638
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,103
Ha.

639
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:10,357
Nun werde ich Ihnen
dieses Buch hier zeigen.

640
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,944
Was sollen wir hauchen?

641
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,114
Ha, ha, ha.

642
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,242
- Schnell hintereinander.
- Ha, ha, ha.

643
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,915
(narrator) Now the enemy was approaching
the very frontiers of the Reich.

644
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,000
The Volkssturm, the home guard

645
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:32,546
of the elderly, the underaged
and the unfit, was sworn in.

646
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,438
(men repeat oath)

647
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:17,091
Männer des Berliner Volkssturms,
ihr habt soeben...

648
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:21,011
(narrator) They listened with
closed faces to oratory from Goebbels

649
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,014
about fighting to the bitter end.

650
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:31,397
(Goebbels) ..wehrbereiter
und wehrentschlossener Männer verfügt,

651
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:36,777
die den festen und unerschütterlichen
Willen haben...

652
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:12,188
(narrator) The Volkssturm trudged out
through that same Brandenburg Gate

653
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:16,025
which had seen the soldiers march
back from Paris four years before.

654
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,534
They went towards the Russians,

655
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,996
keeping their thoughts to themselves.
