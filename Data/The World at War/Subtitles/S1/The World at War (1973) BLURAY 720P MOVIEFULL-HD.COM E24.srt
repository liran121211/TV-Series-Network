1
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,102
(narrator) North Field, on the island
of Tinian, in the Marianas,

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,438
1500 miles south of Japan.

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,864
ln the summer of 1945 this was
the biggest air base in the world.

4
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,950
Here, on August 5,

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,787
the world's first uranium bomb
was loaded into a B-29 bomber -

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:43,042
named Enola Gay
after its pilot's mother.

7
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,464
Next morning, before dawn,
the Enola Gay took off.

8
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,050
lts target - Hiroshima.

9
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,494
On April 12, 1945,

10
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:06,125
Franklin Roosevelt, President
of the United States, died suddenly.

11
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,547
The nation mourned its lost leader.

12
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,890
He had brought them from the depths
of economic depression 12 years before,

13
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,478
now he had led them
to the eve of victory in a world war.

14
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,360
Two months before his death,
Roosevelt had been at Yalta, in Russia,

15
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,239
laying the political foundations
of the post-war world.

16
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,660
Roosevelt and Churchill wanted
to restore democracy to Eastern Europe,

17
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,912
particularly Poland.

18
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,584
They also asked Stalin to confirm that
Russia would join the war against Japan

19
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,920
three months
after the defeat of Germany.

20
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,047
ln a cheerful atmosphere,

21
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,552
the "big three" thought
they had reached agreement.

22
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,055
(man) Yalta was really
the high point of the relationship

23
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,724
between the three men.

24
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,519
Victory was in the air,
the Germans were in retreat,

25
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,814
and so there was a good deal more talk,

26
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,068
in addition to military matters,
of the future.

27
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,321
Poland again became

28
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,074
the most troublesome point.

29
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,118
And it's interesting that

30
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,078
both Roosevelt and Churchill

31
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,623
felt they had an agreement with Stalin.

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,669
(narrator) The problem with Poland -
as with all Eastern Europe -

33
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:37,049
was that the Western leaders wanted
a freely elected government there.

34
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,553
The Soviets wanted a government
friendly to Russia.

35
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,849
They thought the West
understood and accepted this.

36
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:51,855
Poland, from their point of view, was
not going to be an outpost of the West -

37
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,192
nor any of the Balkan countries.

38
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,237
They thought they'd had
various agreements

39
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,782
about spheres of influence
with Mr Churchill -

40
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,702
if they left Greece
pretty much in British hands,

41
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,580
they could have certain
proportional influences

42
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,085
in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria,
particularly Poland.

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,174
My impression at Yalta

44
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,345
was that the Russians thought

45
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:28,308
we had in substance
accepted that demand.

46
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,438
(narrator) After Yalta,
Roosevelt lived for only two months.

47
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,609
Even by then, he and Churchill
had become disillusioned

48
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:42,239
by the interpretations the Russians
were putting on what was agreed there.

49
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,201
The very, very tough exchange
of telegrams on both sides

50
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,120
between Stalin and Roosevelt

51
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,248
makes it very plain
that Roosevelt, before he died,

52
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,750
knew that Stalin
was breaking his agreements.

53
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,129
l think it went sour because

54
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,589
the military developments

55
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,009
strengthened Russia's hands

56
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,596
and that where
the Russians had felt it necessary

57
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,267
to be considerate of Western opinion
at Yalta,

58
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,520
a few months later
they didn't feel any such necessity

59
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,189
because the war was going so well
for them,

60
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,610
and therefore they swept aside
some of the engagements they'd got into.

61
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,323
That certainly applied
particularly about Poland.

62
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,910
(narrator) Roosevelt had been seen
as a friend by the Russians.

63
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,955
His successor, Harry Truman,
was an unknown quantity -

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,541
both to them and to his own advisers.

65
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:41,173
l left, as soon as Roosevelt died,
to go back to see Mr Truman.

66
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,550
l wanted to be sure
that President Truman

67
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,386
understood the position
of our relationships,

68
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,182
because there had been
so much euphoria in the air

69
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:56,480
about the warm relationships
that existed with our gallant allies.

70
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:02,819
And l got home within a week
of the time Roosevelt had died.

71
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,948
l found, my first experience
with President Truman,

72
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,284
l found he was an avid reader.

73
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,371
l found he'd read all the telegrams

74
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:17,501
and understood from those messages
the difticulties we were going to have.

75
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,172
(narrator) The arrival
of their foreign minister, Molotov,

76
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,802
in Washington on April 23 gave Truman
a chance to prove, as he put it,

77
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,262
that he would
"stand up to the Russians".

78
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,308
(newsreel) Even as his arrival raised
hopes on the thorny Polish question,

79
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,312
the world learned that Russia had
signed a 20-year pact of friendship

80
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,272
with Poland's Warsaw government.

81
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,359
This Polish government
had no pro-Western members.

82
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,985
They were all pro-Soviet.

83
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,823
The Western leaders
were angry and upset.

84
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:52,869
Molotov saw Truman and his secretary of
state, Stettinius - Alger Hiss's boss.

85
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,205
By that time...

86
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:02,129
the Polish situation
had, to use a gentle word, crystallised.

87
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,048
The Russians were moving forward.

88
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:11,138
They seemed to be paying no attention
to the kind of provisional government

89
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,976
that the British and Americans
had hoped for.

90
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:25,277
Therefore protests - angry protests -
were going to the Russians about that.

91
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:30,824
And Truman decided to have a showdown,
at which he was gifted.

92
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:37,747
On that occasion, as you know from
what is now part of the history books,

93
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,252
he accused Molotov, in eftect,

94
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,212
of violation of the agreements,

95
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,547
as early as that.

96
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:50,093
This was a strange thing to do in
the midst of a war, by no means yet won,

97
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,472
with an important ally - but he did it.

98
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,101
And it ended by Molotov saying:

99
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,812
"l've never been talked to like this
in my life",

100
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,649
and Truman saying: "Well, keep
your agreements and you won't be" -

101
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,152
just like a schoolteacher.

102
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:12,616
Stettinius, who'd been present, told me
the next morning - he was still shaken -

103
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,619
he said, "l thought
the whole conference was oft."

104
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,831
Well, that was
an unfortunate conversation.

105
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:25,462
lt was one of the first diplomatic
conversations that Truman had,

106
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:32,385
and l can only say that it was not
a diplomatic statement on Truman's part.

107
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,848
He used good, solid Missouri language,
which was very definite,

108
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,310
and Molotov had talked
to other people that way,

109
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,355
but had had no one
talk to him that way.

110
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,273
So he was very much upset,

111
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:50,070
and l gained the impression that
he thought this was a new voice,

112
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:54,783
not Roosevelt any more,
but a more aggressive president.

113
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,702
(narrator) When he was sworn in,

114
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,872
Truman had said he would continue
Roosevelt's policies.

115
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,999
But his sudden harshness with Molotov

116
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,752
now worried the secretary of war,
Henry Stimson.

117
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,629
The day after the confrontation,

118
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,174
Stimson told Truman about something
he thought could transform

119
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,093
America's dealings with Russia.

120
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,388
Stimson's biographer, McGeorge Bundy.

121
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,516
Stimson wrote to Truman,

122
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,936
"l think it is very important
that l should have a talk with you

123
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,982
as soon as possible
on a highly secret matter."

124
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,235
"l mentioned it to you
shortly after you took oftice,

125
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,990
but have not urged it since on account
of the pressure you've been under."

126
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,244
"lt, however, has such a bearing
on our present foreign relations

127
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:44,416
and has such an important eftect
upon all my thinking in this field,

128
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,838
that l think you ought to know about it
without much further delay."

129
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:56,052
The next day, April 25,
Stimson explained to Truman

130
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,347
that his view of foreign policy -
Stimson's -

131
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:04,686
was dominated by
the imminent prospect of atomic power,

132
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,856
and the terms which might be got
from Russia

133
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,900
in exchange for sharing atomic secrets.

134
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,447
(narrator) lt was Truman's first
detailed news of the atomic bomb

135
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,116
and its diplomatic potential.

136
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,203
He asked Stimson to head a committee
to decide its military use.

137
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,293
By this time, in great secrecy, two
kinds of atomic bomb had been developed,

138
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:34,341
one based on uranium, the other
on a man-made element, plutonium.

139
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,179
The uranium bomb did not need testing -
but there was only one.

140
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,349
The plutonium bombs -
easier to produce in quantity -

141
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,517
would have to be tested before use.

142
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,145
The first would be ready by July.

143
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,023
A special unit
of the American Air Force

144
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,484
had begun practising
the tactics involved

145
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,112
in dropping one very large bomb,
with great accuracy,

146
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,323
then getting away as fast as possible.

147
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:02,369
lts commander was Colonel Paul Tibbets.

148
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,953
(Tibbets) Up to this point,

149
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,792
anything in the way of an error
in bombing up to 500 or 600 feet

150
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,086
was considered good bombing.

151
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,964
So l told them then: "lf you have
a 100-foot error from 25,000 feet,

152
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,883
you're just a borderline case."

153
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,260
"l want it less than 100."

154
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,347
l was told immediately,
"You can't do this."

155
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,518
So l said, "l don't know why not."
They said, "Nobody's ever done it."

156
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,104
l said, "That's no reason
why it can't be done."

157
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,773
"Practice, they tell me, makes perfect."

158
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,859
"So we'll practise and you'll practise
until you do it."

159
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,580
(narrator) From their forward bases
in the Mariana lslands,

160
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,084
American B-29 bombers
were already attacking Japan's cities

161
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,294
with more conventional weapons.

162
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,589
To begin with, the results were poor.

163
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:05,473
General Curtis LeMay developed a new
tactic: low-level incendiary raids.

164
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,729
(LeMay) With aerial photography
you could outline a general area,

165
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,606
but not precisely.

166
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,402
You just couldn't avoid
doing collateral damage,

167
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,281
and l'm sure we burned down
a lot of Japanese buildings

168
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:27,203
that had nothing to do
with the war industry at all.

169
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,585
This, of course, is one of the sad
things of war that can't be helped.

170
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,799
(narrator) On March 9, 1945, 2,000 tons
of incendiaries were dropped on Tokyo,

171
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,844
destroying 16 square miles of the city.

172
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,431
80,000 civilians died -

173
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,935
more that night in Tokyo than
in the whole of England in the Blitz.

174
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,439
Most suftocated in the firestorm.

175
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,483
LeMay now attacked city after city.

176
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,153
lt looked as if the B-29s alone
might defeat Japan.

177
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,948
(LeMay) lt wasn't until
General Arnold asked the direct question

178
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,742
"How long will the war last?",

179
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,953
and then we sat down
and did some thinking about it,

180
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,958
and it indicated that we would be

181
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,587
pretty much out of targets
around 1 September,

182
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,672
and with the targets gone,

183
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:24,594
we couldn't see much of any war
going on at the time.

184
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,687
(narrator) By the spring of 1945

185
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:39,692
Japan was helpless in the face
of American air and naval power.

186
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,031
Most of the Japanese merchant fleet
and navy had been sunk.

187
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:51,329
An eftective blockade had cut oft Japan
from her overseas army,

188
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,207
grounded most of her air force
for lack of fuel,

189
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,627
and threatened her population
with starVation.

190
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:03,800
American fighter-bombers roamed at will,
backing up the devastating fire raids.

191
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,804
Many Japanese politicians realised

192
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,766
that their country
could not hold out much longer.

193
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,774
April 1 : American troops
land on Japanese soil -

194
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,195
Okinawa, only 350 miles
from the mainland.

195
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,865
They face fierce resistance.

196
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,452
But as the battle starts,
the growing peace party in Japan

197
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:36,583
secure the appointment of a new cabinet,
led by Admiral Suzuki.

198
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:42,255
When the Suzuki cabinet
came into existence,

199
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,676
the military situation was deplorable,

200
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:54,350
and, moreover, the economic plight
of our nation was quite apparent.

201
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,769
The military command...

202
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:05,695
tried to squeeze the last drop,
so to speak, of the nation's blood,

203
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,450
in order to prosecute harder
the useless war,

204
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:15,788
but it became evident
to any sensible man

205
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,584
that we were at the end of our tether.

206
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,879
(speaks Japanese)

207
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:28,343
(translator) The younger ofticers
in the army, the extremists,

208
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,512
thought that we should fight
to the bitter end,

209
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,765
until every man had been killed.

210
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:39,103
But the war minister, General Anami,
didn't agree.

211
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,691
He thought that if we fought on
until the Americans invaded the mainland

212
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,320
and then hit their forces hard
on the beaches once,

213
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:52,825
we could then negotiate peace
on terms more favourable to Japan.

214
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,831
(narrator)
But Truman would not negotiate.

215
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,085
He told Congress so in May,
after Germany's defeat.

216
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:08,883
(newsreel) Our demand has been,
and it remains, unconditional surrender.

217
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,390
l want the entire world to know

218
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:22,981
that this direction must and will remain
unchanged and unhampered.

219
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,529
(narrator) Truman now faced
two major problems:

220
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,990
how to deal with the Russians in Europe,

221
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:36,661
and whether to ask them to fulfil their
pledge to join the war against Japan.

222
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:41,624
ln Germany, Russian and Western troops
exchanged toasts,

223
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,044
but already Churchill was sending
urgent messages to Truman

224
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,715
warning that an iron curtain was being
drawn down in Europe by Russia.

225
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,676
The "big three"
must meet quickly before, as he put it,

226
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,429
"the armies of democracy melted".

227
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,434
And Truman had a new secretary of state,
James Byrnes.

228
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,145
Byrnes wanted to finish the war
against Japan

229
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,147
before the Russians could join in

230
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,483
and cause problems
for the West in Asia, too.

231
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,195
lt was ever-present in my mind

232
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,075
that it was important

233
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,665
that we should have an end to the war
before the Russians came in.

234
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,834
(narrator) But Stimson wanted to avoid

235
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,086
hasty decisions in Europe
or the Far East

236
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,298
before the bomb was ready.
He wrote to Truman:

237
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,634
"Over any such tangled weave
of problems,

238
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,638
the atomic secret would be dominant."

239
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:43,102
"lt seems a terrible thing to gamble
with such big stakes in diplomacy

240
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,065
without having your master card
in your hand."

241
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,526
Truman reassured Stimson -

242
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:55,615
the "big three" meeting was postponed
until July 15

243
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,201
on purpose "to give us more time".

244
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,205
(narrator) Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's
close friend whom Stalin trusted,

245
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,539
was sent to Moscow in May

246
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,293
to take the heat temporarily
out of the Polish issue.

247
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,838
He reported back
that he had smoothed things over.

248
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,008
Stalin had also promised - unprompted -

249
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,803
to join the war against Japan
on August 8.

250
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,138
While Hopkins was in Moscow,

251
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,934
Stimson's committee
reached its decision.

252
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,645
The committee studying the atomic bomb

253
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:32,026
unanimously recommended that it be used
as soon as possible, without warning,

254
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,030
against a major
Japanese military establishment.

255
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,908
Only this, Stimson thought,

256
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:44,288
would provide the psychological blow
which might induce Japan to surrender.

257
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,458
Although he agreed
with some of Truman's advisers

258
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,044
that the Japanese
should be given an ultimatum

259
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,548
which made it clear
they could keep the emperor,

260
00:18:53,632 --> 00:19:00,263
he opposed announcing this until
after the bomb had at least been tested.

261
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,223
But after the war he wrote,

262
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,602
"lt is possible,
in the light of the final surrender,

263
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,231
that a clearer and earlier exposition

264
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,943
of American willingness
to retain the emperor

265
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,572
could have produced
an earlier ending of the war."

266
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,784
(narrator) June 18: Washington.

267
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:27,123
General Eisenhower is given a hero's
welcome after his victory in Europe.

268
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,292
ln the White House that day,

269
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,753
Truman is asked to approve
his joint chiefs of staft's plans

270
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,964
to invade Japan in November.

271
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,301
We gathered up our papers
and started to go out,

272
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,636
and Mr Truman spotted me and said:

273
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,763
"Mr McCloy, nobody gets out of this room

274
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,765
without expressing himself -

275
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,142
everybody else has."

276
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,019
"Do you think l have

277
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,479
any other alternative?"

278
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:55,193
l looked over at Colonel Stimson -
he liked to be called Colonel -

279
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,112
he'd been colonel of a regiment
in World War l,

280
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,114
rather than Secretary -

281
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,076
l looked over at Stimson
and he nodded, he said, "Go ahead."

282
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,830
So l started in,
and l said that l thought that

283
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,916
we ought to have our heads examined

284
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,463
if we didn't begin to think in terms
of a political culmination of the war

285
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,215
rather than a military one.

286
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,761
And l said l'd give them some terms -

287
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,389
l'd send a message over to them,
l'd spell out the terms.

288
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,810
And Mr Truman said, "Well, what
are your terms? What would you do?"

289
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,730
l hadn't quite prepared for
the actual dictation

290
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,899
of the surrender terms at that point,

291
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,068
but l started in and l said,

292
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,987
"ln the first place,
l'd say you can have the mikado,

293
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,448
but he's got to be
a constitutional monarch -

294
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,660
you've got to have a representative
form of government."

295
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:51,040
"You can have access to, but
not control over, foreign raw materials

296
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,794
so you can have a viable economy..."
l spelled it out as best l could.

297
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,713
"And l'd say,
'Besides that, we've got a new force,

298
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:03,594
and it's in the form
of a new type of energy

299
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,055
that will revolutionise warfare,

300
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,726
destructive beyond any contemplation."
l said l'd mention the bomb.

301
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,815
Well, mentioning the bomb, even
at that late date, in that select group,

302
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,608
it was like they were all shocked

303
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,820
because it was
such a closely guarded secret.

304
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,782
lt was comparable
to mentioning Skull and Bones at Yale,

305
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,368
which you're not supposed to do.

306
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,914
But Mr Truman said, "This is the sort
of thing l was trying to reach for -

307
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,791
get that all spelled out."

308
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,878
At that point Stimson did come in
and joined in support of my position,

309
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,340
but then later on Mr Byrnes,
who was then secretary of state,

310
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,384
who was not present,

311
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,055
vetoed the idea
of oftering them the mikado.

312
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,144
One can only speculate
as to what would have happened

313
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,856
if we had put the message
to the Japanese

314
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,650
in the form that l indicated,
including the mikado.

315
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:04,488
l always had the feeling, in view of
some of the information we've had since

316
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:11,662
of the tendency on the part of some
of the real military hotheads in Japan,

317
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,498
to think that this was perhaps
the best way out,

318
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:19,128
that we might have been able
to avoid the dropping of the bomb.

319
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:24,050
(narrator) By this time,
the battle for Okinawa is almost over.

320
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,260
12,000 Americans had died,

321
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,931
a bloody foretaste of what invasion
of the mainland might cost.

322
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,102
For the Japanese,
the lesson was harsher still.

323
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,940
100,000 died,

324
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:45,946
and, for the first time in the war,
their soldiers surrendered in thousands.

325
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,745
As the last resistance ended,
on June 22,

326
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:57,583
the new Japanese cabinet
made its first move towards peace.

327
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,837
Ultimately,
we had to conduct negotiations

328
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,298
with our military opponents -

329
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,259
that is to say, America and Britain -

330
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,764
but the high command
refused categorically

331
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,851
to entertain any idea of

332
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:20,189
starting conversations
with the enemy powers.

333
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:27,613
The only great power left out
of the enemy camp was the Soviet Union,

334
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,991
because of the fact that nominally

335
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:35,913
there existed still the neutrality pact,

336
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:43,879
and so this was the only window open
for peace endeavours -

337
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,675
and this window looked
towards the north.

338
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,888
And so we argued it out
with the military command,

339
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:58,310
and the military command
finally, reluctantly,

340
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:03,899
acceded to our request that we start
negotiations with the Soviet Union

341
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:09,780
in order to arrive
at the final destination,

342
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,741
which was Washington and London.

343
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,662
(narrator) But it was the Chinese
foreign minister, not the Japanese,

344
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,582
that Stalin had been meeting.

345
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:25,921
A huge Japanese army still occupied
parts of China, including Manchuria.

346
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,049
The Russians and Chinese
were negotiating terms

347
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,428
under which
Stalin would attack that army.

348
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,682
When Truman sailed to Europe on July 7
to meet Stalin and Churchill,

349
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:41,645
he knew, through intercepted messages,
that Japan wanted an end to the war,

350
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,357
but not unconditional surrender.

351
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,778
Truman and Byrnes
now had several options open to them -

352
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,490
they could modify the surrender terms,

353
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,868
they could encourage the Russians
to invade Manchuria,

354
00:24:55,952 --> 00:25:01,332
they could demonstrate the atomic bomb,
they could invade Japan itself.

355
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,714
But Truman decided that he would drop
atomic bombs on Japan without warning.

356
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,468
This alone, he hoped,
would end the Pacific war quickly,

357
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,595
before the Russians joined in.

358
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,266
And it would immensely strengthen
American bargaining power in Europe.

359
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,352
The decision had already been taken

360
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,272
when Truman arrived
for the "big three" meeting on July 15.

361
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:33,614
The next morning, just before dawn,
at a remote desert site in New Mexico,

362
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,909
Robert Oppenheimer and the team
that had built the bomb

363
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,955
witnessed the first atomic explosion.

364
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,959
(Oppenheimer) l remembered
the line from the Hindu scripture,

365
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,585
the Bhagavad-Gita:

366
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:52,841
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince

367
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,804
that he should do his duty,

368
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,723
and to impress him

369
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,310
takes on his multi-armed form

370
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,147
and says, "Now l am become death,

371
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,525
the destroyer of worlds."

372
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,989
l suppose we all thought that,
one way or another.

373
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:21,954
(narrator) The plutonium bomb exploded
with a force of 20,000 tons of TNT.

374
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,876
The desert at the point of the explosion
was turned into glass.

375
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:32,339
By July 1945
Japan's economy was crumbling

376
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,093
and her cities were defenceless
against the B-29 raids.

377
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,804
Although her army
remained virtually intact,

378
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,890
Japan's war industries were smashed.

379
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,230
One million civilians had died.

380
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,526
Millions more were homeless.

381
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:57,740
The US Air Force had no doubts
that surrender was only weeks away.

382
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,243
(LeMay)
lt was a hopeless situation for 'em.

383
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:07,708
The B-29s were flying over Japan at will
and they couldn't do anything about it.

384
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:14,048
We could destroy any target at will
without much opposition.

385
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,843
So with this hopeless situation
they were facing,

386
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:22,306
they just didn't have the will
to continue.

387
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,975
ln fact, they'd been trying
to get out of the war

388
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,396
for about three months
before they actually did.

389
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,275
They'd asked the Russians
to be an intermediary,

390
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,904
to try to negotiate them out of the war,

391
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:43,160
and the Russians had been stalling till
they'd got the European war finished

392
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:49,833
so they could get into the Pacific war
before it ended.

393
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:56,090
(narrator) Stalin and Molotov
refused to see the Japanese ambassador

394
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:01,220
before they left Moscow for the last
"big three" meeting for ten years.

395
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,641
Also at Potsdam
was Secretary of War Stimson.

396
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,728
He passed on detailed news of
the atomic test to Truman and Byrnes -

397
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,190
who, he noted in his diary,
were immensely pleased.

398
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,402
"The president
was tremendously pepped up by it

399
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:20,030
and spoke to me of it again and again
when l saw him."

400
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:24,785
"He said it gave him
an entirely new feeling of confidence."

401
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,872
And when Stimson told Churchill
about the successful test the next day,

402
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,458
Churchill said he now understood

403
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,003
how this pepping-up of Truman
had taken place

404
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,381
and that he felt the same way.

405
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,925
(narrator)
The British and Americans debated

406
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,636
whether to tell the Russians
about the bomb.

407
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,848
Some argued that its full weight
as a diplomatic lever

408
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:50,519
would only become evident
after it had been dropped on Japan.

409
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,106
After one of our meetings,
just as we adjourned,

410
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,901
Truman went up
with his interpreter to Stalin

411
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,697
and told him briefly

412
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,741
what we had discovered

413
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,952
and what the eftect
of the atomic bomb would be.

414
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:11,957
And all Stalin did was to nod his head
and say "Thank you" quite curtly,

415
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,794
and his expression changed in no way
and that was all there was to it.

416
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,091
(McCloy)
lt was a tremendous disappointment.

417
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:25,971
We thought he would be flabbergasted
at this thing but he just passed it oft.

418
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,431
Whether he knew about it,

419
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:33,562
whether he didn't want to show
any great emotion in regard to it,

420
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,314
l don't know.

421
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,318
All l know is that he took it
very much in his stride

422
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:45,699
and, somewhat to our disappointment,
went on to the next item in the agenda.

423
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:51,455
And this rather dismayed Stimson

424
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,040
because he thought that,

425
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,875
once having disclosed this,

426
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,421
there would be immediately
a great rush on the part of the Soviets

427
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,131
to sit down and talk to us

428
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,593
about the future implications
of this thing

429
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,845
and what the future uses of it would be.

430
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,223
But he got no encouragement at all.

431
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,394
(narrator) Stimson's tactics had
misfired - the "big three" had met

432
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,898
before the full power
of the atomic weapon was revealed.

433
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,235
Stimson feared that from now on,
Secretary of State Byrnes

434
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,739
would use the bomb to try to lever
direct concessions from the Russians.

435
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:30,118
l rather think that Mr Byrnes
had something of the thought

436
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:34,248
that this would be a sort of

437
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,293
point of leverage
in diplomatic exchanges,

438
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,130
whereas l think Mr Stimson -
or Colonel Stimson -

439
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,301
had a difterent idea
of the use of the bomb.

440
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,136
(Bundy) He wrote to the president

441
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,682
to urge direct negotiation
on the nuclear issue,

442
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:59,398
and argued that relations with Russia
"may perhaps be irretrievably embittered

443
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:05,821
by the way in which we approach
the solution of the bomb with Russia."

444
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,116
"For if we fail to approach them now

445
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,201
and merely negotiate with them

446
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:15,622
having this weapon
rather ostentatiously on our hip,

447
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:23,463
their suspicions and their distrust of
our purposes and motives will increase."

448
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,050
(narrator) With the atomic weapons
now almost ready for use,

449
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,888
it was time for Truman to issue
a final ultimatum to the Japanese -

450
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,099
and again Stimson's advice was rejected.

451
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:38,854
Truman and Byrnes decided not to modify
the unconditional-surrender formula

452
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,482
by oftering the Japanese
the chance to keep their emperor.

453
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:47,738
My hope is that
the people of Japan will now realise

454
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,825
that further resistance
to the forces of the nations

455
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,579
now united
in the enforcement of law and justice

456
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,956
will be absolutely futile.

457
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,752
There is still time -
but little time -

458
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,546
for the Japanese to save themselves

459
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,925
from the destruction
which threatens them.

460
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:15,557
The very purpose of it was to assure
them that they would have the decision,

461
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,602
and at the same time

462
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:24,358
not to start a controversy
among ourselves

463
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,611
about the position of the emperor.

464
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,324
When the Potsdam proclamation
was issued,

465
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:41,333
Foreign Minister Togo and l
worked together many sleepless nights,

466
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:46,713
and l took this proclamation
to the attention of the foreign minister

467
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,759
and explained the substance of it.

468
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:55,472
Togo at once said this was acceptable,

469
00:32:55,556 --> 00:33:01,311
and he immediately went to the palace
and asked for an audience.

470
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:08,151
The emperor approved Togo's judgement
that this should be accepted

471
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,405
and the war be terminated at once.

472
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,075
(Japanese man) Foreign Minister Togo
said in the cabinet meeting

473
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,663
that we can stop the war
without the question of the emperor.

474
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,416
We can keep the emperor all right.

475
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,918
But at that time we -

476
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,461
the Japanese government -

477
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:31,550
asked some... intermediate...

478
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,593
mediation... Mediation?

479
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,596
..mediation to the Russians,

480
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,641
so many cabinet ministers said,

481
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,478
"Well, let us see the situation
for a while."

482
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,231
(narrator) Prime Minister Suzuki
announced

483
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,234
that Japan would ignore
the ultimatum.

484
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,446
Perhaps Russia
would save Japan's honour.

485
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,658
After all, the Potsdam Declaration
had not been signed by Stalin -

486
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,618
he might still mediate.

487
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,372
Stalin told Truman
about the Japanese approaches.

488
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:07,002
Truman knew all about them -
the Japanese codes had been broken.

489
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,547
Both leaders agreed to ignore
the peace feelers

490
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:14,217
and Truman sailed home on August 3.

491
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,637
With no response from the Japanese,
he authorised the Air Force

492
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,975
to drop the atom bomb
as soon as they were ready.

493
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,144
The Japanese foreign minister, Togo,

494
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,481
in desperation
cabled his ambassador in Moscow:

495
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,276
"Since the loss of one day
relative to this present matter

496
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,362
may result
in a thousand years of regret,

497
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:38,200
it is requested you immediately
have a talk with Molotov."

498
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,370
But Molotov
would still not meet the ambassador.

499
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,372
On August 6,

500
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,085
two days before the Russians had said
they would attack the Japanese,

501
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:53,048
the Enola Gay set off
on its 1500-mile journey.

502
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:58,470
l noticed as l taxied out
that there were several hundred people

503
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,848
that were in the area
the aircraft were parked in,

504
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,268
there were some
in front of the control tower...

505
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,897
People were out there
to see what was going on

506
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,691
without really knowing
what they were looking at,

507
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,527
but it was something difterent,

508
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,489
so they wanted to be part of it,
wanted to see what was taking place.

509
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,909
There's one bomb and one aeroplane
was going to carry that bomb,

510
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:25,705
and that's the group commander,
Colonel Tibbets, with his full crew.

511
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,916
My crew was assigned

512
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,168
to fly in formation on his right wing

513
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,419
during the bombing,

514
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,838
for a couple of reasons -

515
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,381
somebody had to fly there

516
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,135
and l was scheduled by him
to fly the second mission,

517
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,638
if there were to be a second mission.

518
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,933
We were to have a third aircraft
flying on the left wing

519
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,477
who would drop back
just before the bombing -

520
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,271
he was equipped with cameras.

521
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:54,151
We were to fly unseen by each other
for the first three hours

522
00:35:54,235 --> 00:36:01,116
and to make rendezvous at 8,000 feet
over lwo Jima at 6am.

523
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,493
This was the plan.

524
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,956
We made the rendezvous successfully,
then we had about an hour and a half

525
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,044
to go along in a lazy formation on
a beautiful night out over the Pacific,

526
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,464
with moons and cloud pufts
that looked like powder pufts -

527
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:20,093
it was a quiet, peaceful evening,
believe me.

528
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,306
Nothing much went on -
a little bit of talk in the aeroplane,

529
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,225
but that's always normal on a mission -

530
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,644
but then you'd get a quiet period,

531
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:34,566
and l guess everybody was dreaming
or something, because it was quiet.

532
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,155
(narrator)
At 8:15 on the morning of August 6,

533
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:46,745
the Enola Gay, flying at 32,000 feet,
released its bomb over Hiroshima.

534
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,998
(Tibbets) As soon as
the weight had left the aeroplane

535
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,334
l immediately went into this steep turn,

536
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,212
as did Sweeney and Marquart behind me,

537
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,298
and we tried then to place distance

538
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,884
between ourselves
and the point of impact.

539
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,638
ln this particular case,
that bomb had 53 seconds

540
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,766
from the time it left the aeroplane
until it exploded.

541
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,395
That's how long it took to fall
from the bombing altitude - 53 seconds.

542
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,566
And this gave us adequate time,
of course, to make the turn.

543
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:21,821
Now, we had just made the turn
and rolled out in level flight

544
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:26,159
when it seemed like somebody
had grabbed hold of my aeroplane

545
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,036
and gave it a real hard shaking,

546
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,998
because this was the shock wave
that had come up.

547
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,050
This was something
that l was glad to feel

548
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,761
because it gave me a moment of relief -

549
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:49,266
after all, having worked on that bomb
for well over a year,

550
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,227
that 53 seconds
while l'm turning the aeroplane

551
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,480
l'm wondering
"ls it or is it not going to work?"

552
00:37:55,564 --> 00:38:01,111
And, of course, the shock wave
hitting us was indication it had worked.

553
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,990
Therefore l felt that success
had been achieved.

554
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:09,035
When the bomb came
l saw a yellowish flash

555
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,997
and l was buried in the darkness.

556
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:17,711
The two-storeyed wooden building that
was my house, with eight rooms in it,

557
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,464
was blown down to pieces
and covered me up.

558
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,342
(speaks Japanese)

559
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,845
(translator)
When l regained consciousness

560
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,056
everything was pitch dark all around me.

561
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,643
l tried to stand up,
but my leg was broken.

562
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,107
l tried to speak and l found
that six of my teeth had been broken.

563
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:43,069
Then l realised that my face was burnt
and my back was burnt.

564
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:48,491
There was a slash right across
from one shoulder down to the waist.

565
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,412
l crawled to the river bank
and when l got there

566
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,916
l saw hundreds of bodies
come floating down the river.

567
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:03,882
And it was then that l realised with
a shock that all Hiroshima had been hit.

568
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,554
The day was clear

569
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,181
when we dropped that bomb -

570
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,601
it was a clear sunshiny day
and visibility was unrestricted -

571
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,936
so as we came back around,

572
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,815
again facing the direction of Hiroshima,

573
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,235
we saw this cloud coming up.

574
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,907
The cloud by this time - now two minutes
- the cloud was up at our altitude.

575
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,909
We were at 33,000 feet at this time,

576
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,410
and the cloud was up there

577
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,539
and continuing to go
right on up in a boiling fashion -

578
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,084
it was rolling and boiling.

579
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:46,174
The surface was nothing but...
a black, boiling...

580
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,760
the only thing l can say,
like a barrel of tar -

581
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,054
probably
the best description l can give.

582
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,139
This was the way it looked down there.

583
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,100
Where before there had been a city -

584
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,268
distinctive houses, buildings

585
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,188
and everything that you could see
from our altitude -

586
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:05,652
now you couldn't see anything except
this black, boiling debris down below.

587
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,447
We took pictures as rapidly as we could.

588
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,701
My immediate concern after that
was "lt's time to get out of here."

589
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:20,667
l encountered
long, ceaseless lines of escapees.

590
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:26,756
All of them had no clothes whatsoever
on their bodies.

591
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,636
And the skin

592
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,600
from their faces, arms and breast

593
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,061
peeling oft and hanging loose -

594
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:45,191
and yet without any expression.

595
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:49,028
ln deep silence they are escaping.

596
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:54,117
l thought it was a procession of ghosts.

597
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,453
The words went back

598
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:01,249
basically to the eftect
that the bombing conditions were clear,

599
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:05,753
the target had been hit, the results
were better than had been anticipated,

600
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,089
and that message was sent on back.

601
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,258
From there on it was just a proposition

602
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,635
of letting everybody talk
for a few minutes

603
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,679
and get it out of their system.

604
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,723
The excitement was over -

605
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,643
pretty soon it became
a rather routine flight back home.

606
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,896
As a matter of fact,
it was routine enough

607
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,691
that l let Bob Lewis
and the autopilot fly that aeroplane

608
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,570
and went back and got some sleep
for about the first time in 30 hours -

609
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,530
and l was ready for it.

610
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,240
A long drawn-out war,

611
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:41,247
you begin to get casualties from the
side-eftects of exhaustion, privation...

612
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,001
disease and things of that sort.

613
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:48,421
So getting it over with
as quick as possible

614
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:54,177
is a moral responsibility
of everyone concerned.

615
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:58,056
Now, it's true that we knew
the war was over

616
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,184
and if we just waited a little while
it would be over,

617
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,020
because the Japanese were negotiating,

618
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,106
and we knew this
because we'd broken their code

619
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,859
and we were listening
to their communications.

620
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:16,783
But l believe that President Truman
made the proper decision to use it...

621
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,246
because it probably hastened
the negotiations

622
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,624
and even if we just saved one day,

623
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,377
to me it would be worthwhile,
you have to do it.

624
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,798
l thought it was absolutely unnecessary,

625
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:36,427
because by the time
the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima

626
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:42,433
we were conducting negotiations
with the Soviet government,

627
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,895
looking towards
an early end of hostilities.

628
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,650
And we were completely exhausted.

629
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,779
And the navy and army, too,

630
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,949
were slowly becoming...

631
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:06,874
more amenable to the idea of peace.

632
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,628
lt's an appalling subject to talk about,

633
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:15,216
and the United States has,
consciously and unconsciously,

634
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,636
a great deal of guilt complex
about its use.

635
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:24,976
But Truman made the decision on
the basis of the military necessities.

636
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,147
And l think an impartial analysis,

637
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,150
particularly from
the Japanese themselves -

638
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:36,112
more evidence is coming out that
they would've fought on fanatically.

639
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,323
You know, they did fight on fanatically

640
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,949
in some of the islands,

641
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,118
in spite of the surrender.

642
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:46,623
And the emperor
wouldn't have had the courage

643
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,209
to have called it oft,
or the support to call it oft.

644
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:56,007
When l heard about the atomic bomb
l was so astonished,

645
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:01,929
and l frankly said,
"The American people are brutal."

646
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:10,021
l wondered if the American people
were really civilised.

647
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,814
But at the same time

648
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:16,611
l thought this may become a key

649
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:21,282
for Japan to end the war.

650
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,247
(narrator) lt was two days before
the Japanese government realised

651
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:32,627
what the atomic bomb was
and what it had done.

652
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,214
70,000 had died in Hiroshima.

653
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,133
Another 70,000 were injured.

654
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:44,555
97% of the city's buildings
were destroyed or severely damaged.

655
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,975
President Truman, on hearing the news,

656
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,729
called it
"the greatest thing in history".

657
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,107
The peace group in the Japanese cabinet

658
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:59,028
hoped that the bomb might persuade
the war faction to accept surrender.

659
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,198
As the cabinet met
on the morning of August 9,

660
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,368
it received further shattering news.

661
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,454
The previous evening, in Moscow,

662
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,666
Molotov had finally received
the Japanese ambassador

663
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:16,045
and bluntly told him that Russia
was about to declare war on Japan.

664
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,717
Eight hours later - exactly three months
after the defeat of Germany,

665
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,802
just as Stalin had promised -

666
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,556
Russia attacked the Japanese army
in Manchuria.

667
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,519
Japanese hopes of Russian mediation
were at an end.

668
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:35,440
American hopes of finishing the war
before Russia became involved

669
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,984
were thwarted.

670
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,616
Later that same morning,

671
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,704
the Americans dropped
a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki.

672
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,290
lt killed 60,000 people.

673
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,917
But even now the Japanese militants

674
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,546
held out for a surrender
without an occupation.

675
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:04,135
The peace party wanted only
to preserVe the emperor's position.

676
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,929
For the first time,
to break the deadlock,

677
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:11,100
the emperor, Hirohito,
was called in to decide.

678
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,979
He chose peace.

679
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:20,860
(Hisatsune Sakomizu) l shall never
forget the emotion of that time.

680
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:27,492
Everybody started to cry,
so l looked at the emperor's face.

681
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,912
He just kept silent,

682
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:38,795
but he wore white gloves on his hands...

683
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:47,136
He wiped his own face several times,

684
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:54,352
so we could know the emperor himself,

685
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,814
His Majesty the emperor himself,
was crying.

686
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,779
l shall never forget the emotion

687
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,073
in this room at that time.

688
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,829
On August 10, the Japanese
made it known they would surrender

689
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,249
if the emperor were allowed to stay.

690
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:21,420
On August 12,
the Allies sent a noncommittal reply.

691
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,882
By this time,
Japan's army was near revolt.

692
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,844
(speaks Japanese)

693
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,764
(translator) Even if a thousand
atom bombs had been dropped,

694
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:36,143
and even if Japan
had been completely devastated,

695
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:40,231
you must remember
that Japan's honour was at stake,

696
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,942
the pride of the Japanese at that time

697
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:48,447
who felt that the only honourable way
out of the war was not to surrender,

698
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,867
but to die to the last man.

699
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,078
(narrator)
The Americans dropped leaflets

700
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,205
urging the Japanese to surrender.

701
00:47:56,331 --> 00:48:01,586
These almost upset the delicate
manoeuvrings of the peace party.

702
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,797
(speaks Japanese)

703
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,009
(translator)
That could have caused a lot of trouble.

704
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,887
Civilians and soldiers
all over the country

705
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,932
were completely unaware
of what was going on.

706
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,603
lf they had found out that
the government was negotiating peace

707
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,813
with the United States,

708
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,108
the situation
would have become impossible.

709
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,653
lt might even have led to a revolution.

710
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:33,868
So l felt we had to reach
a final decision as fast as possible.

711
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,584
(narrator) Once again, on August 14,

712
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,712
the emperor met
a divided Supreme War Council

713
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:48,966
and told them they must accept
the Allied ultimatum.

714
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:53,429
He himself would broadcast the next day.

715
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,641
That night, a group of junior ofticers
invaded the palace

716
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:00,019
and tried to seize the recording
of the emperor's message.

717
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,856
They couldn't find it. The coup failed.

718
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,358
At noon on August 15,

719
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:12,365
the Japanese people heard their
emperor's voice for the first time.

720
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,284
(Japanese over radio)

721
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:24,919
"The war", he told them, "has developed
not necessarily to Japan's advantage."

722
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:31,133
"Moreover, the enemy has begun to use
a new and most cruel bomb."

723
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,552
"Should we continue to fight,

724
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,847
it will not only result
in an ultimate collapse

725
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,101
and obliteration of the Japanese nation,

726
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:45,648
but also the total destruction
of human civilisation."

727
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:50,569
"We must, therefore,
endure the unendurable."

728
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:59,328
When the emperor addressed the nation
through his broadcast,

729
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:06,043
l know that 99 men out of 100

730
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,170
were taken aback.

731
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,842
They expected the emperor
to urge them to fight on.

732
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:19,473
So the shock was tremendous.

733
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:25,604
And all the army ofticers,
particularly the younger ones,

734
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:31,902
who said that
they had to fight to the bitter end,

735
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,072
were naturally disillusioned.

736
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:41,704
Some even tried to remonstrate

737
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:46,834
with the decision
taken by the cabinet for surrender.

738
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,587
(speaks Japanese)

739
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,551
(translator) ln a way it could be said
that the atomic bombings

740
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,095
and Russia's sudden attack on Japan

741
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,890
helped to bring about
the end of the war.

742
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,350
lf those events had not happened,

743
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:08,272
Japan, at that stage, probably
could not have stopped fighting.

744
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,326
(narrator) The war had ended,
but not the dying.

745
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:25,998
And radiation sickness -
which the Americans had not foreseen -

746
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,667
would kill thousands more
in the years to come.

747
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,346
The morning of September 2, 1945:

748
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,392
the United States battleship Missouri
is anchored in Tokyo Bay.

749
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,105
The new Japanese foreign minister,
Shigemitsu,

750
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:53,651
limps on board
to sign the surrender document.

751
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,875
The Allied commander, General MacArthur.

752
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:17,508
l now invite the representatives
of the emperor of Japan

753
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,553
and the Japanese government

754
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,973
and the Japanese lmperial
General Headquarters

755
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:29,728
to sign the instrument of surrender
at the places indicated.

756
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:35,067
(narrator) The foreign minister's aide,
Kase, watched the ceremony.

757
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:42,533
(Kase) l saw many thousands of sailors
everywhere on this huge vessel,

758
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:48,706
and just in front of us
were delegates of the victorious powers,

759
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,960
in military uniforms
glittering with gold.

760
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,421
And looking at them,

761
00:52:55,505 --> 00:53:02,136
l wondered how Japan ever thought
she could defeat all those nations.

762
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:10,269
(newsreel) Let us pray that peace
be now restored to the world,

763
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:16,442
and that God will preserVe it always.

764
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,322
These proceedings are closed.
