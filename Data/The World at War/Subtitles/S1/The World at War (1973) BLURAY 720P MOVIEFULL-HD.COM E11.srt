1
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,638
(narrator) No country, no people

2
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:18,976
suffered so terribly in the war
as the Soviet Union.

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,313
Nowhere else are
the memories of war so alive today,

4
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,983
and so profound.

5
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,652
The German invasion
brought about a catastrophe

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,740
which it seemed at first
no nation could surVive.

7
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:37,911
ln the siege of Leningrad alone,
which lasted for over two years,

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,247
more human beings died

9
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,544
than the total war dead of Britain
and the United States combined.

10
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,132
Yet it was here that Hitler was broken.

11
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:55,888
The Russian people faced
the possibility that they might perish,

12
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,432
and overcame it.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,225
We are hoping for the victory.

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,355
We are quite sure
that the victory will come sometime,

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,444
and we hoped that
our hardships would end.

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,257
(narrator)
Kharkov, under German occupation, 1942.

17
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,847
Hitler had written in Mein Kampf:

18
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,309
"The colossal empire in the east
is ripe for dissolution."

19
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,146
"And the end of Jewish domination
in Russia

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,399
will also be the end of Russia
as a state."

21
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,445
The Soviet system was to be demolished.

22
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:42,953
But there was more. lt was in Russia
that Hitler would find Lebensraum -

23
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,914
new territory for German colonisation.

24
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,713
The Soviet peoples
would be treated as mere natives

25
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,048
in a German colonial empire.

26
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,969
Their cities would be Germanised
or razed to the ground.

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,140
They would be pedlars,
backward peasants,

28
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,559
domestic serVants, labourers.

29
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,167
Communists and intellectuals
were exterminated.

30
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,630
The least sign of defiance
brought instant reprisal.

31
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,133
(speaking Russian)

32
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,179
(mterpreter) The occupiers
were harsh, very harsh,

33
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:46,892
especially in those areas
where the partisans were active.

34
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:51,980
ln the Ukraine, 51 1 villages
were burnt down by the Nazis

35
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,900
before the population could escape.

36
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,279
ln one village, Pisk, near Kiev,

37
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,658
which was totally razed to the ground,

38
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,786
babies were thrown into the fire.

39
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,085
(narrator) Before the war,

40
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,337
the regions now occupied by the Germans

41
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,422
had produced nearly three quarters

42
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,258
of the country's coal and iron,

43
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,593
a third of its beef and grain,

44
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,221
almost all its sugar.

45
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,724
By autumn 1941 , the Germans controlled

46
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,938
what had been the industrial and
agricultural heart of the Soviet Union.

47
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,032
The invaders found that
the Russians had tried to destroy

48
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,285
everything they had to leave behind.

49
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:51,790
Villages burned, the summer harVest
flamed in the fields around them.

50
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,502
By that autumn,
the Germans had advanced for 600 miles

51
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,505
over scorched earth.

52
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,385
ln some of the Baltic republics,

53
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,930
which had only been annexed
by the Soviet Union a year before,

54
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:11,101
the Germans were made welcome
by local nationalists.

55
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,646
ln parts of the Ukraine,

56
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,401
some of the peasants made the
traditional offering of bread and salt.

57
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,243
The bodies of nationalists shot by
Soviet security at the last moment

58
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,413
were brought out
and carried through the streets.

59
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,963
For a brief moment, it seemed to some
that these submerged nations

60
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,175
might become
willing partners of the Nazis.

61
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,554
Communists were hunted down.

62
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,975
And in all the places
the Nazis occupied,

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,519
the round-up of the Jews began.

64
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:21,838
ln the path of the German,
Russia seemed to be crumbling away.

65
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:27,135
Stalin had the defeated commander
of the Western Front and his staff

66
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,554
arrested and shot.

67
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,855
Monuments of Soviet construction,
even the Dnieper Dam,

68
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,358
the very symbol of the Five-Year Plans,

69
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,111
had to be blown up and abandoned.

70
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,413
Locomotives were wrecked,
though they were needed as never before,

71
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,792
for there now began an evacuation
which in the end was to save Russia

72
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,295
and change the course of the war.

73
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:17,477
1500 factories moved on 18,000 trains
with over a million workers

74
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,523
to the safety of eastern Russia
and the Urals.

75
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,525
One witness said:

76
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,695
"lt was as if the earth tilted up

77
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,199
and everything human or mechanical
rolled from west to east."

78
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,368
(speaking Russian)

79
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,248
(interpreter)
There was no factory when we arrived.

80
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:42,294
There were only storehouses
where materials were kept.

81
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:50,051
We began by emptying the stores
and clearing the land around it.

82
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,516
We were working up to 14 hours a day.

83
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,604
(narrator) ln bleak places,
lacking food or sleep,

84
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:06,526
the Russians reconstructed a new war
industry beyond the reach of the Nazis.

85
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,656
When we emptied the storehouses,

86
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,117
the machinery arrived.

87
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,455
Where the warehouses used to be,

88
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,540
we built a new factory.

89
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,876
(patriotic Russian song)

90
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,893
(narrator) Unlike the Germans,
the Russians, from the first hour,

91
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,521
waged a total war.

92
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,232
Every pair of hands
was set to the machines

93
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,860
as the men were draffed
into the battles of the west.

94
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,738
War work strained everyone to the heart.

95
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,575
1 1 to 15 hours a day, rations short,

96
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,161
worry about a husband or a son
at the front,

97
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,289
exhaustion like a permanent illness.

98
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,509
But for the camera,
they wore a cheerful, determined face.

99
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,516
Now the Germans
were breaking through to Leningrad,

100
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,812
Russia's second city
and capital of the revolution.

101
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,819
(Russian marching song)

102
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,660
The workers were given rifles.

103
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,912
Harking back to the days of revolution,

104
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:45,166
Leningrad's leaders encouraged
the whole city to stand and fight.

105
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,962
Untrained,
they marched out to face the panzers

106
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,340
within sight
of their own factory chimneys.

107
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,013
The chance to get non-combatants
out of Leningrad was missed.

108
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,933
Anyway, most families preferred to stay.

109
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:06,938
My husband,
he got two places on a plane,

110
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:12,360
and he asked me suddenly
to take the child and go with him,

111
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,698
but l refused because
l couldn't leave my mother

112
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:23,246
and his mother, my mother-in-law,
here in the besieged city.

113
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,874
So l told him
to take the old lady with him

114
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,669
and l remained in Leningrad
with my mother and child.

115
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,257
(narrator) ln September,
the German ring closed.

116
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,636
Over two and half million people
were trapped in the city,

117
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,722
400,000 of them children.

118
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,100
Leningrad's only link with Russia
was across Lake Ladoga.

119
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,895
The greatest of all sieges
was beginning.

120
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,106
Now Stalin interVened.

121
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,526
Marshal Voroshilov,
in command of Leningrad, was sacked.

122
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,363
ln his place was sent
Marshal Georgi Zhukov,

123
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,449
who was to become
one of the great commanders of the war.

124
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,870
His deputy was the hard and resourceful
Andrei Zhdanov,

125
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,581
Leningrad's Communist Party chief.

126
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:14,172
Leningrad soon felt
the new team's determination.

127
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,757
Outside the city,

128
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,511
Zhukov threatened that anyone
who retreated further would be shot.

129
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:25,183
lnside, the security forces
hunted down spies and defeatists.

130
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,894
Zhdanov's men ended the wastage of food,

131
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,314
mobilising everybody
for the city's defence.

132
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,616
Every major building was mined
in case the Germans broke in.

133
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:48,248
But the German attempt
to take Leningrad by storm failed.

134
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,292
(siren)

135
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,426
Berlin ordered: "The Führer has decided
to raze the city of Petersburg

136
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,553
from the face of the earth."

137
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,724
"There is no reason for the
future existence of this large city."

138
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:13,523
The Leningraders were to be bombarded
and starVed to death.

139
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,699
Day affer day, the bombers came over.

140
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,546
German gunners could see the spires
of Leningrad from their lines.

141
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,967
Their shells could strike
every district, every street.

142
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,907
Lake Ladoga remained
the only gap in the enemy ring.

143
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:51,830
When it froze, an ice road for supplies
was built across its surface.

144
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,553
Trucks fell through the ice
or were destroyed by air attack.

145
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,442
The ice road could bring too little in
and take too few civilians out

146
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,946
to keep Leningrad
from the onset of starVation.

147
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:30,118
Everything was running out.
The trams and buses stopped.

148
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:34,289
ln the darkness and intense cold
of the North Russian winter,

149
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,500
there was no longer heating
or electric light.

150
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,753
Workers, half-conscious with hunger,

151
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,172
kept the arms factories turning,

152
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,593
even when shells had torn off the roof.

153
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:59,397
Tanks of raw, unpainted steel drove
out of the factory into the front line.

154
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:05,570
Bread was now made with
sweepings, cattle-cake, sawdust.

155
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,823
People ate soap, linseed oil,

156
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,075
the paste for wallpaper.

157
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,702
Housewives and children

158
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:17,624
got only four and half ounces
of this "bread" a day.

159
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,264
Frozen and silent,

160
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,767
Leningrad refused to die.

161
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,020
The libraries stayed open.

162
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:44,233
People took inspiration
from the new literature of the blockade.

163
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,695
(Olga) Poetry was, for us,

164
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,157
a great force that kept us alive.

165
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,160
(narrator)
"lf what they say of Leningrad is true,

166
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,621
the tears have frozen
in the people's eyes."

167
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:01,459
"We cry no longer, for no tears
could quench our burning hate."

168
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,420
"And hate is our only course."

169
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,882
"The guarantee of life,
the cure for grief,

170
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,678
the one uniting,
warming, guiding force."

171
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,516
And the end of November,
December and January

172
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,435
were the most tragic of times.

173
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,272
Firstly, it was cold - minus 40.

174
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,610
Then the famine, the hunger, began to...

175
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,239
to... to be felt.

176
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,866
And people began to starVe

177
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,994
and to die from cold.

178
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,040
(narrator) The siege went on.

179
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,837
There were few ways
to hit back at the Germans.

180
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,341
One was with naval guns
from the warships trapped in the port.

181
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:57,473
On land, small raiding parties
penetrated behind the German trenches.

182
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,441
They cut supply lines,

183
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,651
they captured prisoners

184
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,404
and collected information.

185
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,249
They descended on collaborators
and tried them on the spot.

186
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,220
January 1942.

187
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:41,809
About 4,000 people
were dying in Leningrad each day.

188
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,341
(Glga) When l went to the shops

189
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,636
to receive my ration for my family,

190
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,639
if l passed on the way there two bodies,

191
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,433
on the way back there were four.

192
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,357
(narrator) Outside the ring, the
Russians fought to loosen the blockade

193
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,278
and to speed up the pitifully slow
convoys across the frozen lake.

194
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:20,867
But there was no major offensive
to break the siege ring, and no airliff.

195
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:27,915
The battles before Moscow
had first call on men and equipment.

196
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,175
Spring brought new fears.

197
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,302
The murderous cold slackened,

198
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,055
but melting snowdriffs
revealed thousands of corpses

199
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,892
in the streets and yards.

200
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,024
A campaign was launched
to clean up the city.

201
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,868
There was no epidemic.

202
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,798
Now the ice road was melting.

203
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,720
Although there would be a difficult time
before the lake was clear for ships,

204
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,181
the mood in Leningrad
was turning confident.

205
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:30,686
(Olga) When the sun began to shine,
then we began to clean

206
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,064
and to wash.

207
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,567
Of course,
now we had water in our homes.

208
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,820
We began to feel normal again.

209
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,243
(narrator) The city council dared
to send a few trams back on the streets.

210
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:50,998
(Olga) We greeted the tram as an
old forgotten friend coming back to us.

211
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:56,545
l remember l clapped my hands when
l saw the tram running along Liteiny.

212
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,449
(narrator) The surVivors felt stronger.

213
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,369
Their rations were increased.

214
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:46,429
Squads of volunteers went from
house to house bringing help to families

215
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:51,058
who, in the winter, had almost
lost contact with the city outside.

216
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,570
Children who should have been evacuated
eight months before

217
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,364
were taken by ship across Lake Ladoga.

218
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,458
The ships brought back
troops and munitions

219
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,210
to relieve the gaunt men
in the trenches.

220
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,922
Leningrad began to look more like
a military base.

221
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,887
The worst of the siege was over.

222
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:32,558
Though the bombardment went on,
it now made sense to repair the damage.

223
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,271
Peat was dug for fuel
against the next winter.

224
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,443
Schoolchildren and professors of botany

225
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:46,197
helped to plant every open space
with vegetables.

226
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,374
There were no worries
about food for the Germans

227
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,709
occupying the prairies of the Ukraine.

228
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,380
For 50 years, German expansionists
had looked to this region

229
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,883
to free Germany
from dependence on imports by sea.

230
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,141
General Manstein said, "A large part of
the population will have to go hungry."

231
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,645
"Nothing, out of
a misguided sense of humanity,

232
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,563
may be given to the population,

233
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,192
unless they are in the serVice
of the German Wehrmacht."

234
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,433
ln Kiev, the Ukrainian capital,
plans to win over local nationalists

235
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,979
with the promise of an anti-Russian
puppet state never got off the ground.

236
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,774
They were brushed aside
by the army and the SS.

237
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,279
The reality was
work under German overseers

238
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,823
or deportation to the Reich.

239
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,872
Each village
learned the price of defiance.

240
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,882
ln Moscow in early 1942
there was confidence.

241
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,842
The winter fighting had revealed

242
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:33,345
that the Germans were no more invincible
than Napoleon had been.

243
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,805
But it seemed to Russians

244
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,058
that they bore the burden
of the war against Fascism alone

245
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,353
and that the West was not doing enough.

246
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,860
When Stalin began to call for
a second front, a landing in the west,

247
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:52,239
the people joined willingly
in the meetings organised to support it.

248
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,868
Molotov, the foreign minister,
was told by Western diplomats

249
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,330
that though they admired
the heroism of the Red Army,

250
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,958
a second front was not yet practical.

251
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,127
Stalin didn't believe them.

252
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,296
(speaking Russian)

253
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,301
Stalin was in direct command of an army

254
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,888
becoming harder and more formidable
every day.

255
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,852
But the Russians did not pretend
to be immune to grief.

256
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,939
Tens of thousands
knew this poem by heart...

257
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,984
"Wait for me, and l'll return."

258
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,570
"Only, wait very hard."

259
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,534
"Wait when you are filled with sorrow
as you watch the yellow rain."

260
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,203
"Wait when the winds
sweep the snowdriffs."

261
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,830
"Wait in the sweltering heat."

262
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:46,669
"Wait when others have stopped waiting,
forgetting their yesterdays."

263
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:51,006
"Wait even when from afar
no letters come to you."

264
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,426
"Wait even when
others are tired of waiting."

265
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,514
"Wait even when
my mother and son think l am no more,

266
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:02,268
and when friends sit around the fire
drinking to my memory."

267
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:07,106
"Wait, and do not hurry
to drink to my memory too."

268
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,193
"Wait, for l'll return,

269
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,529
defying every death."

270
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,908
"And let those who do not wait
say that l was lucky."

271
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,412
"They never will understand
that in the midst of death

272
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:25,040
you with your waiting saved me."

273
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,502
"Only you and l will know
how l surVived."

274
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,798
"lt's because you waited,
as no one else did."

275
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,387
There were still disasters to come.

276
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:43,100
ln May, the Germans beat off
a Russian offensive near Kharkov.

277
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:47,313
As the Red Army advanced,
the panzers cut round its flanks.

278
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,826
The Soviet commanders
begged to be allowed to pull back

279
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,911
before it was too late,

280
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,625
but Stalin, pushing advice aside,
forbade them to retreat.

281
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,044
The German pincers closed.

282
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:14,673
Most of the men of three Russian armies
were forced to lay down their arms.

283
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:43,369
ln the whole war, over five million
Russian soldiers were taken prisoner.

284
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,082
Less than two million surVived.

285
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,297
For the British especially,

286
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,468
the Russians were now
"Our gallant Soviet ally."

287
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:05,140
But, at first, help could only come
through the Arctic convoys

288
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,851
heading for Murmansk and Archangel

289
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:13,190
through the killing ground of the
German U-boats, bombers and warships.

290
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:24,118
ln July 1942,
this one convoy lost 80% of its ships.

291
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,333
But the courage of British seamen
could not make the convoys carry enough

292
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,086
for Russia's gigantic needs.

293
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,466
1942 was the year of deep war -

294
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,512
defeat fought off,
but as yet no sign of victory.

295
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,807
This was a time of bitter endurance,

296
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,936
a season for learning to bear
disappointment and loss.

297
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,649
Once, it seemed possible
that German soldiers

298
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,860
were only brother workers in uniform,

299
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,780
but now Soviet writers
spoke in words of hate.

300
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,660
"One can bear anything -
the plague, hunger and death -

301
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,121
but one cannot bear the Germans."

302
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,915
"One cannot bear these fish-eyed oafs

303
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,793
contemptuously snorting
at everything Russian."

304
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,672
"We cannot live as long
as these grey-green slugs are alive."

305
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,260
"Today there are no books,
today there are no stars in the sky."

306
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:27,306
"Today there is only one thought -
kill the Germans."

307
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,559
"Kill them all
and dig them into the earth."

308
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,770
"Then we can go to sleep."

309
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,273
"Then we can think again
of life and books

310
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,026
and girls and happiness."

311
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,031
"We shall kill them all,

312
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,868
but we must do it quickly or
they will desecrate the whole of Russia

313
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,788
and torture to death
millions more people."

314
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,219
As the Soviet soldiers advanced,

315
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,848
they found what Germans
had been doing to civilians.

316
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,652
(priest chanting)

317
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,613
The churches were full once more.

318
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,501
The priesthood was invited
to pray for the life of holy Russia

319
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,671
to work on the patriotism
of the worshippers.

320
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,719
The icons were honoured again.

321
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,014
The public campaign for atheism
was dropped.

322
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,433
(congregation singing)

323
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:03,086
The Germans murdered
Jews and Communists.

324
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:07,215
They murdered those
suspected of supporting the partisans.

325
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,801
They murdered hostages.

326
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,854
Affer battle, in retreat,

327
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,482
they just murdered.

328
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:42,501
To the north, the Russians prepared to
attack the German ring round Leningrad.

329
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,836
As they waited, runners brought the news

330
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,882
of the surrender of the German armies
at Stalingrad.

331
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:55,222
For army and people, this was the sudden
glow of victory at the tunnel's end.

332
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,184
Now they knew they would win.

333
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:30,215
At Leningrad,
the relieving troops broke through.

334
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,760
(speaking Russian)

335
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:47,107
They forced open a land route.
The 16-month blockade was over.

336
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,443
But they did not break the siege.

337
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,155
The Germans and Finns
still lay around the city.

338
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,867
(speaking Russian)

339
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,494
(Olga) lt was such a feeling
l can't relate it.

340
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,789
l went to my neighbour across the yard,

341
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,375
and we kissed each other
and told each other:

342
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,378
"Now we shall live. There is a way out."

343
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,299
(narrator) ln a fortnight,
a railway was laid through the gap.

344
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,344
Food and fuel
began to roll into Leningrad.

345
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,394
The symbols of old Russian honour

346
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,522
were restored to the army
as they had been to the church.

347
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,858
(patriotic Russian song)

348
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,614
Propaganda
united Lenin with Alexander Nevski...

349
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,496
..the 18th century hero, Suvorov...

350
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,836
..heroes of the Red cavalry,

351
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:54,091
mighty ghosts cheering forward
the avengers of the Soviet motherland.

352
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:03,683
The insignia of a traditional and
professional army were brought back.

353
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,480
Gold braid was imported from Britain.

354
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,858
Political commissars lost rank.

355
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,572
The years of the purges were forgotten.

356
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,783
(Russian marching song)

357
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,945
(speaking Russian)

358
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:01,783
(mterpreter) Every Soviet citizen felt
himself a part of the common struggle.

359
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,536
Some people say
it was the Fascists' cruelty

360
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,749
which led to resistance
in the Ukraine and other occupied lands.

361
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,918
No.

362
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,175
l believe resistance was inevitable.

363
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:28,935
Soviet people in the rear could not
hold themselves back from the struggle.

364
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:45,452
(narrator) ln 1941 , behind the lines
partisan bands began to form.

365
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,621
At first, they lacked arms.

366
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,165
They grew slowly.

367
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,675
German deportations for forced labour
made thousands flee to the forests,

368
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,721
where they joined the partisans.

369
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,681
(patriotic song)

370
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,321
Soon the partisans
became a formidable army

371
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,408
operating against
the enemy lines of communication.

372
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,942
The penalty for collaboration was death.

373
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,611
On a mere suspicion
of sympathy for the enemy,

374
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,699
whole national groups,
the Volga Germans, the Crimean Tatars,

375
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,951
were deported to central Asia.

376
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,454
For individual collaborators, no mercy.

377
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,925
As German prisoners
were paraded through Leningrad,

378
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,512
people struck out at an enemy
they could reach.

379
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:49,075
ln the steppes of Soviet Asia, in
the new factories and mines of Siberia,

380
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,581
the most desperate production effort of
modern times was coming to its climax.

381
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,757
Russia has been caught
with obsolete aircraff,

382
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,593
unfit for close battle support.

383
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:53,139
Now the plants turned out
9,000 modern aircraff every month.

384
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:58,061
ln 1943, military output
finally outstripped Germany's.

385
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,990
Above all, it was the tank.

386
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,703
ln 1943,
the factories built 24,000 of them.

387
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,375
More than any other weapon,
it was the tank,

388
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,169
especially the famous T-34,

389
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,423
which won the battle
on the Eastern Front.

390
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,481
With the American trucks
now streaming in from Persia,

391
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,235
this torrent of armour
moved up to the line.

392
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,157
The Russians knew that in July 1943

393
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:57,495
the Germans would launch their
full strength against them once more.

394
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,623
They knew too
that the blow would fall at Kursk.

395
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,334
They must hold firm.

396
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:07,672
Then the Red Army, now
the biggest land force ever seen in war,

397
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,841
would strike back.

398
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,636
The Germans planned to drive

399
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,972
into the shoulders of the Kursk bulge,

400
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,766
hoping to cut off the huge Soviet army,

401
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,227
then hit at Moscow.

402
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,779
They brought up 70 divisions -
almost a million men -

403
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,699
with the new Tiger tanks
and Ferdinand guns.

404
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,868
Hitler had intended to strike in May,

405
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:40,914
but there were delays in production
and building up reserVes.

406
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,964
Weeks passed.

407
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:55,762
When the German were ready to attack,
the Russians were waiting for them.

408
00:41:55,846 --> 00:42:01,768
(speaking Russian)

409
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,895
(mterpreter) We were all prepared.

410
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:07,482
We were more than ready
to meet Hitler's attack.

411
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,108
We knew we had enough armour

412
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,153
to stop the Fascists
breaking through our defences.

413
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,374
Our reconnaissance patrols
had captured prisoners.

414
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,712
From them
we learned that Hitler's troops

415
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:35,009
planned to start the attack
at 2:30 in the morning on July 5.

416
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,138
The news was given to our troops.

417
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,057
(speaking Russian)

418
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:45,061
(mterpreter) The commander
sits in the obserVation post,

419
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,605
the soldiers are in the trenches,

420
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,150
and tomorrow
the enemy is expected to attack.

421
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,907
You can imagine
what thoughts are in his mind.

422
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:10,253
There were more than
a hundred tanks every kilometre.

423
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:14,048
When tanks are moving,
the whole earth trembles.

424
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,342
And the guns fire,

425
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,470
but the soldier just sits.

426
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,316
(narrator)
Soviet aircraff took off at dawn

427
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,194
to wreck the German bombers
waiting on their airfields.

428
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,334
The Germans kept to the timetable.

429
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:56,215
On the morning of July 5,
the panzer divisions moved forward.

430
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:31,042
Kursk was the biggest tank battle
in history.

431
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:35,880
ln the north, the German pincer
made ten miles in five days, and halted,

432
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,884
with 50,000 dead
and 400 tanks destroyed.

433
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,930
ln the south, in an even vaster battle,

434
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,058
a 20-mile dent
was made in the Russian defences,

435
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,894
but the Germans were spent.

436
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:54,524
On July 15,
Hitler called off the Kursk offensive.

437
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,824
The Red Army went over to the attack.

438
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,662
Under bombardment,
the sappers went ahead

439
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:53,541
to cut a path into the German defences.

440
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,473
Through the gap,
the tanks plunged forward,

441
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,434
the troops riding on their sides.

442
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,416
These were the new Russian soldiers,

443
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,836
very different
from the defeated masses of 1941 .

444
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,257
Their clothes were shabby,
but their weapons were clean.

445
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:48,012
They were tough, chasing the enemy
into close-quarter battle.

446
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,430
They were resourceful,

447
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:54,435
trained to live off the land
and to cross rivers on their own.

448
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,650
lf there was no boat,
a bench or a log would do.

449
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,408
They went without regular leave or pay,

450
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,453
but now their morale
was fierce and high.

451
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:22,421
ln military terms, it was Kursk which
decided how the European war would end.

452
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:27,677
When this supreme German effort failed,
the Soviet victory began.

453
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,474
The fighting to break through
German positions was hard and slow,

454
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,394
but affer nine days
the Red Army had recaptured

455
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:40,481
all the ground lost
in this last German offensive.

456
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:10,636
The Germans began to fall back,
destroying everything as they went.

457
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,682
Now they were under constant attack
by Soviet fighters.

458
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:21,105
The Luffwaffe
had lost command of the air.

459
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:38,873
Suddenly, the towns of occupied Russia
were full of armour moving west.

460
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:44,378
Affer two years,
the conquerors were pulling out.

461
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,007
(air-raid siren)

462
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,553
At Leningrad,
the Germans were still at the outskirts,

463
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,889
the city still under shellfire.

464
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:07,276
The siege was not to be finally broken
until January the following year.

465
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:17,745
The strength of Russia, like a gigantic
spring compressed back to its limit,

466
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,289
was now bursting forward.

467
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,751
The first cities were liberated.

468
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,271
On August 5, 1943,

469
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,733
Orel and Belgorod were freed.

470
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:54,532
ln each town, those who had died
in battle were buried.

471
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,705
"Do not call me, Father,
do not seek me."

472
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,291
"Do not call me, do not wish me back."

473
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:08,754
"We're on a route uncharted,
Fire and blood erase our track."

474
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:13,175
"On we fly on wings of thunder,
Nevermore to sheath our swords."

475
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:18,014
"All of us in battle fallen,
Not to be brought back by words."

476
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:22,059
"Will there be a rendezvous?
l know not."

477
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,478
"l only know we still must fight."

478
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,231
"We are sand grains in infinity,

479
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,985
Never to meet, nevermore see light."

480
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:38,117
"Farewell then, my son,
farewell then, my conscience,

481
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,077
My youth and my solace,

482
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,580
My one and my only."

483
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,374
"And let this farewell
be the end of a story

484
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,919
Of solitude vast,
and which none is more lonely,

485
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,797
ln which you remain barred
forever and ever

486
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,299
From light and from air,

487
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,676
with your death pangs untold."

488
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,345
"Untold and unsoothed,

489
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:03,267
not to be resurrected,
Forever and ever an 18-year-old."

490
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,854
"Farewell, then.
No trains ever come from those regions,

491
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:10,316
Unscheduled or scheduled,
no aeroplanes fly there."

492
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,403
"Farewell then, my son,
for no miracles happen,

493
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:18,365
As in this world
dreams do not come true."

494
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,369
"Farewell.
l will dream of you still as a baby,

495
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,623
Treading the earth
with little, strong toes."

496
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,626
"The earth
where already so many lie buried."

497
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:33,047
"This song to my son, then,
is come to its close."

498
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,679
ln Moscow, Stalin announced:

499
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:46,227
"Tonight at 2400 hours on August 5,
the capital of our country, Moscow,

500
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:50,064
will salute the valiant troops
who liberated Orel and Belgorod."

501
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,524
(shouting in Russian)

502
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,405
"Eternal glory to the heroes who fell

503
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,950
in the struggle for the freedom
of our country."

504
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,035
"Death to the German invaders."

505
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,753
ln November, Kiev was freed.

506
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,921
(upbeat Russian song)

507
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:41,759
Russia was saved by its soldiers
and by its people.

508
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:47,223
But in the earth,
never to welcome the coming of peace,

509
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,226
lay 20 million dead.
