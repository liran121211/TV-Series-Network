1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,014
(man) l don't think many of the aircrew

2
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,766
knew what strategic bombing
really meant.

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,686
(man #2) As schoolboys,
we joined the air force,

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,646
cos there was a war being fought

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,066
and there was a bit of glamour
attached to the air force.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,863
(man #1) lf you couldn't
get the Kraut in his factory,

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,074
it was just as easy
to knock him off in his bed.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,164
lf old Granny Shickelgruber next door
got the chop, that's hard luck.

9
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:45,878
There are a lot of people who say
that bombing can never win a war.

10
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:52,968
Well, my answer to that is that it has
never been tried yet, and we shall see.

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,385
(♪ tea dance)

12
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,349
(narrator) Affer the Battle of Britain,

13
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,811
the Royal Air Force
had cause to celebrate.

14
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,733
Fighter Command had shown how difficult
it was to destroy a country

15
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,028
which could defend its own air space.

16
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:43,453
A lesson the air staff, apparently,
neglected to teach itself.

17
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:51,461
Lord Trenchard had founded the serVice
as a force of strategic bombers.

18
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,882
Fighters for defence were secondary.

19
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,803
Long-range bombers, it was argued,

20
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,806
could win wars
without costly land battles.

21
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,601
They would bomb the industrial heart
out of an enemy

22
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,812
and totally demoralise
his civilian population.

23
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:17,404
ln 1939, the RAF was not really equipped
to put this thesis to the test.

24
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:22,659
But affer Dunkirk, it was the only force
capable of attacking Germany.

25
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,704
And the British public
desperately needed an attack.

26
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,044
(newsreel) The British Empire
is building up a bomber force

27
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:37,716
designed as the offensive air weapon
to smash the heart of Germany.

28
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,806
The first daylight raids
were disastrous.

29
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,186
Bombers fell easy prey to the Luffwaffe.

30
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,647
(♪ "Bring Back My Bomber And Me")

31
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,746
Still the RAF persevered,
though losses mounted.

32
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,125
Heavy casualties forced Bomber Command
to start flying at night.

33
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,378
(♪ "Bring Back My Bomber And Me")

34
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,219
(man) OK, chaps, here we go.

35
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,640
(indistinct radio contact)

36
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,268
(redio) Taxi out and take off.

37
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,728
(♪ "Bring Back My Bomber And Me")

38
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,209
Do you see what l see, skipper?

39
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,586
(man)
What do you see, my Scottish friend?

40
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,090
Fog. Dirty, yellow, stinking fog.

41
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,929
(narrator) For aircrews
trained to attack in daylight,

42
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,806
night flying had its problems.

43
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,058
To find a target in Germany,

44
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,768
in the dead of night,

45
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,772
in any average weather conditions,

46
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,317
was quite far beyond the task

47
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,444
of any bomber crews.

48
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,784
We're over the Dutch coast.
Too much cloud to see where.

49
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,581
(narrator) Patriotic films had no
difficulty in giving the impression

50
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,250
that determination
and a diet of raw carrots

51
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,670
could overcome the law saying
you cannot see in the dark.

52
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,799
- Can't see anything else but the Rhine.
- l hope it's not the Danube.

53
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,511
Keep on going. You might be able
to pick up something with lights on.

54
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,098
lf you could get visual pinpoints
en route,

55
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:56,396
you could get within five or seven miles
of the targets.

56
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,819
- Bomb doors open.
- Steady.

57
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,406
(narrator) Once the target was reached,
it was a piece of cake...

58
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,949
Bombs gone.

59
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:15,374
..provided you were just
blowing up a studio model.

60
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,462
l hope we haven't
kept you waiting, sir.

61
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,672
Good Lord, no. Come and sit down.

62
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,969
- How did you get on?
- Caused a hell of a great big fire.

63
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,057
Buckets of smoke.
Visible, ooh, 50 miles away.

64
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,104
Well, old boy,
how about some bacon and eggs?

65
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,239
(narrator) The truth was different.

66
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:51,785
ln fact, in those days,
and it's been proved since,

67
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:57,624
three bombs in every 100 got
within five miles of the aiming point.

68
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:08,051
In diesem Schlafsaal wurden neun Kinder
getötet und fünf schwer verletzt.

69
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,764
(narrator) lnaccurate bombing
could be embarrassing.

70
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,309
The German propaganda ministry
quickly capitalised

71
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,062
on the destruction
of this children's hospital.

72
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,231
Das sind die Opfer
der britischen Mordbuben,

73
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,859
die dieses gemeine Verbrechen ganz
bewusst begangen haben.

74
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,611
Es wird unerbittlich gesühnt werden.

75
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,868
But the war cabinet's view
was that Germany had to be bombed.

76
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,872
And this was the only strategic
bombing Britain could then undertake.

77
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,417
Coventry and Liverpool indicated
German industry would suffer

78
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,211
if its workers were bombed out.

79
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:48,341
Professor Lindemann told Churchill that
de-housing a third of German workers

80
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,094
would bring industrial production
to a halt.

81
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,348
And there was popular pressure
to avenge the Blitz.

82
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,977
We ask no favours of the enemy.

83
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:07,861
We seek from them no... compunction.

84
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,448
On the contrary,

85
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:17,037
if tonight the people of London
were asked to cast their votes

86
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,374
as to whether a convention
should be entered into

87
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,877
to stop the bombing of all cities,

88
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,630
an overwhelming majority would cry:

89
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,342
"No, we will mete out to the Germans

90
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:35,931
the measure and more than the measure
they have meted out to us."

91
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:48,401
(narrator) But the Germans were now
meting it out to the British bomber.

92
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,998
By the end of 1941 ,
Britain had lost 700 aircraff.

93
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:21,309
The navy and the army were demanding
bombers for the Atlantic and the desert.

94
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,854
Bomber Command
stood to be put out of business.

95
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,649
ln the face of mounting losses,

96
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,860
the cabinet ordered bombing operations
to be cut down,

97
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,280
to save the bomber force.

98
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,035
During the respite in February 1942,

99
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,831
Sir Arthur Harris took over as
Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command.

100
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:48,044
He was determined to succeed
with new tactics and new bombers.

101
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:52,841
(Harris) The Nazis entered this war
under the rather childish delusion

102
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,552
that they were going to bomb
everybody else

103
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,930
and nobody was going to bomb them.

104
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:05,895
At Rotterdam, London, Warsaw
and half a hundred other places,

105
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,400
they put that rather naive theory
into operation.

106
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:16,197
They sowed the wind and now
they are going to reap the whirlwind.

107
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,827
l put them onto the north German ports
in the Baltic,

108
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,956
because, having flown
quite a bit at night myself,

109
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,419
l realised that the easiest targets
to get hold of, of course,

110
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,589
were always the ones on the coastline.

111
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,217
Because if you can see anything,
you can see a coastline.

112
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,596
lf you can see a coastline
with its odd shapes,

113
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,434
you can find your way along to ports
and recognise them.

114
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,980
(narrator) Lubeck and Rostock
were the first major targets.

115
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,858
As ports, they were easy to find.

116
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,779
And they burnt well.

117
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:02,494
ln March 1942,
230 bombers destroyed half Lubeck.

118
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,665
ln April,
Rostock was bombed into flames.

119
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,752
The style was set: night area bombing.

120
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,964
This was to become the pattern
for the next three years.

121
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,968
lt was terrifying,
it was indiscriminate,

122
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,931
but as far as Bomber Command
was concerned, there was no alternative.

123
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,225
How many occasions,

124
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,770
looking out of the window,
or walking out in the garden,

125
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,191
could you see up to 18 or 20,000 feet?

126
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,402
Maybe on two or three days at most.

127
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,781
On how many occasions can you
guarantee if you see up to it here,

128
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,743
that you could see down to it
500 miles away,

129
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,246
in the other end of Europe?

130
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,748
That was the situation.

131
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,086
There's no possibility
of hitting the individual targets,

132
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,755
consistently small targets,

133
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:01,761
until we got
the navigational electronic aids

134
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:06,266
that would show those targets up
in the dark or through clouds.

135
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:13,106
(narrator) The first electronic aid
to navigation now came into serVice.

136
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,524
lt was called GEE.

137
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:18,278
Three radio transmitters in England
sent an invisible grid of signals

138
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,488
across western Europe.

139
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,080
By monitoring the signals
and plotting them on a map,

140
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,876
a navigator could tell
where his aircraff was.

141
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,839
GEE was first used at Cologne.

142
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,760
Here, Harris threw in every bomber
he could scrape up

143
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,387
for a monumental prestige attack.

144
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,727
(Harris) ln your hands
lie the means of destroying

145
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:56,691
a major part of the resources by which
the enemy's war effort is maintained.

146
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,279
Press home your attack.
lf you individually succeed,

147
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,574
you will have delivered
the most devastating blow

148
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,035
against the very vitals of the enemy.

149
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,330
Let him have it right on the chin.

150
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:14,083
Send that message
to all groups and stations.

151
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,755
l was trying to show them
what could be achieved

152
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,758
with something approaching
an adequate force,

153
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:27,013
and that it would be achieved
without abnormal casualties.

154
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:35,188
(newsreel) The dark hours over Hitler's
Germany are about to be made hideous.

155
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,150
The men of Bomber Command
know well what they have to do.

156
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,362
A calm, moonlit night,
everything ready and waiting,

157
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,198
from planes to carrier pigeons.

158
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,827
They seem to know the ops are on.
Come on, fellas, get cracking.

159
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,337
(newsreel #2)
Round the clock with the RAF.

160
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,341
At station affer station, there
are heavies, including Lancasters,

161
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,761
the heavy bomber of the moment,
ready for tonight.

162
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,598
For tonight is going
to be very, very interesting -

163
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,350
a thousand-bomber night.

164
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,995
(narrator) On that night, May 30, 1942,

165
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,623
1 ,046 bombers took off for Cologne.

166
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,673
(woman) Wir hörten auch gleich
kurz darauf das Brummen

167
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,924
der anfliegenden Bomber.

168
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,094
(translator) We heard the drone
of the approaching bombers

169
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:52,348
and guessed that
it was a heavy formation.

170
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,857
And soon affer,
the first bombs fell around us.

171
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,028
We were all shaking with fear.
Some people nearly fainted.

172
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,864
Many of the patients were crying.

173
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,618
The roaring and crashing
came closer and closer.

174
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,747
We really thought
all hell was breaking loose.

175
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,542
Our part of the city was in flames.

176
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,670
People were running out of cellars
and out of houses.

177
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,547
Some were buried in the rubble.

178
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,258
Others were caught
by the falling masonry.

179
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:34,223
Many people actually caught fire,
running around like living torches.

180
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:41,773
(man) We really didn't expect, in '42,
that such a heavy raid would take place.

181
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,026
We were only used to smaller attacks,

182
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:52,033
and when l got the news that about
1 ,000 bombers were attacking Cologne,

183
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,743
it was incredible.

184
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,628
The morale of the people
was not shattered too much.

185
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:08,508
lt was more like a short shock
which passed away.

186
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,349
(narrator) German industry remained
resilient, although the industrial Ruhr

187
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,893
was under attack throughout 1942.

188
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,063
Damage was extensive,
but there was some slack in the economy

189
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,608
to be taken up in more war production.

190
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,363
The Nazi war machine was skilled
at orchestrating civilian morale.

191
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,157
(♪ "Deutschlandlied")

192
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,474
(man) Flugzeuggeräusch.

193
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,643
(telephone rings)

194
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,484
Bitte mal die Geschwindigkeit
von 02:15 Uhr nachmessen.

195
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,196
(siren)

196
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,201
The Germans could give as well as take.

197
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,456
The Luffwaffe was acutely aware of
the lesson radar-controlled RAF fighters

198
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,460
had taught it
during the Battle of Britain.

199
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:31,424
Air defence chief General Kammhuber
evolved a most efficient system.

200
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,051
Across the North Sea coast

201
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,804
stretched an early-warning radar grid,
the Kammhuber Line.

202
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,640
This grid was divided into boxes.

203
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,479
ln each box was a night fighter,
waiting like a spider for the fly.

204
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:51,444
We overtook the plane on the side,
so he thought, "Ah, he hasn't seen me."

205
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,658
He still did some corkscrewing
or waving.

206
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:03,039
l just banked slightly to give
the gunners a good view underneath.

207
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:08,169
l moved off maybe ten degrees to port
and starboard during this manoeuvre,

208
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,255
but it wasn't violent
in any sense at all.

209
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:18,012
And then l was shooting this way
and diving directly,

210
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:23,559
or with a - what we said -
schräge Musik,

211
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,605
two two-centimetre cannons,

212
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,817
the same, only flying underneath,

213
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,612
and waiting, moving very easy.

214
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,866
We did the same
parallel to the other one, shooting.

215
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:45,164
Between the motors
you had about 5,000 litres of gasoline,

216
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,084
and that was burning very easily.

217
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:52,797
The advent of the Kammhuber Line,
and all that went with it,

218
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:58,052
was a startling sort of thing
to be confronted with,

219
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:04,058
because the German night defences
took a terrible toll of British bombers.

220
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,270
(aircrew singing "Home on the Range" )

221
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,691
(narrator) But now the RAF
was no longer alone.

222
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:33,796
Hiya, fellas. There's your birdseed
for Hitler. Come and get it.

223
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,472
(narrator) Throughout 1942,
the US Eighth Army Air Force

224
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,309
had been building up in England.

225
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,482
The American air chiefs
believed they could succeed in daylight

226
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,652
without suffering the losses
the British had done.

227
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:01,782
They were convinced
they could bomb accurately by day.

228
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,035
(man) Charlie's doing his twirl again.

229
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,287
(man #2)
Wish I had something like that.

230
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,956
(man) You guys wouldn't know
what to do with it.

231
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,336
Took six months to teach you
how to pull a trigger.

232
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,673
(man #3) Can the small talk.
You need to come home.

233
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:24,096
Their aircraff were very heavily armed.
Some carried up to 12 machine guns.

234
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:28,684
And they were trained
to fly in close formation.

235
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,979
(man) Formation flying
was really the name of the game

236
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,733
as far as the Eighth Air Force
was concerned.

237
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:41,239
There was never anything like it
happened before or since.

238
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:50,665
They actually were sort of making
their own rules up as they went along,

239
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,876
because it was just a brand-new concept.

240
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:59,423
You made it possible
to have a more concentrated firepower

241
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,177
from the gunner's positions
of all your aeroplanes.

242
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:10,268
The fact that you could depend
on good formation, tight formation,

243
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:17,942
not only helped you
in defence of fighter attack,

244
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:25,700
it made your chances of achieving
good bombing results much better.

245
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,537
Because if you're bombing,
a squadron of aeroplanes was bombing,

246
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,666
and the pattern was
a good, tight pattern,

247
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:39,213
your results were bound to be good.

248
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,967
(man) Bombs away.

249
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,512
(narrator) Early raids into France
bore out American optimism.

250
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:50,141
Later, over Germany,
it was a different story.

251
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,727
They found at first, yes, the bombers

252
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,521
could cope pretty well with the fighters

253
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,606
and take acceptable losses,

254
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,234
if penetrations were not too deep,

255
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,905
if they kept good formation and they had
supporting fire, one from the other.

256
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,825
But the Germans were learning too.

257
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,412
They learned how to make their attacks
and penetrate formations.

258
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,416
And they started the head-on attacks,
to try to get the leader

259
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,209
and spread the formation.

260
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,754
Once they got the formation spread out,

261
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,800
then they could pick the bombers off
at will. More or less, anyway.

262
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,568
(narrator)
But it was too early to admit defeat.

263
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:51,952
At night, the British bombers flew on,
hundreds at a time, but each on its own.

264
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:57,083
(man) We used to see them go over in
the early evening, one by one in trail,

265
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,002
l would not have changed places
for them.

266
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,840
l'd much rather have
the close formation, the firepower,

267
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,468
than go over the way they did.

268
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,180
(man #2) Flying with the RAF,
you were Single Charlie.

269
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,141
Just affer we'd crossed the Dutch coast,

270
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,560
l felt a terrific bang in my face.

271
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:22,441
The windscreen was shot away
and l'd been wounded in the forearm,

272
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:27,321
the shoulder and the head. The plane
went out of control temporarily.

273
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,704
l didn't see any sense
in saying that l'm wounded,

274
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:41,377
in case they all thought,
"He's going to pop off any minute now."

275
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,256
Again, the gun exploded
in the front of the plane beside us

276
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,593
and the shell hit the engineer
who stood beside me in the forearm.

277
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:54,849
And l had bits in my leg and they
sort of skinned the skin off my hand.

278
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,519
The port elevator had been shot off -

279
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,481
it keeps the plane straight,
on each side of the tail,

280
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,525
and the port one had been shot off.

281
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,486
This meant that you had
to hold the stick back, right back,

282
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,949
as if you're going to climb like this,
to keep the plane straight and level.

283
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:16,871
The bomb aimer had to help push it back
because this hand was pretty weak,

284
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,539
my shoulder had been hit

285
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,793
and it was keeping the stick back by
holding my hands in front.

286
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,963
And the engineer held it
with his other hand, his good arm.

287
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:30,426
So we held it, combined, back,
to keep the plane straight and level.

288
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,846
lt wasn't
a "press on regardless" feeling,

289
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:39,435
it was just a fact that
the four engines were still flying.

290
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,396
lf we'd had any engine cut,
l'd have thought,

291
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,690
"Well, we can't get any further."

292
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,651
But another factor here was,
had l turned back,

293
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,822
we'd have another 700 planes
that are more or less on the same track,

294
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,617
and spread something like
eight or ten miles broad

295
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,745
and maybe
four to six thousand feet deep.

296
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:04,043
And you're turning back right into them,
heading through this lot to get back.

297
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,672
And then again, had l turned off, say
at 90 degrees, to try and avoid them,

298
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,800
you're still turning across
quite a number of them.

299
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,346
Then l watched the target indicators
and opened the bomb doors

300
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,183
and kept the plane steady as l could
on the target indicators, and level.

301
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,769
This is one of the things
they made a fuss about,

302
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,230
that we'd a picture
of the target affer all this.

303
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:29,527
But as soon as we'd a picture taken,
l turned to head for base.

304
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,115
One of the things
l remember feeling on this trip

305
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,786
was that we had to get back,
because l knew we were wounded.

306
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,332
None of the other members could fly it,
even on normal straight and levels,

307
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,751
so to fly it at night
with one elevator gone,

308
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:50,297
and having the stick in your belly
and no instruments, as it were,

309
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,550
would've been pretty well impossible.

310
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:57,096
We were shot at a few times on the way
back, but we weren't hit again.

311
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,183
Eventually, we came over England,
when l saw these beacons flashing.

312
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:12,278
As it touched down, the legs
of the undercarriage collapsed.

313
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:16,282
We went along on our belly
for maybe 50 yards or so.

314
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,494
And came to a stop. Switched off
engines to keep the fire hazard down.

315
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,665
lt was then only, that l knew
the navigator was killed,

316
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,751
because he'd slid forward beside me.

317
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,436
(man) About how many enemy fighters
did you see?

318
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,355
(pilot) I couldn't keep track,
but I counted about 65.

319
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,609
(pilot #2) I stopped trying to count
when I got to 50, sir.

320
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,153
(man) l think
it was generally understood

321
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,156
that the combat tour was 25 missions,

322
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,992
because you'd be dead
by the end of that time,

323
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:04,246
so there wasn't any point
in asking you to stay around any longer.

324
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,082
(narrator)
Bomber crews lived a curious war.

325
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,627
One day in action, the next on the town.

326
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,504
When our group wasn't flying,

327
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,132
they'd usually go into London.

328
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,509
Spend the day in London.

329
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,846
And sometimes,
if they had some money leff,

330
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,267
they'd call up to find out if there
was a mission going the next day,

331
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,186
and if not, they'd stay over.

332
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,481
(man) Flak will be heavy,
probably accurate,

333
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,858
but you've been through worse before.

334
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:38,489
Remember that your biggest enemy
still is single-engine fighter planes.

335
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,414
l recall one evening
in the officers' club.

336
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,419
Our operations officer was pouring
Scotch into a one-armed bandit,

337
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,214
you know, these things
that you put quarters in,

338
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:59,468
trying to persuade the machine
to deliver a jackpot.

339
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:07,393
But... l guess it was a kind of an eat,
drink and be merry sort of life.

340
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,563
(♪ "American Patrol" by Glenn Miller)

341
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,699
The going's gonna be rough.

342
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:27,496
You'll have to pull your necks in there
and stay in there and pitch, every man.

343
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,651
(Corcoran)
l think that flying is so impersonal,

344
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,112
that is to say combat flying,

345
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,198
that you don't get
that intimate sense of loss

346
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,784
if you see an aeroplane get shot down

347
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,663
that you'd have
if your buddy on a battlefield

348
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,916
had his head blown off
right within arm's length.

349
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,966
(narrator) Men came from Britain,
America, Occupied Europe,

350
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,926
and the British Commonwealth

351
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,931
to fight and die in
the most determined air offensive yet.

352
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:32,519
ln January 1943, at Casablanca,
Churchill and Roosevelt

353
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,731
decided to combine
the British and US bombing efforts

354
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,442
in preparing Nazi Europe for D-day.

355
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,572
U-boat yards, aircraff plants...

356
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,284
..armament factories,

357
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,245
oil installations and transport,

358
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,542
were deemed priority targets
for round-the-clock precision bombing.

359
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,802
But precision bombing at night
was still impossible for Harris.

360
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,305
An attempt to pick off the Ruhr dams
with specially designed bombs

361
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,808
was only partially successful,

362
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,311
and cost the lives
of some of the best aircrews.

363
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:30,619
Though the raid led to improved accuracy
later on, not all the dams were hit.

364
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,414
Ruhr arms production was unaffected.

365
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,502
Harris believed that only the mounting
onslaught of night area bombing

366
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,588
would crush German industrial capacity.

367
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,008
(Mahaddie) At this time,
we were getting better aircraff.

368
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,636
The Lancaster
was coming out in great numbers.

369
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,975
We were losing the less efficient
Stirling and the Halifax.

370
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,394
We were getting better radar devices.

371
00:30:55,478 --> 00:31:01,316
And we had extremely good navigators,
selected navigators.

372
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,652
And this was the essence
of the whole thing.

373
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:09,241
And these navigators were able
to get much closer to an aiming point

374
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,326
than we had previously.

375
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:16,248
Then we laid great lanes of flares,
hundreds of flares.

376
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,417
Even if we missed the aiming point,

377
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:24,923
we would identify some
very positive feature on the ground,

378
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,427
like a lake or a bend in the river.

379
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,597
And from there,
we could then creep on to the target

380
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,726
and put flares down,
different coloured flares.

381
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,896
And then later on,
we got target indicators.

382
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:45,569
And these were... Just imagine
a great bunch of incandescent grapes

383
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:52,743
falling from 2,000, 4,000, wherever
we wanted them to detonate from.

384
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,913
(narrator) At the end of July 1943,

385
00:31:55,997 --> 00:32:01,335
Harris deployed his improving technology
with devastating effect on Hamburg.

386
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,339
(Harris) The effectiveness
of the first Hamburg raid

387
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:10,552
was due to us at last getting permission

388
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,056
to use something
we'd had in the bag for a long time,

389
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,683
which was known as "window",

390
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:21,730
which was the dropping
of clouds of aluminium paper strips,

391
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:27,569
which completely upset
not only the German location apparatus,

392
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,405
but also their gun-aiming apparatus.

393
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,512
(man) None of us,
neither civilians nor firemen,

394
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,765
knew what happened on this night.

395
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,142
lt was a very heavy raid,

396
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:04,856
but we had almost the same
one year before.

397
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,902
We were not prepared
for the fire storm

398
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,906
which broke out
half an hour affer the raid.

399
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,288
(narrator) The effect of the bombing,
combined with a heat wave,

400
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,750
was to create
a man-made tornado of flame.

401
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,919
A fire storm.

402
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,801
Und diese ganze Gegend
wurde von Kanälen...

403
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,721
(translator)
l went to this area near the docks.

404
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,889
lt was crossed by canals.

405
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,810
People tried to leap down into them
out of the flames,

406
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,062
but the water was on fire.

407
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,115
lt's difficult to explain
why the water was burning.

408
00:33:55,199 --> 00:34:00,495
There were many ships, small ships,
moored in the canals.

409
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,460
They had exploded, and burning oil
had been released onto the water.

410
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:13,175
And the people, who were themselves
on fire, jumped into it.

411
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:19,264
And they burnt, swam,
burnt and went under.

412
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:46,374
Most people
were killed by the fierce heat,

413
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:53,548
not burnt or suffocated
or poisoned by carbon monoxide.

414
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,343
We think that in some places,

415
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:02,516
the temperature
reached 1 ,000 degrees centigrade.

416
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,439
(narrator) The British night attacks
and American day raids

417
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,566
lasted nearly a week.

418
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,652
30,000 died.

419
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:20,200
ln Hamburg,
we really found out the first time

420
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:25,705
that the morale of the German people
can be shattered so much

421
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,251
that work for industry,

422
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:33,505
the work in the armaments industry,
would collapse.

423
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,930
(narrator) At the time, Speer said

424
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,892
six more raids like that
would have finished the war.

425
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,357
The Allies did not have that capacity.

426
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,320
The shock passed.

427
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,077
At the same time, the Eighth Air Force

428
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,874
had stepped up
the intensity of its daylight raids.

429
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,836
Next group will bomb
from an altitude of 13,000 feet.

430
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,549
We feel that this low altitude

431
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:22,137
will be equalised by the element
of surprise which is with us.

432
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:28,393
(narrator) Two weeks affer Hamburg,
they planned to deal their knockout blow

433
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,812
against German industry.

434
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,564
(man) Lights, please.

435
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:36,860
This group of buildings here
is your target.

436
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,030
This building will be the aiming point.

437
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,742
lf your bomb pattern
is concentrated in this area,

438
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,621
it should very effectively
knock out the factory.

439
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,416
(narrator) The target was the
ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt,

440
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,377
producing a major part
of Germany's needs.

441
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,260
The attacking force
was to be split into two.

442
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,012
The first wave would fight
to a secondary target,

443
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,599
the Messerschmitt aircraff plant
at Regensburg.

444
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,936
Then it would fly on unhindered
to North Africa.

445
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,647
The second wave,
ten minutes behind the first,

446
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,691
would then arrive at Schweinfurt,

447
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,152
whilst the German fighters
were on the ground refuelling.

448
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,322
Their battle
would be during the trip home.

449
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,411
(pilot) l went in
without any fighter escort at all,

450
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:14,291
and flew clear across Europe
without fighter escort,

451
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:19,587
with about 125 aeroplanes
that l had in the division at the time.

452
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:25,844
(narrator) German air defence staff
plotted the path of the first wave

453
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,764
as it flew further and further
into Germany.

454
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,852
They could not tell
the plan was going wrong.

455
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,522
British weather helped to upset
the Americans' careful plans.

456
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,026
Unexpected low cloud
delayed the takeoff of the second wave.

457
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,362
The result: the Luffwaffe,
refuelled and re-armed,

458
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,072
was waiting for them.

459
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,950
Well, we didn't expect an attack

460
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:53,371
coming that far into the country
without fighter escort.

461
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,666
And we were all very astonished.

462
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,798
(man) Null. Anfrage Viktor.

463
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:35,330
Schweinfurt was the result of very good
conditions in favour of German fighters,

464
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,625
and the fact
we could bring all our fighters

465
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,253
into operation
to intercept the bomber stream.

466
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:47,258
This altogether
has favoured our results.

467
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,475
(narrator)
21 Flying Fortresses were lost

468
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,187
before the first bomb fell
on Schweinfurt.

469
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,823
(Lemay) The first division,
coming in later, had heavier losses,

470
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,952
because they had to go back out
in addition to coming in.

471
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:18,164
l think we wound up the day
by losing about 60 aeroplanes,

472
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,085
which didn't make anybody very happy.

473
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,589
Ich kam dann noch mal hoch und bin
von unten ins Ziel und...

474
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,800
hat dann prima hingehauen.

475
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,496
(narrator) The cost was high.

476
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,625
But ball-bearing production
was disrupted for six weeks.

477
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,839
(Speer) When you hit Schweinfurt first,

478
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:12,552
it was a nightmare getting true.

479
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,806
But then, l had
a very good representative, Kessler,

480
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:21,769
and he did with all means,
not only the repair,

481
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:27,901
but also the replacement
of ball bearings with other devices

482
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,196
which could do the job,

483
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,449
not as good as a ball bearing,
but it could be done.

484
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,915
(narrator) ln the two-wave attack,

485
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,710
over 120 aircraff
were lost or damaged beyond repair.

486
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:50,507
To prove their point at Schweinfurt,
the Americans would have to go back.

487
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,635
Naturally, l was keenly disappointed,

488
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,971
largely because
in sending my crews back,

489
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,266
l knew they would sustain
additional losses.

490
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,019
lf we had done the job right
in the first place,

491
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,688
we could have avoided these losses.

492
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:11,319
But nobody who fires a gun
hits his target every time.

493
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,030
We went back
because we got good weather

494
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:17,116
and it was our highest priority target.

495
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,160
That's why we returned.

496
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:25,833
On 14th October, some 300 bombers
were marshalled over England.

497
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,046
(Rogan) There were aeroplanes
climbing all over England.

498
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,881
England was just an airport.

499
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:36,761
And this, l think, was real difficult.

500
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,181
(narrator) lt took some time

501
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:45,144
to group a large number
of heavy bombers into a tight formation.

502
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,690
These complicated manoeuvres
gave warning to the Luffwaffe

503
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,943
of the strength and direction
of an attacking force.

504
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,654
Two thirds of all German fighters

505
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,074
were now concentrated
against the Eighth Air Force.

506
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,535
(Stewart)
The fighter was the boogie man.

507
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:08,334
The fighter had eyes
and, in a great many instances,

508
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:14,299
the fighter had a pretty competent fella
at the controls.

509
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:21,848
And when he latched on to you,
you were in trouble lots of times.

510
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:26,561
l was that close
that l could really see the rear gunner.

511
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:31,441
l saw him as frightened as l was.

512
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:39,866
(Rogan) They'd call the positions
of the fighters out over their intercom.

513
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,993
Sometimes they'd get so frightened

514
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,996
that they'd continue
to hold the microphone down,

515
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,916
and keep hollering into the microphone.

516
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:56,966
And they started
at 1 ,000 metres, almost,

517
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,553
with their tracing ammunition,
in order to frighten us.

518
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:05,224
And l told my younger pilots,
who had no experience,

519
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,520
to close their eyes,
attacking from behind.

520
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,905
(Rogan) There wasn't much time
to think. You just put that gun sight on

521
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,867
and kept waving your head around
looking for enemy fighters

522
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,453
and kept the gun sight on 'em.

523
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,749
Pilot to navigator, what's the word?

524
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,459
We're making the run.

525
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,879
(Rogan) Right before we hit the target
was the worst part.

526
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,675
We got picked up by fighters, were
taken into the target and they leff,

527
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,096
and we dropped the bombs
and they picked us up affer the target.

528
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:50,019
(narrator) More than 60%
of all ball-bearing production

529
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,355
at Schweinfurt was destroyed.

530
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:56,734
The Americans had lost
more than 60 Flying Fortresses.

531
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,447
lf you would have repeated those raids
shortly afferwards,

532
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,034
it wouldn't have given us
the time to rebuild.

533
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,538
Then it would have been
a disastrous result.

534
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,873
Could you take the losses
the forces took

535
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,376
when you didn't know
if you'd accomplish it?

536
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,672
When you thought ball bearings were
coming in from Sweden and Switzerland?

537
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,508
You didn't know.
You don't go on with those things.

538
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:25,930
(narrator) So the strategy swung back
from pinpoint targets like Schweinfurt

539
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:30,518
to another night area offensive: Berlin.

540
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:35,648
With American support, Harris believed
he could wreck Berlin in six months

541
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,692
and win the war.

542
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:42,113
But the depleted Eighth Air Force
were not now able to join him.

543
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,993
He sent the most amazing signals.
And one that l'll always remember -

544
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:52,582
and this is the sort of thing
you read out to your crews at briefing -

545
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,376
this one went on to say:

546
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,838
"Tonight you go to the big city."
That's Berlin.

547
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:03,259
"You have the opportunity to light
a fire in the belly of the enemy

548
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,720
and burn his black heart out."

549
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,889
(cheering)

550
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,689
Well, crews, affer they stopped
cheering a thing like that,

551
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,733
they didn't want aircraff.

552
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,444
You could just fill their pockets
with bombs

553
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:25,823
and point them towards Berlin
and they'd take off on their own.

554
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,538
(narrator) Bomber Command
had to go on on its own.

555
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:38,252
lt was a long way, and the weather
at the end of 1943 was particularly bad.

556
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:42,423
But each night, the bombers
fought their way to Berlin

557
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,051
and other cities deep in Germany.

558
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:54,185
Harris' crews wrought terrible damage.

559
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,776
(newsreel) Berlin is getting
a real taste of total war.

560
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,196
The terrific weight of RAF assaults
on the capital of Naziland

561
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,572
has set the Hun reeling.

562
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,326
How he must regret the ruthless attacks
he made on Warsaw, Rotterdam,

563
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,079
Belgrade, London,
Coventry and the rest.

564
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,414
The day and night of reckoning is here.

565
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,583
And what do you think of it, Keith?

566
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,796
Jerry definitely had it this time.
lt certainly was a wizard prang.

567
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:37,895
(narrator) Yet many of Berlin's offices
and factories managed to go on working.

568
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:44,735
(Speer) ln my experience,
people rather got numb.

569
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,782
They were going through the streets
like shadows.

570
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,578
But they were still working
like automats.

571
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,649
(siren)

572
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,576
We had very little trouble
in getting there,

573
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,202
but one thing l did notice

574
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,414
was the vicious way
in which every German town

575
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:42,793
now seems
to throw up flak indiscriminately.

576
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,755
(narrator) The technological advantages

577
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,758
which prevailed over Hamburg
no longer applied.

578
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,512
The German air defence
had leapfrogged ahead once more.

579
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:04,190
Berlin looked as if
it would indeed remain Berlin.

580
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,068
(♪ "Berlin bleibt doch Berlin")

581
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:28,756
By early spring, 1944, Harris
had not totally destroyed the city.

582
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,834
Bomber Command had been
savagely mauled by the Germans.

583
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:09,296
ln those four months, in raids
against Berlin and other targets,

584
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:14,760
1 ,000 aircraff, the Command's
first-line strength, were lost.

585
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:19,140
But Harris did not,
and does not, concede defeat.

586
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,767
(Harris)
The casualties in the Battle of Berlin

587
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,104
were no more than we would have suffered

588
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:30,151
if we'd gone anywhere else in Germany,
deep into Germany.

589
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,862
People seem to forget
that Bomber Command

590
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,948
fought 1 ,000 battles during the war.

591
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,908
You can't succeed in every one.

592
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:42,288
l'm not saying the Battle of Berlin
was a defeat or anything like a defeat.

593
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:47,334
l think it was a major contribution
towards the defeat of Germany.

594
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:51,839
There were thousands
of heavy anti-aircraff guns,

595
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:56,552
millions of ammunition for them,

596
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,889
and hundreds of thousands of soldiers,

597
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:04,685
which were torn away
from our fight in the Eastern Front.

598
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:09,482
So l should say,
with air attacks on Germany,

599
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,402
you had, in an early stage, from '43 on,

600
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,030
really a so-called second front.

601
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:24,371
(narrator) Despite all the devastation,
the Germans carried on.

602
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,665
German industry was still supplying

603
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,960
the armies fighting fiercely
in the east and in ltaly.

604
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:34,965
The strategic bombing thesis
remained as yet unproven.

605
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:44,016
The lessons of Schweinfurt
had been well learnt by the Americans.

606
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:48,020
Re-equipped, they joined the RAF
over Berlin in March 1944.

607
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,397
But now they were escorted
by the Mustang,

608
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,692
a remarkable aeroplane
which was to change everything.

609
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,821
lt had a bomber's range
and a fighter's performance.

610
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,574
The German day fighter
had now met its match.

611
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,959
By the end of spring 1944,
the German day fighter had lost

612
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,962
where the Spitfire and Hurricane
had won.

613
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,674
The Americans had finally beaten
the Luffwaffe over daylight Europe

614
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,884
with their long-range fighters.

615
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:25,724
We had nothing of the same effort.

616
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,979
And l think
they frightened us quite a bit.

617
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,981
l think the main concern

618
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:36,068
was the quantities
in which they were showing up.

619
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:45,369
(narrator) The Germans had lost control
of their air space in daylight.

620
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:52,126
From now on, the Allies would be able to
launch day raids over Germany at will.

621
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:05,431
But, in March 1944,

622
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,268
both bomber forces were placed
under Eisenhower's overall command

623
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,604
to prepare for D-day.

624
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,606
There would be six months' respite

625
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,567
before the Allied bombers
could set out once more,

626
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:20,196
to break the will of the German people.
