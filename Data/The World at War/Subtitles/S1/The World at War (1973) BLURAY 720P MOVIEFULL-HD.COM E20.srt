1
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,286
(translator) What we went through
will be difticult to understand

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,413
even for our contemporaries,

3
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,665
and much more difticult for generations

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,044
that have no personal experience
from those days.

5
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:48,732
(narrator) The oftice of the National
Socialist Party in Munich in 1929.

6
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:53,529
The keen young clerk who now
comes forward has already been noticed.

7
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,366
He's marked for promotion,
for high responsibility.

8
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,035
He is Heinrich Himmler.

9
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,999
Himmler it is who refines
the philosophy of Nazism,

10
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,837
its ideas on politics and on race.

11
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:14,383
Hitler has appointed him
ReichsfÃ¼hrer of the SS.

12
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,136
(translator) When l wanted to sign up,

13
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,515
the man in charge asked me, "Were
you a soldier?" l said, "Yes, indeed."

14
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,810
"ln the First World War?"
"Yes, indeed."

15
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,312
"Do you have awards for bravery?"

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,732
"Yes, indeed."
"What do you have?"

17
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,443
Then l said,
"lron Cross, First and Second Class,

18
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,280
and l serVed in the
Hessian Lifeguard Regiment."

19
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:41,869
Then he said, "Well, just as there was
an elite guard in the Kaiser's time,

20
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:47,666
there is an elite guard now in the
new movement, and that is the SS."

21
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,670
"You should join the SS."

22
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,799
So l allowed myself to be persuaded

23
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:00,304
and thereby, if you like,
l came by fate to the SS

24
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,015
to be Himmler's adjutant.

25
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,192
(narrator) Himmler's dream
for his elite guard

26
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,027
had roots in the fabled past,

27
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:19,072
in the culture of an older,
Aryan Germany.

28
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,582
When the Nazis came to power in 1933,

29
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,418
he could put his ideas into practice.

30
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,172
(translator) Himmler had set out
to achieve a dream.

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,722
He would inspire a new awakening of the
Germanic race within the German people.

32
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,896
(narrator) Youth would achieve
the dream.

33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,946
Youth had the nerVe and the strength
that would be needed.

34
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,501
Fresh air, exercise, good food,

35
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,712
to build blood and bone and marrow.

36
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,679
There were no limits
to what healthy youth could do.

37
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,559
And the dream
had a pseudoscientific base -

38
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,480
Neo-Darwinism,
propagated in films like this.

39
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,108
"Only the fittest surVive."

40
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,988
"The weak go under."

41
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,452
That, after all, was the law of nature.

42
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,916
Farmers knew it perfectly well.

43
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,628
Horses were bred for pace
or for the plough.

44
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,091
Why not pedigree humans, too?

45
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:13,353
lt was time to develop a new race,
a better one - a race of supermen.

46
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,522
There was no harm in that.

47
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:19,067
(translator) We must see how we
could return to a more natural law,

48
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,195
but only ever through
positive racial thought -

49
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,782
how one can improve something
and breed it.

50
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,080
Never with the thought -
it never occurred to us -

51
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,500
that we might arrogantly
talk about exterminating anybody

52
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,754
who didn't happen to have been born
with a white skin,

53
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:44,134
or who was culturally inferior to us
or was undesirable.

54
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,184
(narrator) The SS -
the strongest, the purest, the fiercest.

55
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,978
They would do more than surVive.

56
00:05:55,063 --> 00:06:01,318
With Himmler at their head, they would
create a racially superior Europe.

57
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,200
(translator) The SS
was based on the Jesuit order,

58
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,621
which had been founded as
the elite guard of the Catholic Church.

59
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,831
And Himmler had taken much from this -

60
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,168
the hierarchy,
the strict selection and leadership,

61
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,545
and the punishments.

62
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:30,055
(narrator) Himmler himself
exacts the oath of obedience unto death.

63
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:38,355
(translator) They were conditioned
to see themselves as the sons of light,

64
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,942
that they were engaged in a struggle
against powers of darkness,

65
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:46,530
and that it was their duty to feel they
were at all times on duty for the nation

66
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,867
and, in a wider sense,
for the new order in Europe.

67
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,666
(narrator) "Arbeit Macht Frei."

68
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,964
"Work sets you free" on the gates
of Dachau, a model concentration camp.

69
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:08,385
The SS were Hitler's instrument of
terror in the creation of the new order.

70
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,596
lt was only logical
that they should run the camps.

71
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,604
Their first prisoners
were dissidents of the Nazi state -

72
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,816
political and religious,
as well as racial.

73
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,736
The SS schooled themselves in brutality,

74
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,449
systematically reducing their victims
to total subserVience,

75
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,326
depriving them of individuality.

76
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,745
No names.

77
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,373
Numbers.

78
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:47,257
September 1935. The Nuremberg Laws.

79
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:53,263
ln the Reichstag, GÃ¶ring spelled out the
purpose of the Reich Citizenship Act,

80
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:57,601
and the Act for the Protection
of German Blood and German Honour.

81
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,979
Pure must not mix with impure.

82
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,318
From now on, intermarriage was forbidden
and sex declared illegal

83
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,363
between pure Aryan and impure Jew.

84
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:15,785
Appealing to feelings and beliefs deep-
rooted in European Christian culture,

85
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,539
Nazi propaganda pilloried the dirty Jew.

86
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:24,753
Dishonest, scheming, money-lending
capitalist and subversive communist,

87
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,632
verminous, unclean, racially inferior:

88
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,593
"Jews are not wanted here".

89
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,845
But for leaders
seeking to unite a people,

90
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,432
they were mighty useful scapegoats
to unite against.

91
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,852
ln schools, the Jew-boys
stood by the blackboard

92
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,314
as their classmates
pointed out the difterence.

93
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:50,153
German schoolchildren were taught to
despise Jewish culture as soft and evil,

94
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,032
to be proud of their own strength,
their own purity.

95
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,248
From all over Germany,
the young converge on Landsberg,

96
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,208
the castle where, as a prisoner,

97
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,337
Hitler had first set out his theory
of a dominant Aryan race.

98
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,090
(men sing Nazi hymn)

99
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,813
Hitler had dreamed of a youth
as fierce as animals,

100
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,276
with Christian tenderness and other
degenerate soft mutations cleansed,

101
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,819
burned out of them.

102
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:35,073
Now that youth
was growing up to manhood.

103
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,244
November 1938.

104
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,790
The synagogues burned on Crystal Night.

105
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:55,844
The morning after, Jewish males
were marched oft to concentration camps.

106
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,472
The Jews were isolated, friendless.

107
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,142
lt was time to get out, if they could.

108
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,567
Not many countries
opened their doors to the Jews.

109
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,487
ln Germany, too, bureaucratic obstacles.

110
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,491
Emigrants paid stift charges
when they obtained permissions to leave

111
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,953
from state ofticials
such as Adolf Eichmann.

112
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,748
(translator) l asked Eichmann,

113
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,293
"Why don't you make it easier
for people who want to get out?"

114
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,380
"You want to get the Jews out,
they want to leave of their own accord."

115
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,758
Eichmann organised it.

116
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,720
And they actually did it
as l had envisaged it.

117
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,019
There was a representative
from the passport oftice,

118
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,521
one from the finance authorities,

119
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,192
one from the shipping oftices,
and transport representatives.

120
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,237
And this man, this poor Jewish man
who now wanted to emigrate,

121
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,365
could make the rounds in two hours

122
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,577
and could get all his confirmations
and could get out.

123
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,293
And, as l said - l really must say it -
Eichmann said to me once:

124
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:15,340
"You were actually the inventor of the
Central Oftice for Jewish Emigration."

125
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,804
(narrator) January 1939.

126
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:25,225
Hitler threatens a new solution
to the Jewish problem.

127
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,436
lf world Jewry drags Germany
into another war,

128
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,773
that will be the end of the Jews
in Europe.

129
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,660
September 1939.

130
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,538
Germany attacks Poland.

131
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,716
The victorious armies parade
through Warsaw.

132
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,305
Poland will be colonised. The population
are not Aryans, they're Slavs and Jews.

133
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,311
(translator) l remember in front,

134
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,982
there was a German band
with musical instruments.

135
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,484
For me, it was very nice.

136
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,570
l was happy.

137
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,281
l even remember that l clapped.

138
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:28,538
(narrator) German soldiers, aided by
some Poles, beat up Jews in the streets.

139
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,595
Nazi rule in Poland
is based at once on ruthless terror.

140
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:49,976
Any who resist, object, answer back,
risk instant execution.

141
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:56,399
There are public hangings
by the thousand.

142
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:10,455
The whole of Poland is on the move
to be resettled on a racial basis -

143
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,957
those of German origin to Germany,

144
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,877
the Poles themselves
to designated areas,

145
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,714
a workforce without rights
in their own country.

146
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,510
At the bottom of the heap, the Jews.

147
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,722
By order, they will wear
the Star of David at all times.

148
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,934
There are heavy penalties
for not doing so.

149
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,567
Wearing it, they're easily identified.

150
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,114
"The Jews started the war."

151
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,826
"Now let them clear up the mess."

152
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,793
German newsreel cameras
could show people back home

153
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:01,381
that Jews at last were being made
to do an honest day's work

154
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,342
to earn their daily bread.

155
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,807
(translator) My mother,
may her soul rest in peace,

156
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,977
asked me to go to the bakery
and stand there the whole night

157
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,645
to get a loaf of bread

158
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,816
so that there would be something to eat
at home the next day.

159
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:26,406
When l arrived, there were already
masses of people standing in line.

160
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,995
Among us, there were little children -
non-Jews, Poles - running around.

161
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,330
They pointed at each and every person,

162
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:39,836
"That's a Jew. That's a Jew.
Das Jude. Das Jude. Das Jude."

163
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,591
So that these people would be
taken out of line and not get bread.

164
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,719
My turn came.

165
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,389
l turned around and saw that the boy
was a friend with whom l played.

166
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,183
l said to him in Polish,
"What are you doing?"

167
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,561
His answer was,
"l'm not your friend.

168
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,981
You're a Jew. l don't know you."

169
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,527
(narrator) ln 1940,
Germany struck west.

170
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,280
The SS went too.

171
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,165
Here again, a brutal terror.

172
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,879
Less so, however,
than in eastern Europe.

173
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,882
Many in the west were Aryans too.

174
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,595
ln Poland, in 1940 and '41 ,

175
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,933
Jews were ordered
into recreated medieval ghettos.

176
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,561
(translator) We took a small cart.
l, with my father,

177
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,439
built a small cart and we began to move.

178
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,360
Thousands and thousands, tens
of thousands of people, were walking,

179
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:50,615
taking their belongings with them, some
on their heads, their backs, shoulders.

180
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,202
There were children,
old people, babies, all of them,

181
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,537
like the exile of the peoples,

182
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,540
the exile from Egypt.

183
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:14,681
(narrator) The ghettos were closed oft
behind wire and long, high walls.

184
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,143
ln Warsaw, a road divided the ghetto
in two

185
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,939
with a bridge over it
for the Jews to cross by.

186
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,405
(female translator) There were
only two water pits in the ghetto.

187
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,614
The ghetto was small.

188
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:38,079
When they brought us into the ghetto,
they put three families into one room.

189
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:45,378
ln one room, three families
with children. We never slept.

190
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,394
(narrator) StarVation rations.

191
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,817
Harsh punishments for smuggling food.

192
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,499
For resistance or attempts to escape,

193
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,877
public execution.

194
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,898
June 1941 .

195
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,484
Germany attacks Russia.

196
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,945
SS shock troops in the first wave.

197
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,826
Another racial war, more resettlement,

198
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,330
mass deportations, forced emigrations.

199
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,834
War against subhumans,
against Slavs and against Jews.

200
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,587
Millions of Jews.

201
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,550
(translator) We found a round figure
of three million Jews in Poland,

202
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,762
then immediately after that
came the Russian campaign

203
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,182
and we found another
five million Jews in Russia.

204
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,852
How on earth should we manage
to emigrate this eight million

205
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,272
by using these long and tiresome
ofticial methods?

206
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,069
Now, with the war, we were cut oft.
We had no way out.

207
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,656
(narrator) To be rid of so many Jews...

208
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,411
only one alternative left:
kill them all.

209
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,623
The job was begun
by SS execution squads,

210
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,792
Einsatzgruppen.

211
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,418
(gunshot)

212
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,590
(translator) They're shooting.

213
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,139
People are already lying dead.

214
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,474
My daughter was in my arms
the whole time.

215
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,185
Somehow, l found the strength
to carry her.

216
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,439
She was so close to me that
l couldn't undress. She wouldn't let me.

217
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:17,029
She said, "Let's run away. They're
killing us. Why do we just stand here?"

218
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,449
"Why do people stand and not run away?
Why are they standing?"

219
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,702
l said to her...
l could not really speak.

220
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,414
l think l said,
"Where are we going to run to?"

221
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,002
Some people did start to escape,
but they didn't let them.

222
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,925
There were many Germans guarding us.
There were many Germans.

223
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,138
Not only Germans, they even
got non-Jews from the towns together

224
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,640
to guard that we shouldn't escape.

225
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,101
There were some sort of policemen there.

226
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,397
So we undressed.
There was no alternative.

227
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,493
There were about 500 people altogether.

228
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,746
Our turn came.

229
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,583
l came up and saw how my father went,

230
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,003
how my mother is shot,

231
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,174
how my sisters are shot.

232
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,553
My sister was very pretty -
absolutely beautiful.

233
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:27,475
The German looked into her eyes
and she pleaded with him to let her go:

234
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,312
"Don't kill me. Just let me live."

235
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,233
Nothing helped. She was shot.

236
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,324
Then l, with my daughter in my arms,
came up.

237
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,828
He told me to put her down.
l wanted to, but she wouldn't let me.

238
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:53,167
She hid her head so as not to see
what was being done with her.

239
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:58,089
He forcibly, as far as l can remember,
took her, stood her up.

240
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,635
He shot, or didn't shoot.

241
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,554
l neither saw nor heard.

242
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,848
Then he shot me.

243
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,560
l stood there and heard a shot.

244
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,355
lt didn't touch me.

245
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,649
Then again, a shot.

246
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,818
l fell.

247
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,697
l am lying in the pit

248
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,492
and l feel that l do feel something.

249
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:31,664
l didn't believe - l couldn't believe -
that l'm alive.

250
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,836
l was lying in a pit of blood,

251
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,006
a pit full of blood.

252
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,178
This is how l lay the whole night,
under corpses.

253
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,389
(narrator) ln August 1941 ,

254
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:53,602
Himmler visited
a concentration centre near Minsk.

255
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,326
lt was crowded with Jews,
Russian prisoners of war

256
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,911
and others who were to die.

257
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,791
The SS ReichsfÃ¼hrer asked to see
for himself how the killing was done.

258
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,628
(translator) And there,
an open grave had been dug.

259
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,801
They had to jump into this
and lie face downwards.

260
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,180
And sometimes, when one or two rows
had already been shot,

261
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,933
they had to lie on the people
who'd been shot

262
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:37,063
and then they were shot
from the edge of the grave.

263
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,445
And Himmler had never seen
dead people before,

264
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,532
and, in his curiosity, he stood right up
at the edge of this open grave -

265
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:52,370
a sort of triangular hole -
and was looking in.

266
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,708
While he was looking in,
Himmler had the deserVed bad luck

267
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,878
that from one or other of those
who'd been shot in the head,

268
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,422
he got a splash of brains on his coat,

269
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,592
and l think it also splashed
onto his face.

270
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,347
And he went very green and pale.

271
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,933
He wasn't actually sick,

272
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,146
but he was heaving
and turned around and swayed.

273
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,527
And then l had to jump forward
and hold him steady,

274
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,072
and then l led him away
from the grave.

275
00:23:43,004 --> 00:24:03,732
(gunshot)

276
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,451
(translator) After the shooting,

277
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,997
Himmler gathered
the shooting commanders.

278
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:24,086
Standing up in his car so he'd be higher
and be able to see the whole unit,

279
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,172
he made a speech.

280
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,801
He could not relieve them of this duty.
He could not spare them.

281
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:35,514
ln the interests of the Reich -
in this planned thousand-year Reich -

282
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,310
in its first decisive great war
after the takeover of power,

283
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,228
they must do their duty.

284
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:58,204
(narrator) But shooting was messy,
distressing, inefticient.

285
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:02,124
So vast an undertaking
required careful planning.

286
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,877
At Wannsee in January 1942,

287
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,797
Himmler's deputy, Heydrich,
convened a conference.

288
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,718
Senior civil serVants attended
from various departments of state.

289
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,889
There were representatives of the
ministries of justice and of transport.

290
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:21,143
Formal minutes were kept,
and lists of Jews, country by country -

291
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,439
in Poland, over two million,
in Norway, 1300,

292
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,150
England, 330,000,

293
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,486
Russia, five million.

294
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,781
Grand total: over 1 1 million.

295
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,911
Eichmann, with his experience
in transportation,

296
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,163
was appointed permanent administrator

297
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,959
for this final solution
of the Jewish problem.

298
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:51,090
lt had been decided that all the Jews
in Europe were to be gassed.

299
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,845
All Occupied Europe
had a concentration-camp system

300
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,058
based on the model camp, Dachau.

301
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,894
The camps were not only
an instrument of terror,

302
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,064
they were an important factor
in war production,

303
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,484
each with its cluster of labour camps
attached.

304
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,239
Now, they were also to be the means
of the Final Solution.

305
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:19,159
ln the occupied east,
new camps were specially built

306
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,538
and old ones
equipped with new industrial capacity.

307
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,375
They were to be machines
to kill human beings by the million,

308
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:30,754
utilise the by-products,
dispose of the waste.

309
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,842
The camps were sited on railway routes
to facilitate transportation.

310
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:39,680
Eichmann chartered rolling stock
from the state railways.

311
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:44,435
The biggest camp was built astride the
main railway line from Cracow to Vienna,

312
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,147
in the outskirts of the Polish town
of OÅwiÄcim -

313
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,982
Auschwitz.

314
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:56,488
ln summer 1942, Himmler visited
Auschwitz to inspect progress,

315
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00,367
to see for himself
how things were getting on.

316
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,579
Work was under way.

317
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,540
Manufacturers' tenders
had been called for, choices made.

318
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,417
Plans and architects' drawings

319
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,796
for the new combined gas chambers
and crematoriums were ready,

320
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:19,136
with their carefully designed chimneys
and specially patented furnaces.

321
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,278
Outside, construction workers -
slave labourers -

322
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,656
were striving to keep to their schedules

323
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,533
in the warm summer weather.

324
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,582
The gassing would be done
with poisoned pellets

325
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,377
developed from a commercial pesticide,
Zyklon B.

326
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,463
The pellets were shaken
through a roof grille.

327
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,841
Exposed to the air,
they gave oft cyanide gas.

328
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,972
ln the occupied territories,
the roundups began.

329
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,327
ln some countries - this is Holland -
no stampede.

330
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:29,498
The Jews gathered for resettlement
in orderly fashion,

331
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:33,127
the order of their going
worked out by their community leaders.

332
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,256
Behind it all, the SS and the Gestapo.

333
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,094
Jews everywhere were told -
and they were ready to believe -

334
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,140
they were being transported
for resettlement.

335
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:51,270
ln the starVing ghettos of the east,
those who volunteered to go got bread.

336
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:56,900
To escape starVation, they willingly
paid railway fares for the journey.

337
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:10,205
Bewildered, under armed guard,
they walked to the station.

338
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,251
The cattle trucks were waiting.

339
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:18,088
There were soldiers on the platform.

340
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,216
They climbed aboard.

341
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,596
(translator) The minute we got in, the
minute they closed it on us with a bolt,

342
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,140
terrible cries began inside

343
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,685
in Polish, Yiddish, German -

344
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,854
pleading, requests:

345
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,982
"There's no air. We're suftocating."

346
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,277
"Suftocating. Suftocating."

347
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,616
Here suddenly you had a hell on wheels,

348
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,660
and people suddenly stopped
to be preoccupied

349
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,079
either with the past or with the future,

350
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,999
but with surViving the journey.

351
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,924
(translator) The first to faint were
children, women, old men and women.

352
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,969
They all fell down like flies,
exactly like flies.

353
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,682
Father was standing next to me.

354
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,978
All of a sudden, l see that
he is falling. He has collapsed.

355
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,356
l cried, "Father, Father!"

356
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,868
Then l found a piece of wood
on the floor of the wagon.

357
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,664
l got up and began to beat
with the piece of wood.

358
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:37,292
lt was a club or something.

359
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,881
l began to beat the people who were
standing around me in the wagon

360
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:48,178
so that they would make room for Father,
so that Father could get up.

361
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,765
l remember that l didn't care
about the suftering of others,

362
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,559
their cries, their threats,

363
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,103
only that Father should get up.

364
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:10,742
We had read the name of Auschwitz
on the label on the trucks -

365
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,246
in the trucks or the wagons. Trucks.

366
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:21,378
But nobody of us knew
what Auschwitz meant.

367
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:31,889
(man) l could see two rows
of barbed wire

368
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,224
which were obviously electrical.

369
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:41,273
And then l saw a row of people
with carbines

370
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,776
and a row of dogs -
very disciplined dogs.

371
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,488
And l was more amused
than uneasy.

372
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,868
l didn't think they would shoot me
because l couldn't see a reason.

373
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,833
(translator) The car was opened.
They undid the bolt.

374
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:05,213
The first moment it was opened,
there was a sudden gust of air.

375
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:10,052
lt was good. We began to
throw out the dead bodies.

376
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,765
But all of a sudden,
there were voices:

377
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,517
"Raus, raus.
Schnell, schnell, schnell."

378
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,103
"Quick, quick. Out, out, out."

379
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,900
l was afraid then for the first time,
and you know why?

380
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,695
There were flames until the sky

381
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,866
and a strange smell.

382
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:38,246
The smell l remember from home when
my mother burns on Friday a chicken.

383
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:46,213
(narrator) On the platform to greet
them, an SS reception committee.

384
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,508
New arrivals were divided
into two columns.

385
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,136
A quick medical inspection
by the camp doctors.

386
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,764
Those fit to work were put to one side.

387
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,360
ln the other column, all the rest -

388
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,529
the old,

389
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,406
the sick,

390
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,658
the lame,

391
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,244
pregnant mothers,

392
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,329
women with children.

393
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,920
Some suspect the worst.
Most have no idea.

394
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,299
(Rudolf Vrba)
The idea of a mother being told,

395
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,804
after this terrible journey,
that her children are going to be gassed

396
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,890
was an utter outrageous idea
in her mind,

397
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,685
because after all that she'd suftered,

398
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,439
here comes a gangster
who wants to increase her suftering.

399
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:50,527
So she was tempted to go immediately
to the next neat ofticer

400
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:56,992
and say, "This man says, sir, that
my children are going to be gassed."

401
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,704
And he says, "Madam,
do you think we are barbarians?"

402
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,754
(narrator) Those to be gassed
were told they would be deloused

403
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,631
in the showers before starting work,

404
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,718
then they would rejoin their families.

405
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,474
They waited their turn,
sometimes for hours.

406
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,812
(translator) HÃ¶blinger said to me,
"You are interested in the actions?"

407
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,149
l said, "Yes, very interested indeed."

408
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,319
He said, "l'll take you with me
this evening."

409
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,116
The new arrivals had to get undressed.

410
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,328
When a certain number had gone inside,
they shut the doors.

411
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,456
And that happened three times.

412
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,462
Every time, HÃ¶blinger had to go out to
his ambulance and they took out a tin.

413
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,632
One of the SS BiockfÃ¼hrers did that.

414
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,137
Then he climbed up the ladder
and at the top there was a round hole,

415
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:04,601
and he opened a little iron door
and held the tin there and shook it.

416
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,978
And then he shut the little door again.

417
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,523
Then a fearful screaming started up.

418
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:15,403
Approximately, l would reckon, after
about ten minutes, it slowly went quiet.

419
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:21,034
l said to HÃ¶blinger, "Can we get nearer
when they're taken out?" We went closer.

420
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,621
They opened the door - that was
the prisoners' squad who did that -

421
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,665
then a blue haze came out.

422
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,334
And l looked in and l saw a pyramid.

423
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,964
They'd all climbed on top of each other
until the last one stood on the top.

424
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:40,262
All one on top of the other. lt was a
pointed heap. lt all came up to a point.

425
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,851
And then the prisoners
had to go in and tear it apart.

426
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:57,195
They had to tug and pull very hard
to disentangle all these people.

427
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,492
Then we went back to the hall and it was
the turn of the last lot to undress -

428
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,996
the ones who'd managed
to hang back a bit all the time.

429
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,458
The prisoners had to check where small
children had been hidden and covered up.

430
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:15,922
They pulled them out and opened
the doors quickly again and whoosh,

431
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,509
they threw all the children in
and slammed the doors.

432
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,179
"Oh, ugh! l'm going to be sick," l said.

433
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:27,392
"l've never seen anything like it
in my life. lt's absolutely terrible."

434
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:31,605
lmagine, when they threw the children
in, how the people inside screamed

435
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,900
because then they suddenly realised
what was happening.

436
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:39,779
And l said, "Karl, can we leave soon?
l can't stand it any more."

437
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:44,284
And he said,
"You do get used to anything in time."

438
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,876
(narrator) A few - the strong,
the young -

439
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,879
would work till they died.

440
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,926
Some would die of exhaustion,
some were beaten to death,

441
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,431
some, too weak to work another day,
were gassed in their turn.

442
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,684
And prisoners had other uses -

443
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,146
medical experiments.

444
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:27,953
Some, their hearts broken,
chose to die on the electrified wire.

445
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:33,833
Outside that wire, SS men,
free to go home to their families

446
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,628
at the end of the day's work.

447
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:44,135
And l remember when we passed
10,000 naked women on a frosty morning,

448
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,305
already sorted out, you see,
and put on the lorries.

449
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,016
And they knew -
they were all prisoners already -

450
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:54,271
and they knew that they are now going
to the gas chamber, and they were quiet.

451
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:58,900
Somehow, people were accustomed
to live with the moment,

452
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,236
with the knowledge that death will come.

453
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:05,115
But when the motors started -
you know, this noise -

454
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,367
this created a panic between the women,

455
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:12,038
and a terrible noise
went up from those lorries, you see.

456
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,791
The death cry of thousands
of young women

457
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,795
who were already reduced
to skeletons, and their...

458
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:24,301
their futile attempts, which they knew
by any logic that they can't succeed,

459
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,138
to jump out from the lorries
which take them to the gas chambers

460
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,224
which are only, perhaps,
less than a mile away,

461
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:36,229
and which were already stoked and the
fire was coming out from the chimneys.

462
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,648
This means everything was prepared.

463
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,278
This was the moment
when the rabbi's son spoke to his God:

464
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:47,032
"God, show them your power."

465
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,242
"This is against you."

466
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,411
And nothing happened.

467
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,872
And then he said, "There is no God."

468
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,796
(translator) We used to say, "Where is
the world? Where is the United States?"

469
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,716
"Where is Russia?"

470
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,220
"Do they know what is happening here
in the extermination camps at all?"

471
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,352
There had, of course,
been only too much evidence

472
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:21,858
of the persecution of the Jews, before
the war began, in Hitlerite Germany.

473
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,861
And then, as the war progressed,

474
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:29,199
some horrifying reports
began to come out.

475
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:36,748
At first it was very difticult,
naturally, to assess their accuracy.

476
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:41,044
They were, indeed, so horrible that it
was hard to believe they could be true.

477
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,468
(narrator) Among the working prisoners,
a resistance movement.

478
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:53,264
They smuggled out photographs with
a plea to the great powers for help.

479
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:59,813
The evidence was so extensive,
one could hardly fail to give it credit,

480
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,024
and we decided that
one of the things we must do

481
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,611
was to make a joint statement

482
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:10,782
in each of our capitals
at the same time,

483
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,201
declaring what our information was

484
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,621
and what this horror was
that was being perpetrated,

485
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:21,042
and also making plain
our detestation of it

486
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,045
and our determination
that those responsible for it

487
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,091
should be punished
when the war was over.

488
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,970
And that we got agreement upon
after some negotiation,

489
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,849
and it was near the end of 1942

490
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,561
when l made the statement
in the House of Commons

491
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:46,317
with, l must say, a dramatic eftect far
exceeding anything that l'd expected.

492
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,904
And the Speaker -
a very fine speaker, Algy FitzRoy -

493
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,990
he got up and he said,

494
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:56,161
"lt is for the House to rise if it
so wishes to express its feelings."

495
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:01,332
And the whole House got up. Lloyd
George came to me afterwards and said:

496
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:05,503
"ln all my years in parliament,
l have never seen anything like this."

497
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,964
He was deeply impressed, and so was l.

498
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:11,050
Well, that was something
that we could do.

499
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,512
(narrator) ln April 1943,

500
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,056
the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto rose,

501
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,478
led by young men and women
who knew the truth about resettlement,

502
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,189
and determined to fight.

503
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,692
They had pitifully few arms.

504
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,111
They fought bravely.

505
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:37,952
lt took the Germans 33 days
to crush the ghetto.

506
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,750
The surVivors were marched oft
to share the fate of those who had gone,

507
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,753
unresisting, before them.

508
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,298
Theresienstadt.

509
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:56,971
The Nazi cover story - resettlement in
the east - was elaborately documented.

510
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,307
This propaganda film made in 1943

511
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:03,436
was designed to show the German public
and the lnternational Red Cross

512
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:08,066
what conditions in the resettlement
camps were really like.

513
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,486
By the time this film was released,

514
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,697
most of the people seen here
were already dead

515
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,617
in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.

516
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,705
By 1944, the Germans
were losing the war.

517
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,291
The SS speeded up the rate of killing.

518
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,923
The railway tracks
now led straight to the gas chambers.

519
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:37,971
And still the trains rolled in
from ltaly, from Greece, from Hungary.

520
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,767
(translator) They took us
to Crematoria lll and lV.

521
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,396
There we saw hell on this earth -

522
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,941
large piles of dead people,

523
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,530
and people dragging these bodies
to a long pit,

524
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,410
about 30 metres in length
and 10 metres in width.

525
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:05,081
There was a huge fire there
made of trees.

526
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:11,421
On the other side, fat was being
taken out of this pit with a bucket.

527
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,383
We immediately had to begin working.

528
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,928
Four people would take hold
of one dead person.

529
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:25,101
But the SS came and said,
"No. Each one of you will take one."

530
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,399
He showed us how
with a simple walking stick.

531
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,484
One was to take the body under the chin,

532
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,904
put the stick on the neck
and drag the body to the pit,

533
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,491
like you would drag a rag
or a piece of wood.

534
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:46,873
At the edge of the pit, were still more
people who pushed the dead into the pit.

535
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:53,046
Some of our group threw themselves
and jumped into the pit alive.

536
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:59,385
They apparently thought it better to be
burned alive rather than do such a job.

537
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,141
There were only four or five SS men
altogether.

538
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:12,231
They were so well-organised that there
were just four or five of them with us.

539
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:19,280
But there were electric fences, and
beyond this fence there were SS guards.

540
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,449
Escape was impossible.

541
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:31,084
After a week, they suddenly
took me one night to Crematorium l.

542
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,712
There, the whole job
was more mechanical.

543
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:40,176
All around, there were
water installations as if for showers.

544
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:47,558
Everyone crowded around these showers.
They still didn't know.

545
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:54,023
Some who did not dare to believe
that they were going to be poisoned.

546
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:59,696
They would put about two thousand,
two and a half thousand people in there.

547
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,699
lf there wasn't room,
the small children would be thrown

548
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,827
on top of the people's heads.

549
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,955
There were invalids.

550
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,209
They would take out their serVice cards
showing that they had fought in WWl

551
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:17,547
with all kinds of distinctions and
medals which they had from that time.

552
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,968
They shouted, "We fought for Germany,
now they're going to burn us, kill us."

553
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:26,556
"This is impossible.
We protest against such a thing."

554
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,517
But everyone just laughed at them.

555
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,603
They didn't take it seriously,
these SS men.

556
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,398
They laughed at the whole thing.

557
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:41,070
There were invalids l helped to undress
as they couldn't do it by themselves.

558
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:45,408
There were many of us who helped.
l would talk to these people.

559
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,661
There were cases
where l saw acquaintances.

560
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:53,332
My heart wouldn't let me walk over
to them to let them recognise me.

561
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:59,005
No one who hasn't gone through such
a thing can imagine the will to live,

562
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,549
what a moment of life is.

563
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,011
Every person, without exception,

564
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:09,766
is capable of doing the worst things
just to live another minute.

565
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:25,364
Many women miscarried
during the poisoning.

566
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,577
People hit each other.
People scratched with their nails.

567
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,163
There were fingernail marks on people.

568
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,418
Everyone wanted to surVive,
but it was impossible there.

569
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,594
We went in to take out all the corpses.

570
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:50,223
We took them up by lifts to the ovens.

571
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:59,690
Near the ovens upstairs, there was a man
who removed gold teeth and false teeth.

572
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,693
They would shave the women's hair

573
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:07,490
and look for valuables in
the most intimate of places,

574
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,284
especially on the women.

575
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:14,580
ln the oven,
it took 15 minutes to burn them.

576
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:19,502
Only a few ashes were left
from all those corpses.

577
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,589
(narrator) The industry of death
had useful by-products.

578
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,343
Women's hair was packed in bales,
gold teeth melted down,

579
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:33,307
artificial limbs and spectacle lenses
recycled for the German war machine.

580
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,476
lt all helped.

581
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,404
ln July 1944,

582
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,867
the Russians liberated Lublin
in eastern Poland.

583
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:55,079
Close by, they found
the extermination camp at Majdanek,

584
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,957
where tens of thousands had died.

585
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,509
The proofs of horror were all too clear.

586
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,430
Only 170 miles away,

587
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:16,058
the ovens of Auschwitz
were busier than ever.

588
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,230
(translator) There were two shifts
at work,

589
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:25,026
from six in the morning to six at night.

590
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,867
l was present when they brought
the Gypsies one night for burning,

591
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,202
for poisoning.

592
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,788
lt was a terrible sight.

593
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,253
There were cries to the sky.

594
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,054
The cries in the bunker,
in the crematorium,

595
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,223
in the gas chamber, were horrible.

596
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,393
Horrible.

597
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,231
l still wonder today
how God didn't hear these cries.

598
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,738
(narrator) The German army
was now retreating on all fronts,

599
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,783
leaving fire and destruction behind.

600
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,702
lt tried to destroy evidence
of the camps,

601
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,790
pulling up railway lines,
dismantling equipment.

602
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:35,388
Yet even now, Himmler urged
the master race to fight on.

603
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:39,517
Defeat was unthinkable,
their task unfinished.

604
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:47,358
(translator) Eichmann said at that time
six million people had been killed,

605
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:52,530
four million in concentration camps
and similar setups,

606
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:58,411
and two million by shooting -
Einsatzkommandos.

607
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,539
And he told me at that time...
lt was fantastic, really.

608
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:06,460
l had thought a lot of people
had been killed, but six million?

609
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:11,716
Well, he said - and just imagine,
that was still too few for Himmler.

610
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,719
Himmler said to me,
"'There must be more than that."'

611
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,054
And he set up his own statistics unit -

612
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:21,225
today, one would say computer people -
who were to check up on this.

613
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:27,606
(narrator) The Russians reached
Auschwitz in January 1945.

614
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,570
The Germans had moved most
of the surViving prisoners back west,

615
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,196
into Germany.

616
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,409
Some, too old or too sick to be moved,
remained.

617
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,975
And there were the relics and belongings
of those who had been brought here.

618
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,946
Then rescuers reached
the camps in Germany itself,

619
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,656
where, by now,

620
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:22,286
the surVivors of the extermination
camps had been abandoned.

621
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:40,679
They found the stench of rotting
corpses, cholera, typhus.

622
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,643
Many who were rescued
were too weak to surVive.

623
00:51:56,571 --> 00:52:00,991
Some lived to bear witness.

624
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:06,622
(translator) When the Americans
entered, l weighed 42 kilos.

625
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,125
l was skin and bones.

626
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,506
l walked around the camp naked.

627
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,425
l had a belt with a plate,

628
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,138
spoon and revolver.

629
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,475
This was all my property
after the liberation.

630
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,796
l bless every day
that l continue to live,

631
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,966
because every day that l live
is pure profit.

632
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,304
l could say that today l'm 27 years old.

633
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,598
The years before the camp don't count,

634
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:11,228
as l was dead in the camp
and reborn after the liberation.

635
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:22,492
