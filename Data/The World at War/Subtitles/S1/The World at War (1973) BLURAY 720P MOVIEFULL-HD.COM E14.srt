1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,767
(narrator) Monsoon in Burma.

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,732
(man) lf you can imagine the heaviest
rain you'd ever get in this country

3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:30,571
going on for six to eight weeks without
a break, this was monsoon period.

4
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,866
(narrator) Five months in every year.

5
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:39,663
(man #2) Squashing through mud, living
in mud, lying in mud and sleeping in mud

6
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,124
and drinking in mud and eating in mud.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,794
That was the monsoon in Burma,
and it's just a nightmare.

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:53,010
(narrator) War in Burma made up
in ferocity what it lacked in scale.

9
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:58,182
Here, in 1944, in these conditions,

10
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:04,396
the British were defending the frontiers
of lndia against the Japanese.

11
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,039
(bird calls)

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,097
(narrator) The Burmese jungle -
a steam bath, closing out the sky.

13
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:26,478
Dense, imprisoning...
and a long way from home.

14
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,066
l'd never seen a jungle. l'd seen
a forest, but l hadn't seen a jungle.

15
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:36,864
We went in there,
it was dark, dirty, damp, rain,

16
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,034
there were all sorts of animal noises
that we'd never heard before...

17
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,203
ln fact, it was really scary.

18
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,997
l liked the jungle.

19
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:50,878
lt did not have the fear it seems
to have had for some Allied soldiers.

20
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,007
lt was a friendly place - dark,
where you could camouflage yourself.

21
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,222
(narrator) Burma:
jagged mountain and fetid swamp,

22
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:07,144
clothed in jungle
and scored by steep river valleys.

23
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,486
Burma: endless green growth
spawning every kind of disease -

24
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,991
malaria, dysentery, scrub typhus,

25
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,995
dengue fever, prickly heat -

26
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,415
particularly in monsoon.

27
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,715
Mud. lt might have been Flanders
in the First World War.

28
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:44,223
The monsoon in Burma turned camps
into swamps, roads into quagmires.

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,316
Affer the rains, the country
was just one great bowl of mud.

30
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,449
For the British,
Burma was a shield and barrier

31
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,786
protecting their lndian empire.

32
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,497
The Japanese saw they could use Burma

33
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,749
to screen their new territorial gains

34
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,459
in Southeast Asia,

35
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,295
to cut the Allied supply route
to China,

36
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,341
and to secure new sources
of oil and rice.

37
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,678
ln December 1941 , they invaded.

38
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,055
They had the advantage of surprise,

39
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,977
and, for this jungle war,
they were thoroughly prepared.

40
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,229
l don't think any country

41
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,316
could have been more unprepared for war

42
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,278
than Burma was at this particular time.

43
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,488
The government was unprepared,

44
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:46,285
the civil organisation
and the people were unprepared,

45
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:51,456
and the defence forces
practically didn't exist.

46
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:57,546
Some of the Gurkha who came along had
400 recruits straight from the depot,

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,885
and the British had been milked
of reinforcements and officers to Europe

48
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,723
and, you might say,
only the dull leff behind.

49
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,817
(narrator) The Japanese from the start
swept all before them.

50
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,783
They used the jungle
to outmarch and outmanoeuvre

51
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,037
Britain's weak Burma army.

52
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,546
The British retreated in confusion.

53
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:51,350
lt was a crashing disadvantage to me
in the 1942 campaign

54
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,269
in that l hadn't got a wireless set

55
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:59,733
which would contact
my air support in Rangoon,

56
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,194
and, therefore, believe it or not,

57
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,989
the only thing l could do was to tap in

58
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,702
onto the railway telephone line,

59
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:15,582
get the babu
in the post office in Rangoon,

60
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,711
and try and persuade him
that it was vitally important

61
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:24,633
for me to be put on
to air force headquarters.

62
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,303
And that was really
one of the reasons why,

63
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,599
in our withdrawal to the Sittang,

64
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,103
we were
terribly badly bombed by the RAF

65
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,689
as well as by the Japanese air force.

66
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,072
(narrator) The Japanese
had heavy air superiority.

67
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,699
They bombed and strafed almost at will,

68
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,162
spreading terror
among raw troops and civilians.

69
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,046
Only a small force
of American volunteers

70
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,674
and the few RAF planes
that were in Burma

71
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,511
challenged their dominance
and rose to battle with them.

72
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,650
The damage the Japanese bombers dealt
was, as much as anything, psychological.

73
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,904
People couldn't believe
this was happening to peaceful Burma.

74
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,507
Resistance, valiant at times,
was swept aside.

75
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,890
l was discharged from hospital
at Mandalay

76
00:07:54,974 --> 00:08:00,687
having broken three ribs - leff
absolutely stranded on the roadside.

77
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,689
And a civilian picked me up,

78
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,608
took me home to his house,

79
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,612
and said what did l do?
And l said, "l'm catering."

80
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,905
He said, "lf you like,

81
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,948
come to our house and cook for us."

82
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,700
We were there two hours,

83
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,993
no more than that,

84
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,078
when the message came through:

85
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,581
"Evacuate, the Japanese are here."

86
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,883
(narrator)
The Japanese march north continued,

87
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:34,596
leaving a trail of chaos and destruction
the length of Burma.

88
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,643
The British retreated.

89
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,479
(Bowers) l had nothing,
only what l stood up in.

90
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:48,693
l raided someone's kit, found a stout
pair of boots, and we began to walk.

91
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,964
(narrator) ln the mounting confusion,
the wounded were a problem.

92
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,551
(man) We had to leave giving treatment
and just bandage up,

93
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,470
do the best we could.
Some we had to leave behind.

94
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:20,433
Others we put on transport to get them
on the roads - this was all we could do.

95
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,770
And eventually we had
to finally give it up as a bad job

96
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,438
and make our own way out,

97
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,858
as we were only 24 hours
in front of the Japanese

98
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,278
through the length and breadth of Burma.

99
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,999
(narrator) The Japanese
took everything in their stride.

100
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:49,754
Ahead of them, the last recourse
of a retreating army: scorched earth.

101
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:01,016
The invaders seemed
to have made the jungle their friend.

102
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,686
They were racing
to win the rich prize of Burma's oil -

103
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,606
but found instead a blazing inferno.

104
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:14,404
At one installation, £1 1 million worth
of oil and plant went up in 70 minutes.

105
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,750
Refugees: Eurasians, Chinese, lndians.

106
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,339
(Bowers) lndians we saw die on the
roadside - we could do nothing about it.

107
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,551
We just had to
think about ourselves and go on.

108
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,850
(man) The Japanese
were driving Burma people -

109
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,937
in their thousands they came through.
There were some terrible sights.

110
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,606
Men were leff behind,

111
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,902
and it was heart-breaking to see them
being separated from their people,

112
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,239
wondering whether they'd meet up again.
They were dying in their hundreds.

113
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,492
All you used to do was pile 'em up,

114
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,161
throw petrol over them
and set fire to them

115
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,955
and that was the end of those.

116
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,133
(man) We had to hack
through virgin jungle practically

117
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:23,181
to get out of that country,
and we had to find our own way to lndia.

118
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,185
l think the overall impression l had
of that horrible trek out of Burma

119
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,563
was that it seemed to bring the best
and worst out of people.

120
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,982
Some people who l'd looked up to

121
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,150
and respected

122
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,194
l found l couldn't respect any more

123
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,366
because they became
entirely different on that march.

124
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,118
ln fact, l felt that it was

125
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,870
a question of surVival of the fittest.

126
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:53,795
(narrator) British prisoners -
5,000 in one engagement alone.

127
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,006
The Japanese despised
those who surrendered.

128
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,677
They believed
soldiers should fight to the death.

129
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,181
(Okada) We felt the British officer
was a very good fighter -

130
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:10,937
all of the ones we captured, they always
said to me, "We will win the war."

131
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,442
Now this l couldn't understand, because
here is a man who has surrendered

132
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,528
and he still says,
"We will win the war."

133
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,544
(triumphal music)

134
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,006
Through the deserted cities of Burma,

135
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,759
the conquering Japanese
marched in triumph.

136
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:53,646
The Burmese people were now exchanging
one set of imperial masters for another.

137
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,648
(shouting in Japanese)

138
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,365
ln five months, by May 1942,

139
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,494
the Japanese
chased the British up past Rangoon,

140
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,079
through the lrrawaddy
and Chindwin valleys,

141
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,664
to the frontiers of lndia

142
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,125
and out of Burma altogether.

143
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,296
lt was the longest retreat
in British history.

144
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,382
The Japanese also drove another army,
the Chinese,

145
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,843
up to Mandalay towards China.

146
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,679
The Chinese,
at war with Japan since 1931 ,

147
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,807
were protecting their supply line,

148
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,975
the Burma Road.

149
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,979
China was allied to the western powers.

150
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:40,235
ln command of Chinese forces in Burma
was the American, General Stilwell.

151
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,864
Stilwell, chief of staff to the Chinese
supreme commander Chiang Kai-shek,

152
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,034
watched America's interests.

153
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,747
The commander-in-chief, lndia,
was General Wavell.

154
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,791
Transferred from the Middle East,

155
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:59,003
he now faced a formidable foe
with scanty resources.

156
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,049
But while his Burma army licked
its wounds, he planned a comeback,

157
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,678
a limited offensive for late in 1942.

158
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,641
Wavell chose to mount this offensive
in the Arakan,

159
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,644
on the Bay of Bengal,
near the lndian Border.

160
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,731
Affer a hopeful beginning,
everything went wrong.

161
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,818
The British were outmanoeuvred
and outfought again,

162
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,529
and pushed back to their starting point.

163
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,198
They still had not learned
to adapt to the jungle.

164
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:35,331
ln the Burmese jungle, fortunately,
there are many bamboo growths,

165
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,710
and in Japan we all eat bamboo shoots,

166
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,881
so there was a lot of natural food
in the form of bamboo shoots

167
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,507
all over the place.

168
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:50,221
Apart from that, we all know that
what a monkey can eat, we can eat too.

169
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,933
So if you watch the monkeys
and avoid what the monkeys avoid,

170
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,019
you are fairly safe.

171
00:14:56,103 --> 00:15:01,149
Apart from that there are such creatures
as bandicoots - a type of rat, you see -

172
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,986
snakes, jungle lizards and tokay -
small lizards -

173
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,864
you cut off the head, chop them up
and make into curry,

174
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,825
mixed with pepper, can make good curry.

175
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,329
We have our meats
and Yorkshire puddings and so forth -

176
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,247
they lived on rice.

177
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,460
You can't get meat and Yorkshire pudding
and greens and potatoes out there,

178
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,129
so we had to reorganise ourselves

179
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,591
and lived on the things
that the army could produce for us,

180
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,217
like corned beef.

181
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,553
And this is the only place l know

182
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,265
where you could open a tin of corned
beef and pour it out like a liquid.

183
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,061
(narrator) One man
who was going to use the jungle:

184
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,813
Orde Wingate,
an experienced guerrilla fighter,

185
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,734
supremely unorthodox,
with a touch of the fanatic.

186
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:51,032
Now he planned a raid deep in enemy
territory, to be supplied from the air.

187
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,535
He commanded the Chindits,
ordinary British and Gurkha troops,

188
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,039
but intensively trained.

189
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,542
(Caivert) The first operation
was initially

190
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:06,631
to accompany
a general advance into Burma,

191
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,467
but the general advance was cancelled.

192
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:15,014
However, Wavell wanted
the expedition to go forward.

193
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,561
(narrator) February 1943:
the first Chindit expedition.

194
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,981
The going could not have been worse -

195
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:29,862
long distances in dense, hilly jungle,
and always one more river to cross.

196
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,418
The heat was extreme,
drinking water was short,

197
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,004
and malaria was rampant.

198
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,340
But at last the British were fighting
as the enemy did,

199
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:54,220
learning to turn the jungle to their
own advantage - but still hating it.

200
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:07,400
(man) The heat and the smell
of the jungle was vile. Very vile.

201
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:14,449
You couldn't live in the jungle for an
eternity - you'd never stand the smell.

202
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,997
(man #2) Even when you went downhill,
you knew you had to go up again,

203
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,791
and we were carrying
60 to 70 pounds on our back,

204
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,794
five days' rations
plus arms, ammunition.

205
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,006
You'd think, "Oh, will it ever end?"

206
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,341
lt just went on and on and on,

207
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:39,098
and the rain - and, of course, the fear
that you would be ambushed or attacked.

208
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:49,567
lt was absolute hell
in the first Wingate expedition,

209
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:55,281
where the jungle was the friend
of the Japanese, but our enemy.

210
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,117
(man #1) We were wet all the time,

211
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,080
and while we were wet
we got the leech onto our bodies.

212
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,000
They were there all the time
because of the dampness of it.

213
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,337
They got onto your body,
sucked the blood from your body,

214
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,840
and unless you burnt them the right way
with the cigarette end,

215
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,677
they fell off and leff black spots
all over your body.

216
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,765
Once they had their fill of blood,
they dropped from your body

217
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:26,270
and burst inside your clothes,
and you were smothered in blood.

218
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,866
(man #2) The thought that
you'd get wounded and be leff behind,

219
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,121
that was always in our minds, l think -
l'm sure it was in most people's minds.

220
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,581
l saw chaps having to be leff behind -

221
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:50,253
hand grenade, pistol, flask of water,

222
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,214
water bottle, rations -

223
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,843
and propped up against a tree, leff.

224
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,681
(narrator) 450 died.

225
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,020
For some, a simple cross
in a jungle clearing.

226
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,819
ln June, affer four months,
the first Chindits returned from Burma.

227
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:20,116
Out of the 3,000 men who had gone in,
less than 2,000 came back.

228
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,247
Weary and emaciated, most
had marched a thousand jungle miles.

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,377
Whatever the expedition's
military results,

230
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,589
it did teach valuable lessons
in jungle operations,

231
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,425
in air supply, and in morale.

232
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:46,809
(Caivert) This was a raid. lts tactical
and strategical effect was not great.

233
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:52,231
lts main effect was on the morale
of the British and lndian troops.

234
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,984
Our forces were not picked men,

235
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,696
they were ordinary
British and Gurkha battalions,

236
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,407
and the rest of the army said, "My God,

237
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,784
if those people can do it, we can."

238
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,873
(narrator) Very slowly, the British
were getting the measure of the jungle.

239
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,418
They loathed its stench,
its sticky heat.

240
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:16,005
lt was hard for them to realise
that the jungle was neutral.

241
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:20,468
(Japanese man, calling out in English)
Hello, Tommy! Where are you?

242
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,683
Hello, Tommy! Where are you?

243
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,897
l have been hit. Come and help me.

244
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:37,276
(narrator) The enemy carried on
a crude but effective war of nerVes.

245
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,656
The troops still thought of the Japanese
soldier as master of the jungle,

246
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,283
a man who could go for days
on a handful of rice,

247
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,161
didn't seem to know the meaning of fear,

248
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:52,416
would never surrender,
was perhaps unbeatable.

249
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,130
(mocking laughter)

250
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,259
A sort of superman.

251
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:05,763
The Japanese was a good soldier.
He was a good soldier.

252
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,684
lf he was told to do a job,
he would stop there until he died.

253
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,395
Animals.

254
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,940
But great soldiers,
great fighting soldiers.

255
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,445
Their battle drill was fantastic.
You couldn't help but admire them.

256
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,157
lf they were ambushed,
they were at you -

257
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,828
in 20 or 30 seconds they were
pounding you with their mortars,

258
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,497
and in frontal attacks
nobody could beat them.

259
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,000
They would just come on and on and on.

260
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,295
He hadn't the mentality, l suppose,
to think for himself.

261
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,838
He just obeyed orders.

262
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:44,510
And he came at you with everything he
had, even if it meant losing his life.

263
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,971
He just... he didn't care about life.

264
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,433
We were taught from the very beginning

265
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:55,021
that we must...
our life is the emperor's.

266
00:21:55,147 --> 00:22:00,234
For instance, when l leff for war duty,

267
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,445
l had to clip my nails and hair

268
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,613
and write a last will and testament,

269
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,198
because from that moment

270
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,076
our lives are in the emperor's hands.

271
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,619
ln other words,

272
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,706
my family will put that in the urn

273
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,459
in case my body is not recovered.

274
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:20,046
So our training
is to die for the emperor, you see.

275
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,441
(mournful Japanese song)

276
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,684
We had what we called officers' clubs,
where there were Japanese geishas.

277
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,396
These were mostly for officer grade.

278
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,237
For the other ranks, we had
what you might call "comfort girls".

279
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:33,244
And, of course,
in the officers' parties you all drank -

280
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,082
the thing was to get drunk
very quickly, sing songs,

281
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,543
and because of
the limitation of the girls,

282
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,421
only the high officers got them later.

283
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,506
But the songs would be like...

284
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,260
l think the English have a song
called "Roll Me Over in the Clover",

285
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,554
and you go "One, two, three, four..."

286
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,558
Our songs are very similar - it's always
"One, two, three," like this.

287
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,769
And similar in content, too.

288
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:04,316
For the enlisted men,
our entertainment...

289
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:10,072
Because you're entertaining only
between battles or on one day's leave,

290
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:14,994
and you may die next day, we don't have
much time for any lengthy entertainment,

291
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,289
we go straight to the comfort girls.

292
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:24,336
You pay your money and you come out
feeling refreshed and like a new man.

293
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,924
Most of the comfort girls
for the enlisted men,

294
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,342
many were Koreans,

295
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,678
and l must say
l respect all of them very much,

296
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,264
because who else
would come to the front line

297
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:39,477
to give us the last entertainment

298
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,980
for many of us on this earth?

299
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:47,109
(narrator) The British had their own,
very different, entertainment.

300
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,361
(Vera Lynn)
Burma was the furthest point

301
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,989
and very few artists were going there,

302
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,200
so l said, "Right, that's for me."

303
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,537
They thought they were the forgotten
army and l think they probably were.

304
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:03,667
ln fact, just for them to see me
was quite a lot to them,

305
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:09,006
because that l had gone
to all the trouble

306
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,426
and travelled so far just to see them

307
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:17,097
made them feel that they weren't
a long way from home, you know.

308
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,767
lf l could pop on a plane
and nip out there,

309
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,479
they weren't too far away
and not forgotten.

310
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:28,067
(narrator) ln this jungle stalemate,
the message was certainly welcome.

311
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,403

312
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:51,924

(narrator) October 1943.
Things are looking up.

322
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,077
Lord Louis Mountbatten arrives
as supreme commander

323
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,955
of a newly created
Southeast Asia Command.

324
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,336
His mission: to end the stalemate
and knock out the Japanese.

325
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,133
Mountbatten's immediate aim
was to rebuild morale

326
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:21,513
in an army that felt itself forgotten
and wondered why it was there.

327
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:27,603
"We shall march, fight and fly
through the monsoon," he declared.

328
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,816
Another new appointment:
General Bill Slim,

329
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,278
commander
of the newly formed 14th Army.

330
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,366
He knew Burma,
and he knew the Japanese.

331
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:51,418
Bill Slim was essentially
a soldier's general.

332
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,880
Watchful of his troops' well-being,

333
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,717
he wanted them fit
and ready to go over to the attack.

342
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,340
(narrator) Malaria.

343
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,926
At the First Arakan
this, and other diseases,

344
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,514
had claimed 120 victims
to every battle casualty.

345
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,808
(man) l had malaria 17 times.

346
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,602
The last time they thought
l had spinal malaria -

347
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,439
l couldn't walk
and l couldn't even move my arms.

348
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:58,819
And l was getting inoculations all day
and every day, three times a day.

349
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,030
(narrator)
To stamp out the scourge at source,

350
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,908
clouds of a new insecticide, DDT,

351
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,328
were sprayed over
the swampy breeding grounds.

352
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,719
December 1943:
a second offensive at Arakan.

353
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,097
The Japanese counter-attacked.

354
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,266
One enemy force advanced north,

355
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,934
wheeled behind the British,

356
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,562
and turned west to capture Ngakyedauk -

357
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,398
or "Okedoke" - Pass.

358
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:41,278
Another split the British divisions
and encircled one of them.

359
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:54,458
British and lndian units, trapped in
a small enclave, fought for their lives.

360
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,256
lsolated groups fought on, surrounded.

361
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:08,013
The skeleton force held out
against an entire Japanese division

362
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,850
in what came to be known
as "The Admin Box".

363
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:16,897
Clerks, mechanics, drivers,
even a general, joined in.

364
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,236
ln the first Arakan operation,
the troops had withdrawn.

365
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,324
Now, on Slim's express orders,
there was no withdrawal.

366
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,411
They were supplied from the air.

367
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,962
By day and night, the planes
of Troop Carrier Command flew in

368
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,756
to drop essential stores.

369
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:56,562
What seemed certain defeat was
averted by this tactic of air supply.

370
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,780
Casualties were heavy.

371
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:11,159
The wounded were tended
in improvised dressing stations.

372
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:17,082
Surgeons performed major operations
in sweating heat, plagued by flies.

373
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,418
(flies buzzing)

374
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:42,024
At one field hospital, doctors,
medical orderlies and wounded alike

375
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,943
were butchered by Japanese.

376
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,161
The sufferings of prisoners
taken by the Japanese

377
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,538
also stirred the troops to fury.

378
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,841
Thousands of Allied prisoners of war
slaved and died

379
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,010
building the Burma Railway.

380
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:15,682
(man) They captured us,
and from then on we were no longer men.

381
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:22,230
(man #2) They literally
despised us for giving in.

382
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,401
(man #1) We didn't have the food.

383
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,864
We had to work
anything up to 16, 18 hours a day.

384
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,622
(man #2) lf you argued with one,
if you hit one,

385
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:43,293
you automatically got six set about you.

386
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,799
And they thought nothing of beating you
until your arm was broke

387
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,885
or your leg was broke.

388
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,723
(man #1) They'd stand him outside
the guard room in the blazing sun,

389
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,143
take a great delight in pricking him
with a bayonet point

390
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,604
to make him stand upright.

391
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,278
(man #3) There were men
with terrible ulcers,

392
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:14,324
and the only treatment they had
was dropping maggots onto the ulcers

393
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,245
and letting the maggots eat out the pus
and clean the ulcers out.

394
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,623
That's the only treatment
we had for them.

395
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:26,962
(man #1) To find a chap that was
12 stone down to about five stone

396
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:31,008
and crawling about trying to beg
for food or scrambling for food...

397
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,344
l mean, it took some living with.

398
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:39,182
(man #4) At that time
l was going to the toilet on all fours

399
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,060
cos my bowels had dropped.

400
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,272
(man #2) The latrines were concrete -

401
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,776
the top was just
one absolute sea of maggots.

402
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,030
This chap in particular
was in such a bad way -

403
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,240
l think it was cerebral malaria -

404
00:33:55,324 --> 00:34:01,246
that they found him with his head
down there. He'd committed suicide.

405
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,879
(man #1) A very close friend of mine,
in my own regiment,

406
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:13,842
he'd suffered from everything
from beriberi, cholera...

407
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:21,183
When he died, he was just skin -
skin over a skeleton and nothing else.

408
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,394
His legs had been eaten away
with ulcers.

409
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,607
And there was just nothing of him.
l only just recognised him.

410
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,783
And there were 16,000 died
just on the raigway.

411
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,745
For every sleeper that was laid,
there was a human life given up.

412
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,749
With the proper food, proper treatment,
we could have carried on,

413
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,544
built their blasted railway
and thought nothing of it.

414
00:34:55,468 --> 00:35:01,056
(man #2) l could never understand
people being like that -

415
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,311
so terrible in things that they'd done,

416
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,273
and the sadistic nature of them.

417
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:16,029
Thinking of this, l felt sorry for 'em
as much as anything.

418
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,371
(gunshots)

419
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:38,343
(narrator) Japanese troops
would die rather than surrender,

420
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,555
dig themselves in, resist to the end.

421
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,558
But now, a change.

422
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:50,063
At Arakan, some Japanese
gave themselves up. They'd had enough.

423
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:55,902
The superman myth was exploded -
these troops were not unbeatable.

424
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,615
But many Japanese wounded
still took the traditional way out.

425
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,661
(Okada) lt was almost impossible
to take care of the wounded,

426
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,371
and the wounded, knowing this,

427
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:10,876
would ask their comrades to give them
a grenade so they can commit suicide,

428
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,628
and maybe three or four wounded
who could not walk

429
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,215
could commit suicide that way.

430
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,475
(man) We picked up a number of Japanese
who'd been badly shot up.

431
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,646
lt was quite necessary in our field
hospitals to tie their hands down,

432
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,440
because if you didn't do that,

433
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,277
they merely tore at their bandages,
opened their wounds

434
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,989
and literally tried to commit suicide.

435
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,456
(narrator) Late in 1943,

436
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,833
from Ledo on the lndia-Burma border,

437
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,211
Stilwell and the Chinese advanced

438
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,504
to open the way for a new route,

439
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,672
the Ledo Road,

440
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,967
joining the ogd Burma Road at Bhamo.

441
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,513
The Chinese had to fight
to clear the path

442
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,100
which would lead them back to China.

443
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:16,358
Stilwell's two divisions went ahead,
seeking out the enemy.

444
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:43,009
Edging southeastwards, in three hard
months they killed 4,000 Japanese.

445
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:52,018
Behind them came the engineers,
blasting as they went...

446
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:02,279
and, in their thousands, the labourers
who would build the highway.

447
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,082
The Ledo Road, driven hundreds of miles
through atrocious country,

448
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:18,169
was to ensure continued supplies
to China.

449
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:26,219
For Stilwell's troops, conditions
were as hard as anywhere in Burma.

450
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,606
From Wingate, too, a new offensive.

451
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,608
Promoted general, he was to lead,

452
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,737
despite opposition
from more orthodox colleagues,

453
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,574
a second Chindit expedition
to the interior.

454
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:52,537
They flew in
and were again supplied from the air.

455
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,459
March 1944: Operation Thursday.

456
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,299
Air transport for 10,000 men
and 1 ,000 pack animals, with stores,

457
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,636
to jungle sites deep in enemy territory.

458
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,461
Landing so many gliders in rough,
hostile country was a formidable hazard.

459
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,673
Guerrilla fighting was new
to most of them.

460
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:50,053
ln spite of their training,
this was a venture into the unknown.

461
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:30,176
(Caivert) The second Wingate operation
was ten times the size of the first.

462
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:36,891
The object was, in effect, to cut the
lines of communication of the Japanese.

463
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:42,772
North Burma's like a great bowl
with mountains all the way round

464
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:48,528
and communications
running to the rim of the bowl.

465
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:53,283
We fanned out
to cut these lines of communication.

466
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,916
(narrator) The Chindits were
on their own, marooned in mid-Burma,

467
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,627
hundreds of miles from their base.

468
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:10,717
But now it wasn't hit and run.
This time they fought pitched battles.

469
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,996
(aircraft overhead)

470
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,711
Bombers were called in time and
time again to save a tricky situation.

471
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:53,801
Early on, the leader, Wingate,
was killed in an air crash.

472
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,180
The operation went on.

473
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,393
(man) We just marched
on our own two feet with muleteers.

474
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,689
lf we was taken ill, we were just
sort of slung across the pony

475
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,692
till such time
as your temperature went down,

476
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,445
and affer about two days
you was slung off the pony

477
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,658
and another unfortunate got put on.

478
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,996
(man #2) Any units
operating in those circumstances

479
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,040
have to be mobile all the time,

480
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,253
and wounded, of course,
immediately bring you to a halt.

481
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:32,924
Fortunately, Wingate was able to obtain
assistance from the United States

482
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,969
and we were given
some remarkable aircraff,

483
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,055
which was
a very short take-off/landing aircraff

484
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:44,811
and could get into any little valley
or bit of paddy field and so on,

485
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,230
and evacuate our wounded for us.

486
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,109
(narrator) Long weeks in the jungle -

487
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:56,823
weeks of dysentery, jaundice,
jungge sores and magaria.

488
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:02,829
Aircraff like this meant rescue
for thousands, sick as well as wounded.

489
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,211
The Chindits killed Japanese
where they thought they were safe,

490
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:15,216
and forced them
to divert troops from other purposes.

491
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:20,263
Fighting without respite in these
conditions told on the toughest.

492
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:24,225
(Caivert) Most of the brigades,
through casualties and disease -

493
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,896
they'd been behind the lines
for four to five months - were finished.

494
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:35,862
My own brigade had only 300 fit men
out of the 4,000 who originally came in.

495
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:49,000
(narrator) Meanwhile, pushing down
from the north were Merrill's Marauders.

496
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,298
Named affer their leader,
Brigadier General Merrill,

497
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,926
the Marauders were American volunteers.

498
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:06,934
Among their targets,
the important airfield of Myitkyina.

499
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:11,189
But the Japanese again
had launched an offensive themselves.

500
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:15,068
ln March 1944,
three divisions crossed the Chindwin

501
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,489
to attack Kohima and lmphal
inside lndia itself.

502
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,824
One division struck towards Kohima,

503
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,242
two towards lmphal.

504
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,827
They advanced rapidly,

505
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,747
threatening to isolate both objectives.

506
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,458
(man speaking Japanese)

507
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,169
(interpreter)
From the Chindwin river to Michan

508
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,421
there are many precipitous mountains

509
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,840
sticking out
like the fingers of the hand.

510
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:43,805
We advanced, climbing up and down
these steep mountains.

511
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:48,142
On the map, the distance
is only about 150 kilometres,

512
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,771
but when the mountains and valleys
were taken into consideration

513
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:55,024
it was about 300 km.

514
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,362
Without rest or sleep,
it took us 13 days to reach Michan,

515
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,989
where we cut the road.

516
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:07,078
(narrator) For the Japanese,
Kohima was a tempting prize.

517
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:12,166
lts capture would cut the Allies'
supply line to the great base at lmphal.

518
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:24,721
The British air crews flew dangerous
sorties to prevent their advance.

519
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,191
(bombs explode)

520
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,326
But the columns came on.

521
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,176
Steadily, the enemy
tightened their circle round Kohima.

522
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,389
They squeezed the small garrison
into a tiny central area.

523
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:12,935
Losses were heavy,
reinforcements desperately needed.

524
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:16,606
l sent the 2nd British Division
down to support

525
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,276
the fighting at Kohima,
and they went into Kohima.

526
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,820
The front line was on either side

527
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,532
of the district commissioner's
tennis court.

528
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,868
They stood shoulder to shoulder.

529
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,205
Where they were killed,
they were buried.

530
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,459
Out of three British infantry brigades,

531
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:41,631
two brigadiers killed, two brigadiers'
replacements seriously wounded.

532
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,383
That's what the fighting was like
in Kohima.

533
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,887
They attacked us at the tennis courts,

534
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,433
and it was just like playing tennis -

535
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,811
so much so that l believe that the area

536
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,522
from one side of a tennis court
to the other

537
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:02,527
was the positions between the Japanese
and the platoon l was with.

538
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:06,823
The fighting l saw was literally
hundreds at a time coming towards us.

539
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,951
The manpower strength
just pushed us back

540
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,746
from one trench
to a trench ten foot behind us.

541
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,792
Eventually they kept overrunning us
due to the manpower.

542
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,046
(narrator) Kohima was
the ordinary soldier's battle.

543
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,759
Small groups of Japanese and British
fought hand to hand.

544
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,641
(Brown) Every one of us was frightened.

545
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:39,021
lf we put our hands up and surrendered,
our battalion would have been finished.

546
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:43,609
We knew that if the Japs had got us,
they would have shot us and tortured us,

547
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,779
like they did do to some of our boys.

548
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,825
So we stayed in the holes
and prayed to God.

549
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,870
Affer the first seven or eight days

550
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,498
the ammunition, the food,
was running out.

551
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,126
Water was almost non-existent.

552
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,839
Then we was told the 2nd All-British
was on their way to get us out.

553
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:15,474
(narrator) At last they got there.
The British were now struggling

554
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,020
to force the Japanese
back from the ridge they had seized,

555
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,648
and a continuous artillery duel went on.

556
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:31,991
The Japanese had started with a force
of 15,000 against a garrison of 3,500.

557
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,593
When the British supplies dwindled,

558
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,554
they were replenished
entirely from the air.

559
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,393
(man) l think everyone on the ground

560
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,814
felt just how much they owed
to these aircrews

561
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,860
who were going flat throughout the day
and sometimes during the night.

562
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,446
And at that time of the war

563
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,866
there weren't that number
of spare crews around,

564
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:19,497
so that each crew had its aircraff
and that aircraff had to be kept flying,

565
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:23,209
and they were going absolutely flat out.

566
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:32,510
(narrator) Kohima was relieved
affer seven weeks.

567
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,972
The troops could now see
the suicidal price

568
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,684
the Japanese had paid
in their bid to capture it.

569
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,811
(man) They were fanatics.

570
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,647
When l say fanatics,
you could be holding a position

571
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,358
and they're about
30 yards away from you,

572
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:51,112
and all of a sudden they'd come
flying at you, shouting and yelling.

573
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,824
lt always amazed us -
or amazed me, rather -

574
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,703
how anybody could come flying
out of the jungle expecting to kill you

575
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,788
who was shouting at you.

576
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:05,459
l know it unnerVes you and all that,
but you can get used to this eventually.

577
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,922
And when we did get used to it,
we took a great toll of the Japanese.

578
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,676
We just held fire and got aim and said,
"You shout on, lad, you come on."

579
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,388
And they came on and
they filled up in front of our trenches,

580
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,516
our little weapon pits.

581
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:27,023
(man #2) Fighting the Japanese
was totally committed war.

582
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:32,278
There was no question of heroics,
mock-heroics or chivalry

583
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:38,075
in the sense that one read about
prior to the war with Blggies.

584
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,831
We were totally committed
to killing as many Japanese as possible,

585
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:48,044
probably prompted by the fact
that we knew from bitter experience

586
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,046
that there had been atrocities,

587
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,256
and we were always fearful of the fact

588
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,468
that we didn't wish
to be taken prisoner.

589
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:01,223
(Brown) l seen one of my lads
tied up with Dannert wire.

590
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,934
l don't want to see it no more.

591
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:10,524
lt was impossible
to feel sorry or pitiful for'em,

592
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,195
because we knew what they done
to our boys.

593
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:22,119
They didn't give us a chance,
and we didn't give them a chance.

594
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:41,514
(narrator) Affer Kohima,
the relief of lmphal.

595
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:47,144
Fighting there had been as bloody
as at Kohima - and as heroic.

596
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:52,441
The Japanese now had to be cleared
from the Kohima-lmphal road.

597
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:02,409
ln July 1944,
the Japanese broke off the offensive.

598
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,916
Kohima and lmphal had been
the high point of the Japanese effort.

599
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,879
"They will never come back,"
said General Slim.

600
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,977
On Stilwell's front,
the Chinese, with Merrill's Marauders,

601
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,354
had taken Myitkyina airfield -

602
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,440
but with heavy casualties.

603
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:37,945
Under monsoon skies,
more wounds to be dressed.

604
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,325
(thunder)

605
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:59,633
Mountbatten had said the troops
would fight through the monsoon.

606
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,302
Now, in the deluge,

607
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,972
they were driving the Japanese back
across the Burmese frontier.

608
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:08,726
Ahead, the long road
they had come two years before:

609
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:13,189
Mandalay, Rangoon,
and much bitter fighting.

610
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,609
There would be no rest

611
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:22,615
till all the Japanese in Burma
were defeated and destroyed.
