1
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,100
(narrator) This land was made for war.

2
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,978
As glass resists the bite of vitriol,

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:27,776
so this hard and calcined earth rejects
the battle's hot, corrosive impact.

4
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,454
Here is no nubile, girlish land,

5
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,875
no green and virginal countryside
for war to violate.

6
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,047
This land is hard, inviolable.

7
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,691
(narrator) Benito Mussolini

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,111
declares war on France and Britain.

9
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:59,368
Combattenti di terra, di mare,
dell'aria.

10
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,793
(crowd cheering)

11
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,939
(narrator) Like some Roman consul,

12
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,567
Mussolini longed for an African empire.

13
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,404
Already he had massacred the
Abyssinians and subjugated the Libyans.

14
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,031
Now he wanted more.

15
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:48,208
(man) We were certainly not ready
to go to war in 1940.

16
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,670
lt was purely a political move
from Mussolini

17
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,965
who felt that Hitler
was winning too much too quickly

18
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:00,387
and that if he didn't make some sort of
gesture, take some sort of initiative,

19
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,309
he would not be able to sit
at the conference table.

20
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,407
(narrator) Mussolini's eyes
were on Egypt -

21
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,036
the Egypt of the Nile
and the Suez Canal.

22
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:32,336
ln autumn 1940, he poured 250,000 troops
into Egypt's neighbour, Libya,

23
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,839
and another 300,000 into Ethiopia.

24
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,134
Facing them in Egypt
were just 30,000 British soldiers

25
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,386
of the Western Desert Force.

26
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:12,125
September 13, 1940, when the battle
for Britain was at its height,

27
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,462
Mussolini's men
set out to conquer Egypt.

28
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,308
Completely outnumbered,
the British troops simply fell back.

29
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,026
Affer four days, Mussolini's men
were to reach Sidi Barrani,

30
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,028
60 miles inside Egypt.

31
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,616
There they would stop,
still 300 miles short of Cairo.

32
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,289
(Colacicchl) Looking back,
it seems extraordinary

33
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:55,961
how we moved into Egypt by sending out
these enormous columns -

34
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,840
not very well protected
because we didn't have many tanks.

35
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:05,804
And then each one of them settling down
in a sort of fortified camp.

36
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,647
This helped, of course,
General O'Connor, l think, a lot.

37
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,233
(narrator) O'Connor,
the British commander,

38
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,486
had used the pause
to plan a counterattack.

39
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:26,616
The ltalians had a series
of these fortified perimeter camps,

40
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,287
and we decided
that, as they were so far apart,

41
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,706
they would be unable
to support each other,

42
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,002
and we moved our troops round
to attack them from the rear,

43
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,005
the way that their rations would come.

44
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,810
(man) O'Connor undertook an operation
which was due to last about four days,

45
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,689
which was the limit for the available
tanks, which were nearly worn out,

46
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:04,279
and for our administration, in terms of
supplying water and fuel and ammunition.

47
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,490
He achieved complete surprise,

48
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,410
got behind the ltalian positions
at Sidi Barrani, and, in the morning,

49
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,038
the ltalian resistance collapsed.

50
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,207
(cheering)

51
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,604
(Belchem) O'Connor's
great achievement was

52
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:44,111
that, by using captured vehicles
and captured dumps of water and fuel,

53
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,573
he was able to maintain
this four-day battle

54
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,661
into what became an offensive
lasting over a period of weeks

55
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,288
and resulted in taking him
as far as Benghazi

56
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,291
and indeed, beyond, to El Agheila.

57
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,880
(narrator) An area the size of England
and France had been captured.

58
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,968
For the British, it was an unbelievable
victory and marVellously opportune

59
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,096
for, back home,
the Blitz was mounting in ferocity.

60
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,142
For Mussolini, a mere six months
affer entering the war,

61
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:19,354
the defeat meant the pricking
of his imperial pretensions.

62
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,691
(Colacicchl) Mussolini had said,
"l want 1 ,000 ltalian dead

63
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,069
to be able to sit
at the conference table."

64
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,197
And, of course,
it cost many more than that.

65
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,669
(narrator) 200,000 ltalians
were taken prisoner.

66
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,431
(man) They'd had enough.

67
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:59,060
ln many cases they were
very, very happy to surrender.

68
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,314
To think that we were
vastly outnumbered,

69
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:08,820
and to see one Tommy taking literally
thousands back to the POW cage

70
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,907
was a great joy for us to see.

71
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,036
We used to call them "gentlemen".
"There go the gentlemen."

72
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,666
(narrator) Tripoli, Libya's capital,
was in O'Connor's grasp.

73
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,628
But Churchill withdrew
the cream of O'Connor's forces

74
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,130
to meet the Nazi threat in Greece.

75
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,509
(G'Connor) We couldn't do
Greece and Tripoli at the same time.

76
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,010
That was clear.

77
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,306
l say we could have done Tripoli
immediately

78
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,809
and still leff the options open
for Greece.

79
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,270
We lost an enormous opportunity

80
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,356
to finish up North Africa,

81
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,941
and it was a fatal error

82
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,526
to go to Greece.

83
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,782
lf we had advanced immediately,
we could have pushed him out.

84
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,368
l entirely blame myself
for not having done it.

85
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,330
l think it was quite inexcusable.
l ought to have.

86
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:07,128
(narrator) February 12, 1941 .
Hitler comes to Mussolini's rescue.

87
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,219
A small mobile force
that had been hurriedly put together

88
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,720
set sail to Tripoli.

89
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,562
A force that was soon to be renowned
as the Afrika Korps.

90
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:38,159
The task of the German Africa army
was only

91
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:43,123
to tie down
as many British troops as possible

92
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:47,168
and to cover the southern flank
of Europe.

93
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:54,843
We had never the intention to conquer
Egypt or to cross the Suez Canal.

94
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,310
(narrator) The man Hitler chose
to save Mussolini from disaster

95
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,104
had made his name in France
the summer before -

96
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,441
Erwin Rommel.

97
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:20,744
ln the port of Tripoli
in February / March '41 ,

98
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:28,627
Rommel told my friend Lieutenant Hunt,
an engineer:

99
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,840
"Hunt, here you can build me 150 tanks."

100
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,510
The man looked stupefied,
and Rommel told him:

101
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:42,599
"Don't you have timber
here in the harbour and canvas of sails

102
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,519
to make 150 covers for Volkswagen?"

103
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,647
"So you can give me 150 tanks."

104
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,691
And those tanks misled the British.

105
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:58,698
(narrator) Rommel knew nothing about
desert warfare, but was bold and daring.

106
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,329
(man) Rommel was perhaps the ideal
commander for this war theatre.

107
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,540
lt was very wide in area,

108
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,795
but very limited in numbers of soldiers,

109
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,799
and so he could apply
practically naval tactics.

110
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,928
(Westphal) Towns and cities
were very few

111
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:25,642
and, therefore, we had no difficulties
with the Arabian population.

112
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,019
They didn't disturb us.

113
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,569
(narrator) The evening the Afrika Korps
arrived, they were ordered to the front.

114
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,658
Rommel believed in attack, and quickly.

115
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,754
On the last day of March, when not all
the troops promised had even landed,

116
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,756
he took on the British at El Agheila,

117
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:02,554
and in just 12 days pushed them back
the 500 miles to Egypt.

118
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,683
(man) lt was as if the bogeyman
was just round the corner.

119
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,269
lt was "Here comes Rommel,"

120
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:13,565
or "Rommel's coming down the desert
fast. Get the hell out of it."

121
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:20,572
(narrator) Now it was the British turn
to be taken prisoner in their thousands.

122
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,754
(man) Rommel told me to go ahead
and we reached Derna,

123
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:41,926
picking up on our way English soldiers
and generals who came in one by one.

124
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,305
Amongst them,
the famous General O'Connor.

125
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,933
(G'Connor) lt was miles behind
our own front.

126
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,810
We drove into the one bit of desert

127
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,105
in which the Germans had sent
a reconnaissance group.

128
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,194
lt was a great shock, and l never
thought it would happen to me.

129
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,862
Very conceited, perhaps.

130
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,449
(narrator) And so the Rommel legend
took shape.

131
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,703
By mid-April, he had driven
the British back where they had started.

132
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,165
But one pinprick remained - Tobruk.

133
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,758
100 miles behind the front,
its Australian garrison held out,

134
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:26,638
denying Rommel a precious forward port
for his supplies.

135
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,394
While Tobruk remained in British hands,
it threatened Rommel's supply lines

136
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,315
and deterred him
from advancing any further into Egypt.

137
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:45,323
Unable to take Tobruk by direct assault,
Rommel prepared to besiege it.

138
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,244
The Luffwaffe, too, were called in.

139
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:13,142
Over 1 ,000 raids
were mounted against Tobruk.

140
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,654
Under Rommel's nose,

141
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,866
the Royal Navy replaced their garrison
with fresh troops -

142
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,619
Poles, South Africans, lndians, British.

143
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,498
(man) lt was bare rations in Tobruk.

144
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:41,045
Although one must thank the navy.
They did a wonderful job.

145
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,305
(narrator) ln 1941
the Royal Navy ruled the Mediterranean.

146
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,349
They had done so since
giving the powerful ltalian fleet

147
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,060
a bloody nose at Taranto
the previous autumn.

148
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,522
And so British convoys made their way
through the Mediterranean

149
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,983
relatively unmolested.

150
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,777
More importantly, operating from Malta,

151
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,405
the Royal Navy could harass
Rommel's own convoys

152
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,199
passing from ltaly to Tripoli.

153
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,402
The British supplies got through,
while Rommel's didn't.

154
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,490
Denied the petrol
necessary for his panzers,

155
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:55,370
Rommel couldn't advance
any further into Egypt that summer.

156
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,247
And, worse, no matter how hard he tried,

157
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,458
Rommel couldn't take Tobruk.

158
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,837
lt remained a thorn in his side, and
became a symbol of British doggedness

159
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,548
every bit as much
as Churchill's bulldog face.

160
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,595
(man) We were pestered with
blaring loudspeakers on the perimeter.

161
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,682
We were called
the self-imposed prisoners of Tobruk

162
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:22,438
and Rommel's propaganda machine
bellowed at us to give up.

163
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,067
Well, we just took no notice.
We said, "We'll stick it out."

164
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,903
We knew that they couldn't get in.

165
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,790
(man #2) There had been no light
at the end of the tunnel at all

166
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,376
since the withdrawal from Dunkirk.

167
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,463
l think for political
and, above all, for morale reasons -

168
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,049
the morale
of the people of this country -

169
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,721
it was terribly important
to show that we could hold the Germans.

170
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,515
(narrator) The Desert War
was in stalemate,

171
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,601
a time for taking stock of tactics
as well as supplies.

172
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,813
Rommel's tactics had more effect
than those of the British,

173
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,107
especially in his use of tank.

174
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,987
(Beichein) We had been trained
to fire on the move,

175
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,866
to execute the sort of cavalry charge
on tracks,

176
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,702
and handle armour in that way.

177
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:22,415
The Germans had studied this problem
much more than we between the wars

178
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:26,335
and also, of course, Rommel had
experience from northern France

179
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,047
and so had many of his tank crews.

180
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:33,468
And they appreciated that
the tank's best action against his enemy

181
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,555
is to wait for him to come on,
sitting in a hull-hidden position.

182
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,265
lf they're caught in the open,

183
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:44,062
to decoy the enemy
onto their own antitank gun lines.

184
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,159
(narrator) Rommel's main antitank
weapon was the Krupp-made 88mm.

185
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,204
lt had decimated the French tanks
in May 1940

186
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,873
and was doing the same now
to the British tanks.

187
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,669
(man) lt was effective
at 1 ,000 yards and over.

188
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:14,300
lt could pinpoint you, zero into you
and it would brew a tank up easily.

189
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,850
(man #2) They could shoot at us before
we were even within striking distance.

190
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:28,314
We couldn't hope to hit them with
the two-pounders or the six-pounders.

191
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,903
(narrator) Rommel not only had the edge
in tactics and equipment,

192
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,074
he also enjoyed the confidence
of his political chief, Hitler.

193
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,700
Wavell, his opposite number,

194
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,703
was pressured by Churchill
to provide a victory.

195
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,416
When he didn't, he was replaced
by General Sir Claude Auchinleck.

196
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,795
"The Auk", in turn, appointed
as his commander in the field

197
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,464
Lieutenant General Cunningham.

198
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,300
Cunningham had defeated
the ltalians in East Africa

199
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,346
and put back Haile Selassie
on the throne of Abyssinia.

200
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,558
But he was an infantryman
and knew nothing about tanks.

201
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,019
The tank held the key to success
in the desert,

202
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,939
but British tanks
leff much to be desired.

203
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,234
(man) They were very poor,
mechanically.

204
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:18,406
There were parts missing,
parts not connected properly.

205
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,618
(narrator) Unlike the Germans,
the British had few tank transporters,

206
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,746
so their tanks had to move
long distances as well as fight

207
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,040
on their tracks.

208
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,336
(man) Every track is connected
to the next track by a pin -

209
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,629
a lot of moving parts -

210
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:40,052
which, in the desert, was sometimes
powdery but hard, gritty sand.

211
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,015
Well, water is a lubricant

212
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,144
and a tank track
is best suited to muddy conditions.

213
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,066
(narrator) To Churchill, the Desert War
had been too long in stalemate.

214
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,193
He needed victory,

215
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,988
especially affer the humiliating
failures in Greece and Crete.

216
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,824
No sooner were Cunningham
and Auchinleck appointed

217
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,453
then they, too,
were pressured into an offensive.

218
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:25,598
The British now had more equipment,
but their tactics hadn't changed.

219
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,517
Rommel might have been tempted
to echo Wellington:

220
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:33,147
"They came on in the same old way and
we stopped them in the same old way."

221
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,278
ln just five days that November,

222
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,657
Cunningham lost 300 tanks -
two-thirds of his force -

223
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,159
many through mechanical failure.

224
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,496
(man) Say the track came off
and jammed,

225
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,456
well, if you were in action,

226
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,668
you couldn't do anything about it
but bail out.

227
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,337
And then you couldn't recover the tank.

228
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,841
At that time in the desert
we had no means of recovery of tanks.

229
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,887
(man #2) You'd always
leave the battleground.

230
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,058
Jerrys, they used to seem to stay there.

231
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,143
We might have had a successful day

232
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,647
but the Jerrys always seemed
to deny us the battlefield.

233
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,651
(man) Their equipment had to come
equally as far as ours,

234
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,070
but they seemed to value it more

235
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:26,325
and did every effort to recover
their tanks as soon as it got dusk.

236
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,536
(narrator) By bluff and guile,

237
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,539
Rommel convinced Cunningham
he had lost the battle,

238
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,292
but Auchinleck
was determined to stay put.

239
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,504
He sacked Cunningham, who wanted
to withdraw, and appointed Ritchie.

240
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,799
The gamble to stay and fight came off.

241
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,727
When defeat
stared the British in the face,

242
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,563
the battle's balance
swung dramatically their way,

243
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,733
as Rommel's panzers ran out of fuel.

244
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,943
Tobruk was relieved.

245
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,822
Rommel was forced to withdraw
500 miles back to his starting point,

246
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:10,453
and, on Christmas Eve 1941 , Benghazi
changed hands for the third time.

247
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,458
But with Commonwealth forces again
poised to push the Axis out of Africa,

248
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,628
they were again denuded of troops and
equipment, this time for the Far East,

249
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,422
where Japan's entry into the war

250
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,508
threatened British bases
in Burma and Malaya.

251
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:31,640
An opportunity of gaining something
which was real and important

252
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,143
in the Middle Eastern theatre

253
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:41,067
was lost for the sake of something
which was very doubtful

254
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:46,238
and unlikely to pay off
in the Far East.

255
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:52,078
(narrator) Within a couple of weeks,
Rommel counterattacked.

256
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,921
Against the weakened British forces,
he recaptured Benghazi

257
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,173
and once more threatened Tobruk.

258
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,509
He was stopped at Gazala.

259
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,637
Once again, it was stalemate.

260
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,911
The peculiar conditions of the desert
bred a comradeship that was unique.

261
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,039
To many, the Desert War
was a private war,

262
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,876
the last to retain
any pretence of chivalry.

263
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,386
(man) As soon as we stopped anywhere
and there was a lull and a rest,

264
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,805
you'd clear off a patch of the desert
and say:

265
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,891
"Right. Now we'll have
a game of football."

266
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,895
(man #2) The sportsmanship showed
in both sides.

267
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:06,318
Football games were not interrupted by
artillery fire during certain periods.

268
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:12,283
(Beichein) The staple diet
was biscuits and bully beef.

269
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,662
(man #3) We had bully beef fried,
bully beef boiled,

270
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,206
bully beef with dog biscuits.

271
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,627
(man #4) Oh, and dog biscuits.
Dogs would refuse to eat them.

272
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,548
(narrator) With food a problem
and water scarce,

273
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,509
dysentery was a constant danger.

274
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:37,099
The Germans invented a water can
which the envious English,

275
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,020
affer seeing theirs burst countless
times on the bumpy desert surfaces,

276
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,315
copied and christened the "jerry can".

277
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,736
(man) We were rationed at one stage
there on a cup of water a day

278
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,197
to bath and shave.

279
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,909
What offen happened was
the sections collected their ration,

280
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:59,163
put it into a helmet
and each would shave out of that.

281
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,832
(narrator) Above all, it was hot.

282
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,586
Very, very, very hot.

283
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,965
(man) lt was so hot
you could fry an egg on the mudguard.

284
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,594
lt's literally true.
You could break an egg on the outside.

285
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,472
lt was so hot it would sizzle.

286
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,771
(narrator) The fly was perhaps
the desert soldier's greatest scourge -

287
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,316
not just as a nuisance
but as a carrier of disease.

288
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,694
The flies were indifferent
as to which side they plagued.

289
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,574
(man) There were competitions
as to who killed the most flies.

290
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:41,080
The flies were that fattened
with living on the dead

291
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,415
that any time you killed them,

292
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,252
the smell got into you
and caused stomach upsets.

293
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,004
And we had orders
from division headquarters

294
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,590
to cut out this business
of killing the flies.

295
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,926
We just had to let them go.

296
00:25:55,887 --> 00:26:03,352
(Westphal) l think one fly has,
within one year, nine million children.

297
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,774
(narrator) There was, too,
the occasional scorpion and viper.

298
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:13,654
And when the wind blew,
the sand and dust got in everywhere.

299
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,662
(man) The fine dust
used to clog up everything.

300
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,957
The jets would clog up
in the carburettors.

301
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,959
Your watches would stop.

302
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:31,463
(man #2) We had great problems with our
intestines that gave a form of diarrhoea

303
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,801
which was very severe
because of the sand passing through.

304
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:40,139
(man #3) You had, for instance,
to go from your quarters to the latrine,

305
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:44,226
and you had literally to do it
with a march compass.

306
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,646
There are cases
where soldiers did not return

307
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,316
when they had forgotten
their march compass.

308
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,571
ln the sandstorm, of course,
the fighting stopped,

309
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,865
which was enjoyed at the beginning.

310
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,784
Then affer three days you think:

311
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,121
"Better the sandstorm stops
and the fighting starts again."

312
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,587
(narrator) Ritchie planned an offensive
for May with Grant tanks from America.

313
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,382
But Rommel, as usual, got in first.

314
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,260
Ritchie had learnt little
from previous mistakes.

315
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,054
Like the ltalians, he had set up

316
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,680
a series of fortified camps

317
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,682
and laid mines galore.

318
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,142
But as O'Connor had done

319
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,393
with the ltalians

320
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,563
Rommel simply went round
the open flank.

321
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,193
(man) We were down south,
just in front of Bir Hakeim

322
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:40,699
and, during the morning, we saw
this dust going up from where Jerry was.

323
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,328
He was coming up through
where the Seventh Armoured Div were.

324
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,789
And it was like a fox in a hen coop -

325
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,167
everybody dashing about
all over the place.

326
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,401
(narrator) Ritchie's new tanks
were proving a disappointment.

327
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,737
Once again, the British armour
was out-manoeuvred.

328
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,740
The Battle of Gazala was Rommel's.

329
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:38,382
The way was open to the prize that had
eluded Rommel the previous summer,

330
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:44,096
the prize that Churchill, for one, had
determined ever to deny him - Tobruk.

331
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,523
Tobruk's fortifications
had been neglected.

332
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:59,069
They were no longer as formidable
as they had been the previous summer.

333
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:24,386
(newsreel) 27 Juni. Das Oberkommando
der Wehrmacht gibt bekannt.

334
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:28,348
Berlin Radio broadcast
news of Tobruk's surrender.

335
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,059
For Churchill
it was a particularly dark moment.

336
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,978
For Rommel, the peak of his career,

337
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,398
and a grateful Führer
made him field marshal.

338
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:49,161
The British now fell back into Egypt,
further than ever before.

339
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:54,208
(De Guingand) l've never seen such
chaos. You couldn't save the situation.

340
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,837
l've never seen a desert road
crammed with every sort of vehicle,

341
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,758
every unit muddled up higgledy-piggledy.

342
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,844
No one knew what was going on and...

343
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,139
Luckily our air force
was stronger than the enemy's,

344
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,601
otherwise l think
we would have been routed.

345
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:18,607
(man) The state of despair
had to be masked,

346
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:23,320
and it was masked in a typically
British way - by nonchalance.

347
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:27,074
When Rommel was expected in Cairo
that evening,

348
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,951
Lord Killearn, my ambassador,

349
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:33,705
instantly gave a dinner for 80 people
at the Mohammed Ali Club

350
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,125
and said, "When he comes down,
he'll know where to find us."

351
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:44,299
(narrator) Past Mersa Matruh, past
Maaten Bagush, past Fuka, past Daba,

352
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:49,805
the British fell back,
until, on June 30, 1942,

353
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:54,017
they reached a railway halt
just 60 miges from Agexandria -

354
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,228
El Alamein.

355
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,618
lt was no chance choice of Auchinleck's

356
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:16,707
that the decisive battle for Egypt
should be fought here at El Alamein.

357
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,091
This bit of desert
was not like any other

358
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,468
over which the war had been fought.

359
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,971
As always, the sea was to the north,

360
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:35,434
but, here, just 40 miles inland,
was another sea -

361
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,314
a sunken sea of quicksand
and salt marsh,

362
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,482
impassable to tanks.

363
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,569
The Qattara Depression.

364
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,532
Until now the fluid strategy
of desert warfare

365
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,952
had sprung from there being
always an open flank.

366
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:58,498
But at Alamein, Rommel would have
to think of something different.

367
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,213
Auchinleck prepared
for the final battle for Egypt,

368
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,841
for, affer Tobruk,
he had sacked Ritchie

369
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,345
and taken command
of the Eighth Army himself.

370
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,685
But Churchill was already planning
to sack him too.

371
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,229
Rommel didn't wait
for Churchill's decision.

372
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:27,069
He threw his tired troops into
a last, desperate attempt to take Egypt.

373
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,328
ln July, in perhaps the most decisive
battle of the Desert War,

374
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,830
Auchinleck halted him.

375
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,251
(De Guingand) It was
a frightfully important battle,

376
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,839
and it was touch and go that we might
have lost our whole Middle East base.

377
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,772
(narrator) Churchill went to see for
himself in August the troops' morale.

378
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,732
Tobruk's fall had exasperated him,

379
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,736
but he was heartened by the reception
he got from the Eighth Army.

380
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,408
He'd already decided to appoint
Alexander in place of Auchinleck.

381
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,202
The new Eighth Army commander
was to be Montgomery,

382
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,998
although Montgomery had not set foot
in the desert during the war.

383
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,459
(man) When Montgomery came
we were a bit apprehensive about him

384
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:29,756
because we'd never seen this man
who had white knees and what have you.

385
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,261
(Durrell) The presence of your PM
suddenly was a very tonic thing.

386
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,222
He was wearing a siren suit,
smoking an immense cigar,

387
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,057
but he had "WC" on his slippers -

388
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,435
he was wearing
old-fashioned dancing pumps

389
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,187
that you used to wear
with dinner jackets,

390
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,940
with W on one foot and C on the other.

391
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,153
And he gave us a very good pep talk.

392
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,795
(narrator) For Rommel,
the laws of desert warfare

393
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,756
now began to work against him.

394
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,967
The further the advance,
the longer the supply line.

395
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:20,891
(Westphal) l think we had
crossed the Rubicon, like Caesar,

396
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:24,728
when we went to Egypt.

397
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:31,151
The eyes of Hitler were directed
every day to the Russian front -

398
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,445
the deciding front -

399
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:37,449
and our role was not so important.

400
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,953
He was content
if we had no difficulties,

401
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,249
but he was not able to guarantee

402
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:51,838
the supplies came
to the North African force.

403
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:03,058
(narrator) Only one in four of Rommel's
supply ships ever got through.

404
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:07,395
His solution - late in the day -
crush Malta.

405
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:24,454
Göring's Luffwaffe believed it could
annihilate the island single-handed.

406
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,252
(siren)

407
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,605
Stukas, Heinkels, Junkers,
Dorniers, Messerschmitts

408
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,318
day in, day out, hundreds at a time,
were ordered against the island.

409
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,863
Malta became
the most bombed place on earth.

410
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,519
Malta held out.

411
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,865
Equally bad for Rommel,

412
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,744
the Desert Air Force could now operate
from its home bases along the Nile,

413
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,330
just 100 miges behind the gine.

414
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,668
(man) ln the desert,
fighting is characterised

415
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:59,216
by the opposition of tanks
in large quantities,

416
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,345
of artillery, of air support.

417
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:09,893
Air support, for instance, didn't play
a considerable role in Russia,

418
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:14,064
where troops had enough cover.

419
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:20,362
ln Africa, air superiority
was all decisive.

420
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,159
(narrator) Montgomery
had air superiority.

421
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,913
Desperately short of fuel, Rommel's
convoys had to run the gauntlet,

422
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,457
the 1 ,400 miles
from his main base at Tripoli,

423
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:37,504
whereas Montgomery was only
60 miles from his at Alexandria.

424
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,799
(Westphal)
The distance from the ports -

425
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,177
Benghazi, Tripoli
and, perhaps, Tobruk -

426
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,055
had become too big.

427
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,393
(man) During the jigsaws
up and down the desert,

428
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,853
when we pushed Rommel back

429
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,940
we used to accuse him
of putting oil in the wells,

430
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,401
which we thought
was really a dirty trick.

431
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,278
Then when we came back down,

432
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,155
he would blame us
for putting oil in the water.

433
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,159
And now it seems that, all the time,
it was the oil wells below the ground

434
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,245
seeping through into the water well.

435
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,209
(narrator) ln September the Afrika
Korps' morale was dealt a blow

436
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,546
when Rommel fell ill.
Hitler ordered him home.

437
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:26,344
But his men were leff behind
under the desert sun for a second year.

438
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,851
(man) When you are in the desert, you
feel like a man on the moon would feel.

439
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,979
You are alone with the universe.

440
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,693
(narrator) For the men of the Afrika
Korps, there was no question of leave,

441
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:46,573
only the certainty that, sooner or
later, the British would attack them.

442
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,742
(man) The homesickness of the soldier

443
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,287
who would have preferred
to be at home and not at war.

that the desert campaign

447
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,594
produced the most memorable song
of the Second World War.

448

(woman sings "Lili Marlene" in German)

449
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:14,601
(man) Lili Marlene
was a piece of our home.

450
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,152
(narrator) Lili Marlene
was equally popular with the British.

(men sing "Lili Marlene" in English)

452

00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,269
just the pgace for a spot of geave
with its bars, bazaars

459
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,564
and, um... other distractions.

00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,541

(Durrell) lt really was weird

465
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,940
when you think of the whole of Europe
blacked out and in darkness.

466
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,984
ln despair, you know?

467
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,362
ln Cairo, seething with light,
you rang up people,

468
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,532
you went out to dinner,
you had a hot bath and a whisky,

469
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,826
and on Monday
you'd be back on the line.

470
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,374
(narrator) Montgomery saw his main task
as raising the troops' morale.

471
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:05,962
He was the first commander to project
himself like an American politician.

472
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:11,092
Press men and photographers kept at
arm's length by Wavell and Auchinleck

473
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,720
now found themselves welcome.

474
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:19,392
(Beichein) He immediately went round
all the formations of the Eighth Army,

475
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,936
gathering people round to talk to them.

476
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:28,943
He used also the press, the radio
and gimmicks, such as his hats.

477
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:34,741
(man) They wanted something to be able
to identify themselves with and look at,

478
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:39,037
something other
than the strict uniform.

479
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:49,797
(De Guingand) lt was remarkable. ln
days, there was a different atmosphere,

480
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,382
a feeling of confidence.

481
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:55,553
He told us that
the bad old days were over

482
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,932
and he was now determined
there was going to be success.

483
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,309
He said, "Now the only order

484
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:05,772
is everyone stays where they are, fights
where they are and dies where they are."

485
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,452
(narrator) Montgomery saw to it
his army had the latest weapons.

486
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,080
Pressed by Churchill
to take the offensive,

487
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:26,251
"Monty", as he was soon known,
was not going to be rushed.

488
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,336
He was determined, as he put it,

489
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,798
to have everyone tough and hard
for the coming battle.

490
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,804
Because its first few hours
were going to be dominated by the mine -

491
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,348
the Germans had laid
over half a million of them -

492
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,434
the offensive had the codename
Operation Lightfoot,

493
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,229
a sick joke if ever there was one.

494
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,400
A mine detector
had been devised for use at Alamein,

495
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,402
but many were found to be faulty,

496
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,613
so most of the detecting
had to be done in the old way -

497
00:42:55,698 --> 00:43:02,161
by men prodding the ground with
bayonets and liffing the mines by hand.

498
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:16,342
The German minefields at Alamein
were five miles deep.

499
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,635
To assault them,

500
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,888
Montgomery had assembled
a quarter of a million troops -

501
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,850
British, Australians, New Zealanders,

502
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,977
lndians, South Africans,

503
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:30,315
Greeks, Poles, Czechs and Free French.

504
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,483
Twice as many men as Rommel had.

505
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,945
Nothing was being leff to chance.

506
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,533
(man) We were fully trained.
We were really confident.

507
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:47,332
(man #2) Every single solitary man
knew exactly what he had to do.

508
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,709
(man) Everything was in your favour.

509
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,712
We had no fear as such.

510
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,297
lt's an old adage, you know,

511
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:58,509
that it'll never happen to you
personally, you think.

512
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,056
(narrator) October 23, 1942.

513
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:08,436
ln the darkening desert, 1 ,100 tanks
and 1 ,000 guns moved into position.

514
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,523
(man) l was with my battalion,

515
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,611
laying mines
in front of our own positions,

516
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:20,073
and the Battle of Alamein started

517
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:25,286
by seeing the whole horizon on fire.

518
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:44,180
(man #2) A lot of people think
that Alamein was a big barrage

519
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,349
and everybody waiting behind,

520
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,102
queuing up ready to go
once the barrage finished.

521
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:54,565
But it wasn't like that. There was some
bloody fighting there, believe me.

522
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,568
(man #3) We moved off
before the barrage

523
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,238
and we were allowed a walking pace -

524
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:04,325
that was so the artillery
fell in front of us.

525
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:11,916
(man #4) ln the morning
we were disappointed, to say the least.

526
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,881
When the tanks should've passed us,
they hadn't arrived. Nobody had arrived.

527
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:27,390
By the time the sappers got the mines up
and there was a road made,

528
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:32,186
the Germans realised the reason,
and they pinpointed that opening.

529
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:41,738
(man #3) There was uncertainty that
the ground would erupt underneath you,

530
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:46,534
but you forget about running through a
minefield when a shell suddenly drops

531
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,662
and machine-gun fire opens up
and mortar fire.

532
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,497
There were squeals, shouts.

533
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,333
(Harding) lt was a battle of attrition.

534
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,713
lt was fought in a way,
and rightly in a way,

535
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:03,342
in which you had to continue
the offensive

536
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,429
until you had broken
the enemy's power of resistance.

537
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,139
And this does take time.

538
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,518
(man #3)
lf infantry destroys the antitank gun

539
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,353
and the minefields are clear,

540
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,440
then the tank can come forward
and exploit the situation.

541
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:21,611
But until that happens,
no success, no tanks.

542
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,823
(narrator) Montgomery lost 200 tanks
in the first two days,

543
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,118
as many as the Germans had started with.

544
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,580
Rommel, now back in Africa,
though clearly far from well,

545
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:36,501
immediately counterattacked,
angry his panzers had not done so

546
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,629
when the British had been bogged down
in the minefields.

547
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,298
lt was too late.

548
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,471
Rommel was thrown back,
with losses he could ill afford.

549
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,933
Casualties were heavy on both sides.

550
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:06,989
(man) They really hung on, see.
lt was really stubborn.

551
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:12,745
When we'd finished, then we realised
the casualties we'd leff behind.

552
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:17,959
You kept saying to yourself, "lt won't
happen to me. He'll catch it, l won't."

553
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,710
All of a sudden it dawns on you,

554
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:23,673
"One day you won't always
get away with it, lad."

555
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,225
(narrator) lt was a killing match,
as Monty had predicted.

556
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,311
A messy, horrid killing match.

557
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:43,150
A First World War battle
fought with Second World War weapons.

558
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,285
The battle of attrition
was going Montgomery's way.

559
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,705
The moment had come
for him to let loose his armour.

560
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:18,019
800 tanks, mostly Shermans,
the latest and best tank from America,

561
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,563
were thrown against
the Germans and ltalians.

562
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,065
And Rommel had less than 100 tanks.

563
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,410
Again, the fighting was bitter.

564
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,746
Rommel began to yield a little.

565
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,347
For two days more the battle raged.

566
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,934
lt was the biggest tank battle
of the Desert War.

567
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:05,358
Rommel was now down to only 35 tanks,
compared with Montgomery's 600.

568
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,696
Just when he was thinking of slipping
away to hold a line 60 miles back,

569
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,324
Hitler ordered him to stay.

570
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:22,124
(man) lt's a particularly nasty form
of ending one's days

571
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,752
if one is trapped in a tank

572
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,589
and the tank brews up and is on fire.

573
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:33,803
You will never lose the awfulness

574
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,514
of screams of men trying to get out.

575
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,699
(narrator)
The British armour was through

576
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,244
and by the affernoon of November 4,
the 12th day of the battle,

577
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,372
Rommel was in full retreat.

578
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:11,799
Thousands of ltalians were leff behind.
The Germans had pinched their transport.

579
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:15,052
Rommel's deputy, Von Thoma,
was captured too.

580
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,980
Alexander signalled Churchill
to ring out the victory bell,

581
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,356
which Winston did -

582
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:32,653
the first time church bells had been
rung in Britain since Dunkirk.

583
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,490
(thunder)

584
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:41,412
Heavy rain fell on November 6
to impede both pursued and pursuer.

585
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,582
Montgomery's corps commanders
were all for rushing ahead

586
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,251
to trap Rommel
before he could reorganise.

587
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:51,047
Monty was not going to risk
being trapped himself.

588
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,551
(Harding) Montgomery was very conscious

589
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:59,472
that we had already been twice up
and twice back,

590
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:04,310
and he was determined
not to push back for a third time.

591
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,023
(narrator) The air force saw to it

592
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,401
that Rommel's retreat
was not without incident.

593
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,741
(man) He had nowhere to run.
All he could was run into the sand.

594
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:22,244
(man #2) This is where desert warfare
was something on its own.

595
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,997
You just sat out there
or moved out there

596
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,083
and you were exposed to everything.

597
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,793
(gunfire)

598
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,148
(narrator) Past Mersa Matruh,
Sidi Barrani, through Halfaya Pass,

599
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:56,028
Rommel was pushed back,
turning to fight a little every day.

600
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,909
On November 13,
to Churchill's great joy,

601
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,328
Tobruk was retaken.

602
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,123
A week later it was Benghazi's turn
to change hands

603
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,876
for the fiffh and positively final time.

604
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,264
ln mid-January 1943, Tripoli fell -

605
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:27,977
the prize that had eluded O'Connor
two years before.

606
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,611
At last the British people
had something really to cheer about.

607
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:41,365
And Churchill?
The big victory he had been hoping for

608
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,994
before America would dominate the war.

609
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:52,418
(Churchill) You have altered the face
of the war in the most remarkable way.

610
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:57,548
l must tell you that your fame,

611
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:02,219
the fame of the Desert Army,
has spread throughout the world.

612
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,305
(bagpipes playing)

613
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,644
Now, this is not the end.

614
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:15,316
lt is not even the beginning of the end.

615
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,528
But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.
