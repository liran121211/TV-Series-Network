1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,472
(narrator) August 25, 1944.

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,143
Paris was liberated.

3
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:36,035
That same day, to the east,
Romania changed sides,

4
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,164
and with her defection
went Hitler's only natural oil supply.

5
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,499
Bulgaria had already quit the Axis,

6
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:48,714
and Finland, too, began negotiating
with the Russians for an armistice.

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,430
General de Gaulle, the Free French
leader, enters his capital,

8
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:02,227
a capital four years before he had left
a comparatively unknown soldier.

9
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,648
Now he was being greeted
as the very soul of France.

10
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,075
For Parisians, the dark years
of German occupation were over.

11
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,038
Could it be long
before the rest of Europe was freed too?

12
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,069
August 15, 1944.

13
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,699
Operation Anvil,
the Allied invasion of southern France.

14
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,129
With the break-out from the Normandy
beachhead under way to the north,

15
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,631
Anvil was meant to begin
the pincer movement

16
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,800
on Hitler's Germany from all sides -

17
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:02,097
the pincer movement
that was to squeeze the Third Reich dry.

18
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,937
We leapt out near St Tropez and
l thought, "They'll open up any minute,"

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,981
and suddenly out of the mists

20
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,026
on our particular beach
there came a Frenchman.

21
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,070
He carried a tray of champagne glasses.

22
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,822
And we all stopped.

23
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,408
Clearly, this was utterly unexpected,

24
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,204
and he smiled and said,
"Soyez les bienvenus, Monsieur."

25
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:30,125
"Welcome. But if l may venture a little
criticism, you are somewhat late."

26
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,837
From there on it was known to the troops
as the "Champagne Campaign".

27
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,221
(narrator) Everywhere, during
those mad, joyful weeks of August 1944,

28
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,264
the Germans were being driven back

29
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,100
towards the borders
of their own country.

30
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,066
(gunfire)

31
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,611
Those Frenchmen who had
collaborated with the hated Boche

32
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,030
became ever more desperate.

33
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,046
Those Frenchwomen who had
consorted with their conquerors

34
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,383
were now singled out
for special treatment.

35
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:51,331
Thousands upon thousands of sullen,
bewildered Germans were taken prisoner,

36
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,710
sometimes whole divisions at a time.

37
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,755
(newsreel) 20,000 German troops
are surrendered

38
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,758
by their commander,
Major General Erich Elster.

39
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:07,139
General Elster hands over his pistol
as a token of surrender.

40
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,851
General Elster
commanded the Biarritz area

41
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,186
from the Pyrenees to the Bay of Biscay.

42
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,746
(narrator) To many in the Allied camp,
the war seemed as good as over.

43
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,499
lndeed, there was talk
of being back home for Christmas.

44
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,085
But the top brass
didn't always see eye to eye

45
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,713
on just how the final victory
was to be won.

46
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,299
(man) Montgomery argued

47
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:47,012
that the Germans had had
a very heavy defeat in Normandy.

48
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,391
They'd lost
approximately 500,000 troops.

49
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:56,605
43 divisions had been smashed,
and 2,000 tanks.

50
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,816
This was the moment to really hit them.

51
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:05,447
And what he advocated
was a strong drive up the coastal plain,

52
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:11,661
with the right on the Ardennes and the
left probably almost on the coastline.

53
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:16,166
Day and night, never letting up,
never giving them time to recover.

54
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,211
And, of course, he would be
in command of this.

55
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,589
And we'd go right through,
bounce the crossing of the Rhine,

56
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,008
come round behind the Ruhr,
cut them oft,

57
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,844
and the war would be over in 1944.

58
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:32,099
Eisenhower said, "No. l don't
like this. lt's a pincerlike thrust."

59
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,393
"You're not touching a lot of the troops

60
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,144
which are in France."

61
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,814
"l propose to advance on a broad front,

62
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,649
right up to the Rhine,

63
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,443
and then do a crossing of the Rhine

64
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,654
and finish the war there."

65
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,407
But... That was perhaps safer,

66
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,991
but it meant that the war

67
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,119
couldn't be finished in 1944.

68
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,789
l think the British were very slow

69
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,916
to realise that the main eftort

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,127
for war in Europe

71
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,295
lay with the Americans.

72
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,091
l think the British press
was probably slow, as well.

73
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,428
l think people forgot

74
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:16,560
that the great weight of divisions
and supplies and so on were American.

75
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,980
After we broke out from the bridgehead,

76
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,400
supply for a very long time
had to come over the beaches

77
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,735
or be carried by air.

78
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,448
Army groups found often that
they couldn't do what they wanted to

79
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,285
for lack of supplies,
particularly petrol.

80
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,636
(narrator) Each tank used
a gallon of petrol a mile.

81
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,306
The trucks carrying the stuft

82
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,392
stretched back 250 miles
to the Normandy beaches.

83
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,938
Such had been the speed
of the Allied break-out

84
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,066
that pockets of German troops
had been left behind,

85
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:10,280
and so the road convoys had often to run
a gauntlet of enemy sniping on the way.

86
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,786
The lorry drivers
had nicknamed the area

87
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,957
between Paris and the front line
"lnjun country".

88
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,224
The hardest fighting of all
was along the coast.

89
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,643
Every port had been garrisoned by Hitler

90
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,979
with orders to fight
to the proverbial last round.

91
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:50,487
Le Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne, Calais,
Dunkirk, had all to be assaulted in turn

92
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,739
by separate set-piece battle.

93
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,995
Hitler knew supply
would be the Allies' main headache,

94
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,250
hence his determination to hang on
to the Channel ports as long as possible

95
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,629
and, when finally yielded,
to see they were destroyed utterly.

96
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,974
One third of Montgomery's forces

97
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,269
were engaged in clearing Germans
from the Channel ports

98
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,980
while the rest pushed on into Belgium.

99
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,198
(Horrocks) My really big moment
was when we crossed the frontier,

100
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:39,786
because, you see,
l had commanded the rearguard

101
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,955
during the withdrawal to Dunkirk.

102
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,624
l was then a battalion commander.

103
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,962
And l'd been doing flank guard
and rear guard to the 3rd Division,

104
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,633
commanded by a certain Field Marshal
Montgomery, who was then a general.

105
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,219
And l was very ashamed of myself.

106
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,848
We'd advanced
to the cheers of the Belgian people,

107
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:05,395
and now a few days later, back we were
going through these ashen-faced crowds,

108
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,980
terribly despondent -

109
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,567
they knew they were going
to be occupied again by the Germans.

110
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:15,280
And l kept on saying, "Don't worry.
We'll come back."

111
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,451
And as we crossed the frontier,
we had come back.

112
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:25,123
And a young man - l suppose
he saw the red round my hat, you know -

113
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,752
and he ran across to my tank.

114
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:33,798
There were tears pouring down his face.
And he held out his hand like this,

115
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,302
and he said, "l knew you'd come back!
l knew you'd come back!"

116
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,928
(cheering)

117
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:55,111
A friend of mine in Brussels told me
that he heard the sound of tanks,

118
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,447
but they were quite used to that.

119
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,241
He looked out of the window,
and he said to himself:

120
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,244
"Those are difterent.
They don't seem to be German."

121
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,499
Then he opened the window and leant out,
and somebody waved.

122
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:12,337
He said, "They're British!"
And he tore down into the street,

123
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,632
and so did everybody else in Brussels.

124
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:20,512
There has never been such a scene
as when we liberated Brussels, never.

125
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,890
And some of the really tough
old 30 Corps veterans

126
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:28,269
still blush to think
of the things that happened.

127
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,211
So far, so good.
Now we come to the mistakes.

128
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:58,800
We were ordered to halt. The reason
was that we were outrunning our supply.

129
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,302
Now, this was wrong,

130
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:06,891
because we had 100 kilometres' worth
of petrol with our vehicles,

131
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,479
and another 100 kilometres'
within about 24 hours' reach,

132
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,649
and they should, in my opinion,
have taken a chance.

133
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,610
Because that day that we were halted,

134
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,614
the only thing between us and the Rhine

135
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,869
was one division of very old gentlemen.

136
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,831
We called them "stomach divisions",
because they were sort of my age,

137
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,417
and all had things wrong
with their tummies.

138
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,878
They'd been guarding
the coast of Holland,

139
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,755
never seen a shot fired in anger,

140
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,633
and they'd have been delighted
to move peacefully into our POW camps

141
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,971
without having to indulge in this horrid
war - that was the sort of mentality.

142
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,224
Plus one Dutch SS battalion - nothing.

143
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,854
We could have brushed straight through
them, bounced the crossing to the Rhine,

144
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,525
cut all the Germans in Holland
oft from the Ruhr,

145
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,611
and then got round behind the Ruhr.

146
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,198
Unquestionably, it was, to my mind,
a very bad mistake.

147
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,074
We should have taken the risk.

148
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,454
When we were allowed to advance,
which was September 7,

149
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,791
we made ten miles in four days.

150
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:19,005
We had previously done
250 miles in seven days.

151
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,885
We were no longer pursuing.
We were now fighting again.

152
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,645
Then, on September 1 1 ,

153
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,064
l got my orders for Arnhem.

154
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,567
(narrator) The three main waterways
of the Rhine delta

155
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,570
lay between the Allied spearheads
and Germany proper:

156
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,491
the Maas, the Waal and the Neder Rijn.

157
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:52,163
Montgomery's plan was to lay an
airborne carpet across these waterways,

158
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,498
capture the bridges,

159
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,210
and rush a mobile force round
the left flank of the Siegfried line

160
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:03,299
to cut oft the Ruhr, and so end
German resistance before Christmas 1944.

161
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,269
l've got it.

162
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,261
(Strong) Many people will tell you
that the plan was wrong -

163
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,056
there were too many objectives,

164
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,226
or the parachutists were not landed
in proper places and so on.

165
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,022
And the weather, of course,
was not good, and did interrupt it.

166
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,359
But l think that
if more attention had been paid

167
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,028
to what you might call
the enemy's dispositions,

168
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,406
then l think the plan
would have been alright.

169
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,806
(De Guingand) Airborne troops
who landed at Arnhem

170
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,143
suddenly found themselves
up against some German armoured units

171
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:24,524
that were refitting there, and
just happened to be there at the time.

172
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,818
(gunfire)

173
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:43,459
(Strong) Among the first ofticers
who were landed among the parachutists,

174
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,672
the Germans found
a complete copy of our plan.

175
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:52,635
And this was whisked oft
to the German commander on the spot,

176
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,722
and, of course, from then on
he had all the information

177
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,516
of what we were trying to do.

178
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,835
(De Guingand)
lt's anyone's guess whether,

179
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,046
having got that Rhine bridgehead,

180
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,090
at that time of year,
with the bad weather setting in,

181
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,593
whether we'd have been able
to maintain that

182
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,304
for several months during the winter.

183
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,558
Because one knew from experience
how magnificent the Germans were

184
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,895
at retrieving critical situations.

185
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,526
The battle went on
for three or four days,

186
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,946
and we couldn't really
make any progress.

187
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:59,786
Eventually Montgomery decided
that he couldn't go on,

188
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,415
and that the operation
was to be called oft,

189
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,753
and get as many people back across
the Rhine as possible, which he did.

190
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,131
We lost quite a lot. But l think
one's got to be quite honest,

191
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,094
and say that it failed in its object.

192
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,888
lt achieved partial success,

193
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,265
and l always hate using that expression

194
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,892
of "glorious failures".

195
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,269
l wouldn't call it that, but...

196
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,939
it was a failure, up to a point.

197
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,316
(narrator) The failure at Arnhem

198
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,239
meant the war would now definitely
not be over by Christmas 1944.

199
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,535
lt meant, too, that the initiative,
for the moment,

200
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,413
had been lost by the Western Allies.

201
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,793
But on the Eastern Front,
it was a vastly difterent story.

202
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,504
There, the Red Army
was advancing everywhere.

203
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,216
ln the centre, 100,000 Germans
had been surrounded at Minsk.

204
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,594
ln the north, Finland had been
knocked out of the war,

205
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,558
Estonia recaptured, Latvia and Lithuania
cleared of German troops,

206
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,436
and the borders of East Prussia reached.

207
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,982
ln the south,
the Ukraine had been freed.

208
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,192
Romania had capitulated,

209
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,486
Bulgaria had been overrun,

210
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,530
Greece cut oft,

211
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:22,076
and a link-up eftected
with Tito's partisans in Yugoslavia.

212
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,079
lt was a story of gigantic triumph,

213
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,039
of overwhelming success

214
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,125
everywhere in the east,

215
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,460
save in one near-forgotten city,

216
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,006
where the war had first begun
five years before:

217
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,466
Poland's capital, Warsaw.

218
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,848
By July 1944, the Red Army
occupied the eastern half of Poland,

219
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:50,229
that half allocated to them in
the Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939.

220
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,066
The exiled Polish government in London
was anxious to assert itself

221
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,444
before the Russians overran the country.

222
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,070
Otherwise, in their eyes,

223
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,576
it would merely be an exchange of
occupiers rather than true liberation.

224
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,329
As the Red Army approached Warsaw,

225
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,457
the German garrison
seemed ready to leave.

226
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:28,142
On July 29, a Russian broadcast
talked of Warsaw's impending liberation,

227
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:33,814
and urged the workers of the Resistance
to rise against the retreating Germans.

228
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,361
On August 1 , the Polish underground
army inside Warsaw did rise,

229
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,906
though they did not all support
the London government.

230
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,783
However, the aim of those who did

231
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,245
was to fly in the government-in-exile
once they had control

232
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,750
and set up a legitimate regime
before the Russians arrived.

233
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:57,546
But the uprising coincided with the
Russian oftensive running out of steam,

234
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,841
a coincidence that nevertheless
suited Stalin's book.

235
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:05,179
(man) Stalin was very suspicious
of the underground,

236
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,100
but it was utterly cruel that
he wouldn't even try to get supplies in.

237
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,896
He refused to let our aeroplanes fly and
try to drop supplies for several weeks.

238
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,856
And that was a shock to all of us.

239
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,943
l think it played a role
in all of our minds

240
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,862
as to the heartlessness of the Russians.

241
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,828
(man) We had a very strong
underground organisation,

242
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:34,625
with a civilian government
and all the military commands,

243
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,673
and that was organised during
the four years of the German occupation,

244
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,801
and it just surfaced
and took its functions.

245
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,972
The postal serVice,
which was run by Scouts,

246
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:52,810
was the only means of communications
between the various districts of Warsaw,

247
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,771
which were completely cut oft
by enemy fire.

248
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,108
The Scouts, to get
from one district to another,

249
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:05,573
had sometimes to go through sewers,
or under the enemy fire.

250
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,284
(gunfire)

251
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,788
At the very beginning of the uprising

252
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,833
we had ammunition for only,
l think, ten or 12 days.

253
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:21,630
And then we had to rely on
the ammunition taken from the Germans,

254
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:27,720
or there were factories of ammunition
and arms in Warsaw going on,

255
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,931
and they were producing
their own ammunition.

256
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,700
(woman) There is something in the
Polish character which is optimistic,

257
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,452
and we do not give up so easily.

258
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,412
l would have given half of my life

259
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,083
for the privilege of participating
in the Warsaw insurrection.

260
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,794
There was a tremendous intensification

261
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:05,174
of moral life, intellectual life,
emotional life,

262
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:09,428
the best sides of people
coming to the foreground.

263
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,680
(stirring march)

264
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:28,823
We had lots of recitals
through all the Warsaw insurrection.

265
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:43,003
(man) There were people who took
single-handed actions against the tanks,

266
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:48,551
people who threw themselves
at enemy machine guns, things like that.

267
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,387
There was plenty of individual heroism.

268
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,223
(narrator) The London Poles
almost pulled it oft.

269
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,768
By the end of the first week,
they controlled most of the city,

270
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:02,398
and the RAF was set to fly in
the Polish government-in-exile.

271
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:06,861
But then Hitler, realising
Stalin was going to do nothing,

272
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,321
ordered the SS to crush the uprising,

273
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,242
which they proceeded to do
with great relish and ruthlessness.

274
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,725
(woman) The bombing was very bad -
without interruption, practically.

275
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,978
Not only bombing, we had artillery also.

276
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,606
We would cover our dead with newspapers.

277
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,277
This was the first thing always,
you see, before the funeral,

278
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,197
in order not to spoil the morale.

279
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,914
(man) During the last days
of the uprising,

280
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,125
only one district was left
unoccupied by the Germans.

281
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,295
There were three to four,
perhaps 5,000 people.

282
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:10,299
There were sometimes 30 or 40 people
sleeping in one room.

283
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:15,679
Now, the Germans were bombarding us
with their dive bombers.

284
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,236
(woman) We had less and less food,
you know.

285
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,738
We had some starches,
we didn't have bread,

286
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,990
we had spaghetti, things of that sort.

287
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:41,455
And at the end, you know, we would
kill horses, and eat horse meat.

288
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,625
And dogs were eaten also.

289
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:53,592
(narrator) The London Poles became
more frantic in their hopelessness,

290
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,303
and blamed the British for their plight.

291
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,974
But the RAF
couldn't fly in much supplies

292
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,812
as long as Stalin refused to let them
refuel in Soviet-held territory.

293
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,108
By the time he'd been persuaded
to relent, so little was left of Warsaw

294
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:14,321
that the supplies dropped fell
more often than not into German hands.

295
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:20,202
(man) We were terribly disappointed.
The whole world forgot about us.

296
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:24,790
(woman) l feel that
Poland was betrayed by Allies, you see?

297
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,502
(man) lt was the end. We felt
there was absolutely no hope for us,

298
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,338
that we wouldn't get any help
from the Russians.

299
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,384
The Germans were
set on absolutely annihilating us,

300
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:40,472
and therefore l didn't bother to duck

301
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,810
when l was going under the fire,
anything like that.

302
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:51,066
l just had the feeling that l should die
sooner or later - sooner, better.

303
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,364
(narrator) The Germans brought
their biggest siege gun,

304
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,326
the dreaded giant mortar
nicknamed "Thor",

305
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,580
each of whose shells
weighed more than two tons.

306
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:12,129
lt was a hopeless battle now that
had been going on for ten long weeks,

307
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:16,759
and had already cost the lives
of more than 200,000 Poles.

308
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,595
The time had come to call a halt.

309
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:42,242
Surprisingly, the Germans allowed
the Poles to surrender honourably,

310
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,663
and treated them
not as partisans fit for execution,

311
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,874
but as enlisted combatants,
due the rights of POWs

312
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,293
under the Geneva Convention.

313
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,587
Clearly, some of the German generals

314
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:59,009
already had their eyes on possible
war-crimes trials after the war.

315
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,285
Once the remaining citizens
had been driven from the city,

316
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,914
Warsaw was systematically
razed to the ground.

317
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:00,112
Hitler was determined
it should never rise again.

318
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,508
Thus ended one of the war's
most tragic episodes.

319
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,825
Despite the bombing
and the privations,

320
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,914
the morale of the German people that
autumn of 1944 was surprisingly high.

321
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,667
They responded well
to every propaganda call Hitler made.

322
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,881
This one was for collecting
winter clothing for the Eastern Front.

323
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,766
Hitler reduced the call-up age
that autumn to 16½,

324
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,729
and raked in those who so far had
escaped it on grounds of essential work.

325
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,233
Some 700,000 new recruits were raised,

326
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,361
partly for the Volkssturm,
a sort of Home Guard,

327
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:27,324
and partly to replace his terrible
losses in both east and west.

328
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:32,371
But he also had in mind
a more daring use for his new recruits.

329
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:38,001
Since his defeat in Normandy, Hitler had
been planning a major counterattack,

330
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,672
hoping not just to halt the Allies
before they reached the Rhine,

331
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,717
but to turn them back so decisively
that they would want to sue for peace -

332
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,596
a peace that would give him a breathing
space to stem the Russian advance

333
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,599
before it got too close to Berlin.

334
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,728
Such was his fantasy.

335
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,775
To that end, too,
he'd been conserVing his panzers,

336
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,987
re-equipping them
after their mauling in Normandy.

337
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,864
But where to strike?

338
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,869
That autumn of 1944,

339
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,913
the Allies in the west
had closed up to the German border

340
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,498
along a 1 ,000-mile front,

341
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,502
and had even penetrated
the Siegfried line in one or two places.

342
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:25,591
But supply still remained a problem,
for Antwerp was not yet open.

343
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:29,094
To the north of Antwerp
lay the bulk of the British forces.

344
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:33,515
lf, by a daring blow, Hitler could
capture Antwerp and reach the sea,

345
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,852
he would not only eliminate
the Allies' main supply port,

346
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,396
he would also have split
the Allies in two,

347
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,859
and the British might once again
have to contemplate a Dunkirk.

348
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,154
Eisenhower,
in manning his 1 ,000-mile front,

349
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,781
had had to spread his forces
thinly in places.

350
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:55,412
One such place was just 125 miles
from Antwerp - the Ardennes,

351
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:59,666
of 1940 magical, mystical memory
for Hitler.

352
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,587
lf only history
could repeat itself for him.

353
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:13,805
(De Guingand) ln war, one must remember
that you can't be strong everywhere.

354
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:19,436
12th Army Group, Bradley's army group,
were given certain tasks.

355
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,855
And therefore he had to decide

356
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,275
where he was going to be strong,
and where he would be weak.

357
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,945
And he assessed the situation

358
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,324
and decided he'd thin out
on the Ardennes sector.

359
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,545
(American man)
We were told by some of the men

360
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,175
who were in the houses that we took over

361
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,596
that it was a very quiet sector,
nothing happened.

362
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,265
Once in a while a patrol was sent out.

363
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,020
They would hear sometimes
the crackling of a gun in the distance,

364
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,315
and... well, there was nothing to it.

365
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:22,958
l was... not exactly green,

366
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,919
but there weren't too many
in our particular unit

367
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,590
that had had much
in the way of any combat experience.

368
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,896
(German man) On October 24,

369
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,816
l was ordered to come to Hitler,

370
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,279
to his headquarters in East Prussia.

371
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,408
And he developed me and General Krebs,

372
00:33:56,492 --> 00:34:01,788
the chief of the army group
in the centre, who accompanied me,

373
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,540
that we would get,

374
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:10,005
end of November or beginning
of December, strong reinforcements.

375
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,509
He named... 20 infantry divisions,

376
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:19,848
ten armoured divisions,
and a lot of other special troops,

377
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:24,770
and he promised that
we would be supported by the air force,

378
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,647
with about 3,000 planes.

379
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,361
But we were totally surprised.

380
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:39,201
He explained that the objectives,
Antwerp and Brussels,

381
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,870
were something of a risk,

382
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:46,792
and might seem beyond
the capacity of the forces available,

383
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,294
and their condition.

384
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:54,716
Nevertheless, he had decided
to stake everything on one card,

385
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,551
because Germany needed

386
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,887
a breathing space.

387
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,931
A defence struggle, he said,

388
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,433
could only postpone the decision,

389
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,062
and not change
the general situation for Germany.

390
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,364
(narrator) For his attack,
Hitler, unknown to the Allies,

391
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,450
had assembled
more than half a million troops.

392
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:25,372
Opposing them were just 80,000
ill-equipped, inexperienced Americans.

393
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,167
lt seemed like May 1940 all over again.

394
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,803
(Manteuffel) The morale
of the German attacking forces was high,

395
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,848
and this compensated, in my opinion,

396
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:47,602
for our comparative weakness
in weapon and in manpower.

397
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:53,942
(German man) We saw this build-up
of forces - tanks in great number,

398
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:58,738
more tanks than we had seen
in the last two years.

399
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,491
We even saw aircraft,

400
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:07,914
and then we saw that the preparations
were well kept in secrecy.

401
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,168
(narrator) "Null Day" - Zero Day -

402
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,378
December 16, arrived.

403
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,393
Feuer!

404
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,157
The barrage lasted an hour,
and gave the Allies

405
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:46,036
a taste of what they had themselves
meted out at Cassino some months,

406
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,831
and at El Alamein some years, before.

407
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,088
The last great attack
of the Germans in the west had begun.

408
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,800
Hitler's most desperate gamble was on.

409
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:10,268
(German man) As a simple soldier,
everything is on the road,

410
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,605
and you think these are
more divisions than they are.

411
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:18,318
Therefore we had the feeling
that this build-up of force

412
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:24,199
might enable us to reach the final goal,
which was Antwerp.

413
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,410
The weather was foggy.

414
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:35,377
The American and British air superiority
didn't matter in that type of weather,

415
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:40,423
and therefore we believed
that we would be successful.

416
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,393
(narrator) Surprise was total.

417
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,562
lt began a day
of monumental confusion for the Allies,

418
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:59,567
the worst they experienced
in the whole European war.

419
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,577
Even as the first Wehrmacht waves
were overrunning

420
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,163
the American positions
along the Ardennes,

421
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,916
talk at Allied headquarters
back at Versailles

422
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,628
was focused more on the news
of band leader Glenn Miller's death

423
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:24,384
than of the possibility of the biggest
German oftensive in the west since 1940.

424
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,763
lt was the day Eisenhower
was promoted five-star general,

425
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,850
and the day Field Marshal Montgomery
applied for leave

426
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,769
to go home to England for Christmas.

427
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,440
lke was attending
his chaufteur's wedding that morning,

428
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,401
while Monty was playing golf.

429
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:46,531
As the day wore on,
the resemblances to May 1940 grew.

430
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,868
The overwhelming German might,
their relentless speed,

431
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,370
above all the chaos in the Allied rear,

432
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,749
as bewildered, untried troops
dashed for safety,

433
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:00,420
clogging the roads and preventing
reinforcements reaching the front.

434
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,673
(German man) A rumour was spread
that the Americans

435
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,635
would hand over part of
the prisoners of war to the Russians,

436
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,433
and that helped to build up morale
and the will to fight.

437
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,107
(narrator) 7,000 Americans
surrendered in one go,

438
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:27,364
the biggest mass surrender of
American arms in the European campaign.

439
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,581
German newsreel cameramen
had a field day.

440
00:39:54,892 --> 00:40:00,105
(American man) The fog was lifting
a little bit in the area where we were,

441
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:06,569
but by about 12 o'clock, we found
that we couldn't go any further,

442
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,407
that it was just a question
of surrendering.

443
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,788
(man #2) The lieutenant went
and made arrangements

444
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,833
with the German ofticer in charge,

445
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,586
and came back up
and told us that we had one hour

446
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:29,717
to dismantle and destroy our weapons,

447
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,972
or dig holes and bury
whatever we wanted to bury,

448
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:38,268
and be ready to come oft that hill
within one hour.

449
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:47,861
(German man) The first American
prisoners didn't know what was going on.

450
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,072
They came to us, asked for bread,
and we had bread enough,

451
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:55,285
so we gave them bread
and they gave us chocolate.

452
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,291
(German man) After two or three days,

453
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:47,962
we already saw that
the resistance of the American troops

454
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,633
was stronger than we had believed.

455
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,344
(gunfire)

456
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,391
(American man)
They had been able to break through

457
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,186
because we could get
no fighter-bomber support.

458
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,189
The weather was sitting
right on the treetops,

459
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:11,486
and we couldn't pick up
any of their moving troops from the air.

460
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,990
But on Christmas Eve, the clouds lifted,

461
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,371
and thereafter
the fighter-bombers came in,

462
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:25,083
and they simply
destroyed the German armour.

463
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,434
(narrator) Manteuftel's panzers
had run out of petrol,

464
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,729
still some 70 miles short of Antwerp.

465
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:51,985
Motionless, they were sitting ducks
for the Allied planes.

466
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,325
"lt was a great slaughter",

467
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,745
the American divisional commander
wrote in his report.

468
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:07,417
For Hitler, it was more
than the beginning of the end.

469
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,340
(Manteuffel) The failure
of this oftensive aftected morale,

470
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:19,262
and, therefore, the behaviour of
the soldiers and the civilians alike.

471
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:24,726
Thus we have contributed
to speeding the end of the war.

472
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,855
(narrator)
With the German oftensive halted,

473
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,816
Americans from the south
and British from the north

474
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,695
pressed on the bulge that had been
formed within the Ardennes front -

475
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:40,033
the bulge that gave
this particular battle its popular name.

476
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,287
They met in mid-January 1945,

477
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:48,291
by which time the German army
was in total disarray,

478
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:52,003
for the Russian winter oftensive
had begun four days before.

479
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:57,759
Now Hitler's gamble in the west
was seen to be supreme folly,

480
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,971
for, to do it, he had denuded
his defences in the east.

481
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,524
With its carefully hoarded reserVes
of fuel and equipment

482
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,694
and, of course, of men too, gone,

483
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,573
the German war machine
began to disintegrate.

484
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:07,328
l would say that Hitler's attack
in the Bulge brought the war to an end

485
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:11,708
perhaps six months earlier
than it would otherwise have ended.

486
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,502
The Germans
could have fallen back to the Rhine,

487
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,879
which was a real obstacle.

488
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:20,925
But they had nothing with which
to hold the Rhine, because essentially,

489
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:25,805
the reserVes of the German army,
the mobile troops and the reserVes,

490
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,307
were destroyed
in the battle of the Bulge.

491
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,602
The German soldier was exhausted,

492
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,983
and he had only one desire:
to end the war.

493
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:42,488
But he was willing to fight on,

494
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,993
to cover the rear of the Eastern Front.

495
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,998
(narrator) On January 20, 1945,

496
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,418
Zhukov's tanks entered Germany proper
for the first time,

497
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,504
a mere 100 miles from Berlin,

498
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,590
the occasion being celebrated

499
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:05,094
by a particularly savage sacking
of every village in sight.

500
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,027
Soon, thousands upon thousands
of German civilians

501
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,864
took to the roads westwards,
away from the dreaded Russians,

502
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,742
producing scenes reminiscent
of those long lines

503
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:31,621
of French and Belgian refugees
five years before.

504
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,808
As the Allied bombing intensified,

505
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,852
more and more German cities
were reduced to rubble.

506
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:59,565
ln Mein Kampf, Hitler had written,
"Even if we cannot conquer,

507
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,444
we shall drag the world into destruction
with us."

508
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:21,879
All during March, the Russian guns
could be heard in Berlin.

509
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,995
(Horrocks) They came to me and said,
"Do you want Cleves taking out?"

510
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,749
By "taking out" they meant all
the heavy bombers putting on to Cleves.

511
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:04,255
Now, l knew that Cleves
was a fine old historical German town.

512
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:09,594
Anne of Cleves, one of
Henry Vlll's wives, came from there.

513
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,471
l knew that there were
a lot of civilians in Cleves,

514
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,308
men, women and children.

515
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:19,103
lf l said no, they would live.
lf l said yes, they would die.

516
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:24,942
A terrible decision you've got to take.
But everything depended

517
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,404
on getting a high piece of ground
at Materborn.

518
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,741
The German reserVes
would have to come through Cleves,

519
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,286
and we would have to breach
the Siegfried line and get there.

520
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,331
And your own lives, your own troops,
must come first,

521
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:42,585
so l said yes, l did want it taking out.

522
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,963
But when all those bombers went over
the night...

523
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,508
just before zero hour,
to take out Cleves,

524
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,011
l felt a murderer.

525
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:57,475
And after the war l had an awful lot
of nightmares. lt was always Cleves.

526
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,756
(narrator) The cities west of the Rhine
were cleared of German troops -

527
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,761
Bonn, Koblenz, Mainz
and, of course, Cologne.

528
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,205
By March 22, no German soldier
fought west of the Rhine.

529
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,849
Only the Rhine now lay
between the Western Allies

530
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,977
and the heartland of Hitler's Germany.

531
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,564
Preparations began straightaway
to cross it.

532
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:12,229
(Horrocks) At nine o'clock
in the evening, l remember waiting,

533
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,524
sitting in a command post.

534
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:20,821
Then the news came through that
the Black Watch were over the Rhine.

535
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:24,909
Rather historic, you know, in a way.
They were over the Rhine.
