1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,850
(narrator) Winston Churchill
once told Stalin:

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,645
"The Mediterranean is the soff
underbelly of the crocodile."

3
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,566
Churchill and the British
Chiefs of Staff believed

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,444
that attacking German-occupied
Europe through ltaly

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,821
would help shorten the war.

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,657
The Americans were not convinced,

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,453
preferring to focus on the decisive
blow across the English Channel.

8
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,207
Only reluctantly did they agree
to join their British allies

9
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,459
on the road to Rome.

10
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,897
November, 1942.

11
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,691
1 1 months affer Pearl Harbour,

12
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,071
the American army prepared for its
first encounter with the Wehrmacht.

13
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,163
Operation Torch - codename
for the Anglo-American landings

14
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,000
in the French North African colonies
of Morocco and Algeria.

15
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,049
They met little or no resistance
from the forces of Vichy France.

16
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,803
The French command soon broke
with the government of Pétain

17
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,974
and their troops
became part of the Allied army.

18
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,854
An American general,
Dwight D Eisenhower,

19
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,982
was supreme commander.

20
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,068
The American planners
were never keen on the operation,

21
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,571
but President Roosevelt was determined

22
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:40,159
to get his ground forces
into action against Hitler in 1942.

23
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,162
Attacking the Germans in Tunisia

24
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,999
was the next best thing to
a second front in Europe.

25
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,428
At Casablanca,
within two months of the landings,

26
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:04,641
an impressive array of British
and American top brass assembled.

27
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,444
The Russians were not present,

28
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,988
but everybody there knew
they had to do something

29
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,324
to take the pressure off the Red Army.

30
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:26,330
Churchill and Roosevelt had now to
decide where they went from here.

31
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,083
At the beginning of 1943,

32
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:34,171
the British and Americans
were firmly established in North Africa.

33
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,090
Hitler reinforced Rommel's forces
in Tunisia,

34
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,427
but with the British Eighth Army
closing from the east,

35
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,471
it could only be a matter of time

36
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,308
before the entire African coastline
was in Allied hands.

37
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,726
What then?

38
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:52,564
We have to face the fact that there was
a big difference between the two sides

39
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:57,736
about what the future strategy
of the war would be.

40
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:03,617
The British, the British
Chiefs of Staff, Churchill,

41
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:09,206
were all in favour
of the future of the campaign

42
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,583
being carried out through ltaly

43
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:17,965
and hitting at the underside
of the underbelly of the Germans,

44
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,718
moving up and eventually joining up
with the Russians.

45
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,098
The Americans held
exactly the opposite view.

46
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,560
They felt the only way
that you could defeat Germany

47
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:35,440
was to take the shortest way into the
centre of Germany, across the Channel,

48
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:41,363
and advance into the areas
of the Ruhr and Saar,

49
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,615
the great industrial areas,

50
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,120
and then destroy the German forces
by that means.

51
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,456
(narrator) The British,
led by Sir Alan Brooke,

52
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,458
Chief of the lmperial General Staff,

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,546
came to Casablanca determined
to have their way. They got it.

54
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,550
The Americans, under Marshall,
were persuaded that the next objective

55
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,427
would be the invasion of Sicily,

56
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,263
leading, it was hoped,
to the surrender of ltaly.

57
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:11,184
Thus the main second front
was postponed for another year.

58
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,938
At the time, however, the big news
from the Casablanca conference

59
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,608
was an unexpected pronouncement
by the American president.

60
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:23,280
(man) Mr Roosevelt began by saying
that when he was a young man

61
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:29,119
the great reputation in the American
military was General Grant,

62
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,455
who had once sent an order

63
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:36,251
saying that he would accept no terms
but unconditional surrender,

64
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:41,423
and that these in fact were the terms
that the Allies, or the United Nations,

65
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,468
wanted to present to their enemies.

66
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,639
He then went on
as though he did not understand

67
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,143
how important a statement he had made.

68
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:57,272
Mr Churchill looked
considerably surprised at this.

69
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,275
And l think that Mr Churchill felt that

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,238
it was not the best way to present
the Allied position to the enemy.

71
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,659
However, as he said then and later,
he was Mr Roosevelt's ardent lieutenant

72
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,245
and he would go along with it.

73
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,092
(narrator) Affer the talking, Roosevelt
appeared in his other capacity -

74
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,012
commander in chief
of the American armed forces.

75
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,315
lf this confident-looking American
army crossed the Atlantic

76
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,401
expecting to carry all before it,

77
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,029
it was very soon cruelly disillusioned.

78
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,665
ln a sudden onslaught
through the Kassarine Pass in Tunisia,

79
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:02,754
Rommel inflicted on the American army
one of its worst defeats of the war.

80
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,819
The Afrikakorps was far too
well-equipped and experienced

81
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:31,116
for the lightly armoured
and underpowered American tanks.

82
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:38,081
The morale of these raw young
Americans was badly shaken.

83
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,625
Many were taken prisoner.

84
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,312
(Middleton) lt brought the troops
face to face

85
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,482
with the fact that this
was going to be a long war

86
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,901
and a tough one
and the Germans were very good.

87
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,363
Armies never learn from other armies,
they have to learn by themselves,

88
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,618
and a lot of the tactics
that we used disastrously at Kassarine

89
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,163
were those that the British army
had used equally disastrously

90
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,583
two years before in the western desert,
then discarded.

91
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,961
l think it helped our army
and made them realise,

92
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,006
because the British came down
from the north and did help,

93
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,052
that this was going to be a cooperative
effort, that we couldn't win it alone.

94
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,764
Also, it got the average Gl
accustomed to the fact

95
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,308
that there would be one battle
affer another.

96
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,230
(narrator) But Rommel lacked
the strength to exploit his victory.

97
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:48,401
The Allies, under Alexander, regrouped
and within ten days retook the path.

98
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,613
The Germans in Tunisia
were now hemmed in.

99
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,324
The Allied sea and air blockade
of the coastline

100
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,369
made large-scale evacuation impossible.

101
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,539
ln the south, a forward patrol
of the Eighth Army

102
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,333
linked up with the American
Second Corps.

103
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,502
The trap closed.

104
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:12,801
Two Allied forces, once separated
by 2,000 miles of mountain and desert,

105
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:18,014
joined hands for the finag onsgaught
on the German position in Africa.

106
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,904
The Allied armies, vastly superior
in numbers, drove the enemy,

107
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,909
now without Rommel who had been
invalided home, back towards the sea.

108
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:52,382
The Allied air forces
had undisputed control.

109
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,014
ln seven days it was all over.

110
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,967
Finally, the Afrikakorps saw no point
in fighting to the last man.

111
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,095
They surrendered in droves.

112
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,394
The unfortunate General von Arnim,
who succeeded Rommel,

113
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,773
also surrendered with all his staff.

114
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,234
Nearly a quarter of a million men
were taken prisoner -

115
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,863
a victory to rank alongside Stalingrad.

116
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:03,286
This was a major boost for the British
and their Mediterranean strategy.

117
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:13,004
Sicily, as agreed at Casablanca,
was the next item on the agenda.

118
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,132
Only two months
affer the German collapse in Tunisia,

119
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:22,263
the British and Americans began
landing troops on Sicilian beaches.

120
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,858
The British were led by Montgomery,
the Americans by General Patton -

121
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,486
the first time these
egocentric personalities

122
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,448
had been involved
in the same campaign.

123
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:01,636
lt was the British Eighth Army which
met the fiercest German resistance.

124
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:07,517
On their leff, Patton's Americans
swept across Sicily in style.

125
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,150
They found useful allies in the Mafia

126
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,320
and family connections
among the civilian population.

127
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,031
(man) The situation was relieved
somewhat

128
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,535
by the fact that there
was hardly a family in Sicily

129
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,163
that didn't have relatives
in the United States.

130
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,167
(narrator) The Sicilian landing,
bringing the war on to their own soil,

131
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,253
convinced most ltalians
that theirs was a lost cause.

132
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,089
Giving themselves up,
if possible by the regiment,

133
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,844
became the first objective
of ltaly's armed forces.

134
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,146
Allied raids on Rome provided another
argument for getting out of the war.

135
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,403
Benito Mussolini, il Duce for 20 years,

136
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,449
was outvoted in his own
Fascist Grand Council.

137
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,415
On July 25th,
he was toppled from power.

138
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,838
King Victor Emmanuel approved
the elderly Marshal Badoglio

139
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,673
as head of the government.

140
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:25,053
Badoglio declared publicly
that the war would go on,

141
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,555
but immediately began
secret negotiations

142
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,058
with the Allies for surrender.

143
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:41,402
By now Sicily, affer only a few weeks,
was almost all in Allied hands.

144
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,995
This time there was to be no great haul
of German prisoners.

145
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,293
German evacuation across the narrow
Straits of Messina was very successful.

146
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,099
Most of the Wehrmacht's personnel
got away to the mainland.

147
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,519
Even the last guard dog.

148
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,699
General Patton beat Montgomery
into Messina.

149
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,494
The Allies had landed in Sicily
not knowing where they would go next.

150
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,665
At the prospect of ltalian collapse, the
British were for attacking the mainland.

151
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:40,461
The Americans agreed, but insisted
that Overlord, the invasion of Normandy,

152
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,548
must take priority for resources.

153
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,177
A secret envoy, General Castellano,
was sent by Badoglio

154
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,973
to find out on what terms
ltaly could join the Allies.

155
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,559
But the Allies simply wanted
ltalian surrender

156
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,520
and refused to tell Castellano
of their invasion plans -

157
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,356
partly because they didn't want
the ltalians to know

158
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,108
how limited their forces were.

159
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,320
(Strong) All we could say
to General Castellano was this:

160
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:12,285
"Well, we will tell you
two or three hours before it happens,

161
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,622
so that you can give any assistance
you can

162
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:20,001
to the British...
to the Allied operations.

163
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:25,965
Eventually, on the 3rd September,
these terms were signed.

164
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,055
(narrator) On that day,
the Allies invaded.

165
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,643
Montgomery went across the Straits
of Messina to attack the toe of ltaly,

166
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,603
but found no resistance.

167
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,730
The Germans had moved north

168
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:45,568
to counter the threat of an
Allied landing further up the coast.

169
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:52,408
The ltalians had wanted a landing
to safeguard Rome from German attack,

170
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,203
but this was impossible.

171
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,957
The furthest north the Americans
and British felt it prudent to land

172
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,417
was nowhere near Rome,
but at Salerno,

173
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:06,714
as far as the Allied air cover
operating from Sicily could stretch.

174
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,761
The operation had been mounted
at great speed

175
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,722
to take advantage
of the confusion in ltaly.

176
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,558
The forces of the American general
Mark Clark

177
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,396
were barely adequate
for the job they had to do.

178
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,653
On the way,
the troops heard a broadcast

179
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,115
- by General Eisenhower.
- (Eisenhower) The ltalian government

180
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,660
has surrendered its armed forces
unconditionally.

181
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:40,498
As Allied commander in chief,
l have granted a military armistice.

182
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,334
The armistice was signed
by my representatives

183
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,045
and the representative
of Marshal Badoglio.

184
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,840
And it becomes effective this instant.

185
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,009
(cheering)

186
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,769
(narrator) The surrender of his allies
did not take Hitler by surprise.

187
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,023
He'd already moved reinforcements
into northern ltaly.

188
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,400
Here the ltalians were quickly disarmed

189
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,988
under a plan ironically codenamed
Operation Axis.

190
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:17,785
At this point, Hitler had not decided
just where he wougd hogd the gine.

191
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,582
The Germans entered Rome to find it
a capital without a government.

192
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,711
Badoglio and his ministers had avoided
the risk of being shot for treachery

193
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,548
by leaping into their cars
and driving away.

194
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,474
South of Rome, Clark's invasion force
was nearing the beaches.

195
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,310
(man) Salerno, if you go in on a boat,

196
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:47,231
you look at the mountains that hem you
in and the passes through which you go.

197
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,650
The enemy would be
looking down your throat.

198
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,989
(narrator) The Germans
were ready and waiting.

199
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,903
Affer 48 hours, the Germans
launched a furious counterattack.

200
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,755
The situation became so precarious,

201
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,925
Clark ordered plans
for possible re-embarkation.

202
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,431
But with massive support
from air and sea,

203
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,767
the Salerno invaders
just managed to hogd on.

204
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,459
Affer a week of savage fighting,
the Germans withdrew.

205
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,888
(Strong) lt required the interVention
of all the air forces

206
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,140
to save us at Salerno.

207
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,311
Of all General Eisenhower's battles,

208
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:37,860
that is the one where l think
we were nearest to a tactical defeat.

209
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,363
l've never had any doubts in my mind

210
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,783
that it was a completely successful
operation.

211
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,118
We were ordered to go in there,

212
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,081
we were ordered to seize a bridgehead.
We did it.

213
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:56,337
We were ordered to capture the port of
Naples - we did that within three weeks.

214
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,131
(narrator) So far, so good.

215
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:03,219
At least a large part of southern ltaly
was in Allied hands.

216
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,721
(cheering)

217
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,402
Naples was desperately short of food.

218
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,489
There were bread riots.

219
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,037
Water was scarce.

220
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,052
There was a typhus epidemic.

221
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:01,444
The advance continued, but just ahead
lay the line of real German resistance.

222
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:05,740
The Allied commanders had hoped
Hitler would withdraw further north.

223
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,118
lnstead, greatly encouraged
by his near-victory at Salerno,

224
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:14,457
he had decided to fight here,
in the mountains south of Rome.

225
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,720
Like a bad lira,
Mussolini turned up again.

226
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,474
He was hoisted from his hiding place
by a German rescue party

227
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,393
and taken to Hitler.

228
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,690
The Führer was aghast
at his appearance,

229
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,859
but thought he might come in useful

230
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,946
to encourage the Fascists
in German-occupied ltaly.

231
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,507
The German forces in ltaly
were led by Kesselring,

232
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,593
one of the war's ablest
defensive commanders.

233
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,513
Kesselring had a lot going for him.

234
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:14,100
The rocky spine which runs
almost the whole length of ltaly

235
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:19,688
meant the Allies had to advance along
the coastal plains on either side.

236
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:24,235
The only way to outflank the Germans
was by amphibious landings.

237
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,156
But by now the necessary landing craff
were earmarked for Normandy.

238
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,180
As they went north
to their prepared defensive positions,

239
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:58,144
Kesselring's men destroyed
the only lines of communication.

240
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,160
ln the towns, the Germans
leff booby traps. This was Naples.

241
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:37,016
They were well-trained troops. They were
tenacious troops, they were well led.

242
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,313
And one point l like to make is
they were homogenous -

243
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,274
they were all of one nationality.

244
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:49,028
They were all equipped with the same
weapons and ammunition.

245
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:53,616
They ate the same food. They believed
pretty much in the same god.

246
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,496
l had 16 different nationalities
with me,

247
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,540
some of whom couldn't eat this
and couldn't eat that,

248
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:06,170
and some that didn't want to fight on
Fridays or some other day of the week,

249
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:10,716
and the British,
with their infantry weapons

250
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,969
and your artillery
completely different from ours.

251
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:19,475
You couldn't move them with ease from
front to front like the Germans could.

252
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:26,440
(narrator) Winter. The Allied ground
commander Alexander and his colleagues

253
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:31,403
were faced with the unpleasant realities
of their Mediterranean strategy.

254
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,116
The Eighth Army, accustomed to swiff
advances across the desert,

255
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,912
could only manage
a few hundred yards a day.

256
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:55,344
Across the mountain,
Clark's Fiffh Army was also mud-bound.

257
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:59,890
(man) They issued us galoshes
affer the rains had stopped.

258
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,810
lf anybody was in the galoshes business,

259
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,313
he could have found millions
along the roadside,

260
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,732
because you couldn't walk with them.

261
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,443
lt was impossible
to go through that mud.

262
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,741
(narrator) This was not the sunny ltaly
of the travel posters.

263
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,457
(man) The only way an infantryman
was coming out of those mountains

264
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,792
was to be carried out.

265
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,797
That's why it was actually desirable
to get wounded.

266
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,765
(narrator) Dreadful weather, difficult
terrain, determined German resistance.

267
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,562
To the men in the mud, this combination
did not match up to Churchill's vision.

268
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:51,358
(Clark) l can see him now at his map
and his persuasive way with his pointer,

269
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,779
pointing out the "soff belly"
of the Mediterranean.

270
00:26:55,864 --> 00:27:00,117
Affer we got in there, l offen thought
of what a tough old gut it was,

271
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,412
instead of the soff belly
he had led us to believe.

272
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,013
(narrator) Before the end of 1943,

273
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,183
the Allies were hammering
at Kesselring's Winter Line.

274
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:30,064
Alexander had 1 1 divisions, Kesselring
nine, with eight more in reserVe.

275
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,464
Every small mountain village
had to be fought for.

276
00:27:55,548 --> 00:28:00,260
ln December, the American 36th Division
tried to take San Pietro.

277
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:39,174
(man) lt was one of the things
that most of our fighting was in ltaly.

278
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:44,430
You got into a position, you dug in
and you just stayed.

279
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,642
l mean, we'd shoot at them
and they'd shoot at us.

280
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:54,481
And it was only when they were ready
to leave that we moved forward.

281
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,825
(narrator) Affer ten days,
the Americans took San Pietro -

282
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,994
at heavy cost.

283
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,309
ln any unit, you would have
a Graves Registration Unit,

284
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,812
and their job was to go round
picking up bodies.

285
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:38,400
And what they would do,
if someone had been hastily buried,

286
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,195
they would disinter him,
or if he was just lying there,

287
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,658
they'd pick him up and slide them
into the mattress covers,

288
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,410
pile them up into the trucks

289
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,706
and take them off
to a temporary cemetery somewhere.

290
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:57,669
l suppose some people got buried
as many as four or five times that way,

291
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:02,466
which is kind of unfortunate, really.

292
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:07,095
l always thought people
should be leff where they were.

293
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:44,091
(narrator) The ltalian people
had once been told by Mussolini:

294
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:50,472
"War puts the stamp of nobility on those
who have the courage to meet it."

295
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,581
At Tehran in November 1943,

296
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,958
Roosevelt and Stalin overruled Churchill

297
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,128
and at last fixed a definite date
for the landing in France:

298
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,380
May 1944.

299
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,300
ltaly was to become a sideshow.

300
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,345
But affer Tehran, Churchill refused
to accept the deadlock in ltaly.

301
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,766
He got on to Roosevelt
and persuaded him to lend landing craff

302
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,977
for a new amphibious landing.

303
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,105
The plan was in two stages.

304
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,443
First, Mark Clark's Fiffh Army
would attack the Germans at Cassino,

305
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,905
draw their forces southward,
drain their reserVes.

306
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:52,034
Then the amphibious troops would strike
behind their lines at Anzio,

307
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,661
just 22 miges south of Rome.

308
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,707
At Cassino, the Germans
held the high ground.

309
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,835
They could see everything
that moved in the valley below.

310
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,088
The Fiffh Army attacked
on January 20th.

311
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:10,510
lts troops had not been reinforced.
They were cold, wet, exhausted.

312
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,555
The attack failed disastrously.

313
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,725
But the second stage of the plan
went ahead two days later -

314
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,894
the assault on Anzio.

315
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:24,608
Having gone into Salerno
with not enough troops -

316
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,236
no commander ever has
what he thinks he ought to have -

317
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,491
l was determined that if l was to be
the commander going into Anzio,

318
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,536
or be the overall commander, that we
should not go in on a shoestring.

319
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:42,834
l went in with one and two-thirds
division, which was totally inadequate.

320
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,214
But that's the way
the ball bounces in war.

321
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,508
You do what you're told to do,

322
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,970
or they'll get somebody else
that will do it.

323
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,894
(narrator) The Germans
expected the landing,

324
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,938
but had no idea where it would come.

325
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,483
They did not have enough troops
to cover all possible beaches.

326
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,070
The Anzio force
was completely unopposed.

327
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,700
(man) Nothing. An odd bang
in the distance, but nothing.

328
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,829
And when dawn broke,
we'd got complete surprise.

329
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:25,711
And a few minutes later, along the road,
there came a marVellous drunken car,

330
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,254
swaying back and forth,

331
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:31,591
full of happy Germans who'd had a night
out in Rome and were staggering back,

332
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,052
and couldn't believe they were captured.

333
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,889
They said, "Kameraden"
and they kept on embracing me.

334
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,017
Finally they put them in the clink too.

335
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,145
And that was the landing -
complete surprise.

336
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:51,486
(narrator) The Anzio beachhead
was consolidated in an eerie calm.

337
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:12,340
Affer Salerno, it seemed incredible that
there was no instant German riposte.

338
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,093
Perhaps now was the time
for a lightning dash,

339
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,221
in the style of General Patton,
for the gates of Rome.

340
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,433
But the American commander at Anzio
was no Patton.

341
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,602
General Lucas was a cautious man

342
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,314
who believed the beachhead
must be secured before striking inland.

343
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,150
Alexander did not overrule him.

344
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,668
Churchill complained, "l thought we'd
flung a wildcat into the Alban Hills,

345
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,047
but instead we got a whale
floundering on the beach."

346
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:59,304
There were only two battalions

347
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:05,977
and some very old-fashioned
coast batteries

348
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,814
at the coast for defending.

349
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,942
lf the Americans

350
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:17,781
had realised the situation,

351
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:23,703
they could stay on the evening
of the landing day in Rome.

352
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:29,167
General Lucas could, but he would have
soon been met by an overwhelming force

353
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,504
which would have defeated him,
no question about it.

354
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:38,135
So we had to dig in on the biggest
perimeter we could possibly digest,

355
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,595
and wait for the onslaught which came.

356
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,894
(narrator) Caught off-balance,
as he offen was by Alexander,

357
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,771
Kesselring recovered fast.

358
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,649
Spurred on by Hitler's demands

359
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:56,027
for the immediate liquidation
of the "Anzio abscess",

360
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:00,365
he threw all he had
into the counterattack.

361
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,284
lf Anzio were eliminated,

362
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:07,539
perhaps the Allies would think again
about crossing the English Channel.

363
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,493
Allied advance units which
had spread out from the beaches

364
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,414
were overwhelmed
by the weight of the German attack.

365
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,211
(Vaughan-Thomas) There was one unit
that simply packed in -

366
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,047
folded their coats
and handed themselves over.

367
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,715
They couldn't take it any more.

368
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,801
They were young and hadn't
seen this sort of thing before.

369
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,221
And l don't blame them one little scrap.

370
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,733
(narrator) Two American Ranger
battalions were captured

371
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,487
and humiliatingly paraded
through the streets of Rome.

372
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,561
The beachhead could only be relieved

373
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,523
by breaking through
the German defensive line

374
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,276
which ran through
the monastery of Monte Cassino.

375
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,486
Perched high above the valley,

376
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:06,074
an obserVation post here could see
everything that moved for miles around.

377
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:13,415
The Allies believed, wrongly,
that the monastery had been fortified.

378
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,751
(man) lt was the general view

379
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,922
and the general belief of the troops
involved on that front

380
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,591
that the monastery at Cassino

381
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:27,137
was being used for military purposes
by the Germans.

382
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,056
That being the case,

383
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,894
and it also being part
of my military philosophy,

384
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,855
and a great many other people's,

385
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,774
that you must not put troops into battle

386
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,946
without giving them all possible
physical and material support you can

387
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,949
to give them the best chance
of getting a success.

388
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,708
On February 15th, 1944,

389
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:01,421
over 200 Allied bombers
pounded the monastery into rubble.

390
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,460
The air and ground attacks
were badly coordinated,

391
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:46,132
giving the Germans time to swarm into
the rubble - ideal cover for defence.

392
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,845
The Gustav Line was held.

393
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,025
At Anzio, Kesselring
flung ten German divisions

394
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,194
against the Allies' four and a half.

395
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:10,490
Hitler hoped Anzio would be a
turning point in Germany's fortunes.

396
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,992
He promised the unit
that broke through

397
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,288
the honour of escorting Allied prisoners
through the streets of Berlin.

398
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,060
Massed waves of German infantry
were flung in.

399
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:43,440
(Vaughan-Thomas) They came over a
moon landscape, pitted, wrecked tanks,

400
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,483
abandoned Jeeps along the road,

401
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,028
and l still to this day
don't understand the German tactics.

402
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,490
There was a moment you could see them
leaving their lines

403
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,909
like the old films of the Somme battle,

404
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,704
and falling down as our machine guns
took them.

405
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,674
(narrator) The German offensive
lasted four days.

406
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:14,262
ln the end, the Allied superiority
in heavy guns tipped the balance.

407
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,896
lt was finally beaten back.

408
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,302
The Germans had pulled back,

409
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,347
but the Allies still lacked
the strength to break out.

410
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,600
lt was stalemate.

411
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,186
(Vaughan-Thomas)
We then had to form trenches,

412
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:08,858
and Anzio then became an old-fashioned
World War l trench system.

413
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,236
And they were bombed
and they were mortared

414
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,321
and then they had to do
trench patrols

415
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:18,409
and occasionally, keen generals used
to send up people to try and find out

416
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,954
who was opposite us
and do a trench raid.

417
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,290
lt was right out of Journey's End.

418
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:30,838
(narrator) The two front lines
were only yards apart.

419
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:35,426
A couple of fellows were cleaning this
machine gun, got it all to pieces and...

420
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:41,933
An lrish fellow named Tommy McGough
was there and he looked up and said:

421
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,893
"Bloody Jesus Christ!"

422
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,272
He rushed for this gun,
trying to put the barrel back on,

423
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,524
he put it on upside down and all sorts.

424
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,194
Of course, l just looked and l said,
"Quite all right, Tommy."

425
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:59,200
l could see this fellow was... l go down
to the wire. He speaks good English.

426
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,245
He says, "Where's Fred?"
l said, "He's gone."

427
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,248
l said, "lt's quite all right,
what have you got?"

428
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,208
Danish pork and fresh lemons.

429
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,544
Of course,
l gave him a tin of bully beef.

430
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,673
We got talking to him about
the position and the war and all that.

431
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:19,512
- He come from a place near Emden?
- (man) Emden, yes.

432
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,558
And at the time,
this city had a thousand-bomber raid.

433
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,269
l said,
"Oh, you've had the bugger then?"

434
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,104
"You've had it."

435
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,608
"No, no," he said, "l come from
a little village near Emden. Me OK."

436
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:38,531
He showed me his photos of his wife. She
was a bus conductor in Emden and that.

437
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:44,454
And l said, "Why don't you pack in?
You've had it now."

438
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:48,499
He said, "No, Germany will not be beat."

439
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:53,087
"We shall go right down like that,
till we get near to the bottom,

440
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:59,677
and then we shall join forces with
Britain and America and fight Russia."

441
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,430
Affer that he just went.
l never seen him any more.

442
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,682
He must've got relieved the next night.

443
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:23,159
At meal time, the cooks would shout,
"Grub up."

444
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,579
You'd go with your mess tins
down for your grub.

445
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,540
Before you could get down
to the cookhouse,

446
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,502
Anzio Annie would send one over,
a big one,

447
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,671
one of these clouds raised, you know,

448
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:40,677
and you automatically, as soon
as that burst, you'd drop to the floor.

449
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,097
You were always used to it.
You walked crouched.

450
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:48,434
They called it, when you were walking
about, you'd got "the Anzio crouch".

451
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,241
And as you lay there,

452
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:07,412
you used to tune in - on the radios
that you shouldn't have had -

453
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,373
and... to the voice of Sally.

454
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,751
Sally lived in Rome
and she was a great...

455
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:18,005
Well, she sounded
the most wonderful, sexy female ever.

456
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,174
And she gave messages to the troops.

457
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,677
(deep) "Hello, hello..."

458
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:27,515
Women always think that the lower
they speak, the more sexy they sound.

459
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,393
And she had the lowest register
of any woman.

460
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:36,441
She said, "Hello, this is Sally.
Why don't you come over and see me?"

461
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:41,696
"Private Fox - you remember him last
night? He stepped on a shoe mine."

462
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,448
"Nasty things, shoe mines."

463
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,993
"You could hear Private Fox yelling
for most of the night."

464
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,913
"Don't be like Private Fox,
come over to see Sally."

465
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,502
There would be a smart crack overhead,

466
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,088
and down would flutter
propaganda pamphlets,

467
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,341
saying, "The Yanks
are lease-lending your women."

468
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,678
"They're having a lovely time
in jolly old England."

469
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,473
A picture of a naked woman
embracing an American,

470
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:14,729
or an American tactfully knotting
his tie while she did up her panties.

471
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,903
(narrator) At Cassino,
the Allies maintained the pressure,

472
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,490
their aim to tie up as many
German troops there as possible.

473
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,742
A third attempt to take the monastery

474
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,995
opened with a massive bombing attack
on Cassino town.

475
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,958
500 planes went in under the sporting
codeword "Bradman Batting Tomorrow".

476
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:41,339
Among the places knocked for six was the
headquarters of the British Eighth Army.

477
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:12,995
Once again, there was poor coordination
between air and ground forces.

478
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,551
Affer the bombing,
the Germans came out of the ground

479
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:32,056
and were in position again before the
New Zealanders launched their attack.

480
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,692
The German defenders
were elite paratroops.

481
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:06,007
The battle raged from house to house,
room to room, cellar to cellar.

482
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,527
The New Zealanders lost 4,000 men.

483
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,286
The Germans still held out.

484
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:42,209
Three assaults on Monte Cassino,
three bloody failures.

485
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:47,006
Allied commanders realised they must
crush the defence by weight of numbers.

486
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,468
They massively reinforced
the Fiffh Army.

487
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,432
They used, too,
an elaborate deception plan

488
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,059
to make the Germans think

489
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:02,021
they were preparing another
amphibious landing north of Rome.

490
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:06,400
The Germans weakened their
mountain defences to prepare for it.

491
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:12,740
ln May, the Allies at last outnumbered
the Germans at Cassino by three to one.

492
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,786
Affer an artillery barrage
by 2,000 guns, the monastery fell.

493
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,751
Polish troops
were the first to reach the ruins,

494
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,253
where they raised their national flag.

495
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:37,181
The eyes of the captured Germans
told the story of their ordeal.

496
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,320
The Germans were now
in headlong retreat.

497
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,823
Kesselring declared Rome an open city

498
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,826
and attempted to regroup
north of the capital.

499
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:02,206
On the 25th of May, the Cassino front
linked up with the Anzio beachhead.

500
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,877
Alexander's plan was for Clark
to cut off the Germans' retreat.

501
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:10,715
lnstead, Clark threw everything
into a drive for Rome.

502
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,471
He was determined to get there
before anyone else, and he did.

503
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,766
On the evening of June 4, 1944,

504
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,477
the first Allied troops
entered the city.

505
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:38,451
Those Romans who had backed
the wrong side now paid the price.

506
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,313
Clark's Roman triumph was short-lived.

507
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,733
Kesselring would succeed in regrouping.

508
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,486
Another ltalian winter lay ahead.

509
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,613
And in less than 48 hours

510
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:19,200
the world's attention
would turn to another theatre of war -

511
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,452
the beaches of Normandy.
