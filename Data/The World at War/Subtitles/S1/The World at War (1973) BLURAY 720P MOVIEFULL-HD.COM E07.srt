1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:16,015
l hope the United States
will keep out of this war.

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,101
l believe that it will.

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,521
And l give you assurance and reassurance

4
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:28,736
that every effort of your government
will be directed toward that end.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,825
As long as it remains
within my power to prevent,

6
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:40,706
there will be no blackout of peace
in the United States.

7
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,518
Affer World War l
there was a surge of isolationism,

8
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:47,106
a feeling we had no reason
to become involved in World War l

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,066
and we'd made a mistake

10
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,862
and there were a lot of debts owed
by European countries,

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,198
and the country went isolationist.

12
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,077
l haven't the slightest idea
of European affairs.

13
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,955
- Let Europe fight their own battles.
- War? Not for me.

14
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,916
This time America should keep out -
and l know l will.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,668
lf war breaks out in Europe,

16
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,421
this country should heed the advice
of its first president

17
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,966
and avoid all foreign entanglement.

18
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,930
(narrator) ln early 1940, Britain's
ambassador in Washington reported

19
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,807
that nine out of ten Americans

20
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,768
were determined
to keep America out of the war.

21
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,479
A few, like the American Nazi Party,

22
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,149
even wanted America
to aid Britain's enemies.

23
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,443
(speaking German)

24
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,238
(man shouts)

25
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,836
(man) The country
was enormously divided.

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,257
There was the America First movement,
which was advocating isolationism;

27
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,593
on the other hand there was

28
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:02,347
the Committee to Defend America
by Aiding the Allies.

29
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,057
We had these curious voices

30
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,686
such as Charles Lindbergh's,
the voices of isolationism.

31
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,442
ln the past, we have dealt with a Europe
dominated by England and France.

32
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:18,614
ln the future, we may have to deal
with a Europe dominated by Germany.

33
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,576
(Ball) Charles Lindbergh,
thanks to his extraordinary exploit,

34
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,163
was a very popular figure -
he was almost a folk hero.

35
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,207
So he would have influence.

36
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,252
l suppose that celebrities
of all characters have influence,

37
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,756
otherwise they wouldn't be
endorsing products all the time.

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,093
(Lindhergn) ..but it should not involve
the internal affairs of Europe.

39
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:46,475
They never were, and never will be,
carried on according to our desires.

40
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,937
(applause)

41
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,648
There was a strong
anti-British antipathy

42
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,691
in certain parts of the country.

43
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,693
lt was felt that Britain

44
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,197
was trying very hard
to drag us into its war.

45
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,951
(marching band music)

46
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:12,251
(narrator) 1940 was presidential
election year in the United States

47
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,546
and Roosevelt's main concern that summer
was to get himself re-elected.

48
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,469
Ladies and gentlemen,

49
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:29,559
the 22nd convention of the
Republican Party will now come to order.

50
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:35,524
Even as we meet,
lights are going out in Europe.

51
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,401
Blackouts of dictators

52
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,905
take the place
of lighthouses of free men.

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:49,371
Ours is the grave responsibility
to preserVe the lighthouses of liberty.

54
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,665
ln the name...

55
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,042
of the people...

56
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,462
of the whole United States...

57
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,091
l place in nomination...

58
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,720
that valiant American...

59
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,765
Franklin Delano Roosevelt!

60
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,977
(narrator) Affer France's fall,

61
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,188
most Americans were disposed
to aid Britain in some way,

62
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,609
but still more were strongly opposed
to entering the war on Britain's side.

63
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,237
(Willkie) ..third-term candidate

64
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,490
has not kept faith
with the American people.

65
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,119
(narrator) Roosevelt's opponent
in the election that autumn

66
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:33,582
was an out-and-out anti-war candidate,
Wendell Willkie.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,546
(Willkie) lf his promise
to keep our boys out of foreign wars

68
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,842
is no better than his promise
to balance the budget,

69
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,263
they're already
almost on the transports.

70
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,436
(narrator) But with the Nazis
triumphant everywhere,

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,439
Roosevelt couldn't afford
to wait to be re-elected

72
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,068
before putting America
on some sort of war footing.

73
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,572
(Roosevelt) The Congress
has debated without partisanship

74
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,200
and has now enacted a law

75
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:13,997
establishing a selective method
of augmenting our armed forces.

76
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:20,295
We must, and we will,
marshal our great potential strength

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,508
to fend off war from our shores.

78
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,055
(man) More than 16 million
young Americans

79
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:35,894
are reviving the 300-year-old
American custom of the muster,

80
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,481
by which,
from the earliest colonial times,

81
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,192
every able-bodied citizen

82
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,613
was subject to the call for service
in the national defence.

83
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:04,089
The first number
drawn by the secretary of war

84
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:09,553
is serial number 158.

85
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,972
(cheering)

86
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,975
l am honoured
to be one of those first called

87
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,770
and l'll try very hard
to make a real good soldier.

88
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,897
And l'm proud of you.

89
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,568
(Willkie) If you eIect me
president of the United States,

90
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:31,867
l shall never send an American boy
to fight in any European war.

91
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:40,375
l consider it a public duty
to answer falsifications with facts.

92
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,756
l will not pretend
that l find this an unpleasant duty.

93
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,384
(laughter)

94
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:57,392
l am an old campaigner
and l love a good fight.

95
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,895
(cheering)

96
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,939
(narrator)
Roosevelt got his good fight,

97
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,568
though to stay in the race
he had promised, like his opponent,

98
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,198
not to send American boys
to fight in foreign wars.

99
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,743
- Name, please?
- Franklin D Roosevelt.

100
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,039
(narrator) November 5, 1940,
was election day,

101
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,166
and by midnight America's choice

102
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,877
of president for another four years
was clear.

103
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,006
(man) The results are now conclusive -
Roosevelt wins.

104
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,342
(cheering)

105
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,817
(narrator) Now Roosevelt
felt he had a mandate

106
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,987
to give Britain all aid short of war.

107
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,199
But he could only move slowly,
for America was still deeply divided.

108
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:59,037
(Corwin) Many of the war measures,
such as steps to give aid to Britain

109
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:03,500
at the time when England
was standing alone and was beleaguered,

110
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,127
just squeaked by in Congress.

111
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:12,300
Even a programme of armament,
of military preparedness,

112
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,221
got through Congress
on very, very close votes,

113
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:21,560
one-vote margins
in a total of 400 votes.

114
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,021
(Harriman) Then the extraordinary
legislation, Lend-Lease,

115
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:31,236
was proposed in December of 1940
and became law in March of '41 ,

116
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,862
and under that the president

117
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,199
did everything he possibly could
to give aid to Britain.

118
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:40,954
My instructions
when l went over to represent him

119
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,374
were very simple, very brief.

120
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,836
They were to contact
the British government

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,217
to find out what we could do
to help Britain - short of war.

122
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,803
And we began at once
doing all sorts of things

123
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:01,308
which were not really neutral
under the literal interpretation -

124
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,854
for instance, we were preparing
British naval vessels in American ports

125
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,984
and we escorted convoys
across the Atlantic as far as lceland,

126
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,529
and we transferred
two million tons of ships.

127
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,368
The immediate problem was to get people
to understand what it was.

128
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,165
ln this, l think Mr Roosevelt's
very simple analogy

129
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,544
of lending your neighbour a fire hose
when there's a fire

130
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,174
was a most persuasive
simple illustration.

131
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:38,011
(Roosevelt) The people of Europe
who are defending themselves

132
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,973
do not ask us to do their fighting.

133
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,518
They ask us for the implements of war -

134
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,856
the planes, the tanks,
the guns, the freighters -

135
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,945
which will enable them to fight
for their liberty and our security.

136
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,784
We must be
the great arsenal of democracy.

137
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:07,123
For us, this is an emergency
as serious as war itself.

138
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:13,505
ln those days, the business community
regarded Roosevelt

139
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:19,761
as, at a minimum,
a major deputy of the devil,

140
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:24,265
and Roosevelt was deeply suspicious
of the businessmen,

141
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,730
so that the people who were associated
with the mobilising of the war

142
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,191
had a divided interest.

143
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,945
Some of them felt that their
main purpose in being in Washington

144
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,741
was to put a curb on the
socialist excesses of the New Deal.

145
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,202
Some of them
were uneasy about being there -

146
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:51,209
they had the feeling of people who were
playing in an orchestra in a brothel.

147
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:58,258
And there was
also a great unwillingness...

148
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:02,387
We hear now
about the military-industrial complex -

149
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,640
in those days
there was a great unwillingness

150
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,226
to convert from civilian industry.

151
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,606
There was a feeling that war production
would be a very unprofitable business,

152
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,695
it would lose markets for automobiles,
for tyres, for chemicals, and so forth.

153
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,909
(Galbraith) There was a problem
with some of the unions

154
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,204
up until June of 1941 .

155
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,832
Until Russia was in the war,

156
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,127
and in the days of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact,

157
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,089
there was foot-dragging on the part
of some of the union leaders.

158
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,258
And there were strikes.

159
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,385
(narrator) Four times as many workers

160
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,929
were on strike in 1941
as in the year before.

161
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:49,934
That spring, nearly half a million
coal miners struck for almost a month,

162
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,855
while on the west coast a walk-out
that summer at North American AViation

163
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,318
delayed deliveries of planes to Britain
for several weeks.

164
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:02,405
lt took troops
to get production moving again.

165
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,545
But although Roosevelt was still
reluctant to lead America into war,

166
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,757
the war was now
catching up with America.

167
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:28,056
June 11th, 1941 : an American freighter,
the Robin Moor, was sunk by a U-boat.

168
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,351
Roosevelt used this as a pretext
for occupying lceland

169
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,562
and relieving
the British garrisons there.

170
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:40,151
September 4th: a US destroyer, Greer,
was attacked by a U-boat near lceland.

171
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:44,280
Roosevelt now told his navy
to shoot on sight.

172
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:49,452
October 16th: the US destroyer Kearney
was struck by a German torpedo

173
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,915
while escorting a convoy in mid-Atlantic
and 1 1 of her crew were killed.

174
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,542
Roosevelt used this incident

175
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,878
to push through Congress
the repeal of the Neutrality Act.

176
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,132
We have wished to avoid shooting.

177
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,178
But the shooting has started.

178
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:14,894
And history has recorded
who fired the first shot.

179
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,856
ln the long run, however,

180
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:24,445
all that will matter
is who fired the last shot.

181
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,197
(applause)

182
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:33,496
The repeal of our Neutrality Act will be
the last step on the road to war.

183
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:38,126
lf we load our ships
with contraband of war

184
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,588
and send them into combat zones,

185
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,674
they will most certainly be sunk.

186
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:50,638
And that means war - a war
which in the opinion of many of us,

187
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,434
although designed
to save democracy abroad,

188
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:59,898
will surely destroy it at home
right here in America.

189
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:05,111
(narrator) On October 30
the US destroyer Reuben James was sunk

190
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,405
with the loss of 1 15 lives.

191
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,034
Officers and all hands forward perished.

192
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:15,038
Myself and 45 men
are all that are alive.

193
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,707
(narrator)
Despite pressure from Churchill,

194
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,294
who dearly wanted America in the war,
Roosevelt now did nothing.

195
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:25,673
lt was clear it would take much more
than the drowning of 100 or so US seamen

196
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,592
to bring America into the war.

197
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,804
There was even a sentiment -
l remember this being expressed -

198
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,517
to the effect that England
would fight to the last American.

199
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:41,397
There were steps that were developing -
gradual steps, to be sure -

200
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,693
somewhat comparable to the steps
that took place in World War l.

201
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,989
One incident affer another - the
torpedoing of the Sussex got us excited,

202
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,617
then there was the Lusitanla episode...

203
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:57,330
ln the same way, l think that with the
moves that Mr Roosevelt was making,

204
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,334
the cash-and-carry programme
that he had,

205
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:06,255
the protection of the convoys,
the destroyer deal...

206
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,927
One thing and another was occurring
that would be apt to produce, l think,

207
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,888
an incident that would set the war off.

208
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,474
(narrator) That incident was massive

209
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,894
and it came in an unexpected place:
Pearl Harbour.

210
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,105
(redid) All army and navy bases

211
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,109
on the island of Oahu in Hawaii
are now under air attack.

212
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,821
For the latest news,
keep tuned to this station.

213
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,699
(Galbraith)
My superior, who was in charge

214
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,910
of all civilian operations
of the war, was away,

215
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,790
so l was then sent on to the
great meeting of the wartime leaders

216
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,919
that convened in Washington
on the night of Pearl Harbour.

217
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:50,425
l remember my sense of mission
in going to that meeting.

218
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,844
We had all seen the war coming.

219
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,013
Here was the day and here was the hour,

220
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,642
and here was l, attending the meeting
with the other great men.

221
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:04,856
We got to the meeting and the
other "great men" - myself included -

222
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,858
were one hell of a disappointment,

223
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,777
because nobody could think
of anything to say or do.

224
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,446
lt seemed a good idea to see

225
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,700
what materials were threatened
by the Japanese advance.

226
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,828
Everybody was coming in
during the course of this,

227
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:23,458
some in sport jackets,
some in tennis shoes,

228
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:29,422
and it became terribly evident
that nobody had any real information

229
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,967
as to where
these strategic commodities came from.

230
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,680
And eventually the whole discussion
bogged down, l remember,

231
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,932
on the question of kapok.

232
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:46,689
Kapok, everybody thought... lt was
clearly listed as a strategic material,

233
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,692
it evidently came
from that part of the world,

234
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,863
and nobody could think, for God's sake,
what the stuff was used for.

235
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,616
(sirens)

236
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,585
l ask that the Congress declare

237
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:15,635
that since the unprovoked
and dastardly attack by Japan

238
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:21,766
on Sunday December 7, 1941 ,

239
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,396
a state of war has existed

240
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:32,527
between the United States
and the Japanese empire.

241
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,363
(applause)

242
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:41,077
(narrator) Even now Roosevelt didn't
ask that the US declare war on Germany -

243
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,414
although Britain had already allied
herself with the US against Japan.

244
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,501
But Hitler decided for him.

245
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:54,423
For some unexplained reason, Hitler
declared war on the United States,

246
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,844
which relieved Roosevelt
of all of his difficulties.

247
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:02,515
l was practising law in Chicago -
that is, at the time of Pearl Harbour -

248
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,561
and l can tell you that if Hitler
had not made this decision,

249
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,564
if he had simply done nothing,

250
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,317
that there would have been
enormous sentiment

251
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:19,198
in many parts of the United States
that the Pacific war now was our war,

252
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,743
that the European war
was for the Europeans

253
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,414
and we should concentrate
all our efforts against the Japanese.

00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,739
they were certain the west coast would
be under attack, that we'd be bombed.

261
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,575
There were even blackouts
along the west coast,

274

We must remember
that our parents or our grandparents

275
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,813
or our great-grandparents

276
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,900
all were aliens in their day.

277
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:06,532
lf you believe you have knowledge
of any improper activity of any alien

278
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:11,203
you should report the fact
to the nearest FBl office.

279
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,915
Don't try to be the law yourself.

280
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,129
There was a tremendous change -

281
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,965
the change being
that we were the same individuals

282
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,884
as prior to December 7;

283
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:29,597
on December 8, when we went to school,
many of our classmates and friends

284
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,893
called us "dirty Japs",
teased us, harassed us,

285
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,480
and our so-called friends
were no longer friends.

286
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,484
ln the First World War, as you know,
the Germans were hated thoroughly

287
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,028
and there was a great deal
of discrimination

288
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,863
and harassment of the Germans.

289
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:50,034
ln the Second World War, we were at war
with three different nationalities,

290
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,578
the ltalians, the Germans
and the Japanese.

291
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,081
And l remember that Thomas Mann

292
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,376
and Bruno Walter
spoke up for the Germans

293
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,713
and said they couldn't be removed
because that would be the last despair,

294
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,009
having fled Nazi Germany, to be
again put into a concentration camp.

295
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,137
And Joe DiMaggio's mother spoke up,

296
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,891
and that was very moving,
in San Francisco.

297
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,519
But the Japanese had really nobody.

298
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,110
l think picking on the Japanese

299
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:30,032
was partly a logistically rational thing
that the army could handle -

300
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:36,497
they said, we can't handle the Germans,
but we can handle the Japanese.

301
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,459
Affer all, they couldn't have moved
all the Germans and ltalians -

302
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,128
they would have had to move

303
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,090
half the people out of New York.
lt would've been ridiculous.

304
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,929
(Ball) These people
had always been unpopular

305
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:57,351
because they competed with the American
farmers in truck gardening and so on,

306
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,978
and worked very much harder

307
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,148
and cultivated their land
very much more efficiently.

308
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,985
So a lot of people
took advantage of their situation

309
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,571
to create antipathy toward them.

310
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,532
And the government
acted hastily and rather brutally

311
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,659
- it's not a very attractive chapter.

312
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:17,955
(narrator) More than 100,000 Japanese
Americans were interned en masse,

313
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,207
mostly those on the west coast,

314
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:25,629
whereas the 600,000 German and ltalian
Americans were treated individually.

315
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,841
(Uno) Although we had heard rumours
of an evacuation,

316
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,637
we didn't realise
that it was going to indeed take place.

317
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:38,684
We were told that we could
only take what we could carry.

318
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:44,231
Evacuees had three choices:
they either had to sell their property,

319
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,567
abandon it or store it.

320
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,321
And in many cases, because
of the uncertainty of the situation,

321
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,492
many people just disposed of their
property as best they could.

322
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:59,413
We were then put on buses
and taken to assembly centres.

323
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,251
From the assembly centres

324
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,672
we lived in horse stalls
or in quickly made tarpaper barracks.

325
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,592
The mental anguish
that my mother went through,

326
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,804
having four of her sons in the serVice
of the United States government

327
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:20,351
and having her husband
labelled a dangerous enemy alien...

328
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,281
We had guards, watch towers,
machine guns...

329
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,910
lt was a picture of incarceration.

330
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,539
We felt that we were prisoners -
prisoners in our own country.

331
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,374
lt was certain
there'd be no more rubber for a while

332
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,003
and we'd have to make do with the stock
of rubber tyres that we had.

333
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:33,215
And it wasn't in the authority of our
agency to stop the sale of rubber tyres,

334
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,217
so we drew up an order anyway

335
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,554
and we had an anonymous young man
circulate it

336
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:45,352
in the Office of Production Management
that had to clear all pieces of paper.

337
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:50,149
Walked in, with "Here's the tyre order,
sir." Everybody signed it.

338
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:59,617
And we froze the whole nation's
stock of rubber tyres.

339
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,692
Everybody got work.

340
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,656
This was very much appreciated affer
the long, deep depression of the 1930s.

341
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,950
You might've thought inflation
would be the major problem,

342
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,621
because in most countries, in most wars,
it's been a major problem.

343
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,415
But very early we mobilised,

344
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,337
we put in a rationing, and, although
there was a small amount of grumbling,

345
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,632
it's amazing how well
the rationing system worked.

346
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:01,512
(Galbraith) There was a tendency
to accept shortages with one exception.

347
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,766
People were very resistant
to gasoline rationing.

348
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,979
Clothing shortages, food shortages,
coffee, sugar, people would accept.

349
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:17,903
But there was no form of
rascality, chicanery, thievery, larceny

350
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,990
that people wouldn't engage in
to get extra gasoline.

351
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,452
l think the thing they most resented

352
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,790
was the extreme youth
of many of us who were doing it.

353
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,334
The Office of Price Administration,

354
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,754
as l look back on it,
must've been very hard to take.

355
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,590
l was then 31 .

356
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:43,846
David Ginsberg, my immediate associate,
general counsel, was 29,

357
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,225
and most everybody else
was younger than we were -

358
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,810
including Richard Nixon,

359
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,105
who was one of the more
obscure employees of the agency.

360
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,984
There's a famous wartime picture
of Sewell AVery,

361
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,361
a great tycoon of the last age,

362
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,198
who was head of Montgomery Ward
and brought it out of the Depression,

363
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:07,161
being carried out of his office
by two American soldiers in uniform

364
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,665
because he wouldn't comply
with the War Labor Board.

365
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,044
Our war programme
for the coming fiscal year

366
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:21,467
will cost 56 billion dollars.

367
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:26,513
That means taxes and bonds...

368
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,475
and bonds and taxes.

369
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,270
- Ohh...
- We have a squeal with each orchid.

370
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,902
Want to get your orchid?
Come this way, please.

371
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,363
2250. This is really
a handsome thing to have.

372
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,992
You're getting this
as a premium for a war bond for $2250,

373
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,536
so it's really a good purchase
for anybody.

374
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,914
Let's have a look at that.

375
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:56,043
Hope is looking at the shoe.
He may increase his bid to $2255.

376
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,086
(laughter)

377
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,173
You're going to come up a little,
aren't you, flabby?

378
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,925
(laughter)

379
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,011
l shouldn't, but l'll go 25.

380
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:12,726
Our enemies aren't pushovers.
They're savage, skilful and relentless.

381
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,563
They've trained for years for
just this chance to ensgave the worgd,

382
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,068
and that's just what they intend to do.
And they'll use every trick and tool.

383
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,614
But on the other hand,
they aren't supermen.

384
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,867
They didn't come down from Mars.

385
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,412
They can be licked
and they will be licked.

386
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,164
By men.

(narrator)
On the night of Pearl Harbour,

435
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,399
one man had been happy -
Winston Churchill.

436
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,694
For now he knew Britain was saved.

437
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,238
A few days later
he journeyed to Washington

438
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,782
to make sure the war
was going to be fought

439
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,953
on the British plan of Europe first
and the Pacific second,

440
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,581
and to cement
the new Anglo-American alliance.

441
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,419
What kind of a people
do they think we are?

442
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,463
ls it possible they do not realise

443
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:33,135
that we shall never cease
to persevere against them

444
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,887
until they have been taught a lesson

445
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,224
which they and the world
will never forget.

446
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:52,195
(narrator) Time, Churchill knew,
was on the Allies' side.

447
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,035
With America's industrial might
behind them, they could not lose.

448
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,454
(shouts order)

449
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,798
1942 began badly
for the Americans in the Pacific.

450
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:17,846
Manila, capital of the Philippines,
fell to the Japanese on January 1 .

451
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,060
The Japanese
pushed the American forces

452
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,979
back into the narrow peninsular
of Bataan.

453
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,280
The American plan was to hold out there

454
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,909
for six months or so,
until reinforcements came.

455
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,787
But the reinforcements never did come,

456
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:46,625
and nor had Bataan
been really prepared for a siege.

457
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,860
The American troops besieged at Bataan
had no air support,

458
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,240
were short of medical supplies
and their morale was poor.

459
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,660
Even their commander-in-chief,
General MacArthur,

460
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,579
had leff them for safer shores.

461
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:30,669
Their bitter ballad:
"We are the battling bastards of Bataan

462
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,713
No mama, no papa, no Uncle Sam

463
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,092
No aunts, no uncles,
no cousins, no nieces,

464
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,220
No pills, no planes or artillery pieces

465
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,348
And nobody gives a goddamn."

466
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,353
Cock-a-hoop with the ease
of their victory so far,

467
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:54,901
the Japanese called on the Americans
beleaguered in Bataan to surrender.

468
00:35:54,986 --> 00:36:01,533
The voice of the Philippines calling
the attention of everyone everywhere.

469
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:09,708
Everyone everywhere, Filipinos
and Americans all over the country...

470
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,963
(narrator) They tried leaflets too...

471
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:23,763
aimed mostly at the Filipino soldiers
among the American forces.

472
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,935
The Japanese closed in for the kill.

473
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,434
ln early May, 1942,

474
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:13,396
the American commander in the
Philippines, General Wainwright,

475
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:18,109
bowed to the inevitable and surrendered
the remainder of his forces.

476
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:23,198
(mterpreter) l've decided to accept,
in the name of humanity,

477
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:31,164
the formal surrender of all American
and Philippine army troops

478
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,375
in the Philippine lslands.

479
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:41,466
You will - repeat, will - surrender all
troops to the proper Japanese officer.

480
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,679
(narrator)
80,000 Americans surrendered,

481
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:51,184
the largest mass capitulation
in American military history.

482
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,312
The Japanese made the Americans
march in the blazing sun

483
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,191
to prison camps
100 or so miles from Bataan.

484
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:03,446
Deprived of water and medicine,
starVed and brutally beaten,

485
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,117
some 10,000 soldiers
died along the way -

486
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:11,246
more than had been killed
in the actual fighting for Bataan.

487
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,969
By that spring of 1942, the Japanese
conquests were at their peak.

488
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,348
Surely the British and Americans would
now want to make peace, argued Tokyo -

489
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:34,686
a peace that would allow the Japanese
to retain their conquests.

490
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,566
But already bold steps were being taken
to strike back at the Japanese

491
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,486
here in the heart of their empire,
Tokyo.

492
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,073
l was on this cruiser
called the Northampton

493
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:52,454
and we were several days out at sea
when we saw the Hornet coming up.

494
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,957
And the Hornet
had very unusual planes on deck -

495
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,168
you could see them from a long way.

496
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:02,589
They were large
land-based planes - B-25s.

497
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:11,681
(man) We had only one real worry -
that would have been a dead calm.

498
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,308
Under those conditions,

499
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,978
taking off the carrier deck
with the heavy loads that we had

500
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,356
would have been at best precarious.

501
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,941
The worst thing we thought might happen

502
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,445
would be a completely alerted Japan
waiting for us.

503
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:31,076
What did happen was that
the morning just before take-off

504
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,079
we encountered
two Japanese fishing boats.

505
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:39,501
They spotted our task force,
sent a message to the mainland,

506
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,879
but, unfortunately for the Japanese,

507
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:47,092
were sunk
before they could repeat the message.

508
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,391
So we achieved almost complete surprise.

509
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:21,376
The actual amount of damage done
was minimal.

510
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,256
We were 16 aeroplanes,
each with one ton of bombs.

511
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,594
ln the later stages of World War ll,
the 20th Air Force under LeMay

512
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,266
was sending out 500 aeroplanes,
each with 10 tons of bombs.

513
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,728
So we dropped 16
against a later raid of 5,000,

514
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,982
so the damage was not at all great.

515
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,860
However, it did have some advantages.

516
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,947
One, we had had
nothing but bad news at home,

517
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,575
so it was the first good news
our folks got

518
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,162
and it was appreciated as good news.

519
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,707
lt caused the Japanese
to question their warlords,

520
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,627
who had informed them
that Japan would never be attacked.

521
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:12,594
(narrator) The Doolittle raid stung
Japan's leaders and made them careless.

522
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,387
Ever since Pearl Harbour,

523
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,391
Japan's navy had sought a decisive
battle with America's navy,

524
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:24,272
a battle that would decide
once and for all mastery of the Pacific.

525
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,866
ln early June, 1942,
the Japanese carriers

526
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,161
rendezvous'd close to Midway lsland,

527
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,956
some 1300 miles northwest of Hawaii.

528
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,015
(speaking Japanese)

529
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,936
(translator)
We had ceased to be as wary as before.

530
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,898
The Americans knew in advance
that we would attack Midway.

531
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:10,151
They were waiting for us
and we walked into their trap.

532
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,748
(narrator)
But while the Japanese navy's

533
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,167
attention was focused on Midway lsland,

534
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,210
the American navy were preparing

535
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,713
to strike back
at the Japanese carrier fleet.

536
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,175
(man) We had a wonderful advantage -
we were breaking their code

537
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,718
and they didn't know it.

538
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,804
So we had some idea
what was going to happen there.

539
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,765
We were on the scene

540
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:09,103
with the carrier force in the right spot
to meet them.

541
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,755
(narrator) Midway, one of the greatest
sea battles of all time,

542
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,676
meant the US regained
naval control of the Pacific

543
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,806
and was the end of Japan's hope
of any further conquests.

544
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,851
The four Japanese carriers

545
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,396
that had launched the raid
on Pearl Harbour six months before

546
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,150
were destroyed by planes
from the very American carriers

547
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:42,029
that had been at sea
and escaped destruction that day.

548
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:50,455
The Battle of Midway doomed Japan.

549
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:56,085
The Midway battle was, many people say,
the turning point of the Pacific war -

550
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:01,466
that is, the turning point
from complete retreat on our part,

551
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:06,804
or at least an attempt
to establish a stalemate, and offensive.

552
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:12,602
(narrator) Turning point
not just at sea, but on land too.

553
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,690
The island of Guadalcanal
in the Solomons,

554
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:22,403
the southernmost limit
of the Japanese conquests.

555
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,036
ln August 1942, the Allies returned.

556
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,956
For the Americans,
it was their first invasion of the war.

557
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:38,920
(man) We had such a tiny fraction
of America's force and money -

558
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,464
resources and manpower resources.

559
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,217
90% went to Europe.

560
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,846
We had such a tiny little thread
of existence down there.

561
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,432
lt was our first offensive
in the Pacific

562
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:55,269
and we went in with only one division.

563
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:19,460
The Japanese were tough fighters
and they never would give up.

564
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,463
We had isolated a Japanese regiment

565
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,925
in what was known as
the Gifu strongpoint,

566
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,262
and they fought until
we actually had to annihilate them.

567
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,140
We used loudspeakers
affer we had surrounded them

568
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,727
and tried to persuade them to surrender,
but they wouldn't.

569
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:43,776
Japanese shouldn't have made
such a great effort in Guadalcanal.

570
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,612
They could have saved their strength.

571
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,116
(flies buzzing)

572
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:31,616
(narrator) At long last the tide had
turned for the Allies in the Pacific.

573
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,869
But it was still as yet only a sideshow.

574
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,539
The main energies
were being reserVed for Europe.

575
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,458
lt was really a little odd

576
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:44,253
to the Americans in the general public
at that time

577
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,299
that we were spending
so little effort in the Pacific.

578
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,470
President Roosevelt made up his mind
that the defeat of Hitler

579
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:57,683
was by far the most important
to achieve first -

580
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,686
he was the most dangerous
of the enemies.

581
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,438
And he was very skilful

582
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:07,276
in keeping American public opinion
directed towards Europe,

583
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,862
although we did have
a very major operation

584
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,406
in Japan
and a very successful operation,

585
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,034
affer we recovered
from the tremendous blow

586
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,454
of the loss of a substantial
part of our navy at Pearl Harbour.

587
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:25,711
l think that generally public opinion
had the feeling, as we say in baseball,

588
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,506
the big league was in Europe

589
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:33,344
and in the United Kingdom -
l include that in Western Europe.

590
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,263
The decision was made early

591
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:41,560
that Europe came first -
and it was a wise decision -

592
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,062
in spite of the fact

593
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:47,984
we got the devil knocked out of us
in the Pacific for a long time.

594
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:52,863
That was the right decision
and l think everybody recognised it.

595
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,158
Now, of course, the navy protested

596
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,621
at being leff
way underpowered in the Pacific.

597
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:07,878
And it did put us up to
very heavy casualties and all of that.

598
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:13,467
But l think the country in general
agreed with the decision

599
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:17,263
that the real threat was in Europe.

600
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,349
We could take care of the Japs
in our own good time,

601
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:26,480
but the real thing that had to be met
was on the Continent.
