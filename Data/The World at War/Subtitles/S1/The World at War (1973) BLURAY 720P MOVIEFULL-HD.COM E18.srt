00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:22,021
(narrator) Anne Frank,
in her diary, June 6 1944:

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:26,150
"Would the long-awaited liberation,
which still seems too wonderful,

3
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,653
too much like a fairy tale,
ever come true?"

4
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,574
"Could we be granted victory
this year, 1944?"

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,828
"We don't know yet,
but hope is revived within us."

6
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:43,917
"Now more than ever we must
clench our teeth and not cry out."

7
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:50,382
The people of Holland had lived under
Nazi occupation for four long years.

8
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,319
(narrator) On May 10, 1940,
without a declaration of war,

9
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,031
Germany struck against neutral Holland.

10
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,701
Paratroopers and panzers
overpowered the Dutch peacetime army,

11
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,829
with its obsolete weapons.

12
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,465
Using Holland's excellent roads,

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,552
Hitler's columns raced
across the flat countryside

14
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,346
before the Allies
could come to the rescue.

15
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:26,019
At lunch time on May 14, 50 Heinkels
attacked the port of Rotterdam.

16
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:31,358
ln 15 minutes they started fires
which destroyed the city centre

17
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,736
and struck terror into the population.

18
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,743
Rotterdam capitulated,
and only a few hours later

19
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,914
Holland decided to surrender to save
other cities from a similar fate.

20
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,005
That night, as Rotterdam blazed,
the Dutch people were leaderless.

21
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,052
The queen, with her cabinet,
had escaped to Britain

22
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,305
to carry on the government in exile.

23
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,517
Faced with the prospect of Nazi rule,
more than 300 Dutchmen, mainly Jews,

24
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,477
preferred to commit suicide.

25
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,064
People were stunned,
bewildered, fearful.

26
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,692
(speaks Dutch)

27
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:19,364
(translator) Holland hadn't been
involved in a war since Napoleon.

28
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,910
We were completely stunned,

29
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,204
and psychologically broken.

30
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,667
We had read what Hitler said, and...

31
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:44,306
As to the Jews, l had a firm belief
in what he prophesied.

32
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,393
l actually believed that, yes.

33
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,316
He would do away with us.
Yes, l believed that.

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,112
We were not so very alarmed. We didn't
believe all the things they said, no.

35
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,825
My brother - Eddy, the oldest one -

36
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,287
came to our house

37
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,081
in the days the war started,

38
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:13,961
and he said, "Come with me.
Let's try to escape."

39
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,465
And l remember that
my mother said, "Escape? Why?"

40
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,343
"l must wait for the man
who brings the laundry."

41
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,428
"What do you want me to escape from?"

42
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,891
Maybe they were the enemy to us,
but, really, true,

43
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,228
they didn't see us an enemy
at that moment at least,

44
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:36,817
you see, because we were
just hotel employees,

45
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,946
and so long as we didn't bother them,

46
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,490
they accept everything, you see.

47
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,743
Like, the doorman
opened the door for anybody,

48
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,372
like he'd do today,
like he'd done years before.

49
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,750
l mean, and the bellboys
did the things they had to do,

50
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,169
the porter did the things
that he has to do.

51
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:01,633
Anybody, from the highest to
the smallest, did his job what he did.

52
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,390
(narrator) Germany imposed
a new administration

53
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,142
headed by a Reich commissioner

54
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:14,563
personally responsible to Hitler
and empowered to rule by decree.

55
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:21,111
The new supreme ruler of Holland
was Dr Arthur Seyss-lnquart,

56
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,071
a Viennese lawyer.

57
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:28,535
He had helped organise Austria's
absorption by Germany in 1938.

58
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:32,164
ln the Hall of Knights at The Hague,
he addressed German ofticials.

59
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,500
The 12 most senior Dutch civil serVants
were also present.

60
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,629
(speaks German)

61
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,642
(narrator) He tried
to reassure the Dutch

62
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,604
by declaring that Nazi ideology
would not be imposed.

63
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,398
Germany had no imperialistic designs
on Holland.

64
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,823
Dutch laws would remain in force
until further notice.

65
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,617
Seyss-lnquart made it clear

66
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,996
that the country would still
be administered by Dutch civil serVants.

67
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,041
Anyone who wished might resign.

68
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,251
Few were to do so.

69
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,468
He called for cooperation between
two Germanic peoples of the same blood.

70
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,179
- Sieg...
- (audience) Heil!

71
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,432
(orchestra plays
"Deutschland über alles")

72
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,618
(narrator) As a conciliatory gesture,

73
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,664
Hitler ordered the release
of all Dutch prisoners of war.

74
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,711
People started to relax.

75
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,673
The Germans promised
to maintain living standards

76
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,675
and to cure unemployment.

77
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,302
The occupation
might not be so bad after all.

78
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,356
The Reich commissioner
Seyss-lnquart himself

79
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:27,154
saw oft a trainload of children
on a free holiday to his native Austria.

80
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,043
For the Dutch Nazi movement, the NSB,

81
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,631
this was a moment of jubilation as they
gathered to welcome the invaders.

82
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,177
The NSB had been holding rallies
here in Lunteren for years,

83
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,264
but now, for the first time, instead
of protesting against the regime,

84
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,391
they were its champions.

85
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,981
The NSB membership
quadrupled to 80,000,

86
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,984
although still only 1%
of the population belonged.

87
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,698
Like Hitler's Nazi Party, the NSB
was born of the economic depression,

88
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,453
fear of Bolshevism,
and the promise of a revived Europe.

89
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,711
lt stood for order, discipline
and an authoritarian state.

90
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:28,381
(crowd sings)

91
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,930
Patriotic in their fashion,

92
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,016
the Dutch Nazis
extolled ancient traditions,

93
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,063
glorified the fatherland
and promised national self-respect.

94
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,690
(song continues)

95
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,949
(crowd sings Dutch national anthem)

96
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,203
Saluting the Dutch flag

97
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,373
and singing the national anthem
were part of the ritual.

98
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,501
All references to the royal family,
the House of Orange,

99
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,462
were, however, omitted.

100
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,350
(anthem ends)

101
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,519
(crowd chants)

102
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,813
Anton Mussert, the NSB's leader,

103
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,650
was an engineer with an outstanding
record in the civil serVice.

104
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,110
He saw this as the moment

105
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,238
for the rebirth of the Netherlands
as a great power.

106
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,242
Mussert moulded himself on Mussolini.

107
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,620
Hitler was the Messiah
sent to save Europe.

108
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,958
(Mussert speaks Dutch)

109
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,259
(narrator) A German bomber
flew low over the crowd in salute.

110
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,387
lt was just six weeks

111
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,683
since the Luftwafte had spread
fire and death in Rotterdam.

112
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,611
(Mussert speaks Dutch)

113
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,875
(crowd sings)

114
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,430
(narrator)
But there was another Holland.

115
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,934
Astonishingly,
on Prince Bernhard's birthday,

116
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,771
only one week after France had fallen,
thousands of ordinary Dutchmen

117
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,273
spontaneously demonstrated
their defiance.

118
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,821
Soldiers saluted as
people sang the Orange anthem

119
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:43,743
and placed white carnations, Bernhard's
favourite flower, on national monuments.

120
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,879
Some saw no point in open opposition.

121
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,716
A new German-approved
political organisation,

122
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,634
the Netherlands Union, was formed

123
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,512
to unite patriots in loyalty
to the occupying power.

124
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,848
With most other parties gagged,

125
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,476
it seemed to be a respectable
alternative to the NSB.

126
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,730
15% of the population joined.

127
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,319
Holland was a religious country.

128
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,031
Despite Hitler's claim to be
the saviour of the Christian West,

129
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:26,953
the churches were hostile to Nazism
because it placed man above God.

130
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:31,040
ln some churches,
Dutch Nazis were denied communion.

131
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,176
Everyone had to be fingerprinted
and photographed and registered.

132
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,595
The Dutch government
had left instructions

133
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,430
for civil serVants to stay at work

134
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,892
as long as they thought it was
in the best interests of the people.

135
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:53,521
Now they were systematically issuing
identity cards to the entire population.

136
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,944
The Germans introduced
a racial questionnaire.

137
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,947
(speaks Dutch)

138
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,742
(translator) Very shortly
after the occupation,

139
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,037
two men from the German security police
came to me and asked,

140
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,831
"Are there any Jews
in your municipality?"

141
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:16,085
l told them it was true
there are no Jews in my municipality.

142
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,088
But that was my first mistake.

143
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,471
Because by answering that question
you accept racial discrimination.

144
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,182
And you had to fill in a form.

145
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,227
One passage was if you had
any Jewish grandparents.

146
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,395
l had none, so l said no.

147
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,899
Then you went home and didn't realise

148
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,610
that you'd helped in cornering the Jews

149
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,779
and making them vulnerable

150
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,614
and bringing them in a position

151
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,659
where they could later on
be transported and gassed.

152
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,828
You didn't realise.

153
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:54,958
After a year of being politicised
a little bit better,

154
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:59,379
you got more agitations on what
such a declaration really meant.

155
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,842
But the first impression is:
your age, your address,

156
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,262
grandparents of Jewish origin? No. OK.

157
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,015
You see? lt is so... lt was a process.

158
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:19,065
Step by step the process of infiltration
of this Nazism in the society was there.

159
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,446
(narrator) All Jews were dismissed
from public oftice.

160
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,117
The Germans began
to segregate Jews from other Dutchmen.

161
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,495
They were banned from cafés and parks.

162
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,964
ln Amsterdam, black-shirted NSB men
marched into a working-class area,

163
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,510
pulled Jews out of pubs
and beat them up in the streets.

164
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,019
Jewish self-defence groups fought back.

165
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,772
A Dutch Nazi was killed,
a Gestapo man injured.

166
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,155
As a reprisal, the Germans
snatched 400 young Jews

167
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,824
at random oft the street, beat them up,

168
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:15,121
and sent them oft to Mauthausen,
already known to be a death camp.

169
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:21,210
A Communist street cleaner, Piet Nak,
following his party's instructions,

170
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,924
stood up in the street
and urged Amsterdammers to protest.

171
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,092
(speaks Dutch)

172
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,973
(translator) What drove me personally,
but l think the other people too,

173
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,351
we were filled
with an overwhelming hate.

174
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,062
We'd never seen anything like that
in Amsterdam.

175
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,689
Lots of people,
just because they were Jewish,

176
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,027
men, women and children -
there were no exceptions.

177
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,238
People just arrested and beaten up.

178
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:53,785
You see... Well, what would you do
if you saw someone in the water?

179
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,955
Of course you'd dive in and get him out.

180
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,167
You don't ask if the water's clean
or dirty. You are filled with anger.

181
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,795
There was nothing we could do
but go on strike.

182
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,216
l wouldn't have known what else
we could do. There was no other way.

183
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,720
(speaks Dutch)

184
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,728
(translator)
Thousands in a tightly packed column

185
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,147
marched through the streets
in Amsterdam,

186
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,651
while the Germans circled
round them in tanks.

187
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,865
Of course
the demonstrators weren't armed,

188
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,202
yet they found a weapon
in marching and singing.

189
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:42,083
So they marched along the Rozengracht
singing the internationaie.

190
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,334
(Nak speaks Dutch)

191
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,753
(translator)
The second day of the strike

192
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,840
we held a meeting
at the cleansing department.

193
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:55,096
The boss there wanted us to start work
in the afternoon of the second day,

194
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,893
but we had already decided
we would only go back on the third day.

195
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,691
(narrator) The trams,

196
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:11,654
which had signalled the start
of the strike, signalled its end.

197
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,825
The Germans had shot down nine people.
To continue would mean a bloodbath.

198
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,454
For 48 hours, workmen,
shopkeepers and businessmen

199
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,540
had staged a unique strike
in defence of the Jews.

200
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,709
(Nak speaks Dutch)

201
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,130
(translator) My personal opinion is,

202
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:36,220
put yourself in the place
of the Jewish people of Amsterdam.

203
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,973
They felt they'd been deserted,
left on their own,

204
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,185
but because of this strike
there must have been many Jews,

205
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,228
well, you can't really say many,

206
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,356
but if you ask
if it did any good, l say this:

207
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,442
if just one Jew in the gas chamber

208
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,737
felt that the workers of Amsterdam
had not deserted him,

209
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,906
then it wasn't for nothing.

210
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,118
(narrator)
Faced with such bold opposition,

211
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,371
the Germans now abandoned
what was left of conciliation.

212
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,625
The mayors of three towns
who had been lenient with strikers

213
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,211
were replaced by Dutch Nazis.

214
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,714
NSB leaders, though not allowed
to form a government,

215
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,218
were installed in positions of power.

216
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,055
The head of the Netherlands Bank
was Rost van Tonningen.

217
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:24,018
(woman)
My husband joined the NSB in 1936.

218
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,562
He was very interested
in the work of Hitler,

219
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,899
what he was doing in Germany.

220
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:36,197
ln Holland, the situation
was quite difterent from Germany.

221
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,200
We have big poorness here in Holland,

222
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,452
we have no buildings,

223
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:46,749
three-quarters of the population
had no work,

224
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,168
and they had bad clothes,

225
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:53,756
so it was really not
a very good situation in Holland.

226
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,677
Before l joined the NSB,
l was in the youth movement.

227
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,264
The only difterence between the NSB
and the youth movement

228
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,766
was that it was not
a political movement.

229
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:12,108
The Jeugdstorm was to bring the children
who came from poor parents together,

230
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:18,531
to give them ideals,
to work in teamwork for another person.

231
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:23,369
Of course, we looked
to the youth movement in Germany.

232
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,956
lt was quite difterent, because a German
has a German character

233
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,917
and a Dutchman has a Dutch character.

234
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,004
So we tried in the movement of the NSB,

235
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,507
because we saw the ideal,

236
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,218
we saw the danger of the Bolshevism,

237
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:46,142
and our thinking was to work there,
to make them a big movement,

238
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,603
to try to help Europe,

239
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:54,859
as a big united Europe from several
kinds of countries who work together.

240
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,069
(man speaks Dutch)

241
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,697
(narrator)
Another Dutch Nazi, Woudenberg,

242
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,866
was put in charge of the trade unions.

243
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,998
My father, l think, worked
and he lived from a religious base,

244
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,668
without calling it God

245
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,046
or some other religion's name.

246
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,884
My father was a well-known man.
He was a hated man.

247
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:24,055
There was a possibility
for me to go to Germany,

248
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:28,142
to this National Socialistic
educating institute.

249
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:33,356
lt was a school,
like Eton school or something like that.

250
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,362
We wore uniforms,
and we had the feeling

251
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,990
that we were a selected group,
better than the others.

252
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,036
And, you know, you feel happy
when you have that feeling.

253
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,459
And in a very short time
l was educated in this SS thinking,

254
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,922
a great Germanistic empire,
and there was no reason

255
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:03,052
for me to think about Holland
and the Netherlands in school.

256
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:09,058
l knew there should be one thing done -
this war had to be won.

257
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,812
When l had the age,
l had to be a soldier,

258
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:19,568
to fight so that we could leave behind
that little small country

259
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:25,700
and we come to new situations,
this great Germanistic empire.

260
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,245
- (man) Heil der Führer!
- (crowd) Heil!

261
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,539
(narrator) June 1941 .

262
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:36,085
The NSB called for support
for Germany's attack on Russia.

263
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,630
Mussert urged Dutchmen
to unite for Hitler,

264
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,551
against Stalin, against Churchill.

265
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,554
(Mussert speaks Dutch)

266
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,974
(crowd chants)

267
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,566
(repeated drumbeat of "V"
in Morse code)

268
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,781
(man) Beep beep beep beep.

269
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,075
(conversation in Dutch)

270
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,996
(translator) First it would start,
"Beep beep beep" and "Radio Orange".

271
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,998
There you were, sitting in the dark.

272
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,209
You could only have a little light,
a candle or something,

273
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,586
and we would listen.

274
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,256
(radio crackles)

275
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,051
(narrator) Hundreds of thousands
risked arrest

276
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,678
to listen to Dutch broadcasts
from London,

277
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,638
their only trusted source of news.

278
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:35,102
The radio urged patriots to daub up
signs "OZO" - "Orange will win",

279
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,271
and "V" for "victory".

280
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,524
Goebbels started
a not very convincing countercampaign -

281
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,486
"V" stood for
"German victory on all fronts".

282
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,740
(man) Early in '41 ,
we decided to start a political cabaret.

283
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,786
We looked in all the gramophone shops

284
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,246
in London for old Dutch records.

285
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,375
We used the tunes of these records

286
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,418
and put new words to the tunes,

287
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,254
so that every Dutchman
could whistle the tune

288
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,884
and then every other Dutchman knew
he had heard that from Radio Orange.

289
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,721
(piano plays song intro)

290
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,558
(woman sings "Lied van de watergeus")

291
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,635
(woman) There were two boys
who came over to England in a canoe.

292
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,929
They were introduced to me,

293
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,433
and they realised
all of a sudden who l was.

294
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:01,981
They looked at me in such a strange way,

295
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:08,154
and they said, "ls that you,
this girl, this voice?"

296
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:14,326
And l said, "Yes."
And they said, "May l touch you?"

297
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,413
And l said, "Certainly." They were...

298
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,749
Something happened, something strange,

299
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,753
and all of a sudden
l realised what l meant.

300
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,882
Not l, but what this voice,

301
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:34,889
the whole thing we meant to do with it,
what happened in an occupied country.

302
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,273
(narrator) On the surface, life
in Holland seemed to go on as usual.

303
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,525
Under the patronage of Seyss-lnquart,

304
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,653
Holland's most famous conductor,
Willem Mengelberg,

305
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:55,576
still gave dazzling performances
with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.

306
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,787
(♪ "Egmont Overture" - Beethoven)

307
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:11,675
(narrator) But all the time the Germans
were steadily tightening their grip.

308
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,137
By 1942, the invaders
began to fortify the coast.

309
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:20,100
They evacuated resorts where people
had holidayed only two years before.

310
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:26,148
The Germans conscripted
more and more workers for forced labour.

311
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,402
Those who resisted,
they imprisoned and shot.

312
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,119
There was no sign of an Allied victory,

313
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,082
no sign of when Holland
would again be free.

314
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,629
(♪ "Egmont Overture" - Beethoven)

315
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:57,054
German promises not to impose
their ideology were now forgotten.

316
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,432
All performing artists,
writers and painters

317
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,602
had to join Nazi-controlled
cultural guilds.

318
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:08,232
Only music approved by the censors
could be played.

319
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:32,506
Jewish composers were banned
and players of Jewish origin sacked.

320
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,052
Slowly, resistance was organised -

321
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,347
weapons and explosives for sabotage,

322
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,768
an underground press, printed
and distributed at terrible risk.

323
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,232
The few thousand men
in resistance groups

324
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,610
became Holland's conscience.

325
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:57,156
(man sings
"Kleine Greetje uit de polder")

326
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,370
(narrator) The illegal papers
urged people not to attend

327
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,582
German-sponsored all-Aryan
sports meetings.

328
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,214
But attendances rose -
people wanted to escape the war.

329
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,383
(song continues)

330
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,938
The Resistance also urged people
not to listen to German-controlled radio

331
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,983
which poured out pop songs
and propaganda.

332
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,778
Popular entertainers
like Eddy Christiani

333
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,406
walked a tightrope
between collaboration and resistance.

334
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,160
You must live. So to listen to music,

335
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:47,164
l know it's maybe collaboration,

336
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:51,669
but then the whole Dutch people
have collaborated.

337
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,756
You couldn't listen to another station
than the German station.

338
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,468
See what l mean?
And you can say maybe,

339
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:03,931
"l don't like the German music. l never
listened during the war to music,"

340
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:09,395
but if for one week you're at home
and it is in absolute silence,

341
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,271
you don't hear nothing at all,

342
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:16,819
then in one weak moment
you put on your radio and you hear music

343
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,863
and you don't care
if it's German or Chinese.

344
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,409
lt's much better than to hear still
the bombing or the aeroplanes

345
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,119
or the shouting of the Germans.

346
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,162
(band plays marching tune)

347
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,499
lt was allowed for the Dutch people
to sit down

348
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,960
and just listen to music,
but no dancing.

349
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,004
lt was also forbidden
to make show with your orchestra.

350
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,258
lt was not allowed for a trumpet player
to play a muted trumpet,

351
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:45,681
you see, like, let's say,
Duke Ellington, to crow.

352
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:49,393
lt was forbidden for a trumpet player
or for a saxophone player

353
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:54,940
to make a movement
with his instrument, like swaying.

354
00:28:55,024 --> 00:29:01,196
lt was forbidden to play
a higher note than a C, a written C,

355
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,824
because that was all Negro music,

356
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,745
and they say in Germany
Negro music was music of the devil,

357
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,999
and we are now a cultivated people,
and so were the Germans,

358
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:16,962
so we have to play
proper, cultivated music.

359
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,673
At that time, of course,
you had some ofticers

360
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,592
who were looking for nice girls.

361
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:25,304
Today you have customers in the hotel
all looking for nice girls.

362
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,640
lf they want some nice girl,
you could find some nice girl.

363
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:33,061
l still can find some nice girls today
for them if they ask for it, you know?

364
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,815
But l must say, there was...

365
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,110
He was... How do you call it?

366
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,446
He had his oftice at the Museum Square

367
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,618
and he was, you may say,
town commander of Amsterdam,

368
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,870
and he was a guy, you know...

369
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,707
l mean, today they would say
a playboy, you know?

370
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,877
He was a German playboy in uniform.

371
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:01,799
He had his own two seats in one of
the cinemas and the City Theatre.

372
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:08,222
And later on, l have been many times
to the City Theatre with his card,

373
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,351
because those seats
was not allowed for anybody to sit down.

374
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,855
But two employees, like me,
youngsters, you know,

375
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,984
sat down there
at the invitation of the commander.

376
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,071
So we had fun about it.

377
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,491
(narrator) One film which had
to be shown in every Dutch town

378
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,368
was The Eternal Jew.

379
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:34,498
(Dutch newsreel) They have always moved
over the Earth like parasites.

380
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,708
Their journey started in Asia.

381
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:42,589
From there they moved via Russia
and the Balkans into Europe.

382
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,553
Halfway through the 18th century,
they were spread across Europe.

383
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,597
Towards the end of the 19th century,

384
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,142
they used ships
to take over America too.

385
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,275
Where rats appear,
they bring death and depravity.

386
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,570
They destroy human property and food.

387
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:09,032
They spread pests, leprosy,
typhus and cholera.

388
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,620
They're vicious, cruel cowards,
who prefer to move in big groups.

389
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,795
(narrator) Made in Germany,

390
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,423
the film was part
of the carefully prepared campaign

391
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,050
to foster fear and loathing of the Jews.

392
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,763
(Dutch newsreel)
The assimilation has reached its maximum

393
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,850
here in the second
and third generations.

394
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:39,354
They try to imitate the host people
in their appearance.

395
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:44,735
The host people
sometimes let themselves be fooled

396
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,363
and consider the Jews
to be their equals.

397
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,657
That's where the danger lies.

398
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,870
(narrator) ln each occupied country,

399
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:59,041
the film's message was sharpened
by inserting local material.

400
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,794
(Dutch newsreel)
These assimilated Dutch Jews

401
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,005
are and always will be strange elements

402
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,759
in the organism of the host people,
no matter how hard they try.

403
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,762
(narrator) The Germans
were now putting into eftect

404
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,057
their plan to destroy
all the Jews in Europe.

405
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,394
The local population
had first to be won over to cooperation,

406
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,521
or at least to acquiescence.

407
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,274
There were 140,000 Jews in Holland.

408
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:29,112
ln May 1942, they were ordered
to wear the yellow Star of David.

409
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,199
By that autumn,
they were being rounded up

410
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,618
and on their way to concentration camps.

411
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,704
lt was forbidden for Jewish people
to go to the movies,

412
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,082
to go to the park, to go to anything.

413
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,794
But my brother discovered
it was for a long time possible

414
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,047
to rent a boat
and do some sailing on the Amstel.

415
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,800
One Saturday a little boy
fell in the water

416
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:54,137
and immediately my brother jumped
after the boy and brought him out,

417
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:58,767
and it was the son of a Fascist
living in our street.

418
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,603
The mother of that little boy

419
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:08,652
was very, very thankful to
that Jewish boy who saved her only son,

420
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:13,991
and she said to him,
"lf l ever can do something for you,

421
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,993
then come to my house."

422
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,663
And he went away but...

423
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:25,210
He was not yet downstairs,
immediately he went back, and he said,

424
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,338
"You said something maybe l can use."

425
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,091
"Please write me a note
that l saved your son."

426
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,511
"That's the only thing l ask."
She said, "l'll do that for you."

427
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,388
And l remember her letter,

428
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,350
in which she wrote that that boy
saved her only child,

429
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,354
with German greetings, Heil Hitier,
she wrote under that letter.

430
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,315
And l remember my mother,
she was so mad at him.

431
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,609
She hit him. She said, "You are crazy."

432
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,363
"Why did you do that for?
Now they know your address."

433
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,824
"Maybe they are coming tomorrow."

434
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,453
She didn't realise
they had all the addresses.

435
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,329
And...

436
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,750
Well, one day we were actually hauled,
all of us,

437
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,585
and were brought to the theatre.

438
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,588
There were tables
and there were people writing things,

439
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,715
and there were sacks, and there was...

440
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,468
lt was terrible. But anyhow...

441
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:19,431
There was a man
looking at us, looking...

442
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,184
"ls that your family?"

443
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:26,271
"All right.
You can go home, all of you."

444
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,859
And this was really unbelievable,

445
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,571
to walk on the street again
at six o'clock in the morning,

446
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,822
to be free again.

447
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:41,661
But for the first time,
now we were absolutely safe.

448
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,956
We were in their hands
and they sent us home.

449
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,877
We were tired, but we never go to bed.
No, my mother made coftee.

450
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,463
We felt so safe, yes.

451
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,674
They hauled us from our house,
you know how many times?

452
00:34:54,759 --> 00:35:00,013
1 1 times they played
that game of cat and mouse with us.

453
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,684
We knew exactly how it went.
Then the man came, he sent us home.

454
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,604
The last time he said
it was now long enough,

455
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,691
that game ten times, 1 1 times,
for only one child.

456
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,278
The whole family Koopman
must go to Vught now.

457
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,448
(narrator) Loads of Jews
in goods wagons

458
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,035
arrived at transit camps
at Vught and Westerbork.

459
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,300
Their names and papers
were checked by clerks,

460
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,678
some of them themselves Jews.

461
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,890
Then they were sent east,
supposedly to be resettled.

462
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:49,229
ln fact, to be gassed and cremated
in Sobibór and Auschwitz.

463
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,236
The Resistance
called for strikes and sabotage.

464
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:01,533
Railwaymen and police,
under German control, did not respond.

465
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,411
The trains ran on time.

466
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:13,378
Of Holland's 140,000 Jews,
105,000 perished.

467
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:20,093
(Van Der Deen) l came there on
the platform and there were 24 people -

468
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,181
young and old, ladies, children, men -

469
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,226
chained together in an iron chain.

470
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,272
And they were, of course,
transported to Germany to be gassed.

471
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,650
Four Germans were there -
three at one side with Tommy guns,

472
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,528
and one on the other side of the group.

473
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,240
l was alone, it was 12 o'clock,

474
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,911
you were in the midst of a city
on a railway platform.

475
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,915
What could you do?
lf l could, by surprise,

476
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,792
shoot down the three,
the other man was there.

477
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,587
With my pistol, l was helpless.

478
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,547
But even when you got all four,

479
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:02,302
what can you do with 24 people
who are all linked together

480
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,930
in the midst of the day
after a shooting party

481
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,183
in a place that's crowded with Germans?

482
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,852
So you walk away.

483
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,564
And that is absolutely terrible,

484
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,400
and if you have that experience,

485
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:23,740
you have a new stimulus to risk yourself
for the few possibilities we had.

486
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,534
l stayed for a long time in Vught.

487
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:32,290
Till the last Jewish prisoners,
l stay in Vught.

488
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,459
And...

489
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:40,715
Well, you see, Maurice,
the boy who tried to save us,

490
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,885
must leave me, which was terrible.

491
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,931
My parents after four weeks,
but he after...

492
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,933
Nine months, we stayed together.

493
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:54,938
And he took care of me like my father
should have done, or my husband.

494
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,898
l had not a husband at that time.

495
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,443
lt was touching, the way
he tried to take care of his sister.

496
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,363
He worked in the night.
He was very left-handed.

497
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,740
He tried to sew things
for other prisoners

498
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:11,413
just to get a little bit more food -
that dreadful food - for his sister.

499
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:17,419
And after nine months he had to go,
and l should have gone with him,

500
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,964
but it was not allowed
because l had roodvonk.

501
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,342
l don't know...
scarlet fever, l had that.

502
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:28,638
And that was one of the dirty things
of the Germans -

503
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,684
when you were sick
you couldn't go to the gas chamber.

504
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,894
No. First you had to recover.

505
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,480
They gave you the illusion
nothing happened

506
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,941
because they don't send you
on a transport

507
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,485
when you are sick. So l had to...

508
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,779
My brother, he came
to say goodbye to me.

509
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,073
l was looking at him and l was thinking,

510
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:51,661
"For heaven's sake, he can't go,
not in these poor clothes."

511
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:57,250
He was small, you see,
and l gave him one of my jackets,

512
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,671
and l was thinking, "lt's closing
the other way around, but who cares?"

513
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:06,468
And l gave him a pair of my boots.
And...

514
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:13,850
l looked at him when he walked away
from the barrack, at his back,

515
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,936
and from the back he looked like me,

516
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,274
and l was sure l'd never see him again.

517
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,443
l was sure.

518
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,821
We failed as a nation.

519
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,450
We didn't make one milieu with the Jews.

520
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:36,956
We did it, a part of the group did it,
of the Netherlands, far too late.

521
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,793
We had been neutral
in the First World War,

522
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,004
we thought we should be neutral
in the Second World War -

523
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,756
all this stupid nonsense.

524
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,261
And then, having a sense of protest

525
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,765
isn't the same thing
as translating it to relevant action.

526
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,393
(marching music)

527
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,234
(narrator) As the war went on,

528
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,069
the Germans stepped up appeals

529
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,364
for recruits to fight with them
in Russia.

530
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,450
ln all, 25,000 Dutchmen volunteered -

531
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:17,080
in proportion to its size, the biggest
contingent from any occupied country.

532
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,543
Only half returned.

533
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,067
At the same time,
German decrees forced able-bodied men

534
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:50,447
to report as conscript labour
to work in German war factories.

535
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,496
Rather than be separated
from their families,

536
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,291
tens of thousands
now tried to go into hiding.

537
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:08,006
Police spot checks on papers
made draft-dodging difticult.

538
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,009
Another problem
was the ration-card system

539
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,721
administered by Dutch civil serVants.

540
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:19,309
One of their tasks was to keep
a vigilant lookout for irregularities.

541
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,188
This was because the Resistance,
now bigger and better organised,

542
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,984
forged stamps and stole ration books
to feed the growing numbers in hiding.

543
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:33,573
(woman) We had special organisations
providing people with hiding places,

544
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,992
and they knew our address.

545
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:43,166
So when they had somebody
who had to be hidden at once,

546
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,002
they knew they could always
bring them to us

547
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:50,006
because we always had
two sleeping places

548
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:55,470
reserVed for such urgent cases, you see?

549
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,432
And most of the time
they were people who didn't stay long,

550
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,519
sometimes for a weekend,
and then, in the meantime,

551
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:07,273
they tried to find another safer place
for them where they could stay.

552
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,193
(man) ln a small room, l think...

553
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:16,908
Well, some... four yards, five yards,

554
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:22,872
there were nine people, l think,
sometimes 1 1 ,

555
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:29,254
and people from other surroundings.

556
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,883
We hadn't to do a single thing.

557
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:38,763
Peeling potatoes,
that kind of thing, you could do.

558
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,475
Reading books
from the Christian library.

559
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,519
l played chess with my wife.

560
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:52,527
l studied chess with the books
my friends sent from Amsterdam.

561
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:59,242
But it was horribly like hell itself,

562
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:05,123
as Sartre puts it in Huis Cios,

563
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:12,672
sitting together with people
who you get to dislike more and more

564
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,008
every minute of the day,

565
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,013
with all tensions.

566
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:26,769
And the only one way of escape
was going to sleep.

567
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,066
Early in the morning
you went to the bureau.

568
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,235
We had a Bible institute at the bureau.

569
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,031
lt was very good because we were hiding
all our explosives and weapons

570
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,367
behind the library
of the Bible institute.

571
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,288
And then at nine or nine-thirty,
you had to be there, and not later,

572
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,374
for that would already be...

573
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,544
well, uncertainty in the group -
"Where is he?"

574
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:57,800
And then we tried to do
what was the programme of the week.

575
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,511
The RAF dropped plastics.

576
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,474
So we got such a plastic bomb,

577
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:10,480
and found a beautiful German lorry
and put it in.

578
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:15,693
You have to destroy something
inside that bomb,

579
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:19,697
and then in half an hour's time
it will explode.

580
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:24,035
Now, we had no training in that,
and we didn't press too fast,

581
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,622
and after nearly an hour,
it still didn't explode.

582
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:32,543
So we went back to the bureau we had
and made another bomb,

583
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,296
and pressed that a little bit better.

584
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,674
lt was a little bit risky to put it in

585
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:42,345
because if the other one would trigger
oft just by a little movement,

586
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,973
well, l couldn't tell you
the story then. But it didn't.

587
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,687
And half an hour later the two of them
went together, and it was a real fire.

588
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,856
You need some joy to go on

589
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,359
because we had other days also

590
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,028
when some of the friends
would never come back.

591
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,864
(Bruin Slot speaks Dutch)

592
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,410
(translator) There were several
illegal newspapers in Holland.

593
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,370
(speaks Dutch)

594
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:11,249
(translator) Once, the Germans
had taken 40 of our people prisoner,

595
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:15,211
they'd been put
in Vught concentration camp.

596
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:19,799
They interrogated one of them
and then released him

597
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,135
and sent him to us with this message:

598
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,096
"lf you close down the paper..." -

599
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,308
this was near the end of the war,
probably 1944 -

600
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:35,356
"lf you stop producing your paper,
then we won't shoot these people."

601
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,525
(continues in Dutch)

602
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:52,415
(translator) We called a meeting
and talked it over very carefully.

603
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,339
We reached the conclusion
that we had to go on.

604
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,642
(Van Der Veen) As soon
as some of your friends are shot,

605
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,436
you take things more serious.

606
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:17,273
lf you know that this man is penetrating
into the underground forces

607
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,276
and you can shoot him
and save so many lives,

608
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,490
it is terribly difticult
and a terrible responsibility.

609
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:29,911
We had the orders to kill a couple,

610
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,872
a dangerous couple.

611
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,541
We were asked to shoot them
on the streets -

612
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,420
when they crossed a bridge,
to shoot them there and run away.

613
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,965
But we had a school
very near to that place,

614
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,635
and there were so many people
on the streets,

615
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,639
that we thought,
"Let us bring them in that school

616
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,517
and kill them in the cellar."

617
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:58,189
And as soon as they came in that cellar
and the light was on,

618
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,234
we saw that the wife was pregnant.

619
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,153
And then we couldn't do that.

620
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:09,325
So we arranged - the commander
of our group and l -

621
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,828
that we should threaten them.

622
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,997
And we did so. The man first.

623
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,292
We gave him a hell of a time,
l promise you.

624
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,294
But just threatening.

625
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:26,884
And then his wife also,
but in relationship to her situation.

626
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:32,014
We took the risk of their promises,

627
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,143
of stepping out of that practice
and waiting till after the war

628
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,146
when people could do with them
what was necessary.

629
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,609
(narrator) Spring 1944.

630
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:48,114
The second front,
leading to the longed-for liberation.

631
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,158
The Germans put up posters
warning that Allied invasion

632
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,286
would mean death and destruction.

633
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:58,499
"Mother, is this the second front
Father was always talking about?"

634
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,589
But the invasion came,

635
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:08,801
and by the autumn of 1944
the Allies were racing north.

636
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,262
On September 13, the first Dutch city,

637
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,098
Maastricht, in the extreme south,
was liberated.

638
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:18,060
Resistance fighters arrested Nazis
and punished women collaborators.

639
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,400
But while the southern tip
of Holland rejoiced,

640
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:28,863
the rest of the country
impatiently waited for their liberation.

641
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,701
Days later, their hopes were dashed -

642
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,913
the Allies were beaten severely
at Arnhem.

643
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,380
The Dutch government in exile
called for a railway strike

644
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,799
to deny supplies to German armies.

645
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,178
Railwaymen, who had hesitated before,
now came out in force,

646
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,389
bringing all transport to a standstill.

647
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,934
The Germans retaliated by cutting oft

648
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,771
all supplies of fuel and food
to cities in western Holland.

649
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,026
Soon people were scavenging

650
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,280
along silent and deserted railway tracks
for bits of coal.

651
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:17,244
Shops ran out of food.
Prices soared on the black market.

652
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,039
People kept alive by eating tulip bulbs.

653
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,630
Despite the privations,
the strikers held firm.

654
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,636
Using forged securities, their wages
were repaid by the Resistance,

655
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,764
which was by now
also hiding 300,000 men

656
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,558
wanted by the Germans for forced labour.

657
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,062
There was no electricity or gas.

658
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:48,901
Houses left vacant by Jews
were stripped of wood for use as fuel.

659
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,793
As the winter got worse,

660
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:10,131
the Germans relented
and allowed emergency soup kitchens.

661
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,695
Still, it was clear
that many would starVe

662
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,822
unless Holland was liberated.

663
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:41,495
(man) l did ask my friend Bedell Smith
to ask General Eisenhower

664
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,498
could they not start a separate action

665
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,711
to liberate the rest of Holland,

666
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,422
where we had got up to the Maas

667
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:55,259
and then up to Nijmegen,
and that was it,

668
00:50:55,343 --> 00:51:00,765
and the rest was really getting
in worse and worse trouble this winter.

669
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,893
Well, at that time, pretty soon,

670
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:09,982
almost simultaneously, the German
counterattack came in the Ardennes,

671
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,444
which upset almost everything
one had hoped for.

672
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,576
(narrator)
Hitler now stripped Holland bare.

673
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,663
From Rotterdam alone
in two days in November 1944,

674
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:30,294
50,000 able-bodied men were rounded up
and removed to Germany.

675
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,090
(speaks Dutch)

676
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:37,635
(translator) When the doorbell rang
there were two Germans.

677
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,678
They both came upstairs.

678
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,766
One stayed at the top of the stairs
and the other one came into the room.

679
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,309
He looked round the room,

680
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,938
and the two men who were there
had to get dressed and go with them.

681
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,650
And we, being women,
were crying of course, both of us -

682
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:57,947
one woman with a baby in her arms,
another hanging on her skirt.

683
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,033
And l can still remember vividly
the one German

684
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,829
who was inside the room, he was crying.

685
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,581
Tears were streaming down his face
and he said,

686
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,877
"l am so terribly sorry
that l'm not alone."

687
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,880
"l'd love to be able to help you,
but l can't do anything

688
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,967
because there's someone with me
and l don't know him."

689
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:22,012
He couldn't do it. He'd have tried
very hard to leave those two men there

690
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,224
because he thought it was terrible.

691
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,066
That was the first time
l'd ever seen a German cry.

692
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:38,320
He really cried,
big tears rolling down his face.

693
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:48,164
(narrator) That winter,
16,000 Dutch men, women and children

694
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,207
died of cold and hunger.

695
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,956
Still the liberators did not come.
