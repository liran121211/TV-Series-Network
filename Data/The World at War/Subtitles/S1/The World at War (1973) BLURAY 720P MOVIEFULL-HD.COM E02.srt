1
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:21,437
(narrator) September 1 , 1939.

2
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,731
Germany attacks Poland.

3
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:29,403
Adolf Hitler ignores Britain and France
which had promised to fight for Poland.

4
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:18,368
Sunday September 3. The British prime
minister Neville Chamberlain broadcasts.

5
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,790
(Chamberlain) This morning
the British ambassador in Berlin

6
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,252
handed the German government
a final note

7
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:32,674
stating that unless
we heard from them by 1 1 o'clock

8
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,805
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

9
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,391
a state of war would exist between us.

10
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:48,774
l have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received

11
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:54,655
and that consequently
this country is at war with Germany.

12
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,424
(chanting / cheering)

13
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,352
(narrator) Danzig, taken
from Germany affer the First World War,

14
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,146
welcomed its liberators.

15
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,566
To many good Germans the city's capture
symbolised the end

16
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,861
of the humiliating Treaty of Versailles.

17
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:39,426
Hitler swept forward
to congratulate his victorious troops.

18
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,514
He said they'd rescued his people
from Polish barbarism.

19
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,489
The Germans thrust into Poland
from the west and north.

20
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,701
ln two weeks the Polish army
had virtually ceased to exist.

21
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,788
Warsaw was one of the few places
to hold out.

22
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,123
The Russians,
by agreement with Germany,

23
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,585
seized parts of Poland
they claimed as theirs by right.

24
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,964
The two conquerors met at Brest-Litovsk.

25
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:22,261
lt was the scene of the Russian
surrender to Germany in 1918.

26
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,101
The official German greeting in Russian

27
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:33,563
said German soldiers had always
respected Russian soldiers.

28
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,318
The clash of Nazi and Communist was,
for the moment, conveniently forgotten.

29
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,116
The final bombardment of Warsaw
began on September 23.

30
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,215
(♪ Polish national anthem)

31
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,601
For nearly three weeks Warsaw Radio

32
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,314
had defiantly played
the Polish national anthem.

33
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,831
On September 27 the anthem stopped.

34
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,215
- (announcement in Polish)
- (air-raid siren)

35
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,097
Warsaw was reduced to rubble.

36
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,447
The capital's commander surrendered.

37
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,703
Poland, swallowed by Germany
and Russia,

38
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,164
disappeared into a new dark age.

39
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,709
Arrests, deportations, executions began.

40
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,045
(siren)

41
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,636
Britain's war started
with a false alarm.

42
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,013
September 3.

43
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,226
(man) l remember
when the outbreak of war came.

44
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,770
We were in the cabinet room

45
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:23,775
at the moment
that the ultimatum expired.

46
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,319
(narrator) Lord Butler
was a junior minister.

47
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:31,616
(Butler) And we were just beginning
to congratulate the prime minister

48
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,579
on his broadcast
when we heard a terrible wailing,

49
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:39,624
which of course
was the first air-raid siren.

50
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,255
Chamberlain took it very seriously

51
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,802
and his wife appeared with an enormous
basket full of things for the night

52
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:56,266
and Thermos flasks
and things to read and so on.

53
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,352
And so we all went and sheltered.

54
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,399
l went and sheltered affer some delay
in the Foreign Office.

55
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,986
The whole of the Horse Guards Parade
was empty of people

56
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,614
and there was nobody in sight anywhere.

57
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,243
When l got there, there was no furniture
so l had to sit on the floor.

58
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,289
And an air-raid warden
said that there would be no gas.

59
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:24,169
But of course there wasn't really
any war for some time,

60
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,505
quite apart from being no gas.

61
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,673
(air-raid siren)

62
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,939
(narrator) So, no war that day,
or for many months.

63
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,234
People settled down
to enjoy the unexpected reprieve.

64
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,446
lt was perfect weather
for a late holiday - or invading Poland.

65
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,615
(♪ military band)

66
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,771
People had braced themselves
for a grimmer war.

67
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,983
Hospitals were cleared
to take air-raid casualties.

68
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,945
The experts predicted
over a million injured in two months.

69
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,751
Children and their mothers evacuated
from the cities - 1 .5 million of them.

70
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,671
For some, a nightmare.
For others, an adventure.

71
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,508
(man) We assembled
in a playground rather like this.

72
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,928
The kids were there and the parents.

73
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:45,143
Children had the gas mask over
their shoulder and labels tied to them.

74
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,815
(woman) The women had to decide
whether to keep their children with them

75
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,568
or whether to allow them to go out.

76
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,113
Now, one would think
that this was an easy decision.

77
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,742
Why not keep your children with you -
the natural thing to do?

78
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,703
But against this
was the terrible thought

79
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,164
that there was going to be gas,

80
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,834
that there was going to be
terrible bombing and death

81
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,129
and that children would be maimed.

82
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,260
(man) Everyone was crying -
the parents and children -

83
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,765
and as we moved off especially,
people burst into tears.

84
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,102
My mother was more unhappy
about the wrench of us going

85
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,562
rather than the war itself.

86
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,024
My sister was crying.
l personally wasn't.

87
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,947
l was rather excited at the prospect
of leaving this part of London.

88
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,910
We thought we'd travelled
to the other side of the world,

89
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,914
but in fact, we came to Denham, here,
only 20 miles from London.

90
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,544
l promised my mother
l wouldn't be separated from my sister,

91
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,840
so we went to the village hall
with all the other kids,

92
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:01,261
and because we wouldn't be separated,
we were the last ones to find a billet.

93
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,848
lt was like being auctioned off
at the time.

94
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:09,352
But when we finally got a house
to take us in, it was fantastic.

95
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,480
lt was a new world
that opened out to us.

96
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:18,737
l mean, we had toothbrushes
and sheets on the bed and hot water.

97
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,614
lmagine hot water!
We just couldn't get over it.

98
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,909
And we didn't know
what eiderdowns were for.

99
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:29,038
ln the morning
we went blackberry picking.

100
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,877
Then we heard the sirens,
so we rushed back to our billet.

101
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:39,632
The woman there reassured us and said
not to worry, and we sat down to lunch.

102
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:44,763
lt was the first fully laid-out table
l'd ever seen in my life.

103
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,726
And war was declared,
l think, that same lunchtime.

104
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,730
She said not to worry
and passed us the horseradish sauce.

105
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,317
But l think a number of children
suffered really deeply

106
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,569
being away from their families.

107
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,489
They suffered a sense of rejection.

108
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:07,619
They exhibited their senses of rejection
and sorrow and suffering

109
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:12,332
very offen by
strange behaviour problems,

110
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,127
by bedwetting, perhaps not eating.

111
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,423
31 arrived, with two junior nurses,
l think.

112
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:26,679
They were pretty dirty
and two of them got impetigo.

113
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,224
l had young children at the time.

114
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,559
And l put them into a large room.

115
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,396
You've no idea... l had no idea
that such things existed in England.

116
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,191
They relieved themselves
all over the carpet

117
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,569
and the place was a shambles.

118
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,740
(man shouts orders)

119
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,000
(narrator) There was no heroic rush
to volunteer for the forces.

120
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,086
You waited your turn to be called up

121
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,339
for processing
in the military sausage machine.

122
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,341
All rather leisurely.

123
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,846
(church bells)

124
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,391
But a rush to get married.

125
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:15,436
ln August and September, the highest
number of weddings ever recorded.

126
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,814
White the only wear.

127
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,698
White for the blackout too, to make sure
car drivers can see you in the dark.

128
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,951
At first the blackout
was a bit of a joke.

129
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:39,252
Then road casualties shot up
and the blackout wasn't funny any more.

130
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,004
There were no air raids,

131
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:46,050
but thousands of people were killed
or injured in accidents in the blackout.

132
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,808
Depressing, too. Without it, you could
almost forget there was a war on.

133
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,978
Every night, every home
had to be blacked out.

134
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,647
The air-raid warden
looking for chinks of light

135
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,400
became more hated than Hitler.

136
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,864
The government closed cinemas
and entertainments

137
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,407
at the beginning of the war.

138
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,118
A fortnight later
they were allowed to open again.

139
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:17,957
(♪ band plays "We're Going to Hang Out
the Washing on the Siegfried Line")

140
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:50,031
ln spite of total war, there were nearly
a million and a half unemployed.

141
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,289
Sir John Simon,
the chancellor of the exchequer,

142
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,333
introduced an emergency budget.

143
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,169
ln three hours' time

144
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:07,423
all budget secrets will be revealed.

145
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,347
l am confident
that, whatever may be the burdens

146
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,434
which have to be carried
by the British taxpayer,

147
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,355
my fellow countrymen will bear them

148
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,818
with the same resolution and courage

149
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,113
as our fighting men will show

150
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:37,161
when they discharge their grimmer task
on the field of battle.

151
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,330
(cheering)

152
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,467
The blackout budget.
lncome tax up to 7s 6d.

153
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,470
A 60% tax on excess profit.

154
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,889
ln retrospect, mild enough,

155
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,559
but a ConserVative MP, Chips Channon,

156
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,062
thought it demolished
the edifice of capitalism.

157
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:09,527
Another Tory, Leo Amery, wanted
a tougher war. Why not bomb Germany?

158
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,196
The air minister Kingsley Wood said no.

159
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,491
German munition works
were private property

160
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,452
and the Germans would retaliate.

161
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,620
The opening phase of the war

162
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,583
was one of the most extraordinary
periods through which l've lived,

163
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,335
because it was a period of euphoria

164
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,838
on the part of the people
of this country.

165
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,175
For a long time
there were quite a lot of unemployed,

166
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,846
while the Germans
were manufacturing arms at full stretch,

167
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,517
particularly in the Skoda works
in Czechoslovakia,

168
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,312
which they had by that time occupied.

169
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,815
Now, all this time the Germans
were a beehive of activity.

170
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,443
We were doing absolutely nothing.

171
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,572
We'd gone to war
for the defence of Poland.

172
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,910
ln the event, we did nothing
to help Poland at all.

173
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,079
We never liffed a finger.

174
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,581
For the first three months of the war,

175
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,752
the greatest number of casualties
were in the blackout.

176
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:14,258
We confined our war effort to dropping
leaflets on the German people

177
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,178
telling them that it was a bad idea
to go to war

178
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,806
and that it was a pity
that they'd done it

179
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,724
and perhaps we might make peace.

181
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,564
When a German plane
crashed in Scotland in November,

182
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,984
people came from miles around to see it.

183
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,617
And the Luffwaffe's dead were buried
with full military honours.

184
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,591
Three British divisions went off
to France at the beginning of the war.

185
00:18:55,676 --> 00:19:00,930
More followed. "Nearly 200,000 men,"
said the war minister proudly.

186
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,599
The French had mobilised
six million men.

187
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,270
They grumbled that the British
weren't taking the war seriously.

(narrator) "Winston's back,"
the navy was told on September 3.

232
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:13,039
Chamberlain was reluctant to recall
his most bitter political opponent

233
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,417
with a reputation
for military adventure.

234
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,339
But Churchill was popular
with the public.

235
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,133
He had warned them war was coming.

236
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,219
Now, with surprising energy
for a 64-year-old,

237
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,430
he proved a willing leader.

238
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,696
The RAF dropped leaflets,
the army dug trenches,

239
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,116
but Churchill's navy
was Britain's strongest arm.

240
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,331
And the first lord of the admiralty
was offen in the news.

241
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,334
We are in a very different position

242
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,381
from that we were in ten weeks ago.

243
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,301
We are far stronger

We are far better prepared

00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:15,142
to endure the worst malice
of Hitler and his Huns

246
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,145
than we were at the beginning
of September.

247
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,523
(narrator) The news
that a German battleship

248
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:24,318
was sinking British merchantmen
gave the chance to take the offensive.

249
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:34,286
Churchill concentrated much of
the navy's strength on finding her.

250
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,082
One hunting group patrolled off
the River Plate in South America.

251
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,794
Three cruisers -
Exeter, Ajax and Achilles.

252
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,548
At dawn on December 13
they sighted a heavier German ship.

253
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:49,135
lt was the pocket battleship
Admiral Graf Spee.

254
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,096
Although outgunned,
the cruisers engaged her.

255
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,307
The Battle of the River Plate began.

256
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,731
(man) Within about five minutes
of the alarm being sounded,

257
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,569
Graf Spee and Exeter
were shooting at each other

258
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:12,575
and the Ajax and Achilles
were both shooting at the Graf Spee,

259
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,578
concentrating their gunfire.

260
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,914
The Exeter was quite soon hit

261
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,834
and received early damage.

262
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,421
Her foremost guns
only fired a few rounds each

263
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,548
before they were out of action.

264
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,969
She continued as long as she
possibly could with her affer turret,

265
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:37,433
but the ship herself was badly damaged.
Her speed was reduced.

266
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:46,734
The six-inch-gun cruisers before long
turned directly towards the Graf Spee

267
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,069
so as to close the range still faster

268
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,531
and the captain of the Graf Spee

269
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:58,078
did not follow up the Exeter entirely,

270
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:03,292
but indeed before very long
started heading towards Montevideo.

271
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:09,798
But we could not see
any spectacular damage inflicted on him,

272
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,552
and indeed his speed
seemed to be unimpaired

273
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:19,892
and his heavy guns were still firing
regularly and with very good accuracy.

274
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,023
(narrator) The Graf Spee took on fuel

275
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,818
and put ashore the crews
of the merchant ships she'd sunk.

276
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:41,121
Captain Langsdorff asked the Uruguayans
for permission to stay

277
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,792
but was told he must clear the port
in 72 hours.

278
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,840
So he buried his dead.

279
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,261
Believing that heavier British ships
were waiting for him,

280
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:59,348
he prepared to carry out
his final orders from Berlin.

281
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,855
(Woodhouse) As soon as he started
pulling his anchor up

282
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,776
we got news of it from our people ashore

283
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,239
and we sent off our aircraff.

284
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:19,702
ln due course we got the signal
from the aircraff,

285
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,662
which was a very welcome one:

286
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,039
"Graf Spee has blown herself up."

287
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,508
(narrator) Two days later,
Langsdorff shot himself.

288
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,350
Churchill made the most of a victory
won by bluff rather than gun power.

289
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,186
Two of the cruisers were brought home.

The massive Russian army
crossed the frontier,

apparently set
for the kind of easy victory

307
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,956
the Germans had had in Poland.

308
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,882
But the Finns, few in number,
fought back.

309
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,978
Camouflaged Finnish ski troops
knew how to use their own conditions,

310

moving round the Russian flanks,
cutting their supply lines.

311

The Russian advance ground to a halt,

312
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,366
confirming the German belief
that the Russian army,

313
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:08,871
purged by Stalin of many
of its regular officers, couldn't fight.

314
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,761
Whole Russian divisions were destroyed.

315
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,556
Those who weren't taken prisoner
died in the snow -

316

a humiliating, if temporary, failure.

ln Britain it was snowing, too.

Taking refuge in a Norwegian fjord,

325
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:53,642
the Graf Spee's supply ship Aitmark
was cornered by British destroyers.

326

and affer a fight
released 300 British prisoners.

328
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,738
For Hitler the seizure of the Aitmark
was a setback.

his plan for British action in Norway,

but some, like the foreign secretary
Lord Halifax,

336
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,487
were difficult to persuade.

00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,912
Churchill now added a plan

00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:05,339
which came from Sweden
to the Norwegian port of NarVik.

341
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:10,344
Then it was shipped to Germany
through neutral Norwegian waters.

342
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,265
Churchill wanted to mine the waters

343
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,560
and he added enticingly
that if NarVik were captured

344
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:23,649
it could be used as a base for helping
Finland against Communist Russia.

345
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,280
Churchill knew that his plan might mean
retaliation by Hitler in Norway,

346
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,534
and helping Finland
could mean war with Russia.

347
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,499
Chamberlain was concerned
about innocent Norwegian lives

348
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,584
and the effect on American opinion.

349
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,128
Eventually, he was persuaded.

350
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,965
(man) l think that deep down
he still hoped

351
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,094
that perhaps the major clash of armies
could be avoided.

352
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,638
He thought that Germany

353
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,140
was on the verge of starVation,

354
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,351
or if not on the verge of starVation,

355
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:03,605
it anyhow would be brought to the verge
of starVation by economic warfare.

356
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,565
He thought also that deep down

357
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,819
the German people didn't support Hitler,

358
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,739
that this was a clique and that
if we did our propaganda properly

359
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,118
there would perhaps be
a revolt of the generals

360
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,370
or somebody else against Hitler

361
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:24,251
and that therefore dropping propaganda
leaflets by bomber command of the RAF

362
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,213
rather than bombs
was a good way of conducting the war.

363
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,426
Anything to stop
the real major outbreak.

364
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:38,348
And that is why l think to some extent
the campaigns in Norway

365
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,810
were something acceptable
to Chamberlain,

366
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,104
because it kept the war distant.

367
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:49,484
lt kept the idea of a real big clash,

368
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:54,031
a repetition of Passchendaele
or the Somme, far away.

369
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:59,077
lt meant that war would be localised
and perhaps some miracle would happen.

370
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,663
Perhaps Hitler would die
or be assassinated

371
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,000
and the whole thing would end
with the minimum of bloodshed.

372
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,295
Finland today

373
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:15,177
amidst her snows and her frozen lakes

374
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:23,435
is fighting against the forces
of unscrupulous violence

375
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,146
just as we are oursegves.

376
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,857
(applause)

377
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:35,530
And her need calls
for our sympathy and our aid.

378
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,161
(no sound)

379
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,583
(narrator) British aid
did go to Finland, but late.

380
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,669
The Russians
brought all their weight to bear

381
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,963
and overwhelmed the Finnish defences.

382
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,723
The day the British steeled themselves
to force a landing in Norway,

383
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,850
Finland surrendered.

384
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:09,397
So Britain was saved from war against
Russia and Germany at the same time.

385
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,694
The armistice terms gave Russia
most of what she wanted.

386
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,203
Hundreds of thousands of Finns
had to evacuate their homes.

387
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,548
The French prime minister Daladier

388
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,634
had staked everything
on helping Finland.

389
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,345
He was replaced by Paul Reynaud.

390
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,432
Reynaud went on pressing
for Churchill's operation

391
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,726
to cut off the German iron ore.

392
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:51,356
An Allied meeting in London
decided to mine Norwegian waters.

393
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,400
Churchill had got his way.

394
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,408
British and French troops
stood ready to invade Norway.

395
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,706
The mines were laid on April 8.

396
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,636
A few days earlier,
no thought of Norway in his mind,

397
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:26,224
Chamberlain had proclaimed
that Hitler had missed the bus.

398
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:31,479
And General lronside
dared the Germans to do their worst.

399
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,863
Hitler's invasion force
sailed on April 6.

400
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,821
The Luffwaffe took over
most of the Norwegian airfields.

401
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,032
(♪ marching band)

402
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,460
The German march into Oslo
was led by a band.

403
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,931
Norway had no standing army,
only half-trained militia.

404
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,393
The Norwegians
were antimilitarist by tradition

405
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:56,022
and they had seen German newsreels
of the blitzkrieg on Poland.

406
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,317
No one wanted Oslo
to go the way of Warsaw.

407
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,278
There was little resistance.

408
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,088
The Allied operation in Norway
was a muddle from the start.

409
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:26,428
Troops were embarked, disembarked,
embarked again, without vital equipment.

410
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:34,227
A contingent of French troops sailed
with the British, plentifully equipped.

411
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:49,159
Unlike the British,
they were trained for winter conditions,

412
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,454
but they hadn't got straps
for their skis.

413
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,215
Even the expedition's objectives
were confused.

414
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,011
Trondheim in central Norway
was to be captured by a pincer attack

415
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,347
from Andalsnes and Namsos.

416
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,766
So some troops were diverted south.

417
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,227
But Churchill's mind
was still fixed on NarVik,

418
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,897
and it was there
the first battle took place.

419
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,762
The navy bombarded NarVik

420
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,973
and German destroyers already there
took a battering.

421
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,850
But the advantage was lost.

422
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,021
The British army commander didn't make
a direct assault on the town.

423
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,948
British Territorials did land
at Namsos and Andalsnes.

424
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,660
They had no skis,
no proper maps of Norway,

425
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,746
and no heavy guns.

426
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:24,462
There was little they could do when
they ran into the well-equipped Germans.

427
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,846
Captain Martin Lindsay
was with the British force at Namsos.

428
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,433
(Lindsay) There was no hope at all
for this operation

429
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:41,604
because it was entirely improvised
at short notice and in a great hurry

430
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:46,818
and the force had no aircraff
supporting it and no artillery.

431
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,947
But even more important,
all the ground was covered with snow

432
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,242
and the only way to operate
was with ski troops,

433
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,661
and we hadn't got ski troops.

434
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,789
Therefore the troops
were confined to the road.

435
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:05,462
Whenever the Germans got onto the hills
on the flank they had to retire.

436
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,887
(narrator) The British
couldn't stop the Luffwaffe

437
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,265
from blitzing
the little Norwegian towns.

438
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,686
German control of the Norwegian
airfields was the key to the battle.

439
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,832
The Germans advanced,
capturing hundreds of British prisoners.

440
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,673
Some of these were flown to Berlin
and paraded before Hitler.

441
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,846
Others were put in front
of German newsreel cameras.

442
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:02,810
You seem to be in a good mood. You don't
find Germans as bad as you expected?

443
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,021
- Oh, no, certainly not.
- Oh, no.

444
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,899
l was captured at Fåberg by the Germans.

445
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,944
From there l came to Lillehammer

446
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,821
and we had a supper.

447
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:18,493
lt consisted of brown bread, Gorgonzola,

448
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:22,288
wine which the Germans gave to us,
cigarettes.

449
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:26,543
And a hot meal each day.

450
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,337
And l'm getting on fairly decent.

451
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,757
l hope the war will soon be over
and we'll all go back home.

452
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,845
(narrator)
Most did go home ingloriously,

453
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,891
abandoning Andalsnes and Namsos
still burning.

454
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:57,782
Chased by the Luffwaffe - the Norwegian
campaign rammed home the lesson

455
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:03,079
that sea power without air power
could no longer win battles.

456
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:34,319
Their only honour the part they played
in bringing down a government,

457
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:38,197
for now the machinery of democracy
began to work.

458
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,369
As the troops disembarked,

459
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,498
an angry parliament was assembling
to debate the disaster.

460
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,335
Feeling cut across party lines.

461
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:54,339
Captain Lindsay, a Tory, went to
the leader of the Labour opposition.

462
00:43:54,423 --> 00:44:00,011
(Lindsay) Well, l was the first person
from this force to reach London.

463
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:04,140
l went to see Mr Attlee on the morning
of the first day of the debate

464
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,309
and l gave him a memorandum

465
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:10,521
about the appalling improvisation
and deficiencies in Norway,

466
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:15,109
because l was convinced that we should
lose the war if we went on like that,

467
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,029
which he gave to Herbert Morrison

468
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:21,032
to help him open for the opposition
that affernoon.

469
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:25,703
The Norway debate was the only
decisive debate l ever attended

470
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:29,624
during my 34 years as a member
of the House of Commons

471
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,918
because it was the only division

472
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,213
which definitely brought about
the fall of a government.

473
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,382
For nearly a year before that debate

474
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:41,010
there had been a piling-up
of bitterness and anguish

475
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,845
in the breasts of people

476
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,517
who wanted Britain to go all out
and win the war against Hitler.

477
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:52,480
And so you can imagine
that the debate was a very fierce one -

478
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:58,403
not only the Labour opposition
but also ConserVatives.

479
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:03,741
They felt that the whole conduct
of the war could not be carried on

480
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:09,372
under a man whom they had already
assailed at the time of Munich

481
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,376
and whom they realised
was not really by nature a war leader.

482
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,337
Gradually, the temperature
began to rise,

483
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,215
and when Herbert Morrison
for the Labour Party

484
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:23,177
announced that they were going to divide
at the end of the debate

485
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,555
against the government...

486
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,099
There was an action group

487
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:33,813
of which Clement Davies was chairman,
the Liberal leader, and l was secretary.

488
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,358
lt was an all-party committee,

489
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,779
committed to pressing for
more decisive action during the war

490
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,198
and a more vigorous posture

491
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,659
and more vigorous prosecution
of the war.

492
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,788
And we decided to hold a meeting
affer Morrison's announcement

493
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,958
and we asked Leo Amery
to preside over it.

494
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,544
lt was an enormously attended meeting.

495
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,547
Many ConserVative
members of parliament were there

496
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,091
and l felt something was happening.

497
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,802
There were a great many
members of parliament

498
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,556
who had never been hitherto
members of our action group

499
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,391
who fetched up at the meeting.

500
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,852
The feeling at the meeting
was passionate.

501
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:17,523
And l felt, at that time,
that a great many ConserVative members

502
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,401
were not only prepared
to abstain in the division

503
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,779
but even to vote against the government.

504
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:27,825
And l came down from that meeting
with feelings of great tension.

505
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:34,874
Meanwhile, Churchill had been putting up
a great defence of the government,

506
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,087
and it was ironical again there
because the debate was about Norway

507
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,299
and Norway had been
a series of disasters for which,

508
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:48,638
although he might not be blamed
because they may have been unavoidable,

509
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,225
he was directly responsible
as first lord of the admiralty.

510
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:56,687
And Amery made
a most formidable speech

511
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,398
in which he quoted Cromwell's words:

512
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,819
"You have been here long enough
for any good you have done."

513
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,196
"ln the name of God, go."

514
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,365
And then Lloyd George came down

515
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,160
and made the most devastating speech
l've ever heard even him make

516
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,080
in which he concluded
by saying to Chamberlain:

517
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,457
"You have asked the nation
for sacrifices

518
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,169
but there is one sacrifice
that is more necessary than any other,

519
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,797
and that is
the sacrifice of your own office."

520
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,341
When the result was announced

521
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:29,428
and the ConserVative majority
fell to about 80,

522
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,974
and that meant the fall
of the government in the circumstances,

523
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,894
l could see Chamberlain,
l can see him now, blanch.

524
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,358
He had asked for friendship

525
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,610
from those who were his friends

526
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,448
and he hadn't got it, and he walked
out of the chamber a solitary figure.

527
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,076
And l felt very sorry for him
at that moment

528
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,662
because l knew that he knew
that he was done.

529
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:58,040
And l remember Chamberlain
going to his room afferwards

530
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,043
and saying he wondered
whether this could go on.

531
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:06,841
But it wasn't till the next day that he
really realised that his number was up.

532
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:10,553
On that particular day the whips,
l think, tried to explain to him

533
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,514
that it might have been worse
and that sort of thing,

534
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,391
but those of us who were with him

535
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,144
could see the writing on the wall
by that time.

536
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,981
During those two days, 9 and 10 May,

537
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,152
there was great doubt
as to who would succeed Chamberlain.

538
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:30,364
The Labour Party made it clear that if
there was to be a coalition government,

539
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,117
which by now
everybody thought necessary,

540
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,369
they would not serVe under Chamberlain.

541
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:39,624
The choice, therefore,
was between Churchill and Halifax.

542
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,336
(narrator) Lord Halifax
was the obvious successor,

543
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,464
Chamberlain's trusted colleague.

544
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:52,803
But no peer had been prime minister
for nearly 40 years. As for his rival...

545
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,057
(Coiville) Churchill was viewed
with grave misgiving

546
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,769
by the establishment,
as it would now be called.

547
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:04,148
Everybody at 10 Downing Street
and Whitehall generally,

548
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:08,861
the cabinet offices, and in very large
sectors of the ConserVative Party,

549
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,947
were frightened of Churchill.

550
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,659
They thought he was an adventurer.
They remembered Gallipoli.

551
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,829
They thought that they did not want
to see the fortunes of this country

552
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,333
at a most critical moment
in its whole history

553
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:27,713
handed over to somebody who might do
the most extraordinary things

554
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,758
and undertake
the most astonishing adventures.

555
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,594
And they all, affer all,
realised that Norway,

556
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,181
this fiasco from which
we were just hoping to recover

557
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,725
or had just been saved
in the nick of time,

558
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,353
was largely the inspiration
of Churchill.

559
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:47,024
lt was a very fine idea
but it didn't work, just like Gallipoli.

560
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:55,074
And therefore it was with
a certain amount of fear of Churchill

561
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,827
that l think the minds of most people

562
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:01,455
in the centre of government
and in the centre of Whitehall

563
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,125
turned towards Halifax.

564
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:08,796
Halifax was safe. He was clever.
He was a fellow of All Souls.

565
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,428
He was a man of indisputable charm
and absolute integrity.

566
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:20,141
And it was hoped that he would perhaps
be sent for by the king.

567
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,601
The Labour Party approached me -

568
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,230
Hugh Dalton and Herbert Morrison -

569
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:30,192
and they both talked
in favour of Halifax

570
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,904
and they thought
that Halifax ought to take over.

571
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,366
l think their idea always was

572
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,870
that Churchill would run the war
under Halifax,

573
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,622
an idea which didn't appeal to Halifax.

574
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,250
l remember Churchill telling me

575
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,587
that the critical moment came

576
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:56,177
when Chamberlain asked Halifax and him
to join him in the cabinet room.

577
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:00,890
And the three of them were there.

578
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:06,270
Halifax was sitting beside Chamberlain,

579
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,898
who suddenly turned to Churchill
and said:

580
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:13,861
"Tell me, Winston, do you see any reason
why in the 20th century

581
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:17,865
a prime minister should not be
in the House of Lords?"

582
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:23,579
And Churchill thought
that this was a trap.

583
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,708
lf he said,
"No, l see no reason at all,"

584
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,419
he thought Chamberlain
would turn to Halifax

585
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,964
and say, "ln that case,
if the king were to ask my advice

586
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,342
l could perhaps suggest you."

587
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,012
On the other hand, it would be difficult
for him to say, "Yes, l do,"

588
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,432
because then there could be
no alternative but himself.

589
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:47,436
So he turned round and stood staring
over the Horse Guards Parade

590
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,438
and did not reply to the question.

591
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,733
The decision, l think,
was largely taken by Halifax

592
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:58,948
who told me he had a pain in his stomach
an hour or two before the meeting

593
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,992
and did not really want
to be prime minister,

594
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,787
whereas the man who did want
to be prime minister -

595
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,289
he was quite determined - was Churchill.

596
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,087
(narrator) At dawn the Germans swept
into Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.

597
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:17,716
The war was at last
coming very close home to Britain.

598
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:25,432
As the Allied armies braced themselves
for battle, Chamberlain resigned

599
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:29,895
and advised the king
to send for Churchill.

600
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,148
(Coiville) Churchill would be a gamble,

601
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:37,403
and perhaps when you're
at a very serious moment of your lives,

602
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,780
a gamble is not the thing to undertake,

603
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:43,033
and so it was with great despair

604
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:47,621
that we all heard
on the evening of 10 May

605
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,916
that the king had sent for Churchill.

606
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:59,263
