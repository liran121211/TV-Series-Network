    "Woodrow and Gus are back in their old stomping grounds after they stop the cattle drive to look for a cook. Gus has a fateful encounter with a vengeful old foe.",
    "With the loss of Sean O'Brien, the cook refuses to cross the river and Woodrow and Gus find themselves in their old stomping grounds of San Antonio looking for someone to prepare their meals. On the trail, Jake Spoon abandons Lorena temporarily to go off gambling. Gus visits her but is far more concerned when an old foe, Blue Duck, appears. Blue Duck rides off but later returns and takes Lorena hostage. She has a very hard time of it. Meanwhile, Roscoe Brown is trying to catch up with July Johnson in Texas. He finds him but not before being joined by a young woman and coming face to face with two bandits. They all meet up with Gus and July helps Gus locate Lorena. It's not so good for those July's left behind at his own camp however.\u2014garykmcd"
