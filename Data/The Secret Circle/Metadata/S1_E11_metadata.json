She insists to take it to John and tends to believe his explanation that he needs it to protect her circle from evil witch hunter Eben by outing the traitor of sixteen years ago. Jake shares Adam's concern and stresses that Eben could only triumph over the parents' circle if one of them betrayed them, and the logical suspects are John himself and Adam's father Ethan, whom the Blackwells later confront without final resolution. At the school's \"casino\" fundraiser, John firmly refuses to side with doting Dawn again. Lee attends with Faye, but is caught and confronted aside by his deranged ex Eva, who now has powers. Handsome Aussie world traveler Grant patiently charms grumpy 'off-men' Diana. The kids learn the true danger of black magic while unaware of a curse concerning Conants and Blackwells.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Cassie catches Blackwell sneaking around the abandoned house.
