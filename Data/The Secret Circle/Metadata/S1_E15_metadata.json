A spell devised by the 'Blackwell half-sisters' to reveal the missing crystal also grants them a vision of its history, starring John as black magician scheming to wreck the previous circle and construct the kids' one to his design, for one by fathering them. Grant is back, but can only serve a shoulder for Diane to cry upon after her non-biological father admits having attempted to protect her, also by wrong means, including the murder of Cassie's grandmother Amelia. Adam found the last crystal after undoing its cloaking, but Nick overheard the outcome and grasps it, to exchange with Even for the demon he needs to survive, forcing Jake and John's party to fight them, ending in Faye saving her new lover Adam and Jake by stabbing Nick. The circle must now decide whether to trust John to help protect them by constructing the crystal skull against Eben.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2117631", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 342, "number_of_episodes": 22}
