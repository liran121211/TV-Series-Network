Then Lauren looks to her future, as she gets excited over a possible apartment, but wonders if she will ever be able to afford it on her own. The TOWIE singles go speed dating and there is someone from future episodes in the background. Which person is it? And Arg speaks to Mark about his recent break up, so we hear about his ex, a future TOWIE star, for the very first time. When will we meet the fabulous Lydia?
