348
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,514
Yes, she did.

349
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,619
But bun in the unmarried oven

350
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,867
is like a whole new level of freak out.

351
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,773
- Yeah. Okay, it's ringing.
- (LINE RINGING)

352
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:58,826
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Are we doing this?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

353
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,038
Okay, well, she's not gonna
answer, 'cause<i> Judge Judy</i> is on.

354
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,822
- She might.
- I'm not gonna leave a message.

355
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,123
- (SIGHS) I should?
- I don't know.

356
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:07,115
Her voice mail picked up.
Am I leaving a message?

357
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:09,344
I shouldn't leave this on-on
her answering machine, should I?

358
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,929
Kate, am I leaving a message right now?

359
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,012
Okay, okay. Wow.

360
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:13,625
(LONG EXHALE)

361
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,476
- Ooh.
- Sorry.

362
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,765
Let's get married.

363
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,367
Yeah, we're going to.

364
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:28,203
No. Let's just go to
the courthouse and get married.

365
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:30,320
Really?

366
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:31,757
Why not?

367
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,609
Nothing about our relationship
has been traditional.

368
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:37,623
I proposed to you when
I thought you were unconscious.

369
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:40,468
You know, we decided to have
a nice, long engagement,

370
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,550
to slow things down, and then boom!

371
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:44,585
You knocked me up, so...

372
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:46,664
Are you for real?

373
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,335
Let's get married.

374
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,085
JACK: Your Honor...

375
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,021
Randall has been with us
for over a year...

376
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:04,181
Look, let me save you some time
by being direct.

377
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,687
I don't believe that child
belongs in your home.

378
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,262
- What?
- Excuse me?

379
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,546
That child belongs with a black family.

380
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:15,906
Mr. and Mrs. Pearson,

381
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,093
how else...

382
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,604
will he see himself,
understand who he is?

383
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,039
(STAMMERS, EXHALES)

384
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,998
'Cause we will...

385
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,070
teach him all of that.

386
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,511
JACK: Yeah.

387
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:30,203
- You will teach him?
- REBECCA: Yeah.

388
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:33,116
Mrs. Pearson, I was nine years old

389
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,140
before I understood that I was black.

390
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:37,453
Now, I understood my skin color,

391
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:39,953
the color of my friends and my parents,

392
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:43,789
but I never really understood
what my blackness meant

393
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:46,882
until a white man called me a nigger.

394
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:50,733
And my father sat me down,

395
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,456
and he explained to me
what that word meant.

396
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:56,072
He didn't... sympathize
or feel sorry for me,

397
00:17:56,074 --> 00:18:00,009
because he understood all
the pain that that word elicits.

398
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,593
My father had been called that word

399
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,406
more times in his life
than he could count.

400
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:13,556
Now, you see, what you have
in your possession

401
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,093
is a black child who will
grow up to become a black man,

402
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,226
and my fear...

403
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:22,098
is that he won't have
the tools he needs in his life

404
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,499
if he stays in your home.

405
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,063
I'm... I'm sorry, sir.

406
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:31,674
With all due respect... to your opinion,

407
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:33,898
our son was left in a box

408
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,812
outside of a fire station...

409
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,580
And there are places,
and there are people

410
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,382
who will care for him

411
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:42,296
until he can be paired
with a suitable family.

412
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:44,764
Now, that's my opinion.

413
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,898
It will not change.

414
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:50,398
Now, I said that this is...
inappropriate.

415
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,648
I will see you at your next court date.

416
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:08,429
If you're going for a more
vintage vibe, rose gold is

417
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,608
- very "right now."
- Okay. Well, you know,

418
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,765
I got to be on a red-eye
in about an hour here, Roger.

419
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,757
So just, you know, show me
whatever's the most sparkly.

420
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,023
- Got it.
- Okay.

421
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,816
Do I know you from somewhere?

422
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,207
I'm a famous person, Roger.

423
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,076
Yeah, just, you know,
show me the diamonds.

424
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:23,109
Let's see the goods.

425
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,546
Ooh, that's good.

426
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,123
This is... this is like
something my dad would do

427
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:28,554
after he messed up with my mom.

428
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:32,821
He would... do something big like
this, something romantic. You know?

429
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:35,407
Well, proposing is definitely romantic.

430
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:36,358
Yeah.

431
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,867
Uh, all our selections
are conflict-free.

432
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,304
Well, uh, Sophie will love that.

433
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:44,054
That's good news. She hates conflict.

434
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,429
You know. Hates it.

435
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:48,804
I haven't exactly been the best
boyfriend lately, but I think...

436
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:50,767
we're gonna be fine.

437
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:52,892
- I'm sure you will.
- Yeah.

438
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,962
I really love her.

439
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:56,759
I'm sure you do.

440
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:05,352
You know what? We're gonna do all three.

441
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,477
Okay? I'll just get these three;
we'll let her decide.

442
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,384
I'll just wrap this up.

CLERK: <i>So, after I issue you</i>

444
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,664
the marriage license,
you come back here tomorrow

445
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,649
for the ceremony, bring a witness,

446
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,587
and whoosh, you're married.

447
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:24,048
"Whoosh"? What is that,
the sound a marriage makes?

448
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:25,267
It is here.

449
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,213
TOBY: I never imagined I'd get married

450
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:30,720
under so many fluorescent lights.

451
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:33,105
Yeah, but think of all the money
that we're gonna be saving.

452
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:34,812
And all the other wedding crap

453
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,102
- that we get out of.
- Totally.

454
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:37,572
I don't have to go
wedding dress shopping.

455
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:39,720
- Hell no, you don't.
- Right? Listen to them

456
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:42,713
break it to me that none of
the pretty ones come in my size.

457
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:44,540
(SMACKS LIPS)
Oh, and I don't have to listen

458
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:46,220
to those random wedding guests

459
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,095
come up to me
every five minutes and say,

460
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,384
"Oh, your father would have
loved the day." (SCOFFS)

461
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:52,343
Oh, and then, "Who's
gonna walk you down the aisle?"

462
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:53,500
And father-daughter dance.

463
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:54,618
Like,<i> whatever.</i>

464
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,642
This is way better.

465
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,056
Just get it over with.

466
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:00,048
- Yeah.
- CLERK: You guys are all set.

467
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:01,181
See you back here tomorrow.

468
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:02,446
- Okay.
- Uh, thanks.

469
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:04,290
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

470
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:07,970
Yeah.

♪ ♪

472
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:18,782
So this should be pretty quick.

473
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,374
We'll just be in and out in...

474
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:23,053
Your Honor, what is this meeting?

475
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,488
I didn't know we'd be having any kind...

476
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,462
I wanted a word with Mr. Hill,

477
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,887
before his sentencing, in private.

478
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:31,228
Sir, I can't advise my client

479
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,845
to waive his rights
to speak to you or...

480
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,923
It's okay.

481
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,985
I'll be right outside.

482
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,704
I gave a young man ten years today.

483
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:53,782
Younger than you.

484
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:56,556
He stole a TV.

485
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,431
Ten years for stealing a TV.

486
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,962
It wasn't even a good TV.

487
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,274
I didn't want to do it,

488
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:08,878
just like I didn't want
to give five years

489
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:11,037
to a different fella yesterday,

490
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,941
15 years to another guy
the day before that.

491
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:16,563
I'm a judge,

492
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,017
and the strange thing is...

493
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,610
I don't make the rules.

494
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:25,578
So, round and round it goes.

495
00:22:28,624 --> 00:22:32,931
I know the ending
to each one of those stories.

496
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:36,681
And they haven't even been written yet.

497
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:42,220
I'm here, Mr. Hill, because
you said something yesterday,

498
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:43,595
and it stuck with me.

499
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,688
You said you were the most
disappointed man in the world.

500
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,493
And I'm here to tell you,

501
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:53,173
I fear I am a close second, Mr. Hill.

502
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,556
Because I'm the man who writes
terrible stories day after day,

503
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,267
and I can't change the endings.

504
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,423
And that, sir,

505
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,181
is a horrible... disappointment.

506
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:13,009
So, I want to see if we can find
you a different ending here.

507
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:16,188
I'm gonna take a chance on you,

508
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:18,517
get you out, get you help.

509
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:21,688
I don't expect you to be perfect.

510
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,267
I know you'll make mistakes,
just like the rest of us.

511
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:27,392
But I will ask one thing of you.

512
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,696
(QUIETLY): Yes, sir.

513
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:34,001
I want you to look at my face.

514
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,532
I want you to look at this too tired,

515
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:40,454
too old, too fat face.

516
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:43,782
Lock it in your brain.

517
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:46,993
And if you ever start heading

518
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:49,032
toward the ending I don't want to write,

519
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:52,110
I want you to picture this ugly old mug.

520
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:56,454
You picture this face,
