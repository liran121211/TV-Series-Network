You know what I thought of, the
first time I heard your name?

781
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:18,747
I thought of the expression "déjà vu."

782

a little of myself.

My whole childhood, I felt split inside.

794
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,801
There are these people
that I lived with,

795
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,973
and then there were my birth parents,
who I had never met.

796
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:03,942

I-It can quiet down so much,
I almost forget it's there,

801
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:19,122
but then, there are some times
where it's so loud,

802
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,356
I just feel alone.

803
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:24,870

But here's the thing.

807
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,012
My life turned out pretty great.

808
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,583
And it's not just my big house,

809
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,770
or my super-fine wife, all right?

810
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:50,286

amazing extended family.

813
00:37:58,453 --> 00:38:02,450
if seeing you is giving me that
sweet, sweet déjà vu feeling,

814

I think that means it's gonna
happen for you, too.

No, this is what happens.

822

She gets busted, she gets taken away,
