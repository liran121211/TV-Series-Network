You should not tweet it, no.

344
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,706
Yeah, so wha-what do you, uh...?
Do you have kids here?

345
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,921
- Are you a parent here, or...?
- Uh, fellow honoree.

346
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:58,701
- Oh.
- For my work as a plastic surgeon.

347
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,373
- Butts or boobs?
- Burn victims mostly.

348
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:03,181
- Right.
- Yeah. Skin grafts and such.

349
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,649
- Right.
- And twice a year, I go

350
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,232
to developing countries
with Operation Smile,

351
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,281
- so that kids with cleft palates...
- Mmm.

352
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:10,078
- Oh, um...
- Thank you.

353
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:13,093
- Oh.
- Yeah.

354
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,162
Someone's a little nervous
about his speech.

355
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:18,609
- Yeah.
- (KEVIN SIGHS LOUDLY)

356
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:20,671
- Uh...
- I got to give a speech?

357
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:26,429
Now, I know you think this is
a man who needs no introduction

358
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,164
but there's someone here
who begs to differ.

359
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,070
Coming out of retirement
to present Kevin

360
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:34,117
with his Distinguished Alum Award,

361
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:37,976

Duffy "The Duff" Collins.

362
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:39,899
- (APPLAUSE)
- MEN (CHANTING): Duff! Duff!

363
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,906

364
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,261

MAN: Hey, Duff!

366
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:53,765
Well, thank you for that.

367
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,125
I, uh... I had the pleasure
of coaching Kevin

368
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,773
for four yea... well,
three and a half years.

369
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:05,296
And in my career, I never saw a
kid with so much natural talent,

370
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:09,429
confidence or charisma.

371
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,829
But he caught some tough breaks

372
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:15,507
and suffered some losses.

373
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,679

<i>showed himself to be a star.</i>

(CHEERS, APPLAUSE)

375

on another path.</i>

377

378
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,523
for all you kids out there,

379
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:45,312
a living, breathing example

380
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,789
of outer and inner strength.

381
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,812
This kid is tough as hell.

382
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,281

383
00:18:56,324 --> 00:19:01,164
this little award
may not be much to you...

384

But for me, who knew you when,

385
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,273
who knew your father...

386
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,320

back here to get this award...

You're a... good man.

392

395
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm not strong.

396

Stop, don't. Don't do that. Don't.

Don't-don't... don't love me.

to love someone, love Paul here.

let's face it... a dying medium.

Or Dr. Everly, a woman who...

404

...who helps messed up kids
go out and face the world.

405
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:44,351
The truth is, I...

406
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:46,960
I'm not worthy of this award.

407
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:50,015
Or any honor, for that matter.

408
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:52,788

Can't sleep either, huh?

413

Um, just hungry,

414
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,734
and we don't have anything good to eat.

415
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:25,921
Listen, I wanted to talk to you.

416
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:27,203
Your brother,

417
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:29,906
he wants to tour this college on Friday,

418
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:32,012
and it's in D.C.

419
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:34,164
I'm-I'm probably gonna miss
your football game.

420
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:36,609
It's fine.

421
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:41,703
What happened earlier tonight...

422
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,687
how mad I got?

423
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,656
My fuse has been very short lately

424
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,382
with everything that I'm dealing with.

425
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,859
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

426
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,406
It wasn't right.

427
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:56,921
Okay.

428
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,937
What's going on with you, Kev?

429
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,359
Nothing, Dad. I just, uh...

430
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:08,304
I got to go write that letter.

431
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:39,101
Yeah, I...

432

Look, it's all just...

434
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:50,226
You know, it was just
really steep tonight, Charlie.

435
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:54,507
Yeah... No, I've... I've said it,

436
00:22:54,532 --> 00:22:56,812
uh, said it about a hundred times.

437
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,015
Yeah.

438
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,125
Yeah. Okay. I'll do it right now.

439
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:07,929

442
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:25,715
to accept the things I cannot change,

443
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,710
the courage to change the things I can,

444
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,632
and the wisdom to know the difference.

445
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:40,226
All right, so, we're gonna see
you guys after Kev's game?

446
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,429
- Yes.
- Dad, come on.

447
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,208
It's a four-hour drive.
I don't want to get there late

448
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:44,335
and make a bad impression.

449
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,396

and perfect grades.

were different lengths,

He sees his dad in the stands.

As he holds the Super Bowl
trophy, his dad's proud of him...

Yes, that's right. He loses her.

564
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:27,051
And how's he punished?

565
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:28,386

Bam, he's down again.

578
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:58,070
And he tries so hard to be strong,

579
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:01,664
and he needs painkillers
to get through it.

when you walked back
into that reception tonight.

591
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,994
I was sure you'd left your phone
or something.

592
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:56,640
And then you pointed at me

593
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,398
and said, "Let's get out of here."

594
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,531

- Yeah, no, I was there.

You were nice to me in high school.

I mean, you never knew my name,

600
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:24,858
but we'd pass in the halls,
and you'd always smile.

And once, at one of Hannah
Brubaker's summer parties,

603
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:33,992
you saw Mikey Doyle
getting a little handsy with me,

604
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:36,031
and you pulled him away.

605
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:39,851
I did that?

606
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,710

- Kev, hey.

694
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:43,622
I need you to listen to me, bud.

695
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:47,193
I would take this on for you.

696
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:50,869
Okay? I would take on this

697
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:53,333
and anything else if I could.

698
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:57,108
And I know that you've had this dream

699

for a very long time,

700
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,378
and God knows you have

701
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,348
such a beautiful talent,
but I know, in my gut,

702
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:05,779
it is not the only one that you have.

Hey. I got this

at a very hopeless time in my life.

706
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:27,724
Someone very special gave it
to me back in Vietnam.

The day you were born.

712

The moment you came out, my Number One.

713
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,630
And when I held you,

714
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,599
for the first time,

715
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,563
right here in this hospital,

716
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,561
it hit me like a bolt of lightning.

726

I left my dad's necklace.
I need to come in

Are you out of your mind?
Coming back here, you bastard?

to my father, okay?

It's from where you tore
my shirt off. I know...

Would you announce that
to more of my neighbors?
