00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,835
and I just, I couldn't leave her.

180
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,125
<i>Of course not. No.</i>

181
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,868
How about now, though?
She good? She good now?

182
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,742
She has MS, Kevin.
She's never good.

183
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,609
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

184
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:08,634
I'm just...

185
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,601
I'm tired and I'm sad,

186
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,578
and I'm gonna miss your birthday.

187
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,015
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

188
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,441
I wanted to be with you.

189
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,646
I wanted to be in L.A.,

190
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,734
and I wanted to see Kardashians.

191
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,721
Well, I was gonna take you to the

192
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:22,883
place where they get their smoothies.

193
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:24,908
Oh, stop. You're killing me.

194
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,085
Did I ruin your birthday?

195
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,484
No, of course not.
It's not ruined.

196
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,882
The crew got me this cake.

197
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:33,257
A cake with my face on it.

198
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,820
<i>Kind of cool.</i>

199
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,757
Well, I should get back to her.

200
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:39,484
I'm so sorry, Kevin.

201
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:41,448
Well, listen, the Kardashians
aren't going anywhere.

202
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:43,648
- Promise?
- I promise. They're like gremlins.

203
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,633
By next week, there'll be,
like, a bazillion more of 'em.

204
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:46,750
(laughs)

205
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:47,775
Okay.

206
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:49,601
I love you.

207
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:50,726
I love you.

208
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,104
Yeah, I... yeah, I c... I can't.

209
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,992
- Ready.
- KATE: Okay.

210
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,734
If you don't think this looks good,

211
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,953
you <i>have</i> to tell me.

212
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,656
Now, the perfect situation
for any man to be in.

213
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:07,593
Okay, you can look.

214
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,695
Schwing.

215
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:12,242
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

216
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,265
They might not even ask you to sing.

217
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,429
I'm serious.

218
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,578
If that outfit has
anything to say about it,

219
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:21,273
you are absolutely going to be
the new lead female singer

220
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:23,750
of Yelp's 17th best
reviewed wedding band

221
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:24,976
in Southern California.

222
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:28,210
- Well, I am down two sizes.
- I know. And it shows.

223
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:30,695
You think you're so cute.

224
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,164
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And you are.

225
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,695
You actually look like
a young Bruce Willis.

226
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,859
Don't do that.

227
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:38,132
You cannot tell a man
who went bald at 25

228
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,657
that he looks like a
young Bruce Willis.

229
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,156
- It's too much.
- No.

230
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:44,968
Do you know what the...
sexiest thing about you is?

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,093
Yeah, my calves.

232
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,118
- Mm-mm.
- Oh.

233
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,093
The sexiest thing about you

234
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,687
is how sexy you make me feel.

235
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:52,912
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I see.

236
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,179
- Oh.
- (chuckles)

237
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:55,968
- Kate?
- Oh, no!

238
00:09:56,593 --> 00:09:59,570
- Hey.
- Hey. Birthday girl.

239
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:01,883
Birthday boy. Where's Sophie?

240
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:02,984
Canceled. Mom.

241
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:03,851
- M.S.?
- Yeah.

242
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:05,687
- You? Want to talk?
- Disappointed. No.

243
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:06,750
BOTH: Happy birthday.

244
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,992
I love it when you guys
talk twin in front of me.

245
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey, Kevbo.

246
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,659
- Yep?
- Since Sophie is bailing,

247
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,384
does that mean... that we're gonna have

248
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:14,960
to cancel the double date tonight?

249
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,046
- (laughs)
- No.

250
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,040
- You... It's still our birthdays, Toby.
- It's still our birthday.

251
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:22,398
My God, give me a break.

252
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,876
By the way, you're
gonna love this place.

253
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,512
It's, like, the number
one joint in town, okay?

254
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,868
I had to pull strings like frickin'
Geppetto just to get in there.

255
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,602
- That's a Pinocchio reference.
- Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,860
Geppetto was a woodworker.

257
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,679
Wasn't a...
Never mind.

258
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:35,593
Let's take a look

259
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,719
- at the outfit. I want to see.
- Yes. What do you think?

260
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:38,717
- It's great. I mean, you look...
- Yeah?

261
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:39,654
Yeah, you're beautiful.

262
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,984
The only thing is, are
you trying too hard?

263
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,204
- It's just a question I had.
- No.

264
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,773
I don't know. You don't want to be

265
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:45,876
the girl in the room
that's trying too hard.

266
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,369
- Yeah.
- Uh, we like the outfit, so...

267
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:50,328
Okay, I have a backup.

268
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:52,721
- What? I wanted... I wanted...
- Come help me, please.

269
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:54,188
KEVIN: I'll be right back. Gonna
help her with this real quick.

270
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:57,320
So glad I gave you that extra key
in case of emergencies, Kev.

271
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,696
The key was for emergencies!

272
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,820
And the she says she's too
disappointed to talk.

273
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,375
She says, "Soon.
We'll talk soon."

274
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,734
And then she just...

275
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:12,539
leaves.

276
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:14,500
Oof.

277
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,500
"Oof."

278
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,148
That's what I get?

279
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:20,876
You're supposed to be
a guy who says things,

280
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,321
and-and I get "Oof."

281
00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:23,367
(chuckles)

282
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,921
You make each other better.

283
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:29,835
You're gonna be fine.

284
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,031
Yeah, she's gonna call.

285
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:33,789
- 'Course.
- Today.

286
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:36,282
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that phone is gonna ring,

287
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,882
and I'm gonna be home before tonight.

288
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:41,953
We've got some things
to work on, yeah, sure,

289
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:44,335
of course, but... it's okay.

290
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,992
Hey, no sheets.

291
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,773
Look... sheets are for long-term guests.

292
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,165
I'm not a long-term guest.

293
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:52,226
Okay.

294
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,101
Hey, look, I'm gonna
pop into the office,

295
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,468
get a jump on the week.

296
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:57,585
Why don't you come?

297
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,914
It'll take your mind off things.

298
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,687
Nah, I just want to be alone.

299
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,726
- Okay.
- Yeah.

300
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,429
It's all yours, man.

301
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:09,890
Hey. Thanks.

302
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:11,421
For saying the thing.

303
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:14,789
Sorry about the "Oof."

304
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:15,984
(chuckles softly)

305
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,023
She's gonna call.

306
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:34,835
(sighs)

307
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,203
(food crunching quietly)

308
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,804
So... how was the party? Hmmm?

309
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:46,578
(food crunching)

310
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,656
- (dishes clack loudly)
- What the hell?

311
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,359
- We're gonna go to the movies.
- KATE: I don't want to...

312
00:12:58,383 --> 00:12:59,726
We're gonna go to the movies.

313
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,687
We're gonna go see
the one with Tom Hanks

314
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,379
at the dollar theater,
and we're gonna...

315
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,758
give ourselves over to Tom Hanks
and he's gonna make us feel

316
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:08,351
so much better about the
mind-blowingly upsetting crap

317
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:09,554
that's going on in our heads.

318
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,992
Yeah? Great.

319
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:12,226
It's gonna be fun.

320
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:15,851
WOMAN: Now, obviously, what
makes private adoption unique

321
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,328
is that you are paired
with an expectant mother

322
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:19,539
who has already committed

323
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,704
- to put her newborn up for adoption.
- That's perfect.

324
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:23,929
I was a newborn myself
when my parents found me.

325
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,304
It's perfect. Right?

326
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:29,125
It's common in these situations

327
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,359
for one spouse to be the dragger
and one to be the drag-ee.

328
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,153
It's important to communicate,

329
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:35,515
because... fair warning...

330
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,508
this process will really
get up in your business.

331
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,766
"Get up in there."

332
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,539
That's what she said.

333
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:43,164
- Uh...
- Fingerprints, background checks.

334
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:44,950
We'll be interviewing
both your daughters

335
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,290
to get a sense of their feelings.

336
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:47,700
We haven't told the girls yet,

337
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:48,867
but they're gonna love it.

338
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,789
- A little brother...
- Or little sister.

339
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,328
Or brother. Hey, is that
something we can request?

340
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,296
I mean, I love me some
headstrong sisters,

341
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,646
but they run pretty deep in my
house, if you know what I'm saying.

342
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,771
He wants a boy.

343
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,367
He wants to adopt a little boy,

344
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:02,296
because he was a little boy
when he was adopted.

345
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,632
Yeah. I mean, I guess that's part of it.

346
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,757
He wants to honor
his two fathers by replicating

347
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:08,773
the exact same situation he had.

348
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:10,235
Well, I don't know if I
would put it that...

349
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,868
Hey, Mary, let me ask you.
You have any kids

350
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,757
laying around that were
left at a fire station?

351
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,265
'Cause that might really
scratch my husband's itch.

352
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:25,757
- (door opens, closes)
- (clears throat)

353
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:30,515
Well, as you can see, we're not
afraid of honest, open communication.

354
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,859
RANDALL: Are you fake smoking?

355
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:39,976
Yes.

356
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,843
(exhales)

357
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,351
Do you not want to adopt?

358
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,953
- Does it matter what I want?
- Hey.

359
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:00,164
We only ever talk
about what you want, Randall.

360
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,242
You want to adopt.

361
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,062
You want to honor your fathers.

362
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:06,593
I know this has been
a weird year for you,

363
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:08,385
and I am trying to be supportive,

364
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,744
but this is becoming, like...

365
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,195
a weird pattern.

366
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,375
Okay, I hear you.

367
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:15,476
We're partners, in everything.

368
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:18,578
But 37 years ago, my parents chose me,

369
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,734
and that's why I'm here
with you right now.

370
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,273
This isn't going away for me, Beth.

371
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,328
You need to get your head around it.

372
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:34,992
Hey... Beth.

373
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,656
No. I'm not throwing down with
you in an adoption parking lot.

374
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,445

- Uh-huh.

We're gonna be here into the night.

385
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:04,601
It may seem like overkill, but this is

386
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:05,765
a big opportunity.

387
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,968

(indistinct chatter, laughter)

396
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,352
REBECCA (in distance): I have no life.

397
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,719
- I am a freakin' ghost!
JACK: Oh, you know? That is...

398
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:59,843
- No, no, no, no.
- Admit to me

399
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,210
that you hated the fact that

400
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:02,921
I had something happening for myself.

401
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,108
JACK: I hated that you lied about
working with your ex-boyfriend.

402
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,842
No, that's total BS, Jack.
You hated the fact

403
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,678
- that I was singing again.
- I was fine with it!

404
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,461
- No, you didn't want me to
have a career. - Career?

405
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:14,062
You are a 40-year-old woman
singing covers in pubs!

406
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,898
That is not a career, Rebecca!

407
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:17,101
That is ridiculous!

408
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,070
- Want some?
- Sure.

409
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:26,617
Thank you.

410
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,203
I think Randall's finally
gonna make his move.

411
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,661
What's wrong?

412
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,171
Are you kidding me?

413
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:40,944
Mmm.

414
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:41,960
Could I have some, too?

415
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:42,951
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

416
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,890
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mommy.

417
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,859
Ooh. Happy birthday.

418
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:48,215
- Right there.
- Mmm.

419
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:53,226
Beth's struggling with the adoption.

420
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,289
I thought that she was on board.

421
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,437
- Yeah, I did, too.
- Oh.

422
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:00,031
How did you guys decide?

423
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,587
With me.

424
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,507
There was nothing to decide...
the moment we saw you...

425
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:06,445
You knew.

426
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:07,898
That's a hell of a story, Ma.

427
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:09,000
One of my favorites.

428
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,640
I know you guys didn't have
a perfect marriage.

429
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,476
You'd just lost a child,
and you both just wanted me?

430
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,421
Right away? Just like that?

431
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,789
(sighs)

432
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:27,984
It's complicated.

433
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,445
That's something people say
when they don't want to tell the truth.

434
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,937
♪ Ah, ah ♪

435

That little guy, right there.

440
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:03,585
He wound up here.

441
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:08,434
Exact same place, exact same day.

442
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,664
(muted crying of babies)

443
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:13,789
Just... look at him, Bec.

444
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,515
Placed right there, right next to ours.

445
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,507
Can't you just feel it?

446
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,726
You know, can't you just... see it?

447
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,640
REBECCA: <i>I said no.</i>

448
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:33,984
<i>But your father was so sure.</i>

449
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,203
<i>I was tired and I was grievin,</i>

450
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,632
<i>and he just kept pushing me.</i>

451
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:43,078
(whispers): He was so determined
that you were meant to be.

452
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:45,140
Meant to be ours.

453
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:50,335
<i>Sometimes, in marriage,</i>

454
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:53,914
<i>someone has to be the one
to push to make the big moves.</i>

455
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:57,898
And oftentimes in our marriage,
<i>yes, it was your father.</i>

456
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:00,781
<i>(Rebecca sighs)</i>

457
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,890
Our marriage wasn't perfect, it's true.

458
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,546
But none are.

459
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,953
And your father wasn't perfect, either.

460
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,914
But he was pretty damn close.

461
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:14,585
As close as they come.

462
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:21,906
He pushed... a stranger on me.

463
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:25,835
And that stranger became my child.

464
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,570
And that child became my life.

465
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,257
He became you.

466
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:34,789
(sighs)

467
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,179
Road tripping to Memphis
like teenagers.

468
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:57,804
You're gonna be the
death of me, old man.

469
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,453
I can get a bit bullheaded
when I want something bad.

470
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,973
Don't think that I ever
thanked you for taking me in.

471
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:09,601
Oh, you definitely did not.

472
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:15,570
You know he brought you home
without even asking me?

473
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,632
First you.

474
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:20,164
Then his brother.

475
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:24,039
He wanted something and then he just...

476
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:25,804
went ahead and did it.

477
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,099
Bullheaded.

478
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,789
Like father, like son.

479
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:31,640
Well, I'll take that compliment.

480
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,851
Take that compliment any day.

481
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,953
Didn't turn out so bad, though, huh?

482
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,921
Things that he pushed on you?

483
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,554
No, you're all right, old man.

484
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,149
Could have done without
the Manny in my basement

485
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:52,053
- for a year, but you're all right.
- (laughing)

486
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:55,851
So you like my spot, huh?

487
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,531
Yeah, I do.

488
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:00,593
I like to come here.

489
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:02,234
Reminds me of home.

490
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:05,679
Reminds me of me.

491
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:07,968
A little less fancy
than your neighborhood.

492
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,000
A little less white.

493
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,679
(chuckling): Yeah, there's that, too.

494
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:13,476
(coughing)

495
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,402
TOBY: <i>Come on, you've got
to give me something.</i>

496
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:23,194
Did any of the other girls sing Sinead?

497
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:24,430
What did they say when you were done?

498
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:25,621
Come on, I have been

499
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,976
on the edge of my seat all day.

500
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,304
I don't know, it was just

501
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:32,085
regular audition stuff.

502
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,046
- Wow.
- Okay.

503
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:38,398
Oh, my God.

504
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,849
(soothing instrumental music playing)

505
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:41,632
Um, excuse me.

506
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:42,929
Is this the, uh...

507
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:44,727
is this the hottest restaurant in town?

508
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:45,782
I bought the whole place out.

509
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:46,953
It's a birthday dinner.

510
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:48,671
- Come on.
- This is nice.

511
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:49,882
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

512
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:51,726
Yeah. Okay, wait,
do you want your sister

513
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:53,281
to sit across from you, next to you,

514
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:54,466
or just straight in your lap?

515
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,234
Across from me is fine.

516
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,218
- Sorry.
- Sit down.

517
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,023
That gentleman right there,
that is Aito.

518
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:00,968
He is a genius.

519
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,757
He's from <i>Top Chef, or Iron Chef,</i>

520
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:04,335
or <i>Amazing Race.</i>

521
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,428
You are a TV star, Aito!

522
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,179
The guy loves me.

523
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,585
- Oh, wow, look at that.
- Thank you.

524
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:12,244
Oh, there's a... a wine for every fish.

525
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,265
- (Kevin laughs)
- Okay, I'd like to make a toast.

526
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,945
- Yep.
- To the birthday girl.

527
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:18,398
- And the birthday boy.
- Thank you.

528
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:19,835
Yeah.

529
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,296
I would just like to say

530
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,351
that I am very proud of you.

531
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:25,617
So, cheers.

532
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,875
You know what, Tobe?
I actually didn't go

533
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,181
to the audition... I bailed
before I even got in the room.

534
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,250
What? Why, after all
that hard work?

535
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,523
I know. Believe me, I felt

536
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:39,070
the same way when she told me earlier.

537
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,250
- When she...
- But... yeah.

538
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,399
But let me tell you, you don't know

539
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:42,612
what it's like being in those rooms

540
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:44,683
Man, it's horrible. You know how
many times I've walked into a room

541
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:46,863
and I wanted to bail when I saw
James Marsden ready to read?

542
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:48,479
Wow. Really?

543
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,873
You told...

544
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,737
Okay, wow. Um...

545
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,581
Toby... Toby.

546
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:14,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

547
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,253
(sighs)

548
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:22,714
Went to see my mom.

549
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,682
Okay.

550
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:29,120
You know she didn't want
to adopt me at first?

551
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:31,940
My father pushed.

552
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:38,448
I love my parents.

553
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,034
I loved them together.

554
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,815
But I don't want to be them.

555
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,962
My mother said there's no such thing

556
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:50,565
as a perfect marriage.

557
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,417
But on that, I have to
disagree with my mother.

558
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,518
I didn't think that was allowed.

559
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,018
Today I'm allowing it.

560
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,378
Because we're perfect, Beth.

561
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:03,997
And I know this, you see,
because I'm a perfectionist.

562
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:06,156
So that's kind of my bag, you know?

563
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:08,948
Been chasing after it my entire life.

564
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,346
Perfection.

565
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:17,745
And I fail... and I
fail, and I fail and...

566
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,143
the failure leads to self-doubt

567
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:23,182
and self-loathing, and it's all...

568
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:24,964
And all this other crap I got

569
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:26,698
muddled up inside here.

570
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,206
But when it comes to you and me...

571
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:33,476
baby, there ain't nothing muddled there.

572
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:38,167
We are perfect together.

573
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:43,706
We are perfectly imperfect.

574
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,909
And I didn't even know that was a thing.

575
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:49,143
You see, we don't follow
one another, Beth.

576
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,831
We don't push our own
plans on each other.

577
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:55,503
We adjust our plans together.

578
00:25:57,735 --> 00:25:59,651
And if I can't adjust to you, then...

579
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,706
...then I have to figure out
another way to do this.

580
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,589
I'll volunteer somewhere,

581
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:08,281
I'll... Yes, ma'am?

582
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:11,651
Can I take you somewhere?

583
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:13,253
Where?

584
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:16,104
I want to adjust your perfect plan.

585
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:22,471
Is it "perfectly imperfect"?

586
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:23,863
- Right?
- Yeah.

587
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:24,909
I like that.

588
00:26:25,236 --> 00:26:26,236
(Randall chuckles)

589
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,409
- We open at 8:00.
- I was just...

590
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:49,743
You know, my wife, she sang
here a few months back.

591
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:51,057
Rebecca Pearson?

592
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:52,779
She sang with a jazz band?

593
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,615
Brunette. She's a knockout.

594
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:58,628
Good for her. We open at 8:00.

595
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:04,456
The thing is, she's not
with the band anymore.

596
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:07,128
She's going solo, and I
thought maybe you'd...

597
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:10,112
you'd like to book her for a solo gig,

598
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,534
considering how well she did
the first time around.

599
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:15,081
Is this for real?

600
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:16,872
Are you for real right now?

601
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:19,196
Look, come on, I could pay you.

602
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:21,741
I'll pay you to give her a monthly gig.

603
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:23,089
You know, just... once a month.

604
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:25,194
- You know, something that...
- Hey, hey, hey, pal...

605
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:28,182
you're embarrassing
yourself and your wife.

606
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,370
We're booked months in advance,

607
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:32,930
we don't do solo acts,
I've got nothing for you.

608
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:34,706
♪ You've been down ♪

609
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:39,003

(sighs)

617
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,515
- Dude, just...
- Come on, hey, listen, man.

618
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:05,214
She didn't want to disappoint you.

619
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,026
Do you understand? And, hey, listen,

620
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:08,542
I know I overdid it with the dinner.

621
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,042
My fault, okay, but I was trying

622
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,199
to take her mind off of the audition.

623
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,011
That is not your job, Kevin.

624
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:15,917
That's the point, it's
not your job, okay?

625
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:17,620
I-I... She's going to be my wife.

626
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:19,870
I'm supposed to be her person.

627
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:21,886
Not you. All right?
I'm the one who's supposed

628
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:23,812
to cheer her up,
I'm the one who's supposed

629
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,362
to buy her birthday dinner.

630
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,479
Then buy the dinner!

631
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,871
- Split the dinner with me.
- I can't...

632
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:29,042
I can't afford this crap!

633
00:28:29,737 --> 00:28:33,362
Okay? And I hate that you pay for
meals while we're out, every time.

634
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:35,714
What is that? You're
not her father, Kev.

635
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:36,870
And you're not her husband.

636
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:39,301
Okay, stop right there. Do not tell me
how to take care of my sister.

637
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,144
I've been taking care of her
for a really long time.

638
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:42,605
Yeah, and how well is that
working out for her?

639
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:43,824
Just fine, thank you vey much.

640
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,387
Yeah? She doesn't need to be
coddled. She needs to be pushed.

641
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:47,823
Stop it! Both of you.

642
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:51,753
I'm a 37-year-old woman.

643
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,557
And I shouldn't need
to be pushed or coddled.

644
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,070
Not by a man, not by a husband,

645
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:02,096
not by a brother, not by anyone.

646
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:07,155
I don't even know what
you're saying right now.

647
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:08,784
- Just...
- Ugh...

648
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:09,910
Where are you going?

649
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:11,221
Back to the audition

650
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:13,175
to wipe the floor with those bitches.

651
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,643
That's where I'm going.
And don't follow me.

652
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,761
Well, you heard her, so...

653
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:21,479
Don't do it.

654
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:24,268
- Don't...
- I'm...

655
00:29:25,174 --> 00:29:26,174
Don't, do...

656
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:27,815
Man, she's my ride.

657
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,159
You have to give me a ride.

658
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,800
Come on, get in the car. Get...

659
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,604
How do you... I don't even...

660
00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:34,764
You reach under the thing, and you...

661
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:38,081
Happy birthday.

662
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:40,745
Thank you.

663
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:44,831
I had it bound for you.

664
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:52,917
This was his favorite spot.

665
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,651
I've been coming here almost every day,

666
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:03,448
trying to figure out how I can
give you what you want.

667
00:30:06,144 --> 00:30:07,948
Trying to wrap my head around it.

668
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:13,167
And I know you have
this notion in your mind,

669
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:17,198
this notion of a perfect little newborn

670
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:19,224
that we could shape
and mold from scratch,

671
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:20,698
like Play-Doh, but...

672
00:30:21,974 --> 00:30:24,065
Randall, if we're really gonna do this,

673
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:27,003
I think this is the way.

674
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:33,846
Your parents did
something wonderful for you.

675
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:36,974
And because of that,
you had a wonderful life.

676
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,221
But things could have been
very different for you.

677
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,925
That could have been you.

678
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,315
If you really want
to do this, if you really want

679
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,136
to risk our perfectly imperfect
life for something,

680
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:56,417
let's go all the way.

681
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,453
Let's take in an older kid

682
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:02,401
who no one else in the
whole damn world is gonna help.

683
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:18,988
Oh, sorry we're all done.

684
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:20,448
You have to let me audition.

685
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,471
I can do any song on your list.

686
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:26,706
I was here before, but I lost
my nerve, and I'm a singer.

687
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,171
Well, I used to be more of one
when I was kid, but...

688
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:30,589
Fine. Which song?

689
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,150
- "Nothing Compares 2 U."
- Let's go.

690
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:35,339
All right, guys,
one more: "Nothing Compares 2 U."

691
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,026
Uh, I was also thinking

692
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,451
- that I could just...
- Two, three,

693
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:40,487
four.

694
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:41,712
(music begins playing)

695
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:43,584

Okay.

701
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:09,385
- Talk to you tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

702
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:16,207
(quietly): No.

703
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:17,749
No.

704
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:19,781
You will not dismiss me like that.

705
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,282
And you will not dismiss me

706
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:23,318
because I don't look
like that girl up there.

707
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:25,020
I know I'm not what you imagined,

708
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:27,222
but I will not walk out
of this room and allow you

709
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:29,290
to just give this gig
to a lesser singer

710
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:30,932
because she's a size two.

711
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:33,128
Because I've been living
versions of that story

712
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:36,182
my entire life, and I
can't do it anymore.

713
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,096
And I won't do it anymore.

714
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:47,479
Amber.

715
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:49,081
"Nothing Compares 2 U."

716
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:54,432

722
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,768
That's Amber.

723
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,151
She's our backup singer.

724
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,792
She was our lead singer,

725
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:20,777
but we demoted her because
she wasn't good enough.

726
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:23,721
Your pitch is good, but
your range is limited

727
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:26,112
and your falsetto blows;
You're out of practice, right?

728
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,816
You can't waltz in here
and compete with girls

729
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,621
who have been honing their
craft at open mic nights

730
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:30,932
since they were 16 years old.

731
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:33,157
I-I don't care what dress size you wear.

732
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:35,112
It's... you're not good enough, honey.

733
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:42,682
Toby, she was the one
that told me my father had died.

734
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:46,151
Uh, 17 years old, she had to be
the one to tell me that.

735
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:50,556
She's not just my sister, Toby.

736
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:52,182
I'm not just her brother, we...

737
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:56,026
We've walked side-by-side
through an entire life together,

738
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:58,432
and these things
that we've experienced are...

739
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:00,401
you know.

740
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:07,104
I'm not that good an actor.

741
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,432
Uh, I'm not, I'm not-I'm not

742
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:13,273
really that good at anything,
to be honest with you.

743
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:15,690
Uh, I'm always the guy in
the room trying the hardest.

744
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:18,643
(clears throat)

745
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:22,339
Being her brother, I...

746
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,948
I never had to try to be good at that,

747
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:27,261
you know? So...

748
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:31,550
I can't just cut the cord that quickly

749
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,425
'cause she met this amazing guy.

750
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,317
I know.

751
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:43,534
I do need you to stretch
it a little bit.

752
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:47,018
I know.

753
00:34:48,244 --> 00:34:49,245
(door opens)

754
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,143
Yeah.

755
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:54,615
That did not go well.

756
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,182
- Oh.
- No, no, no, it's okay,

757
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:59,909
because it wasn't about
my weight or my age,

758
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:01,648
it was about my lack of ability.

759
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:03,932
Which is fantastic.
'Cause I can do this.

760
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,839
I know I can do this.

761
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:09,557
Just gonna have to work my way up.

762
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:10,971
Hmm.

763
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:12,196
Well.

764
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,487
But, ooh, I need a drink.

765
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,104
Does anyone want a nightcap?

766
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,807
I... I'm-I got an early call.

767
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,620
So I'm gonna bail on the drink.

768
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:20,645
Okay.

769
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,839
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

770
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:25,398
And, uh, I'll let you take it from here.

771
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:28,237
Drink?

772
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:36,526
WILLIAM: <i>And now, an addendum
to my earlier advice,</i>

773
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:39,628
<i>if I'm so lucky
as to still have your ear.</i>

774
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,573
<i>I loved you, I lost you.</i>

775
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:47,893
<i>And I advise you, 'twas better</i>

776
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:51,073
<i>than to never having had loved at all.</i>

777
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,393
(both laugh)

778
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:57,956
WILLIAM:
<i>But now, with more years,</i>

779
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:00,351
<i>with more time, more perspective,</i>

780
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:03,050
<i>I see things in a slightly new way.</i>

781
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:06,659
<i>So here, my good son,
is a father's advice,</i>

782
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,393
<i>updated and recalled.</i>

783
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,190
<i>It's better to have
loved and lost, surely...</i>

784
00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:13,589
(speaking indistinctly)

785
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:17,073
<i>...but try not to lose it at all.</i>

786
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:18,175
Jack?

787
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,612
- (knocking continues) Hey, Jack?

788
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,261
Hi.

789
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,987
Hi.

790
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:33,721
So, I was trying to remember
myself tonight, Jack.

791
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:37,385
The person I used to be.

792
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,526
And then I started remembering you, too.

793
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:45,096
And I'm not the only one
who gave up on my dreams, Jack.

794
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,026
We both did, right?

795
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:51,487
And we, we realized
an even bigger dream,

796
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:52,940
an even more massive dream.

797
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:56,253
And I'm... I'm still really upset,

798
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,854
and I don't think I'm ready
to talk about any of that yet.

799
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:59,925
But...

800
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,242
I shouldn't have let you leave.

801
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,535
And not just because of all of
the beautiful things you said,

802
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,362
I shouldn't have let you leave
because that's not what we do.

803
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:14,651
That's not who we are, that's not us.

804
00:37:14,714 --> 00:37:16,348
I know that, that's not us.

805
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:19,151
I know that I'm not deeply unhappy,

806
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:21,581
and I'm not unfulfilled,
and you're not an alcoholic,

807
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,773
and you're not your father.

808
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:24,409
And even when I watch Tom Hanks,

809
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:26,128
I sit there and I think to myself,

810
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:27,706
"He's not so great."

811
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:29,104
And who does that?

812
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:31,112
Who watches Tom Hanks and thinks,

813
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:32,887
"You know what? I'm married to
a man that's better than that."

814
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:36,503
Bec, you don't know everything about me.

815
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,339
- Yes, I do.
- No.

816
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:40,777
- I know everything about you.
- Rebecca, you don't know...

817
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,050
I'm drunk right now.

818
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,307
I have been drunk all day.

819
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:50,651
I have been drunk for weeks.

820
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:56,190
And I thought I had it under
control, like the first time, but...

821
00:37:57,783 --> 00:38:00,550
I have a problem, Rebecca.

822
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,948
And I've hidden it from you

823
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,190
for a very long time.

824
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:13,057
And I've-I've hidden it from our kids.

825
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,089
And I need to get a handle on it

826
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:19,768
before I can walk back into that house.

827
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:27,307
And I'm sorry,

828
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:29,544
baby, I...

829
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,479
...I am very embarrassed.

830
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:38,667
And I am very sorry.

831
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:45,448
But I need to fix this on my own.

832
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:48,745
(Jack inhales, exhales)

833
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:11,339

(knocking on door)

835
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:22,932
Get in the car.

836
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:26,917
Get in the car, Jack.

837
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:32,464
You are my husband, and I am your wife,

838
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:36,425
and if you have a problem,
we will fix it together.

839
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:41,151
I just need you to get in the car.

840
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,221
So we can go home.

(sniffles)
- (quietly): Come on.

842
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:50,706
Come on, baby.

843
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:51,801
Okay.

844
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:53,596

you to get in the car.

It was not easy.
