for partner at his firm.

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,300

I was in the bathroom,

11

12
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,971

Kev, wh-what's going on right now?

She's gonna ask Billy Palmer

to go through
the haunted house with her,

324
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:57,404

he might hold her hand.

325

She has a crush on him.

326

It's ridiculous

He's almost as popular as me,

329

00:34:59,194 --> 00:35:00,497
Right? In L.A.

790
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:03,653
I'm telling you, it's all
happening for us, you know?

791
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:06,130
- It is.
- Happening for us in the 20s.

792
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:07,083
Mm-hmm.

793
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:09,911
- Crushing the 20s.
- Crushing the 20s.

794
00:35:11,056 --> 00:35:12,489
- Bam.
- Mmm.

795
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:23,341
I haven't had an audition
in, like, six months.

796
00:35:24,384 --> 00:35:25,919
The new guy is married.

797
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,896
Real... oh.

798
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,505
Thanks.

799
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:34,528
- Have a little more?
- Okay.

800
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,676
Married, huh?

801
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:41,575
Yeah. But he's nice,

802
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,926
which makes it harder.

803
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:44,888
He asks questions.

804
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,403
- He knows my class schedule.
- I mean, come on,

805
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:49,684
that's, you know, that's-that's a...
that's a low bar.

806
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:57,551
You really haven't had
an audition in six months?

807
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:00,801
No, it's been more
like a year, actually.

808
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:05,911
Where are you at?
I mean, what are you...

809
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:08,684
You still sitting in your car,
eating fast food,

810
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,473
staring at where the house used to be?

811
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:15,231
He's gone.

812
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:18,387
Okay? And he's not coming back,

813
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:21,333
and even if you sit there
in the exact same spot

814
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,231
that you were when he left, he's not...

815
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:25,395
coming back.

816
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,723
I know.

817
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:32,520
And he wouldn't want you to stay.

818
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:36,184
Not if there was nothing for you there.

819
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,762
You know what he'd want for you?

820
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,419
Hmm?

821
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:43,036
Everything.

822
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:46,426
Yeah, for you, too.

823
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:56,203
You know, maybe I'll take
an acting class. I know it's...

824
00:36:56,776 --> 00:37:00,145
Or join a crappy improv troupe.
I guess I could do that.

825
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,071
That's the spirit. Yes.

826
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,770
I bet you're hilarious.

827
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:06,372
- I'm probably a pretty funny guy.

I've been here before, Tess.

You think that you're at the

859
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:04,372
But you also began a long time ago.

860
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:05,926
Do you know that?

861
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:08,301
'Cause I was there,

862
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:12,137

And we lost a baby,

866
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:23,294
and we thought it was an ending, but...

867
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:26,137

And life has a middle, too,

877

and middles can be the
hardest because...

878
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,887
that's when you can get really lost.
