A handyman with triplets.

He's a construction foreman,

Not well enough.

- I promise you,

49
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:47,223
kiddo, in the history of chicken pox,

50
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:48,514
no one's ever died.

51
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,873
- Well, ac...
- REBECCA: Okay.

52
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,671
Yeah. I have sick kids. Mm-hmm.

53
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,578
Mom, I got to go. Okay, bye.

54
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:56,874
I had them when I was three.
And my mother is exhausting.

55
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,959
Good. Since you both had it,

56
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,391
you don't need to worry
about getting sick again.

57
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:02,828
Which is a relief, because
it's much worse as an adult.

58
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:05,335
Now, Randall doesn't have a fever

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,328

That's an excellent thing, sir.

62

00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:51,085
I could do your hair,
too, Deja, if you want.

77
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:53,118
Picked up some new barrettes.

78
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:54,742
Fun jewel tones.

79
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:57,022

I never pull too hard.

00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:12,554
See you in a bit.

87
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:19,046
I don't know what to do.

88
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:21,017
I've changed Annie's hairstyle
four times this week

89
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,282
just to make hair care look cool.

90
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,937
As cute as those Afro puffs were,

91
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:25,593
Deja's not taking the hint.

92
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,250
It's been two weeks.
She has to wash that hair.

93
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,743
Well, she's testing her boundaries.

94
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:31,875
Trying to push us away.
We knew this might happen.

95
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,085

96
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,398
I think we have to have a real
sit-down talk about this.

97
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:39,292
Look, she already
doesn't like it here, Beth.

98
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,843
You think telling her,
"Hey, we all had a little chat

99
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,672
and agreed your hair is funky,"
is gonna make her feel welcome?

100
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,375
Yeah, 'cause that's the
way I would say it.

101
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,562
Come on, Randall.

102
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,740
It's a hygiene issue.
We have to address it.

103
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,109
I know, but I...

104
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,391

you got to be the lead parent...

105
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:54,867

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,127

sitting in that office,

107
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,235
talking about weather patterns.

108
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:00,484
But now you're working full-time
and looking damn fine

109
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,273
- in those suede heels, might I add.
- I know.

110
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:03,343
I know you do.

111
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:05,875

112
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,980
and she still goes to you first
for the boo-boo kiss.

113
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:11,281

conversation right now

114
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,734
about the order of
Annie's boo-boo kisses?

115
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,570
May I take the lead here? Please?

116
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,835
I just want her to feel
like she fits in first

117
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,601
before we say something
that may alienate her even more.

118
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:24,515
And who knows?

119
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,986
Maybe when she's more
comfortable with us,

120
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,644
she may want to wash it herself.

121
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,437
All right.

122
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:32,835
She better get comfortable quick,

00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:52,258
- before you...
- (laughs) Yeah. No.

176
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,289
Seriously.

177
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:55,453
All right.

178
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,695
- Kevin. Oh, my God.
- I know.

179
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,171
Listen, it-it... This looks
a lot worse than it actually is.

180
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,735
You know, I got
a little banged up in that scene

181
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,079
I did with Stallone, but I'm-I'm fine.

182
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:05,920
Why do you think we have

183
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:07,073
- a medic on the set?
- No, I know.

184
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:08,188
- I didn't want to slow down production.
- There's a reason.

185
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:09,274
- You know, 'cause... See?
- Uh, hey.

186
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,914
Can you find Delaney
for me right away...

187
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,836
- No. Brian.
- So I can go over today's schedule?

188
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,305
Brian, I'm the king of powering
through things like this.

189
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,414
K-Kevin, I wasn't asking.
I wasn't asking.

190
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,973
Ow. They really hurt, Dad.

191
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,284
Yeah, I know you're suffering, pal,

192
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,948
but your sister, she's
got the same thing,

193
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,560
and she's handling it like a champ.

194
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:27,447
- So?
- So, I-I'm thinking you'll feel better

195
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,664
if you toughen up a bit.

196
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:29,782
I'm gonna go ahead and run you guys

197
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:31,193
an oatmeal bath here in a bit,

198
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,186
- all right?
- Randall, what are you doing?

199
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,364
Yeah, what are you wearing, bud?

200
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,976
It's 20 degrees out.

201
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,558
I'm exposing myself to chicken
pox like Dr. Grader said.

202
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,503
- I need to get it and get it over with
- (doorbell rings)

203
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,235
- before the science fair.
- No, you're gonna get frostbite

204
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,156
or pneumonia, all right?
So just go upstairs

205
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,181
and put your jams on.

206
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,171
- (sighs)
- Mom?

207
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:48,469
Oh, you sounded so

208
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:50,536
- overwhelmed on the phone.
- What? Hi.

209
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,390
I thought, she needs an extra hand
to help with those sick kids.

210
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:56,039
Thank God I made it in before
it started really coming down.

211
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,953
- Aw, you poor things.
- (sighs)

212
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,945
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi.

213
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,936
Would you mind getting my stuff

214
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,079
- out of the car?
- (Rebecca sighs)

215
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:03,031
You know, and you might
need to salt that walkway

216
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,219
while you're out there, 'cause
I almost slipped, broke my neck.

217
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,110
- (mouthing)
- Oh, for God's sakes.

218
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,203
It's the middle of winter.

219
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,828
Where are Randall's clothes?

synced and corrected by susinz

221
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,890
So, what are we looking at here, Dr Lo?

222
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,609
You have a large tear in your meniscus.

223
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,278
It's likely it was slightly damaged

224
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:32,570
when you fractured your
knee, which was...

225
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,416
Uh, I fractured my knee
about 20 years ago.

226
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,688
It's been pretty fine since then.

227
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,210
Until two weeks ago.

228
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,796
I'm assuming you've been in
quite a bit of pain since then.

229
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,904
Yeah, I tried taking painkillers
for a few days,

230
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,329
but I didn't like the
way it made me feel.

231
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,812
And rather than coming to see me
to get the knee looked at,

232
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:50,781
- you decided to...
- Tough it out. Yeah.

233
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,875
Uh, look, here's the thing.

234
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,329
We're almost done with the movie, okay?

235
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:56,210
So I really need to get
back to work next week

236
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,304
so that I can finish my
last three scenes, so...

237
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,364
...how do I do that?
How do we make that happen?

238
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:03,688
Well, we can do a simple
arthroscopic surgery

239
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:04,750
to remove the tear.

240
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,390
Three small incisions,
in and out in an hour.

241
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:09,484
Many patients walk the same day.

No, I'm not a masochist, Jack.
I did not invite her.

253

Two minutes in,
and she's already commenting

254

Well, we can't put her in a car

259
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,619
and send her back to Connecticut.

00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:18,835
- It's... No. No. We can't.

I don't let her bait me.

- Well, I beg to differ, Bunny.
- (exasperated grunt)

266
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,967
I hate when she calls me Bunny.

267
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:34,991
I don't even like bunnies.
Where does that come from?

268
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:36,679
Says the woman that cannot be baited.

I guess I could try if
you really want me to.

It's okay... They'll give you yours back
as soon as we're done.

can bowl in your socks?

- Nothing.
- No, I heard you.

- I wasn't talking to you.
- If you got something to say,

317
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:20,426

00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:15,318
- a very specific fantasy of mine.
- Dude, she's a nurse.

343
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:17,906
- You can live out that fantasy anytime.
- Lucky me.

344
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:20,225
Maybe I could get Brooks
or Bishop to pick up

345
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,796
- my shifts this weekend.
- No, it's okay.

346
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,030
I've got my instructions
from the doctor,

347
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,355
Toby's here, Kate's here.

348
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:25,719
They're gonna take care of me.
I'm in good hands.

349
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:26,820
(sighs): Okay.

350
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:29,320
How's your pain?
On a scale of one to ten.

351
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:31,405
It's manageable, you know,
but my needing to pee is

352
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:34,195
about a 12 and a half right now,
so I'm gonna let you go.

353
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,300
- Okay?
- Okay. If you need anything...

354
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:37,851
I know, I know. You're here.

355
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:38,875
I love you. I'll talk to you soon.

356
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,334
- I love you, too.
- Good-bye.

357
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,511
- Oh, hey, Tobe?
- Hmm?

358
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:43,751
Will you be good with him for a while?

359
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:45,119
I'm gonna try to make my yoga class.

360
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:47,476
What? No. He literally
just got out of surgery.

361
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,664
You heard him, he's fine.

362
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,291
Plus, I missed my workout this morning,

363
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:51,407
'cause we were at the hospital.

364
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,046
Sorry. Are you kidding me?

365
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,812
Go get the dress.

366
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:56,604
Try it on. I swear it fits.

367
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,617
- You know what, I'll go get the dress.
- Tobe?

368
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:00,226
- Yeah?
- I'm not trying on the dress.

369
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,585
- I'm going to yoga class. Kev?
- KEVIN: Hmm?

370
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,310
- I'll be back in an hour.
- Okay.

371
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,581
- Tobe's here.
- Okay.

372
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:06,984
- Love you.
- KEVIN: You, too.

373
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,859
Love you, Tobe. Love you.

374
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:10,976
(door closes)

375
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,695
Ah, maybe give her a break, you know?

376
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,898
- She's got bat mitzvah jitters.
- Yeah.

377
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,468
Um...

378
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:19,429
All right, it says you're supposed

379
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,078
to... take these painkillers

380
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:22,648
with food, so you want me to make you

381
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,451
- a quesadilla or something?
- No, no, no, I'm good.

382
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:26,266
I'm not taking those things.
I took a couple of those

383
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,679
when I first got injured,
they made my mind all fuzzy,

384
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,235
and I need to be sharp
for this recovery.

385
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,383
- Okay, um...
- Oh, it's time.

386
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,930
I'm gonna peel this
sucker off right now.

387
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,922
Uh, no, no. Don't.
The nurse said that step one

388
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:36,247
- is RICE.
- Yeah.

389
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:38,636
All right?
Rest, ice, compress, elevate.

390
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,828
- In about... in a week's time,
- (groans)

391
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,421
I got to be parachuting down
on a bunch of Nazis in Normandy,

392
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:45,859
so this has to go quickly,
you know? Don't worry.

393
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,404
Trust me, Toby, I'm a champion
when it comes to stuff like this.

394
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,757
KEVIN: <i>Dad!</i>

395
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:52,093
Hey, Kev, you can't
be scratching like that.

396
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,171
- Wh-Where are your oven mitts?
- They were too hot.

397
00:14:54,196 --> 00:14:55,563
Everything's too hot.

398
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,609
You said the medicine would help.

399
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,469
Yeah, well, it's only been seven
minutes since you took it, pal.

400
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:01,507
You got to give it time.

401
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,063
It's gonna kick in and help, I promise.

402
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,992
No, it won't!
I feel worse than I did before.

403
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,017
Kev, stop, stop.

404
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:08,546
- Let go! I need to itch!
- No.

405
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:12,156
Look, being sick sucks. I know it, okay?

406
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,524
I-I think you're making it
worse on yourself

407
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,148
by focusing on it so much.

408
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,140
Hey, look, come here. Stand up.

409
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,335
Come on, trust me. Stand up.

410
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:22,914
(sighs)

411
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,645
(roars)

412
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,273
What are you doing?! Stop!

413
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:29,179
You... are tougher than that itch.

414
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:30,337
Look at me.

415
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:32,152
You're stronger than that itch.

416
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:33,585
You're not a mere mortal, son.

417
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,296
You are a Pearson. Look at me.

418
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:36,855
Now, let me hear your battle cry.

419
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,125
- (roars)
- (short roar)

420
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:41,000
Do it like you mean it. From here.

421
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,635
(roars)

422
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,860
(roars loudly)

423
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:45,085
(roars)

424
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,882
- (roars)
- There you go! Own that itch!

425
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:49,351
Own that itch. Let me hear
your roar one more time.

426
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:50,810
(both roaring)

427
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,585
Uh, please don't. Please don't.

428
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,007
Grandma has a headache.

429
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,429
Don't scratch that
beautiful face of yours, Kevin.

430
00:15:57,454 --> 00:15:59,117
It's gonna take you far one day.

431
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,289
Really?

432
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:03,523
(crickets chirping)

433
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,065
Baby, stop.

434
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,992
- What?
- Your internal meltdown

435
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,851
is literally making the bed hot.

436
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,234
Why did I think she'd like bowling?

437
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:14,726
Well, who actually likes bowling?

438
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,196
It was cool for a minute there
when <i>The Big Lebowski</i> came out,

439
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,820
but that was, like, 20 years ago, right?

440
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,109
I meant go to sleep, but okay.

441
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:23,414
I was so sure I had
the right angle on this, Beth.

442
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:26,531
We were gonna have fun,
and then she would feel good,

443
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:27,812
and we could talk.

444
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:30,742
And instead I just made things
a whole lot worse for her.

445
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,117
Can't believe you were gonna throw down

446
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,812
- with some jackass in bowling shoes.
- (sighs)

447
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:38,877
I should've just listened
to you in the first place.

448
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:40,960
You knew. Of course you knew.

449
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,609
You got the hygiene talk on lock.

450
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,898
Right up there with...
untangling necklaces

451
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,648
and perfectly round scoops of ice cream.

452
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,563
The trick is you just
have to run the scooper

453
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:54,633
- under hot water first.
- I know what the trick is, Beth.

454
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:56,945
I'm just wallowing. Okay, I'm done.

455
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:02,296
I'm sorry it didn't end up
the way you wanted it.

456
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,710
You should talk to her.

457
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,171
I will.

458
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:13,007
- In the morning.
- Right.

459
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:16,164
- Just let me hug you!
- (Kate screams)

460
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:18,531
- I need to get sick!
- Leave me alone!

461
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:20,773
Guys, enough! Guys! Stop!

462
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:24,117
Hey, Randall, there are germs
all over this house.

463
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:27,265
You <i>will</i> get sick, you
just have to be patient, okay?

464
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,758
Why don't you go upstairs
and finish your project

465
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,476
- before you get sick?
- Good idea.

466
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:33,170
- Whoa. Sorry, Grandma.
- Okay.

467
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:34,809
Wait, do you want to
see my Rube Goldberg

468
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,165
machine I'm building
for the science fair?

469
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,617
You knock over some dominoes,

470
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:40,445
and then a race car goes down
a slide and hits a marble.

471
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,008
And then I haven't
figured out the middle yet,

472
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,570
but by the end, a marker draws
a line on a piece of paper.

473
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,031
Right. Well, why don't you
show me when it works.

474
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:53,359
Did you sauté the onions first?

475
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,875
- I did.
- How much thyme did you add?

476
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,211
- 'Cause you don't need more than a...
- I did half a tablespoon.

477
00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,795
Well, you're gonna need more than that.

478
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,445
Do you want to make the soup, Mom?

479
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:04,554
- Sure.
- Yeah?

480
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:06,513
- I'm more than happy to help.
- Thank you.

481
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,710
Go for it.

482
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,523
- I like your soup best, Mom.
- Thank you.

483
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,515
Well, your mother actually learned

484
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,109
how to make this from me.

485
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:17,234
I can teach you, too, if you want.

486
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,507
A woman should know how to
cook if she wants to have

487
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,210
a husband and children of her own.

488
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:22,890
- She's ten, Mom.
- Well, Lord knows

489
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,390
I wasn't the prettiest girl
in Erie, Pennsylvania,

490
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:27,726
but I somehow roped your father

491
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,820
with the best pot roast and
green bean casserole in town.

492
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,976
- Did your mom teach you?
- Yeah, she did.

493
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,368
But this recipe right here

494
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,961
actually comes from a maid that we had

495
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:39,296
- when your mother was a little girl.
- You had a maid?

496
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,734
Mm-hmm. A lovely black woman named Dora.

497
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,688
Of course, I was always
correcting her English,

498
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:47,437
so that you girls didn't start
speaking like street kids.

499
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,995
- Jack? Where are you?
- Dad's got a fever, too.

500
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,742
- What? -Yeah, it-it... it just hit me.
- JANET: Oh, God.

501
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,187
I thought you said you'd
had the chickenpox before.

502
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:59,484
- No, I did. I did, I <i>think.</i>
<i>- (Groans)</i>

503
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,742
Probably measles.

504
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,304
- Jack.
- Oh, crap.

505
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,363
Why don't you go upstairs
and go to bed, Jack.

506
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,750
We got everything
under control here without you.

507
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:08,842
Don't we, Bunny?

508
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,406
♪

509
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:21,468
You going somewhere?

510
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,796
I pushed a girl, so you're
kicking me out, right?

511
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,148
You spent the whole night thinking that?

512
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:30,156
We're not kicking you out, Deja.

513
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,273
Honey, sit.

514
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,734
Come on, Deja, bag down.

515
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,132
- Please, sit.
- (pats bed)

516
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,078
You're right.

517
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:43,390
We don't push other people in our house.

518
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:47,867
You push somebody again,
and you'll be grounded.

519
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:50,898
But I hope it doesn't happen again.

520
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:54,757
Is that it, then?

521
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,609
Um...

522
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:00,804
you know...

523
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,265
I grew up with three
very opinionated sisters

524
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,890
and one <i>very</i> opinionated mother.

525
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,132
Fights, arguments,

526
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,921
cold shoulders, yelling matches...

527
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,125
You name it, the Clarke
women did not play.

528
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,934
But no matter who wasn't talking to who,

529
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:23,093
or who stole whose favorite
tube of candy apple lipstick,

530
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:26,335
we always came together
to do each other's hair.

531
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,414
Because my mom believed...
Still believes...

532
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:34,992
That... how you present
yourself on the outside

533
00:20:35,272 --> 00:20:37,187
reflects how you feel on the inside.

534
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,625
Look, I don't know why you're
not washing your hair, Deja.

535
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,015
But I do know we have to
get it taken care of.

536
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:50,671
So, if you don't want to do it yourself,

537
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,093
I'm happy to take you
to my salon. I love it there.

538
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,885
It's really nice,

539
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,378
and I spend way too much money there,

540
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,140
and it's worth every damn penny.

541
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:04,601
Let me know what you decide, okay?

542
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,085
In the meantime,

543
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,924
you can just go ahead and unpack.

544
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:18,227
Will you do my hair?

545
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,167
Brady, hey. What's up? Come on in.

546
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:26,687
- Hey. Uh, it's from the producers.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,469
Just go ahead and, uh, put that
on the counter there.

548
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:30,602
Look at all that kiwi on
a stick. You know I always say

549
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,005
you can never have
enough kiwi on a stick.

550
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,648
(chuckles) They, uh, wanted
to wish you a speedy recovery.

551
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,641
- Well, that's nice.
- I also have a hard copy

552
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,000
of the revised script pages.

553
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,976
Okay. Thank you.

554
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:44,070
Cool. Well, I will, uh...
I'll see you in a few days.

555
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,445
- Yep. See ya.
- All right.

556
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:48,757
(paper rustling)

557
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,898
♪

558
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:05,359
Hey, Peter, it's Kate Pearson.

559
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,101
Yeah, I'm excited
about the gig tomorrow, too.

560
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,997
Yeah. I-I just talked to Ms. Silver.

561
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:13,601
She said we could set up at 6:00.

562
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,560
Yeah.

563
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,024
Uh, and you're good for
rehearsal tonight? Okay.

564
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:20,898
Thanks.

565
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:28,421
I'm just gonna comb you out
a little bit before I wash it.

566
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,695
Don't worry. I won't pull
too hard. I promise.

567
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,437
How long have you had these patches?

568
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,781
You know, my sister
Renee gets them, too.

569
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:50,578
These areas where the hair doesn't grow.

570
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:54,328
What she has is called alopecia.

571
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,460
- Have you ever heard of that before?
- No.

572
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:59,820
It's not that uncommon in black hair.

573
00:22:59,984 --> 00:23:01,484
Some people are just born with it.

574
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,957
It's not their fault.

575
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,640
Oh.

576
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,750
I didn't know that.

577
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:10,742
Is it always like this?

578
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,296
You know, it's okay to talk about it.

579
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:21,679
It's just the two of us here.

580
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:28,148
It gets worse when
there's a lot going on.

581
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,687
What do you mean?

582
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:36,093
Like...

583
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,085
Like, when bad stuff happens.

584
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,046
When Mom gets in trouble.

585
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:46,085
Or... when I have to move houses.

586
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:49,601
That makes sense.

587
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,625
Stress can make it flare up.

588
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:01,289
My mom has really pretty hair.

589
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,421
(clears throat)

590
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:11,000
You know what?

591
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:15,695
Over the years, I've gotten really good

592
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,726
at braiding my sister's hair

593
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,710
in a way that covers up her patches.

594
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:21,914
After I wash you out,

595
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:23,960
I think I can do the
same thing with yours.

596
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:26,976
Does that sound okay?

597
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,093
JANET: Oh, I remember this trip.

598
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,975
Your father took the twins
and Randall out on the lake.

599
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,648
- Remember?
- No, Mom.

600
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:45,546
It's not "the twins and Randall."

601
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,617
It's "the kids." Or even just
Kevin, Kate and Randall. Okay?

602
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:53,148
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired.

603
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:55,374
It's not just tonight.
I mean, since I've been here,

604
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:57,453
you haven't seemed like yourself.

605
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:00,460
Is everything all right
with you and Jack?

606
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:03,186
Yeah. Never better, actually.

607
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,078
Then what's going on?

608
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:08,333
You don't call home much anymore,

609
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:10,570
you stopped coming to see
us for the holidays.

610
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:12,882
- (sighs)
- You don't seem very happy.

611
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:14,304
(chuckles): I am happy.

612
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,554
- We're all very happy.
- Okay.

613
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:19,398
I'm sorry. I'm your mother,
I'm allowed to worry.

614
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:24,625
Who would've thought that
Randall would be the one

615
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,109
to get into private school.

616
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:32,695
I'm sorry.

617
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,296
What... what does that mean?

618
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,609
What? Nothing.

619
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:40,195
Okay.

620
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:43,085
(sighs): All right. You
want to talk about this?

621
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,414
Um...

622
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,796
Do you want to know why

623
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:49,742
we don't come home
for the holidays anymore?

624
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,750
It's because of you.

625
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:57,817
You constantly criticize my family.

626
00:25:57,842 --> 00:25:59,810
I am not a good enough cook.

627
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:01,302
I don't clean well enough.

628
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,828
Uh, Jack doesn't provide.

629
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,997
You're gonna most certainly
give Kate a complex about food.

630
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:09,632
And Kevin is gonna think that his only

631
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,943
value in life comes from how he looks.

632
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:13,769
And all of that is fine.

633
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:16,968
All of that I can sort of
explain away to the kids, but...

634
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:19,849
(sighs)

635
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:27,531
But Randall...

636
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:33,307
tries so hard to get you to like him.

637
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:36,570
And, honestly,

638
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,007
I've always wondered if the reason

639
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,953
that you never bonded with him
was because he was adopted.

640
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:45,492
But you've made it alarmingly clear

641
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,851
that it's because he's black.

642
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,851
That is an appalling thing
for you to say.

643
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:55,455
You know, just 'cause
he's black doesn't mean

644
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,976
that he likes basketball.

645
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:59,695
He likes football,
like the rest of us, okay?

646
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,960
And you got to stop constantly

647
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:03,679
separating him from Kevin and Kate.

648
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:05,304
They're all my kids, okay?

649
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:07,898
I'm sorry, I call them "the twins."

650
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:09,262
That's what they are.

651
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:12,539
And Dora, our maid Dora,
she wasn't just a child

652
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,835
that you had to train
how to speak, she wasn't.

653
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,445
She was a 50-year-old woman
who had four kids of her own.

654
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,054
I can't talk to you when
you're being hysterical.

655
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,315
And St. Mary's, right?

656
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,460
We went to St. Mary's my whole
life, and then suddenly at 16,

657
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:33,155
we switched churches because
we got a pastor from Ghana.

658
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,007
Oh, for God's sakes,
I couldn't understand

659
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:37,296
the man's accent, Rebecca.

660
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,046
When the snow is gone,

661
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,054
I want you gone, too.

662
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:48,460
'Cause I will not expose Randall
to any more of this crap.

663
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,156
What are you talking about?

664
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,687
You're racist, Mom.

665
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,015
You're a racist.

666
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,625
Sweetheart.

667
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:04,289
(sighs) Sweetheart, I thought
that you were upstairs.

668
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,195
I got my first chicken pock.

669
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,429
Okay. All right.

670
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:12,695
Um... (sniffles)

671
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,625
Uh, let's take you back upstairs

672
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,835
and I'll put some
calamine lotion on, okay?

673
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,085
TOBY: Hey, babe have you seen my...

674
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:27,764
Holy hell of a hot fiancée.

675
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:30,015
Wow. That looks great.

676
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:31,914
I told you the dress would fit. Hmm?

677
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,210
Yeah, you did.

678
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:37,467
Hey. You set a goal
and you made a goal,

679
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:39,092
so now is the part
where you get excited.

680
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:40,554
What's going on with you?

681
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,647
Nothing. Can you just unzip me?

682
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:46,245
I have to meet my pianist for rehearsal.

683
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:50,015
Yeah.

684
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:57,335
How can Grandma be racist?

685
00:28:57,762 --> 00:29:00,467
She never says anything mean
to me about being black.

686
00:29:00,492 --> 00:29:03,109
Yeah, that's-that's not always
how racism works, kiddo.

687
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:07,213
REBECCA: Yeah. Do you remember
how we were talking about

688
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:08,772
what Martin Luther King Day means?

689
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:12,656
Someone shot him because he wanted
to get black people equal rights.

690
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,203
- Did Grandma shoot him?!
- No, no, no, no, no. Grandma... mm.

691
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:20,750
Look, you know how sometimes

692
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:24,087
Mom gets really mad at me
and she says some things

693
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:27,457
that... aren't really nice

694
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:29,039
but she makes it sound nice?

695
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:32,429
Like, "Jack, I love when you leave

696
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:34,593
your muddy boots in the
middle of the living room."

697
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:36,945
- Yeah.
- Okay.

698
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,578
So racism can sometimes be like that.

699
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:42,828
You know, people don't
actually say bad things

700
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,365
to people that are different than them.

701
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:47,024
- What they say sounds fine...
- REBECCA: Mm.

702
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:50,718
But there's this mean
undertone to it, you know?

703
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:58,375
I think I'm gonna go to bed now.

704
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,828
(sighs)

705
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,828
I mean, I said alopecia, and it was like

706
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:12,521
no one had ever talked
to her about it before.

707
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,164
I honestly don't know what
I would've done in that moment.

708
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,577
They come to me for the boo-boo kiss,

709
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,844
but they go to you for the
Band-Aid and the boo-boo song.

710
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,070
I don't know anyone else
who has a three-verse song

711
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:28,101
about how antibiotic ointment
can help them heal faster.

712
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,453
♪ And prevent an infection disaster. ♪

713
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,223
That's the...

714
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:34,851
They need the both of us.

715
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,070
We make a good team.

716
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,763
Nope. We were right the first time.

717
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:47,273
(knock on door)

718
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,601
Dang, girl.

719
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:53,593
You look really cool.

720
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,453
Alicia Keys cool.

721
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:57,289
She's old.

722
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:58,656
(laughs)

723
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:02,447
Look, I... I just wanted to apologize

724
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:04,506
for the way I acted
at the bowling alley.

725
00:31:04,768 --> 00:31:07,569
I'm ashamed that I made a scene.

726
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,320
I shouldn't have let
things get so heated.

727
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:12,347
Definitely not Alicia Keys cool.

728
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:16,179
Still no love? All right.

729
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:20,328
Anyway, um, I just wanted to say that...

730
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:26,351
I've had two nervous
breakdowns in my life.

731
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:29,296
One right before Tess was born,

732
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:31,507
and one just earlier this year.

733
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:36,704
And they happen when
I let myself get stressed out,

734
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:39,406
and it just builds up
inside, and then...

735
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:40,859
(imitates explosion)

736
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,992
But, uh, one of the things that helps me

737
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:46,818
when I'm feeling stressed,
though, is running.

738
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:48,773
I run, like, every day.

739
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:51,757
Just helps me clear my mind.

740
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:54,312
So...

741
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,382
if you ever feel like you want to,

742
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,953
I would love to go running with you.

743
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:06,367
She told you what I said?

744
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,468
Oh.

745
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,421
- Hey, Kev, do you...
- (Kevin sighs)

746
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:16,559
Dude, come on.

747
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,129
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean,

748
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,298
what am I doing?
I'm getting better.

749
00:32:19,322 --> 00:32:20,534
- No pain, no gain, right?
- No.

750
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:23,281
Actually, no pain, full recovery.

751
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:24,218
Take your hand off that.

752
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,789
No, no, no. Dude, come on. (chuckles)

753
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:28,750
I hereby release you
from all of your nursing duties.

754
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:29,954
Okay? You can go back to your room

755
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:31,289
and binge-watch
<i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>

756
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:32,825
- or whatever it was you were doing.
<i>- Handmaid's Tale?</i>

757
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:34,398
- What? Okay. Here.
- (sighs)

758
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,804
Come on, don't do that. Don't do that.

759
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:38,532
You know what,
I might not be your nurse,

760
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,836
but I am your future brother-in-law,

761
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,305
and I'm not gonna let you
screw up your knee

762
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,218
for the rest of your life.

763
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:43,989
Well, that's really sweet
of you. I appreciate it.

764
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:45,546
But I'm not gonna let this stupid knee

765
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:47,789
screw up the rest of my life. Not again.

766
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:49,757
Again? What-what?

767
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:52,215
Kev?

768
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,445
Hey. Hey, just...

769
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,812
- (sighs)
- Would you just slow down?

770
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:06,914
What's going on?

771
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:11,593
Toby, I was three years old
when I threw my first football.

772
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,226
I made the varsity team
when I was a sophomore.

773
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:16,804
I wasn't good at football, Toby.

774
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,029
I was great.

775
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,703
My dad used to come to the games.

776
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:21,304
He started taping them for a reel.

777
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:22,664
Colleges were coming.

778
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:24,531
They were scouting me.

779
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:30,117
I-I had this whole future
planned, you know. I...

780
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:37,117
- And then the knee goes, and then bam,
- (snaps)

781
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,031
just like that, it's over in one second.

782
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,234
Gone.

783
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,757
(exhales)

784
00:33:43,766 --> 00:33:44,781
Wow.

785
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,273
I mean, I knew you played
high school football, but...

786
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:50,382
Geez.

787
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,094
So, what do you do, you know?
I started acting, right?

788
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:56,153
At first, I started doing it
to, uh, sort of pass the time

789
00:33:56,178 --> 00:33:58,312
rather than just sit there
and feel sorry for myself.

790
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:01,986
But then, after a while,
I-I started to...

791
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,618
I started to get the same thrill from it

792
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:04,775
that I did from football.

793
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,328
And here we are, man.
It's 20 years later.

794
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,546
Right? I've been working my ass off,

795
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,672
and I am finally on the brink
of something special

796
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,264
and real and fulfilling,

797
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,882
and I will be damned
if I let this stupid knee

798
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,507
destroy another one of my dreams.

799
00:34:18,532 --> 00:34:22,168
And that is why you have
to let it heal fully, all right?

800
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,560
The... It's not that big a deal.

801
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:25,625
The production said they would shift

802
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,719
- the schedule around for you.
- They <i>did</i> shift the schedule.

803
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:28,977
All right, apparently
they can, they can shoot

804
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:30,674
part of the Normandy scene
without me... and Ron,

805
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:31,969
Ron doesn't think it's a big deal

806
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:34,343
if the other guy says,
"I got you, Jimmy."

807
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:37,703
Well, it's a big deal to me.

808
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:42,093
And I-I appreciate all of your effort,

809
00:34:42,118 --> 00:34:44,119
all of your concern,
but I'm not blowing this one.

810
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:45,835
Okay, man? I'm not blowing it this time.

811
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,976
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

812
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:01,804
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

813
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:04,132
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

814
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,765
When did you all get here?

815
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,728
REBECCA: Kevin crawled in around 3:00,

816
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:09,830
and the others came not that long after.

817
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,523
- Oh.
- But you...

818
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:13,967
you've been passed out
with a fever for hours.

819
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:15,312
I was getting worried about you.

820
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,140
How are you feeling?

821
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:19,806
Do you think you could
itch my whole body?

822
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:21,507
'Cause I don't know
that I have the strength.

823
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,984
- I told you chicken pox is the worst.
- Oh, yeah.

824
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:25,195
Sure is, kiddo.

825
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,023
Hey, babe, could you get me the Tylenol?

826
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,781
I-I think I left it in the kitchen.
(sniffs)

827
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:33,031
Hmm. The kitchen, huh?

828
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:34,562
That's downstairs.

829
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:37,804
Uh, I have been avoiding
going downstairs

830
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:39,664
because my mother is down there.

831
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,453
- Oh, babe.
- But you are my husband,

832
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:44,906
and I love you, and you're sick,
so I will risk going downstairs

833
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:46,298
and interacting with her.

834
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:47,991
- Thank you, babe.
- All right, guys.

835
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:50,437
I'm gonna go downstairs.
Uh, who wants something?

836
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:51,702
This is your one and only shot.

837
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:52,750
Hot cocoa.

838
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:54,029
Cap'n Crunch.

839
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:56,250
My Game Boy and some Cheetos.

840
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:57,882
Wait, hold on a second.

841
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,842
Has everyone been avoiding
going downstairs?

842
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:03,851
- Okay. I got this, Bec.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

843
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:05,265
Lie down. I'm already going down.

844
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,423
- Jack, you're sick.
- No.

845
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:08,734
We will not be held prisoner
in our own home.

846
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,585
I'm gonna get your mother out of here.
