2
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:03,787
So is it still there?

3
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:04,842
It's still there.

4
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:07,173
Congratulations. You're
officially six weeks along.

5
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,459
Is it always like this?

6
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:10,827
DEJA: It gets worse when
there's a lot going on.

7
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:13,140
One of the things that helps me
when I'm feeling stressed, though,

8
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:15,632
- is running.
- She told you what I said?

00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:19,868
STANLEY: <i>Let's all raise a glass</i>

10
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,337
to my unemployed
28-year-old son.

JACK: <i>My life,</i> before I met
you, Bec, it wasn't great.

12
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,799
<i>I just tried to get away
from my father.</i>

13
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,434
I've been working my ass off,

14
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:31,741
and I am finally on the brink
of something special,

15
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,134
<i>and I will be damned
if I let this stupid knee</i>

16
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,976
<i>destroy another one of my dreams.</i>

17
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,907
- (kids shouting)
- Stop!

18
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,602
- Stop it, it's mine!
- Why can't you get it?

19
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:42,585
It's mine!

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,563
- You're gonna keep the boys safe?
- Oh, yeah. I will.

21
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,446
- BEC: You have moisturizer for Randall?
- JACK: Check.

22
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,040
BEC: And remember,
Kevin's afraid of bears.

23
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:49,531
- (chuckles) So am I.
- Okay.

24
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,083
Uh, the number for
the campground's by...

25
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:52,474
By the phone in the kitchen.

26
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,209
- I told you that already.
- Three times.

27
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:56,138
- Okay.
- You really think that this trip

28
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:57,945
is gonna help the boys get along better?

29
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,814
I do.

30
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:00,968
- BEC: Because Kevin can be so...
- Yep.

31
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:03,039
And Randall is just
only trying to help.

32
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,562
I know, baby. It's gonna be great.

33
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:06,062
Look, camping's all about teamwork.

34
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,733
Do you remember how the
Steelers were a wreck

35
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:09,523
at the start of the '79 season?

36
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,937
You're gonna Chuck Noll the boys?

37
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:13,205
(whispers)
I'm gonna Chuck Noll the boys.

38
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,101
- Okay. Good luck.
- Okay.

39
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:17,103
- I'm gonna tell Mom or Dad!
- Stop!

40
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:19,562
- Go get 'em, Coach.
- Oh! (howls)

41
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,968
Oh, do you guys hear that?

42
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:23,062
Do you know that sound?

43
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:25,814
That is the call of the wild.

44
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,359
- Hey, Kate!
- JACK: Come on, hop in the car.

45
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:29,069
Your brothers are leaving.
Come say good-bye.

46
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:30,853
Randall, put that up front for me.

47
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,488
Thank you. Kev, here.

48
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:34,656
We are gonna have the
best girl's day ever.

49
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,091
- We are?
- Yeah.

50
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,227
Can you say movies and manicures?

51
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,796
I think the first thing we'll want to do

52
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,570
- is set up the tent when we get there.
- Ugh!

53
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,703
- Backseat.
- I'm already up here, Dad.

54
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:50,454
- Get in the backseat with your brother.
- (sighs)

55
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,317

- (car door closes)

00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:55,039
KEVIN: What?

58
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:57,937
Come on. There is no
Mario out in the wild.

(whispers): Hey.

65
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,285
You kept my daughters up
way too late last night.

66
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,754
Can't even get them out
of bed this morning.

67

Oh, my gosh.

68
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,378
Well, come on, dude.
I get, I get, like, what?

69
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:00,376
One night with my nieces before
I got to go to Sophie's,

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,640
- so sue me, okay?
- Okay.

71
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:04,334
But by the way, uh,
they kept me up, all right?

72
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,978
- Really?
- Annie's basically obsessed with me.

73
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,828
She keeps asking me questions
about Ron Howard and Sly Stallone.

74
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,383
I don't believe my daughter
asked you about Ron Howard.

75
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,570
- Listen, um...
- Yeah.

76
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:13,343
I need to borrow a tie

77
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:14,992
for Sophie's hospital
gala thing tonight.

78
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:16,329
- Yeah.
- And make it something sharp, too,

79
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:18,210
because they're actually
auctioning a date off

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,922
with yours truly to raise
money for the charity.

81
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,032
- Told me that.
- I tell you that?

82
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:22,555
- Told me that, like, four times.
- You jealous?

83
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,214
No black man will ever be
jealous of being auctioned.

Hashtag "AmericanHistory."

85
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:28,093
Uh, question for you.

86
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:30,531
Um, what do you think of Deja?

87
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,671
- I think Deja's lovely, adorable.
- Yeah.

88
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,555
You know, in, like, a surly,
nonverbal kind of way.

89
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,047
Well, she's only been here for a month,

90
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:39,838
so just tread lightly.

91
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,502
- What does that even mean?
- It means...

92
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:42,743
- It's my middle name, Tread Lightly.
- Just...

93
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,531
Oh, and don't say
anything about her hair.

94
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:45,585
Alright.

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,101
Want two?

96
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,195
Morning. How are you?

97
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,039
What is that?

98
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:04,442
Beth, you sure you don't want
to go to this gala tonight?

99
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,584
Gonna be fun.

100
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,831
Oh, man, you know I
love me a good Ke-vent.

101
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,691
But, uh, it's a little last
minute to get a babysitter.

102
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:12,293
Well, first of all, it's a Sophie-vent.

103
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,594
Uh, can I come?

104
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:17,710
To the gala?

105
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:22,640
Yeah. Of course. I mean, uh...

106
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,984
I would have to take you.
Kevin will be busy.

107
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,703
Is that, um, is that cool with you, Kev?

108
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,261
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:30,117
The more the merrier. It's a great idea.

110
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,117
Cool.
Ow.

111
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:34,851
Um... sorry. Can you
excuse me one second?

112
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:41,562
What's up?

113
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:43,210
You really think she's ready to go

114
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:45,265
to some swanky Manhattan charity ball?

115
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,742
She said she wanted to go.

116
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,312
She actually seemed excited

117
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,789
about wanting to do something, Beth.

118
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:51,976
- We can't just ignore that.
- What you're ignoring

119
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,169
is the fact that she is
crushing on Kevin.

120
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,929
I'm gonna pretend like
I didn't hear that.

121
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,726
- Hey, hey.
- She's a 12-year-old girl,

122
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,960
and for better or for worse,
not that I think it...

123
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:01,968
- Just please don't say it.
- But your brother is

124
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,105
- smokin' hot.
- Don't even think it.

125
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:04,984
Oh, my God. This is disgusting.

126
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:07,625
I think it might be
too much for her, babe.

127
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:10,855
It's all those fancy people,
and it's way past her bedtime.

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,524
- She doesn't know...
- This is my opportunity

129
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:13,948
to connect with her.

130
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,437
And I don't care if Kevin...

131
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,054
Lord have mercy on my soul...

132
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,679
is the reason that she wants to go.

133
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,804
Trust me, it'll be fine.

134
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,007
And I get... No, I understand why.

135
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,618
But why doesn't it match
what Howard has?

136
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:26,843
It should be a fairly easy thing to say.

137
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:28,412
All right, just make it match.

138
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,679
Just make the work match.

139
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,960
- Hey! How you doing?
- Hi.

140
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:33,664
- What are you doing here?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

141
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,562
- Yeah.
- In your office?

142
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:37,851
In my office.

143
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:44,984
All right, come on.

144
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,625
Oh. (scoffs)

145
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,711
Oh, you thought that I wanted to...?

146
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,429
Uh, yeah.

147
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,513
You said, "Can I talk
to you in your office."

148
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:53,929
That's how it always starts.

150
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,210
I'm pregnant.

151
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:01,625
Excuse me?

152
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:03,351
I'm eight weeks pregnant.

153
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:06,968
(clears throat) Um...

154
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:11,132
S... Uh, so what
you're telling me is...?

155
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,507
We're... pregnant.

156
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,710
Well, that is...

157
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:23,382
the greatest thing I have
ever heard in my whole life.

158
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:24,851
- Oh, my God.
- (laughs)

159
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,242
(Toby laughs)

160
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,335
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- I'm glad you're happy.

161
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,361
Oh, I'm not happy. I'm ecstatic!

162
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:32,804
I'm-I'm aquiver!

163
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,657
I'm gonna put on my happy
song and I'm gonna be all...

164
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:35,734
No, no. Don't.

165
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,109
Right? 'Cause...

166
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:41,726
this might not happen. In fact,
it probably won't happen.

167
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,562
- What?
- I'm 37.

168
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,257
I'm having a geriatric pregnancy.

169
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,616
- Geriatric?
- Geriatric.

170
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,203
It's literally what it's called.

171
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:51,172
And because of my weight, you know?

172
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:54,085
And because, well, bad things
just seem to happen to me.

00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:55,361
He's coming back.

350
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,704
He's coming back.

351
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:17,252
(video game music playing)

352
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,595
I said no Game Boy. Turn it off, now.

353
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:25,454
- Why are you so hard on him?
- I'm not.

354
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:28,494
Yes, you are, Kev,
and I want you to tell me why.

355
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:31,486
- (sighs) He's annoying.
- No, he's not annoying.

356
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,353
He... He's just trying to show
you how much he loves you.

357
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,408
You know, it...

358
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,439
it would be so easy
for you to be nice to him.

359
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:47,267
But it takes you more energy
and causes more trouble,

360
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,682
you being mean to him like you are.

361
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,689
So why... why can't you
just be nice to him?

362
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:51,712
I don't know.

363
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:52,979
That's not a good enough answer, Kevin.

364
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:54,064
I want you to tell me why.

365
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,540
- I don't know!
- Is it because

366
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,837
he gets special attention sometimes?

367
00:16:57,862 --> 00:16:59,987
You know, 'cause all you kids,
you need something different.

368
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,752
At different moments,
you need something different

369
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:03,276
- all the t...
- I don't know! Stop!

370
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,306
You said I had to sit in here.

371
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,712
You didn't say we had to talk about it.

372
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,931
I don't want to talk about it.

373
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:15,704
Okay.

374
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,548
We'll talk about it later.

375
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:24,447
(video game music playing)

376
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:27,806
- (gentle jazz music playing)
- (lively chatter)

377
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,119
When I walked to the classroom
of my new school

378
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:39,298
and saw all those new faces, I thought,

379
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,212
"Whoa. None of these
kids looks like me."

380
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,869
I felt like I am in the wrong place

381
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:48,461
at the wrong time.

382
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,150
Beam me up, Scotty.

383
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,142
That's a <i>Star Trek</i> reference.

384
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,447
You know <i>Star Trek?</i>

385
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,119
"These are the voyages
of the starship <i>Enterprise."</i>

386
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,314
Oh, there's your brother.

387
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,057
KEVIN: <i>I'm starting to get
really uncomfortable here,</i>

388
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:08,790
and, uh... you know,
if I could get that refill,

389
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:10,470
that would be... that would be great.

390
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:12,759
Um, it's no big deal,
but call me back, please.

391
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:13,784
All right.

392
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,478
Hey! Look at you.

393
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,439
- You clean up nice, don't you?
- RANDALL: Hey.

394
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,073
- Good to see you.
- Don't talk about her hair.

395
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:21,097
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,603
- All right. Uh, oh.
- Hey.

397
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:24,603
- This is, uh, this is Sophie.
- Good to see you.

398
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:26,134
Sophie's my girlfriend.

399
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,173
SOPHIE: Hi!

400
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,361
I love your dress.

401
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:30,665
I like your hair, by the way.
It's very, very...

402
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,825
sort of Halle Berry in <i>Swordfish.</i>

403
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:34,197
Thanks.

404
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:36,642
Um, I like <i>The Manny.</i>

405
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:38,236
You do?

406
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,290
Do you watch <i>The Manny?</i>

407
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,634
What's your favorite episode?

408
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,126
Which one's your favorite?

409
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:43,439
"Iron Manny"?

410
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,220
"The Thin Manny"? "Manny Get Your Gun"?

411
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:47,060
- I'm gonna grab a drink.
- "Of Mice and Mannys"?

412
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,056
"Manny-Pedi"?

413
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:49,650
- (laughs)
- I thought you were a fan.

414
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:52,736
♪

415
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:56,728
Hey, kiddo.

416
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,853
I'm sorry this is so boring.

417
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,814
I just want to wait a little bit longer

418
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,079
and see if your dad calls back.

419
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,064
You think Dad's gonna look
like that when he's old?

420
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:07,415
Better not.

421
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,220
I don't want to get old like that.

422
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,033
I don't want my hair to fall out.

423
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:13,806
You do have really,
really beautiful hair.

424
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,212
You know that? (chuckles)

425
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:17,712
You want to guess how much hair
you had when you were born?

426
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,353
Like, almost none.

427
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:22,494
- Ew!
- (laughs) Not ew.

428
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,126
What about Kevin and Randall?

429
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:26,408
- Eggheads.
- (laughs)

430
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:29,025
All three of you
were just big old eggheads.

431
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:31,509
- Totally bald. (chuckles)
- (laughs)

432
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:33,720
But that's how it works.

433
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:36,423
<i>Everything changes all the time.</i>

434
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:40,191
<i>And when you're a mom,
you get a front row seat</i>

435
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,540
<i>to the best show in town:</i>

436
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,728
watching your kids grow up.

437
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:46,892
Give me that egghead.

438
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,501
It's underneath
all this hair somewhere, right?

439
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:50,540
(both laugh)

440
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,732
WOMAN: I'm at
this cocktail party, right?

441
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,506
And they're serving

442
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:57,684
these mini pizzas
with Gorgonzola and pear,

443
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:02,314
which is just my favorite thing
in the whole world, you know?

444
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:05,107
And I just panic. Bolt.

445
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,269
And I-I'm standing out by the valet,

446
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:09,521
and this guy is smoking a cigarette,

447
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,740
and I-I just, like, ask him for one.

448
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:16,013
And he turns out to be
really nice and super cute.

449
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,206
(chuckles) His name is Terrence,

450
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:21,090
and we've kind of
been seeing each other.

451
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:24,013
But that's not the point.
The point is...

452
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,052
I've started smoking.

453
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:30,146
Vaping, actually.

454
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:34,255
You're vaping?

455
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,218
That was the point?

456
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:37,841
It's, like, a gateway thing.

457
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,723
Oh. Okay.

458
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,013
So, to review:

459
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:45,604
you exit a cocktail party

460
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:48,097
serving delicious mini pizzas,
you smoke one cigarette,

461
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,808
you meet a guy... a nice guy

462
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,134
whose name is Terrence...
And now you're dating.

463
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,888
And now you're whining about vaping?

464
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:56,036
- Vaping?!
- Seriously?

465
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:58,578
You're snapping at me? Again?

466
00:20:58,603 --> 00:21:00,203
I am. Again.

467
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:01,855
Do you know why no one's defending you?

468
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,740
Because you don't have a problem!

469
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,747
The people that come here have problems.

470
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:09,009
Real problems with real issues.

471
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:10,614
What do you come here for, anyway?

472
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:12,178
So you can feel better about yourself

473
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:14,005
'cause you're not
as screwed up as we are?

474
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,850
Screw you, Madison.

475
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,990
(scoffs)

476
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:19,084
(scoffs mockingly)

477
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:25,029
Would anyone else like to share?

478
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,325
MADISON: Screw you, Kate!

479
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,719
Screw you and your terrible attitude,

480
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:34,435
and that is not an easy
thing for me to say

481
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,185
because confrontation makes me cry!

482
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:38,482
Why do you hate me?

483
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,142
Because you're annoying
and you shouldn't be here.

484
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,568
Well, I think <i>you're</i> annoying.

485
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:45,716
The way that you and your fiancé
come here every week

486
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:47,742
and smile and giggle at each other

487
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,052
when some of us don't have
anyone to do that with.

488
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:51,747
You have the guy that you vape with.

489
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,974
His name is Terrence!

490
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,779
And he probably won't last,
because, you know what,

491
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,466
nobody I date ever does.

492
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:01,200
Do you think it's because
you're <i>annoying?</i>

493
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:03,240
Oh, my God! You suck!

494
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,372
(sighs)

495
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,427
(engine starts)

496
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:16,763
- (car beeps)
- (crash)

497
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:17,998
- (shouts)
- Oh, my God.

498
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,693
- (panting)
- (car door opens, closes)

499
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:21,130
(Madison groans)

500
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:24,083
Are you insane?!

501
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:27,732
- (crying)
- Oh, my God, are you actually hurt?

502
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:29,943
I don't... I don't...
I don't know. I-I...

503
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,341
I don't think so.

504
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:32,701
Kate, it was just a little tap.

505
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:34,365
- Are you serious?
- No, but I'm pregnant.

506
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:35,880
(sniffles)

507
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:38,841
I just freaked out for a second.

508
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,500
(shuddering breath)
But, um... but I'm...

509
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,059
uh, I'm fine.

510
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,365
(chuckles): Kate.

511
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,992
Oh, my God, you're pregnant?

512
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:49,825
Yeah. I know, I know. It's hard, um...

513
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,494
- it's hard to believe, but...
- Kate.

514
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,944
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Oh. (chuckles)

515
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:56,372
That's amazing! I'm so happy for you!

516
00:22:56,483 --> 00:22:58,193
- (chuckles) Thanks.
- Oh, my God.

517
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,658
Yeah, but don't tell anyone,
because it's still real...

518
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:02,693
really early stages, okay?

519
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,699
(mouthing)

520
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:05,942
(squeals, laughs)

521
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:07,169
(chuckles, sniffles)

522
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:14,654
You may know him as
television's very own Manny,

523
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,717
But the next item on our auction agenda

524
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,560
is a whole lot more than that.

525
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:23,443
He's starring in Ron Howard's
new World War II epic,

526
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,318
<i>Hill 400, that just finished shooting.</i>

527
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:35,264
- Oh, no, you d...
- (gasps)

528
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:38,116
Sorry, you don't...
you don't eat that part.

529
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:39,670
You don't eat that part.

530
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:42,557
I'm sorry. I just didn't want
you to choke... that's all.

531
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:43,654
You okay?

532
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:49,545
I have to go to the bathroom.

533
00:23:57,092 --> 00:24:00,131
So, without further ado,

534
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:02,850
may I introduce to you the one,

535
00:24:02,936 --> 00:24:05,237
the only, Kevin Pearson.

536
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,420
(applause)

537
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,999
Uh, thank you for hitting me
back on a weekend.

538
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:10,157
I really appreciate it.

539
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:13,326
Listen, I was just... I was hoping
we could get one more, uh...

540
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,639
one more refill on the prescription.

541
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:17,803
(applause continues)

542
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:20,592
Kevin Pearson, ladies and gentlemen.

543
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,475
Right. No, I-I understand
you've already refilled

544
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,108
the prescription one more time
than you should have,

545
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,972
but I-I don't know why
it's that big of a deal.

546
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:28,170
(applause continues)

547
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,685
Kevin Pearson!

548
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,190
Well, I don't have a doctor out here.

549
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,858
All right, look, you know what,
here's the thing though.

550
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:40,569
If you can't help a guy
when he's in pain, right...

551
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:42,507
Which I obviously am...
Then you're kind of useless.

552
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:43,976
And-and, I'm sorry, I find it ridiculous

553
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,311
that you're treating me this way.

554
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:47,570
You know what, take my
headshot off the wall, okay?

555
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:49,748
It's-it's a doctor's
office, not a diner.

556
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,951
Hello? Hello?

557
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:55,646
Excuse me. Excuse me.

558
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:10,678
- (birds chirping)
- (grunts)

559
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,217
Here you go, bud.

560
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:22,170
Kevin's fine.

561
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:23,787
I bet he's hungry.

562
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:28,045
I know that you love
your brother, Randall,

563
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:31,139
and you want him to
love you, and he does.

564
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:32,959
- Yeah, right.
- He does.

565
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,373
I promise you.

566
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:38,998
But, look, sometimes...

567
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,357
sometimes you got to...

568
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:45,373
give people some space,
let them come to you.

569
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:49,326
Just got to be patient.

570
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,459
But I don't like patience.

571
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:53,037
Nobody likes patience.

572
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:02,334
Hey, Kev.

573
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:04,287
Randall.

574
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:08,537
What are we doing?

575
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,412
RANDALL: Deja's in there.

576
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:13,193
Is she okay? Is she...

577
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,412
- is she sick?
- Of me, I think.

578
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:17,318
But she likes you.

579
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,467
No. No, no, no.
She likes that I was the Manny.

580
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,894
- No. Kev, bro, she likes you.
- (sighs)

581
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:25,576
You're good with her.
You're good with people.

582
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,092
I come on too strong.

583
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,406
That's why I'm standing
out here, trying to...

584
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,604
stop myself from barging
into the women's room

585
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:35,063
to make her talk to me.

586
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:38,295
Madam.

587
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:39,475
How are we?

588
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:42,834
I should not go in there.

589
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:44,826
No. No, you should not go in there.

590
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:46,131
- But I'm going to.
- I know.

591
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:47,256
I'm definitely going to.

592
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,548
- Yep.
- Yeah.

593
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:50,943
- (sighs)
- You know why?

594
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:52,693
- Hmm?
- 'Cause you care too much.

595
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:53,941
Yeah.

596
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:56,154
You always have.

597
00:26:56,737 --> 00:26:57,771
You just...

598
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,521
- You feel too much.
- Yeah.

599
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,837
- And I... I mean, I... (chuckles)
- Hmm.

600
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:06,069
- I try not to feel anything at all.
- No, that's not true.

601
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:08,341
It is true. It's true, Randall.

602
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:11,200
Hey, you okay?

603
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:14,237
(chuckles softly)

604
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:16,450
Yeah. Yeah.

605
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:18,507
Okay.

606
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,060
I'm going in.

607
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:23,224
- Hey, Randall. You know, there...
- Hmm?

608
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:27,458
There could be a woman...
(whispers) pooping in there.

609
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:30,318
I know.

610
00:27:34,574 --> 00:27:35,974
Man coming in.

611
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:42,013
- (birds chirping)
- (horn honks)

612
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:43,517
(engine turns off)

613
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:44,943
Jack Pearson?

614
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,240
Yeah, I'm Jack.

615
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,136
Got your wife on the radio.

616
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,441
- She's patched through to the phone.
- (static crackling)

617
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:57,082
Did she say what's wrong?

618
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,745
No, she's been trying to reach
you all day. Just push to talk.

619
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,036
(static crackling)

620
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:05,028
Bec? <i>Bec, what's wrong?</i>

621
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:06,701
Yeah, every-everybody's fine.
Everything's okay.

622
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:08,411
Um, I just, uh...

623
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:13,252
The nursing home where
your dad is at called.

624
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:16,138
My dad?

625
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:19,255
And I couldn't get ahold
of you, so I came.

626
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:22,450
<i>You're not mad at me, are you?</i>

627
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:25,396
Wait, y-you're at
my father's nursing home?

628
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,669
Wh-What's wrong with him?

629
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,865
He's old.

630
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,607
I think it's, uh, cirrhosis.

631
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:34,341
But he's...

632
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:37,419
dying, Jack.

633
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:40,575
<i>I mean, I don't think that
he really has much time left.</i>

634
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,865
Do you... want to come back?

635
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:59,372
No, uh, I'm gonna stay
here with the boys.

636
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:00,966
<i>Are you sure?</i>

637
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,615
Yeah, I'm sure.

638
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:09,185
I mean, is there anything
that you want me to... tell him?

639
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:17,646
No.

640
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,536
No, that man's been dead
to me for a long time.

641
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:28,919
How are... how are the boys doing?

642
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:34,263
Well, baby steps, but...
we'll get there.

643
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,638
You are a miracle.

644
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:39,357
You know that, Jack?

645
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:43,169
Coming from your dad
and being the dad that you are,

646
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:44,982
you are a freaking miracle.

647
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:50,333
Yeah, well, takes one to know one, Bec.

648
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:54,825
I love you.

649
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:56,560
I love you, too.

650
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,162
Bye.

651
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:01,021
♪

652
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:18,738
Hey, babe?

653
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:19,847
Yeah?

654
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:24,129
Uh, so, I got good and bad news.

655
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,535
Uh-oh. Always bad news first.

656
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:29,480
(sighs) I banged up the car.

657
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:30,863
What? Are you all right?

658
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:33,676
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
It was just a fender bender.

659
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:35,761
(exhales) Okay.

660
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,019
And the good news?

661
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,566
The person I got in the
accident with was Madison.

662
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:42,695
- Did you kill her?
- No.

663
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:44,511
Oh. I thought you said it was good news.

664
00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:46,183
But I did tell her
that we were pregnant.

665
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:48,090
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,136
And?

667
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:51,004
And it actually felt
good saying it out loud.

668
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:52,191
Really?

669
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:54,851
- And I want you to come with me.
- Okay, where are we going?

670
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:56,216
- Just come with me.
- Okay, where we going?

671
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,911
- Don't ask questions.
- I'm right behind you.

672
00:30:57,935 --> 00:30:59,153
- I'm not gonna ask any questions.
- Okay.

673
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,177
Where are we going?

674
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,784
(smooth jazz music playing)

675
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:07,605
Ah, sorry about that. Mwah.

676
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,222
How are you? So, what, uh...

677
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,949
what'd I miss?

678
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,222
Huh?

679
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,941
You see that nice lady over there?

680
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,972
- KEVIN: Uh-huh.
- She bought you.

681
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,068
14 grand.

682
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,029
(sighs)

683
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:28,545
Oh. (stammers) Like, I missed it?

684
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,804
That you did.

685
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:34,904
- Oh, wow.
- Where the hell were you, Kevin?

686
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,498
Uh, I was in the...

687
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:39,045
Ron called, you know?

688
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,216
Something about dailies and
we need to reshoot a few things,

689
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,506
I guess, or he thinks maybe
we do, maybe we don't...

690
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:44,771
You embarrassed me.

691
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:48,029
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends

692
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,451
and coworkers.

693
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:55,943
You're not gonna say anything?

694
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:58,288
I don't know what you want me
to say though, you know? I...

695
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:00,107
I'm sorry.

696
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:02,045
Why? Why did you choose to get drunk?

697
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,912
- Tonight. My night.
- Okay, calm down.
