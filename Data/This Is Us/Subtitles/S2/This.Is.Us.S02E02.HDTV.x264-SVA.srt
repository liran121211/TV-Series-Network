00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,767
- We don't use it.
- She can't know that.

177
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,899
Are those pigs in a blanket?

178
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:08,321
These are for Miguel, all right?

179
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:09,647
He loves these little cuties.

180
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:10,571
Really?

181
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,415
What? Miguel can get stuff, too.

182
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,278
Huh? Y'all been sleeping
on my boy Miguel.

183
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:17,104
Miguel gets no love.
And I feel that pain.

184
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,096
Miguel and I, we are simpatico.

185
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:21,899
All right? Two swarthy outsiders
with exotic names.

186
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:23,877
I just don't want my mom
thinking that we sit around

187
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:25,031
just stuffing our faces.

188
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:28,149
Hey. I made this dipping
sauce with nut cheese.

189
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,954
So it's healthy.
And it's fun to say, FYI.

190
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,407
- Nut cheese. All right?
- Okay.

191
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:34,001
And Miguel is the key to my plan

192
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:36,088
- to win over your mom.
- My mom thinks you're great.

193
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:38,057
Uh, your mom thinks I'm a guy
who has heart attacks

194
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,852
and falls through coffee tables.

195
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:42,149
What the hell? What the actual hell?

196
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:45,477
Why won't this throw just throw?
Why won't it just look normal?!

197
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:47,477
- What is happening?
- (panting)

198

you don't... you don't understand.

200
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,767
Every time my mom comes to visit,

201
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,470
she comes in hot, looks me up and down

202
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,954
like she's fitting me
for a freaking bra,

203
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,087
and then she starts criticizing me

204
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:02,368
with these seemingly
innocuous questions.

205
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,696
I...

206
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,012
Okay. I'm not going to overreact

207
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:09,471
to everything she says this time.

208
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:11,399
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna behave like a child.

209
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:12,665

- Do I smell pigs in a blanket?

219
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:35,798
Oh, Miguel, do you have a nose on you.

220
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,392

my favorite thing from the show.

232

You can fill them out now.

348
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:03,845
Fine, Beth. Fine.

349
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,532
- Fine.
- Okay.

350
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,024
What are you guys doing?

351
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:08,907
Nothing, it's just bills.

352
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,962
- Mommy, have some wine.
- Hmm?

353
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,855
- You relax when you have wine.
- All right.

354
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,259
Well, not everybody needs
to know that, okay?

355
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,079
- You know what? I need a walk.
- Oh.

356
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:19,524
Where you going?
The show's about to start.

357
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,837
It's okay. Kevin says
these things can take hours.

358
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:23,610
Yeah, but... D-Did you say hours?

359
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:25,204
Did you say hours?

360
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,348
We're gonna be watching
<i>The Manny</i> for hours?

361
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,110
Watch my purse, okay?

362
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:32,415
- Okay.
- Stay with your grandma.

363
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:36,188
(phone vibrating)

364
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,735
Hello.

365
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,532
Hey. You gonna tell me
what's on your mind?

366
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,313
- I just...
- Wh... Why do these forms

367
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,188
have you Randalling out so hard?

368
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:48,399
It's pride, right?

369
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,424
You don't want to put down on paper

370
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,898
that your dad had a drinking problem

371
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:53,376
and your bio dad had a drug problem.

372
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:54,921
- It's question 15.
- And you have a...

373
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:56,938
What's question 15?

374
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,626
"Do you think you can handle a kid

375
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,368
with a history of physical abuse,

376
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:03,212
sexual abuse, exposure to drugs?"

377
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,378
- Oh, I just put "yes" to everything.
- I know, Beth.

378
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,462
And what makes you think
we can handle that?

379
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:09,321
And we're not talking
about a baby here.

380
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:12,148
This is an older kid with
potentially serious issues.

381
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:13,917
I don't know, I just do.

382
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,676
Do you think that's
a good enough answer?

383
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:18,087
Because once we tell the girls,
there's no turning back.

384
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,204
- What exactly are you saying?
- Maybe we can't handle this.

385
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,850
Maybe we're biting off
more than we can chew.

386
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:27,602
- Are you really serious right now?
- Yes.

387
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:32,751
- What? Are we not...?
- (sighs)

388
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,157
I guess we're picking up
the pace now? Is that it?

389
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:36,362
I thought...

390
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,235
Great.

391
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:39,790
Okay. Thanks.

392
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:44,759
- What? Who was that?
- (chuckles)

393
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:46,212
It was the house band

394
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:47,813
- that I sent my demo to.
- Shut up.

395
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,400
(chuckles) They need me
to fill in tonight.

396
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:51,369
- Their singer got strep throat.
- That is awesome.

397
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:54,345
I knew strep throat had a
purpose. Good for strep throat.

398
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,775
Okay. I'm gonna go
to the sound check.

399
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,032
- Okay.
- Sound check?

400
00:17:57,187 --> 00:17:58,488
Who has a sound check? For what?

401
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,649
Oh, it's not a big deal.

402
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,821
I... I got a singing gig for tonight.

403
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,368
What?

404
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,079
(chuckles): Kate, that's amazing.

405
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:09,188
Like I said, it's not a big deal, okay?

406
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,799
- So I'm gonna run, okay? You guys stay.
- Okay.

407
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,665
W-Wait. Wh-What, what um...

408
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,689
(clears throat)
What kind of place is it?

409
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,196
It's just, uh, you know,

410
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,322
a bar where people
sing at sometimes, so...

411
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,642
I remember when
I used to perform. Gosh.

412
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,923
The smoke was so thick you could
barely see through it. And...

413
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,056
...the first time I sang,

414
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,728
I don't think anybody was
even listening to me...

415
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,665
Wait, hold up. You used to sing?

416
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,071
(sighs) I'm sorry.

417
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,688
I'm a jackass, and I'm nervous.

418
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:40,017
It's okay.

419
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,157
- Bug, go-go break a leg.
- Go, go.

420
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:43,416
- All right. I love you.
- Bye, love you.

421
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,557
- I'll call you, okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

422
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,102
I'm sorry, that wasn't nice.

423
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,345
- ANNOUNCER: All right, everybody.
- Okay, okay.

424
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,890
It's time. You ready
to meet our cast?!

Excuse me.

How much for an hour?

429
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,376
The first one's on me.

430
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,657
Hey, you interested in training?

431
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:43,376
No. Just keeping a promise to my wife.

Hey. What's wrong?

You're crushing.

442
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,823
- Yeah.
- Don't you hear the crowd?

443
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:17,243
Casey adjusted the last scene.

444
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:19,142
He's trying to humiliate me.

445
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,668
I had this whole vision
of how this was gonna go.

446
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:23,587
It's gonna be mortifying.

447
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:27,063
Look, you came here to be Clooney.

448
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,139
Right? You think Clooney loved it
when he had to go back to <i>ER...</i>

449
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,601
You mean to reunite with
Julianna Margulies in Seattle?

450
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:34,896
Yeah, that's right.
I love that episode.

451
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,633
- Yeah.
- That was a bad example.

452
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,953
Look, Kevin, th-this stupid show
does not define you anymore.

453
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:43,387
Right? You-you came here
to do a job, to rise above.

454
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,342
So just be the bigger man.

455
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,547
Be Clooney.

456
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,273
Otherwise, what are we even doing here?

457
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:51,125
Hey, Kevin, uh, we need you
for the quick change.

458
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,164
Okay.

459
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:54,719
- Clooney.
- Mm.

460
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:56,633
I'm gonna Clooney the
hell out of this thing.

461
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:58,025
All right, thank you.

462
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:02,325
You know, I-I have a sister.

463
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:04,820
Her and my mom... oof!

464
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:06,212
- You know?
- Hmm.

465
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,504
Only time I fell through
a coffee table, that-that time.

466
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,872
(chuckles): That was not normal.

467
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,547
- (laughs): Of course.
- For...

468
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,110
Okay, I have to leave
and go to her show now.

469
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,512
This is her first real gig,
and I can't miss it,

470
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,914
so I hope you guys understand.

471
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,351
I do.

472
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,656
Ah, crap.

473
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:31,914
It's okay. I'll stay with the girls.

474
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,439
Thank you. Kevin will understand.

475
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,341
All right, yup.

476
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:36,398
Come on, come on.

477
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,895
Hey, superstar, are you
excited about tonight?

478
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:49,328
- I don't know.
- You don't know. What?!

479
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:51,721
What are you talking about?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

480
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:54,117
You do know that you are

481
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,054
the greatest singer
in this house, right?

482
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,812
And on the planet, and maybe
in the entire universe?

483
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,015
So I have a little surprise for you.

484
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,929
I made this from the first dress

485
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:07,258
that I wore the first time I performed

486
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:08,595
in front of a whole bunch of people.

487
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,992
And I was really nervous,
and I'm telling you,

488
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,818
wearing this gave me confidence.

489
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:15,547
So, I thought that you might
want to go upstairs

490
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:17,328
and try it on, and
maybe wear it tonight?

491
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:19,164
- Yeah.
- You do? Okay.

492
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:20,929
Go upstairs.
I'm gonna pop in the shower,

493
00:22:20,954 --> 00:22:22,563
and then I'll come in your room
and I'll help you get ready.

494
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:24,211

that has serious issues
that we're not prepared for?

Randall, no, we don't know what
kind of child we're gonna get,

510
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:15,251
but we didn't know what kind
of kids we were gonna get

511
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,376
the first two times, and they
turned out okay, didn't they?

512
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,094
But what if they didn't
turn out anything?

513
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,195
What if they were just
great to begin with?

514
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,437
- Don't you ever think about that?
- Think about what?

parents would talk about

519
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:35,586
their sleepless nights
and their terrible babies?

520
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:37,265
Remember how we used to have to fake it?

521
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:40,140
What parents pretend to be tired, Beth?

522
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:42,202
And now we're gonna potentially

523
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,219
introduce a kid
with these kind of issues

524
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,375
- into our home.
- Randall, you're being ridiculous.

525
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,992
And I think you're being reckless.

526
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,875
Randall, you wanted to adopt.

527
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,360
And now you're Randalling out
on me like this was my idea.

528
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:54,918
Okay, stop making my name a thing!

529
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,387
And yes, I wanted to adopt.

530
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:57,874
Got my head around that months ago...

531
00:23:57,898 --> 00:24:00,484
adopting a newborn,
clean-slate baby, like I was

532
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,320
when my parents found me,
but I'm worried, Beth.

533
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:05,179
Because that's what you do, Randall.

534
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:06,673
You worry, babe.

535
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,836
But we have talked about this a lot,

536
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,734
and we discussed
how difficult it could be,

537
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,515
and we came to a decision.

538
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,781
And now I'm jet-lagged,
you got me out here sweating,

539
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,789
and I traveled across country
to miss the taping of a sitcom

540
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:20,906
that I didn't want to come
see in the first place.

541
00:24:21,265 --> 00:24:26,250
So can we please just table
the convo until we get home?

542
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:27,945
Please?

543
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:32,823
I guess the part that concerns me, Beth,

544
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:34,204
- is that we just...
- Oh, my God, you're driving me nuts.

545
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:35,883
Mm-mm. I'm walking.

546
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,929
- Beth...
- I love you, but I'm walking.

547
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:42,937
♪

548
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,805
You sure you don't want
to sing, sweetheart?

549
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,296
You practiced so hard.

550
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,195
- I think that's why my throat hurts.
- Yeah?

551
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,719
Did you finish your cough drop?

552
00:24:57,992 --> 00:24:59,844
You know, I used to get really nervous

553
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,309
- before I sang...
- I don't want to.

554
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:03,679
Okay.

555
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:06,492
We'll get 'em next time then, Bug.

556
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:09,719
(applause)

557
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,953
Thank you. Hope you're all
having a great night.

I know it's not exactly your cup of tea.

621
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:44,383
Randall's driving me nuts.

622
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:47,633
Yeah? Yeah, I know, he'll do that.

623
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:51,406
We're adopting, you know...
well, fostering,

624
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:54,570
and now he's freaking out,
like we're not up for it.

625
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:56,865
He's freaking out
and second-guessing.

626
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,867
Yeah, well, I mean, he'll do that, too.

627
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,157
You know my brother
doesn't attempt anything

628
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,844
unless he's positive
he'll succeed at it, right?

629
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,164
I know it. I... I guess that's true.

630
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,515
I mean, there was this one time,

631
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,414
this... this one time his entire life.

632
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,809
It was in college, and, you
know, this girl at a party...

633
00:30:22,926 --> 00:30:25,820
This really, really, like,
badass, dreadlocked girl,

634
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:28,484
who was, by the way, like...
let's be honest...

635
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:31,125
17 times out of his nerdy,
sweater-vested-wearing league.

636
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,656
He had no shot in hell at her.

637
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:34,836
- But he, uh...
- (Beth laughs)

638
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:37,484
He asked her out anyway.
He called her on the phone.

639
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,804
Good God, he was so nervous,
he made me sweat.

640
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:40,906
Yeah, I bet.

641
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:43,429
I still remember his
opening line, you know?

642
00:30:43,454 --> 00:30:45,094
- Mm.
- It was so cheesy.

643
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,422
He was like, "You don't
know who I am, but..."

644
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:48,648
"But you're about to."

645
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:51,360
- Wait.
- I'm sorry, you thought

646
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:53,531
Randall had that kind of game at 19?

647
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:55,821
Who do you think was
Cyrano-ing the entire thing?

648
00:30:55,845 --> 00:30:57,212
Wait a minute. You?

649
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:59,836
You... Beth, you fell
for the Manny's game.

650
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,862
Now, you sit there,
and you just think about that

651
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:04,101
- for a second, little bit.
- Oh, no. It hurts.

652
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,593
- Yeah.
- Damn.

653
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:06,976
I got got.

654
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:10,554
You know, Beth, that's the only time

655
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,703
in my brother's entire life

656
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:13,797
that he's actually risked failure.

657
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:16,547
It's the only time.

658
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:20,312
You know how hard that was for him?

659
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,320
How scary that was for him?

660
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:23,656
The man was terrified.

661
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,547
You know I think you're funny, Kevin.

662
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:35,289
I know.

663
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,376
You laughed at all my jokes
that night on the phone.

664
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,977
Wait a minute.
You were on the line, too?

665
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,234
- Yep.
- Mm-mm. Forget it.

666
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,274
I don't even want to know.

667
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:43,399
- Some things are better left unsaid.
- (Groans)

668
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:50,117
Okay, so, I got your number.

669
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:51,586
Let's do this again sometime.

670
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:53,961
I would love that. Thanks.

671
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:55,484
- Yeah. See you.
- All right.

672
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:57,234
- G-Good night.
- Bye.

673
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,910
- That was great. That was great.
- Oh.

674
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:06,187
REBECCA: That was phenomenal.
Absolutely phenomenal.

675
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:08,320
And, I'm telling you, i-in time,

676
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:11,023
you will learn to power
through a crowd like this.

677
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:12,203
But it was amazing.

678
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,383
You see?

679
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:15,670
This is why I didn't want you to come.

680
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:17,883
Uh, I'm-I'm gonna...

681
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:19,570
I'm just gonna go pay the tab.

682
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,399
Even though we didn't
get anything. Yeah. Okay.

683
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:25,719
(sighs) You know what?

684
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,226
No, I told myself...

685
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:29,812
I wasn't gonna do this;
I wasn't gonna end

686
00:32:29,837 --> 00:32:32,506
this visit feeling bad,
you know, about what I've said

687
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:34,132
or what I haven't said to you, so...

688
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:35,643
I'm just not gonna say anything.

689
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:37,844
Kate.

690
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:41,336
Sweetheart, you sang

You should be so happy right now.

692

- Mm-hmm.

693

Why do you do that?

694
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:50,851
Do what? I'm complimenting you.
I'm proud of you.

695

No, you feel sorry for me.

697

You overcompensate for me, Mom,
and you always have.

And here I am, a 37-year-old woman,

to make you feel like that?

702
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,390
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Kate.

703
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:14,906
- I want to know. What have I ever done?
- You existed.

704
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:20,675
- It's everything about you, Mom.
- (sighs)

705
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:24,375
It's not just that you're
beautiful or thin.

706

Or that you have perfect pitch
even when you talk.

- No. No.

Well, you did it, Ma.

You got me to say
terrible, unfair things.

Least you could do
is say something terrible back.

Okay, okay. B-Between you and me,
