1
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,336
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,871
You know,

3
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,307
you don't need to stick around
here for my court hearing.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,476
Yeah, no, I really do need
to stick around here

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,944
for your court hearing. I told
your vet counselor that I would.

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,050
Mr. and Mrs. Hodges,

7
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:18,152
I'm sorry for skipping school

8
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:19,553
with Malik, but I am not sorry

9
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:20,854
for yesterday because that was

10
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,923
the best day of my life.

11
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,395
Okay. Pick a letter.

12
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:30,698
- Any letter.
. Um...

13
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,832
"Z."

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,768
- "Z." I got it.
- Yeah, thanks.

15
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,370
Zachary.

16
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:37,771
Okay.

17
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,039
Zeke.

18
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,175
Zeppelin.

19
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,377
Ooh. But what if
they're all girls?

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,779
Zoe?

21
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,549
Zophie.

22
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,253
-Zusan.
-No, you can't just put Zs
on "S" names.

23
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,055
I'm telling you, Jack,

24
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,890
we can never go back there.

25
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,360
Kevin bit the librarian.

26
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,861
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

27
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,030
He bit her on her face
with intent.

28
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,365
Okay, so, the kids

29
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,033
are never gonna learn how
to read. It's no big deal.

30
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,602
-Parachute! Parachute!
-What?

31
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:09,937
-Parachute!
-Okay, okay.

32
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,040
Parachute it is.
There you go. And...

33
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,076
parachute!

34
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,878
- Ooh!
- Parachute.

35
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,948
I dropped Kevin at Sophie's,

36
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,284
Randall at the library,

37
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,387
Kate at the mall,
and I fixed that annoying rattle

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,890
in the Wagoneer,
and all before lunch.

39
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,059
I mean, it's a bird.
It's a plane. It's Super Dad.

40
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,962
Well, look at you,
man of the year.

41
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,630
Couldn't do it without you.

42
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,566
Well, you'll never have to.

43
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,201
Yeah.

44
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:59,883
<font color="#FFA500"> Extracted from MKV & Synchronized By Hisoka Oni </font></font>

45
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,123
I think the spray arm is broken.

46
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,627
So I don't need
a whole new dishwasher?

47
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,529
Thank God.
That is the last thing

48
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,531
I need right now.

49
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,866
I got it!
Don't get it. I'll get it.

50
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,706
Hey.

51
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,973
I missed you, babe.

52
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,676
Yeah? Prove it.

53
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,379
Hey.

54
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:26,780
-What's up, Randy?
-What's up?

55
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,148
How you doing, man?
Hey, Rebecca.

56
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,317
- Hi, Marc.
- How's it going?

57
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,618
Damn, college boy.

58
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,685
What, back for more laundry?

59
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,920
You're here, like,
every weekend.

60
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,157
-Hey, Bug, that's not lunch.
-I know.

61
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,492
I'll get something
at the movies.

62
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,828
Beth and I just saw
Practical Magic.

63
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,030
The one with Sandra Bullock
and Nicole Kidman together.

64
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,665
- I've been dying
to see that.

65
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,900
But we're not 12-year-old girls.

66
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,969
- You ready?
Good to go? All right.
- Yeah.

67
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,305
- All right.
Rebecca, good to see you.
Bye, guys.

68
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,341
-Have fun.
-Randy, good to see you.

69
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,212
What does Kate see in that guy?

70
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:02,416
Honestly, I'm just happy
that she's happy.

71
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,553
And you, Mom? How you doing?

72
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,721
These mortgage payments
are eating away

73
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,390
at what's left
of the insurance money,

74
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,192
and I really need to get a job,
but I'm not...

75
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,061
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,329
I'm sorry. I-I...

77
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,365
I don't want you to worry.

78
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,734
Since I'm already here,

79
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,202
you know,
we could look at your résumé.

80
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,573
That is a very sweet
but unnecessary offer.

81
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,208
And I'm sure you have a ton of
schoolwork you have to work on.

82
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,743
I already knocked out
next week's reading,

83
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,579
Mom, I'm a huge nerd.

84
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,981
Résumés are my jam.
Like, I live for them.

85
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,944
Look, um, Cassidy...

86
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:06,614
We're both adults.

87
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,949
You're single. I'm separated.

88
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,385
Nobody did anything wrong.

89
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,587
You're okay, though?

90
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,988
Because the last thing
I want to do

91
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,391
is make your life
more complicated.

92
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,327
I'm fine.

93
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,464
- I'll...
- You'll what?

94
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,367
You'll call me?

95
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,603
Probably not.

96
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,654
You slept with her, didn't you?

97
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,290
That's why Cassidy hasn't been
at AA all week?

98
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,027
Not gonna talk about that
with you.

99
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,529
Let me ask you something.

100
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,799
Just out of curiosity here.

101
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,901
What's wrong with you?

102
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:07,307
I mean,
I thought you were trying

103
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,143
to help the poor kid fix
her marriage, not destroy it.

104
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:13,313
You're like
a human wrecking ball.

105
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,851
Yeah.

106
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,522
Yeah, thanks for the pep talk.

107
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,991
- No, I'm serious.
- Explain it to me.

108
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,193
What kind of person
does that?

109
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,936
Shame on you.

110
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,941
Shame on you.

111
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,854
I'm so glad

112
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,423
I could make it out early
for Thanksgiving.

113
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,759
The house is gorgeous.

114
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,094
Miguel is gonna love

115
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,430
all these period details.

116
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,897
How's his visit
with his kids going?

117
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,899
It's good.

118
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,735
He is gonna take the train down

119
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,102
from New York
in time for dinner, though.

120
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,103
Okay.

121
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,072
Mom and I are off
for our tour of Philly.

122
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,041
Tess, Annie, let's go, girls.

123
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,910
The playdate express
is leaving the station.

124
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,279
Can't wait for some quality
"R" and "R" time.

125
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,683
That's, 
that's Randall and Rebecca.

126
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,384
-I know, baby. I know.
-See what I'm saying?

127
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,886
- Hey.
- What?

128
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,221
That is for Deja
and Malik's movie date.

129
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,890
It's not a date.

130
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,025
A date is when
you go out somewhere alone.

131
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,393
Well, them's the rules.

132
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,795
Chaperoned dates only.

133
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,229
We all agreed.

134
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,131
Besides,
you won't even know I'm here.

135
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,367
You'll be in the living room.
I'll stay in the kitchen.

136
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,636
The kitchen and the living room
are the same room.

137
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,909
I just want him to take

138
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,978
one bite of the banana.

139
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,114
He should've tried solid food
at least two weeks ago.

140
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,116
Here's a theory.

141
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,751
Maybe baby doesn't like banana.

142
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,787
Everybody likes banana.
It's the healthy snack

143
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,555
-that comes in its own wrapper.
-Well,

144
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,423
-maybe we could try
something else.
-Well, no.

145
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,325
We can't, because you can only
introduce one food at a time

146
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,827
in case there's
an allergic reaction.

147
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,261
That's why I made
the baby food chart

148
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,063
to match the daddy food chart.

149
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,832
Right.

150
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,601
Well, then, Jack,

151
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,935
it's boob juice until dinner.

152
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,437
I got to squeeze in a gym sesh
before my staff meeting,

153
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,672
so maybe we'll try again later.

154
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,340
You know what? I really want

155
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,075
-to keep trying now.
-No, babe, babe, babe.

156
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,276
Please wait for me, all right?

157
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,579
I already missed first rollover

158
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,414
and first sit up.
I don't want to miss

159
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,416
first solid food.

160
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,085
- But I'll try to leave work
early, okay?-

161
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,521
-I love you, Kate.
-Love you.

162
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,522
Jack.

163
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,856
Mwah. Okay, bye.

164
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,958
Did you feel Daddy's kiss?

165
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,466
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

166
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,502
I don't have bacon.

167
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,538
I don't have eggs.

168
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,840
But I got coffee.

169
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,875
Hey.

170
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,210
Kevin, look, 
you know, my...

171
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,847
my court hearing's
this afternoon.

172
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,786
I'm sorry if I was rough on you
the other day,

173
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,722
but you've beaten yourself up
enough. I'm coming in.

174
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,208
Yeah?

175
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,643
Hey, it's Nicky.

176
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,679
Um, is the kid with you?

177
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,881
No, we haven't spoken all week.

178
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,415
Well, he's just...
He's locked himself

179
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,985
in the trailer
since you morons slept together.

180
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,088
But now he's gone,
and he left his phone here.

181
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,223
It's not like him
to just take off.

182
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,493
Nicky, I've got my own crap
going on over here.

183
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,495
I mean, I just... I just signed
the divorce papers.

184
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,764
Cassidy, how many times

185
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,933
have I ever picked up the phone
and called you?

186
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,536
Yeah. Right, okay.

187
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,405
I'm on my way.

188
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,548
I think I overdressed
for this interview.

189
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,383
Kaufmann's would be lucky
to have you.

190
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,187
Thank you for all your help,
sweetheart.

191
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,422
I really appreciate it.

192
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,061
But you don't have to worry
about me, okay?

193
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,163
Ever.

194
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,569
So, if you could, 
picture me grocery shopping

195
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,071
with three toddlers,
you'll understand

196
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,940
I know all about multitasking.

197
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,474
I'm sure you do.

198
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,310
- Yeah.
- Triplets. Wow.

199
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,913
- Yeah.
- You're familiar

200
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,982
with our purchasing
and scheduling software?

201
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,452
If I'm honest, I-I'm not.

202
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,621
But I am computer proficient,

203
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,723
and I type 85 words a minute,
so...

204
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,660
I'm sure I can handle
whatever software you use.

205
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,905
Mr. Simons,

206
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,940
-thank you so much
for your time.
-Sure.

207
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,279
-How'd it go?
-Okay.

208
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,682
I think I sweat out
all the liquid in my body.

209
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,917
I'm gonna go freshen up
for a second.

210
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,451
Do you want to grab the car?

211
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,420
Okay, thanks.

212
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,356
- I'll need to see
some more applicants.

213
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,198
No, I didn't, so we...

214
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,833
Rebecca Pearson is here!

215
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,367
Mrs. Pearson,
so good to see you again.

216
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,603
- Hi. A hug. Ooh!
- Hi. Welcome.

217
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,472
You know, Randall tells
a lot of stories

218
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,509
about his family,
like, a lot a lot.

219
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,644
Like, more than anyone, ever,
in human history.

220
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,646
Okay, let's give her
some space, please.

221
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,181
You guys are very sweet.

222
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,451
I am just...
I'm very proud of Randall.

223
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,821
My son, the congressman.

224
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,856
It's, councilman, Mom.

225
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,390
- I'm a councilman.
- Congressman, no.

226
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,859
-Councilman.
-Hey, I... I like

227
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,394
-the sound of that.
-Hey, one job at a time,
Jae-Dubs.

228
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,964
- Now, is it okay
if I take pictures?
Of course.

229
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,132
Yeah? You don't mind?

230
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,067
- No.
- All right. Maybe...

231
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,636
-You want to see
the rest of the office?
-the two of you. Ready?

232
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,338
One, two, three.

233
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,240
- Nice. 
- Jae-Won. Nice.

234
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,542
- Randall Pearson.
- Yeah.

235
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,745
-There's more to it, Mom.
-No, I know.

236
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,180
I just want to take pictures
along the way. All right.

237
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,681
Wow.

238
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:22,883
I like these maps, too.

239
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,517
This carpet is really...

240
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,086
I just want to make sure

241
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,688
I get every angle here.

242
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,690
-Let me see.
This is your office?
-Yes, ma'am.

243
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,025
Right here.

244
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,693
Wow, look at the desk.

245
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,938
Hi. Are you okay?

246
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,506
It's time for our walk.

247
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,175
I'm having a bad morning.

248
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,342
Join the club.

249
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,011
No. Seriously.

250
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,413
Bad mornings are worse for
people who had massive strokes.

251
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,614
I've got muscle spasms.

252
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,183
Maybe tomorrow.

253
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,118
Do you need help?

254
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,757
All right, well,
don't just stand there.

255
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,158
You're letting the bugs in.

256
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,062
-Hey.
-Hey.

257
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,163
Hey.

258
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,700
Hey-hey!

259
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,803
Hey, Mrs....
Mrs. Pearson. Um,

260
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,971
thank you so much
for having me over.

261
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,907
What's that, popcorn?

262
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,308
Okay, you two,

263
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,877
just pretend I'm not here.

264
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,646
But also remember,
I will be here the whole time.

265
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,550
Neh!

266
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,086
You gonna take it?

267
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,254
Neh! You got to be fast.

268
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,588
All right, just take it.

269
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,790
Have fun, y'all.

270
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,094
So, I told you what
happened when I took my wife

271
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,996
out to Pittsburgh
to do some shopping last week.

272
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,833
Okay, so, we found this...

273
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,769
So, as he comes by us,

274
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,771
Crosby bumps our table,

275
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,506
knocks over her glass,

276
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,309
gets red wine
all down her dress.

277
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,911
So I sucker-punch him.

278
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,813
You sucker-punched
Sidney Crosby?

279
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,281
It was a new dress.

280
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,750
Another club soda?

281
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,985
Yeah.

282
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,790
Just so we're clear,

283
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,626
you're telling a story
about how you sucker-punched

284
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,296
Pittsburgh Penguins captain
Sidney Crosby

285
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,331
for accidentally spilling wine

286
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,799
on your wife's dress?

287
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,101
Yeah.

288
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,535
Okay.

289
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,704
I mean,
there's no way that happened.

290
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,473
But... but okay.

291
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,308
Buddy...

292
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,978
you looking for trouble?

293
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,313
No, no, I don't have
to look for trouble.

294
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,448
Trouble always finds me.

295
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,784
Like a human wrecking ball,
actually.

296
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,021
Aren't you that actor that's
been hanging around town?

297
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,991
Let me ask you a question.
Do you love your wife?

298
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,193
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

299
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,460
She love you?

300
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,196
Of course.

301
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,965
I bet you a hundred bucks I can
get her to take her clothes off

302
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,166
within 20 minutes
of meeting her.

303
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,701
What did you say?

304
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,170
Actually, you know what,
I might have overshot.

305
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,007
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Here, I'll bet you ten dollars

306
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,575
that I can get your wife
out of that wine-stained dress

307
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,177
within five minutes
of meeting her.

308
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,813
What do you think?

309
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,748
There it is. Come on.

310
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,659
Can I help you?

311
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,594
I'm Rebecca Pearson's son.

312
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,363
Sh-she was just in here.

313
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,665
She and my father adopted me

314
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,767
when I was left
at a fire station

315
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,502
and raised me as their own.

316
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,538
That's the kind
of person she is.

317
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,373
Did she tell you that?

318
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,774
No.

319
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,410
That's also the kind
of person she is.

320
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,846
Did she tell you
my father died last year,

321
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,414
saving our lives
in a house fire?

322
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,585
Jesus.

323
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,787
-No.
-Of course not.

324
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,923
Because...
she's not the type of person

325
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,359
to tell you a sob story
to try to get a job.

326
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,860
But you are?

327
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,795
Absolutely.

328
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,632
Your mom's lucky to have you.

329
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,135
I can barely get my son
to return my calls.

330
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,973
She seems like a great person.

331
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,941
She certainly raised
a great kid.

332
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,311
But she doesn't know how
to use the software,

333
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,413
and I don't have the time
to train her.

334
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,317
Sir, I graduated
top of my class.

335
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,620
I have a full scholarship
with Carnegie Mellon.

336
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,889
I'll teach her any software
you need by Monday morning.

337
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,624
Please.

338
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,460
Sh-She just needs a chance.

339
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,266
Hey.

340
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,569
I was just grabbing my bag.

341
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,006
-You ready?
-Yeah.

342
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,446
Everybody's all about

343
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,947
the Philly cheesesteak...

344
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,650
...but my money's
on the roast pork from DiNic's

345
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,085
as the best sandwich
in Philadelphia.

346
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,853
I ordered these in special.

347
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,622
- It's delicious. 
- Right?

348
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,590
All right, so...

349
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,992
...tell me about life in L.A.

350
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,595
Um...

351
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,631
it's-it's lovely.

352
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,700
That's it?

353
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,803
-Any celebrity sightings?
-No.

354
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,672
Don't you want to complain
about the traffic

355
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,941
- or how there's no weather?
. No.

356
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,677
I want to show you pictures
of the baby.

357
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,013
Okay.

358
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,350
Where is my phone?

359
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,286
I just had it.

360
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,655
-Mom, it's okay.
-Come on. No,

361
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,223
it was really expensive.

362
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,993
And Miguel splurged
when I told him not to.

363
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,562
I'm sure it's in here. Hey.

364
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,896
Where could it be?

365
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,398
I mean, I just had it.

366
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,000
-Are you kidding me?
-Mom, it's okay.

367
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,735
-I'll just call it.
-I really need

368
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,871
to find my phone,
though, Randall.

369
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,506
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay? Can you help me, please?

370
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,975
Yes, ma'am. Hey, guys.

371
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,710
- Has anybody seen
my mom's phone?

372
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,911
No, I hear it.

373
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,882
- Is it this?
- Hey!

374
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,917
- Hey!
! Okay.

375
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,986
-Crisis averted, Mrs. Pearson.
-There it is. Thank you.

376
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,089
I'm so sorry.

377
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:05,858
Um, okay, now I'm gonna show you
pictures of your nephew.

378
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,398
-Come on, sweetheart.
-Yes.

379
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,865
Look at this picture.

380
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,835
Look at that one.

381
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,970
Look at his little face.

382
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,343
I'm not talking
about this anymore.

383
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,245
I thought you said
you wanted to.

384
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:29,048
I told you...
it's just the way it is.

385
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,551
Okay, so you can't even
talk to them about it? I mean,

386
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,353
I don't get why you won't
just have the conversation.

387
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,156
And I don't get why you
can't take no for an answer.

388
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,128
Deja.

389
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,275
-Anything you want
to talk about?
-Just...

390
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,245
please tell him to leave.

391
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,082
Hey, Malik?

392
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,287
I think it's best
if you go home.

393
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:13,059
Yeah. Yeah, no, it was...
completely my fault.

394
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,894
I pushed her too hard, so...

395
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,329
Yeah.

396
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,331
You pushed her too hard.

397
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,733
And what... what was it,
exactly?

398
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,170
It's not my place.

399
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,671
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,239
Malik,

401
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,907
if you push my daughter

402
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,576
on something that makes her
uncomfortable,

403
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,011
I have the right
to know what's up.

404
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,486
Deja wants to see her mom.

405
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,355
Her birth mom.

406
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,158
That's what's up.

407
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,330
- Okay.
- Now, this is service.

408
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,533
-Thank you.
-Sure.

409
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,436
I'm happy you came by. Really.

410
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,272
Are you?
'Cause you don't act like it.

411
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,274
Yeah, I know.
Ever since the stroke,

412
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,476
I have trouble making
my voice and face

413
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,978
express empathy and gratitude.

414
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,814
Doesn't mean I don't have any.

415
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,791
Hey.

416
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,560
We've been looking for you.

417
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,033
Hey, come on.

418
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,206
Wha...?

419
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,208
It's a funny story.

420
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,410
Did you win?

421
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,849
Did you drink?

422
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,518
No.

423
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,954
I thought about it, but no.

424
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,423
Come on.

425
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,091
Let's go.

426
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,940
Well...

427
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,909
I better go get changed.

428
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,178
Why, you got a hot date?

429
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,113
It's Wednesday.

430
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,989
You actually forgot.

431
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,759
No, your hearing.

432
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:27,960
Of course. Yes.

433
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,862
I...

434
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,398
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,269
You're sorry.

436
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,139
You're sorry.

437
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,379
Well, I'm sure that'll be
a big help with the judge,

438
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,948
that my character witness
looks like he went 12 rounds

439
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,283
with Mike Tyson.

440
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,252
But you know what?
Just forget it.

441
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:57,256
I mean, I'm the idiot who threw
the chair through the window.

442
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:12,071
"I'm sorry" is like a...

443
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,807
It's like a magic word
when you're a kid.

444
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,009
Doesn't matter what you did.

445
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:20,179
Say you're sorry
and it all goes away.

446
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,016
Then you grow up, and it just...

447
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,853
doesn't work anymore, does it?

448
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,591
No, it doesn't.

449
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,461
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,196
Me, too.

451
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,700
See what I mean?

452
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,169
Yeah.

453
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,114
A little concealer
should do the trick.

454
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,384
I will say, for a Marine,

455
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,951
you've got
a pretty gentle touch.

456
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,187
Well, whoever busted up
your face was an amateur.

457
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,289
You wouldn't want to see what
a professional can do to you.

458
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,695
Growing up,

459
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:09,862
my dad,

460
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,799
he-he flew a Cessna 150.

461
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,668
He called it
The Screaming Eagle.

462
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,870
Named it after
the 101st Airborne Division.

463
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,640
He was so proud
to be in the 101st.

464
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,475
I didn't know your dad served.

465
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,544
You never mentioned that.

466
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,546
Well, not all of us have to talk

467
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,214
about our dead dads
all the time.

468
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,919
Okay.

469
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:36,155
I never found what my dad did
in the military, though.

470
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,725
Bravery. Heroism.

471
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,827
I kept chasing it.

472
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,997
I enlisted again and again,
thinking...

473
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,567
"This time I'll feel it."

474
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,538
I tried and I tried until...

475
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:55,575
I just ended up destroying
everything I had back home.

476
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:02,549
It wasn't you who destroyed
my marriage, Kevin.

477
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,185
I did that all by myself,

478
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,955
way before I met you.

479
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:14,894
All right.

480
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,395
I did my best.

481
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,731
There's only so much I can do
to fix a face like yours.

482
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,307
You know, Cassidy,
it's not too late

483
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,876
to put your family
back together.

484
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,980
I signed the divorce papers
yesterday.

485
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,749
Today is Wednesday.

486
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:41,654
Matty has swimming lessons
every Wednesday.

487
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,289
And, afterwards,

488
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:47,059
Ryan takes him to the diner
on Hawthorne for dinner.

489
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,663
Every Wednesday night, I park
across the street and I watch

490
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:55,101
and I try to work up the courage
to walk in and join them.

491
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,706
And I can't do it anymore.

492
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,975
I'm gonna call it a day.

493
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,814
Okay, kids.

494
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,653
time to face the music.

495
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,155
Could you cut an avocado in half
for me?

496
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,157
-Yeah.
-If I try it myself,

497
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,026
it's fifty-fifty
I lose a finger.

498
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,528
And I've only got five left
that work.

499
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,167
Thank you.

500
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,102
Jack, what do you think?

501
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,504
- You want to try some?
- You can try,

502
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,640
but this kid
does not eat anything.

503
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,708
Open up. Here it comes.

504
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,711
It's like guacamole.

505
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,947
There you go.

506
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,948
Wait, what?

507
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,683
Buddy, you did it!

508
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,452
Look at you.

509
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,954
My-- This is...

510
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,757
Well, this is terrible timing.

511
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,462
Sh-She wants to see
her birth mom.

512
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,966
But she doesn't feel like she
can talk to you guys about it.

513
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,968
She really did not like it
when I pushed her on it,

514
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,370
which... again, I did,

515
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,338
like an idiot.

516
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:07,974
God. What if I blew it?

517
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,709
What if she's over me?
I mean, the-the best girl

518
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:10,710
-in the world and...
-Hey, Malik,

519
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,545
-I need you to focus, okay?
-Yeah.

520
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:16,348
Deja knows that she can talk
to us about anything.

521
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,485
Okay.

522
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,820
"Okay"?

523
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,055
What's-what's that
supposed to mean?

524
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:29,095
Well, she did...
talk to you guys about it.

525
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,863
A while ago.

526
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,032
I guess you just
kind of let it slide.

527
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,867
No, we didn't.

528
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,169
Did you take her to see her mom?

529
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,172
No, but that's because
everything just got so busy.

530
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,608
Okay.

531
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,309
Malik, you "okay" me
one more time...

532
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,713
Off the record.

533
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:47,714
Yeah?

534
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,916
Just say it.

535
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,453
Well, Randall ran
for city council.

536
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,288
You guys moved to Philly.

537
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:58,791
You opened a dance studio.

538
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:02,094
I mean, you weren't too busy
for any of that stuff.

539
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,666
*

540
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,979
Hey.

541
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,313
Yo.

542
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,717
Dude.

543
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,719
-What?
-Well, your tie is a disaster.

544
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,756
-What-what is this?
-What? I...

545
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,590
I haven't worn one of these
since the prom.

546
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:32,992
Okay, I got you.

547
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,627
Look at that.

548
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,028
That's sharp.

549
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,401
Uncle Nicky.

550
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,736
Hey.

551
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,308
You got this.

552
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,310
We got this.

553
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,345
All rise.

554
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,985
Uncle Nicky.

555
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:20,840
Miguel's train is on time.

556
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,016
There's a very persistent
young man downstairs

557
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,518
who won't leave
until you come talk to him.

558
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,754
Then he'll be waiting
a long time.

559
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:42,161
Deja, I'm sorry we haven't taken
you to see Shauna.

560
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,164
What, he told you?

561
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,466
No, Beth,
he shouldn't have said that.

562
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,667
-It's no big deal.
-Hey. Yes, it is.

563
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,203
It's a very big deal.

564
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:58,410
I don't want you
to think that...

565
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,179
I'm ungrateful

566
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,248
for everything you and Randall
do for me.

567
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,751
That-That's why I didn't want
to say anything.

568
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,385
That's why I got so mad
at Malik.

569
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,220
Hey.

570
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,222
We're gonna look at a calendar

571
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,691
and find a good time to visit.

572
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,061
I promise.

573
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,201
Beth.

574
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,071
Um...

575
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:28,674
I'd actually like
to invite her here.

576
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,177
For Thanksgiving.

577
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,579
If that's okay.

578
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,614
Okay.

579
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:39,051
Yeah.

580
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,760
Okay.

581
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,596
I got a bunch
of mushy, nutritious stuff.

582
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,699
All right, we ready?

583
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,534
I'm sorry I ran out
this morning,

584
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,736
but now I'm here, I'm all in,

585
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,739
and I brought a smorgasbord
of solid food options.

586
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,175
Wait, what are those?

587
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,280
Are these
perfectly ripe avocados?

588
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,049
Um...

589
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,985
Yeah, they're
from Gregory's tree next door.

590
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:15,254
All of the avos at Trader Joe's
were hard and green,

591
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,956
like the Hulk's calf muscles.

592
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,159
These are
quintessentially California

593
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,727
first solid food.

594
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,229
This is gonna be great.

595
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,798
Thank you, Gregory.

596
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,633
All right.

597
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,136
Let me get my phone. Hold
on, let me get my phone. Okay.

598
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,138
Ladies and gentlemen,

599
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,940
Baby Jack Damon.

600
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,908
First solid food.

601
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,810
Can you hear the spoon?
You hear it?

602
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,813
- Here comes a spoonful
of ripe avocado.

603
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,185
He did it.

604
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,187
Kate, he did it, he's eating it.

605
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,922
First solid food, buddy.

606
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,658
Today was the day!

607
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,128
You want a little more, buddy?

608
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,030
Here you go.

609
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:00,466
Mr. Pearson,
I've reviewed your case,

610
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,634
and I'm willing to consider
the pretrial diversion

611
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,803
advocated by the prosecution.

612
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,472
But I have one question.

613
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,241
Do you feel remorse
for what you did?

614
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,916
Not really.

615
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,855
I mean, throwing that chair...

616
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:28,294
...was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

617
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,030
If I didn't throw that chair
through the window,

618
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:34,466
I wouldn't have stopped
drinking,

619
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,969
wouldn't have joined AA

620
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,838
or stuck with therapy.

621
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,840
When I threw that chair,

622
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,843
my-my nephew came back
into my life.

623
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,013
No matter
how much I told him to scram,

624
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,015
he just stuck around.

625
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,885
For 40 years,

626
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,687
I have pushed people away.

627
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,590
Not because I-I thought
they would hurt me

628
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:03,195
but because I thought
I would hurt them.

629
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:07,266
I told myself I was doing it
for their own good,

630
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,868
yeah, 'cause I'm broken.

631
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,770
But...

632
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:15,207
but I was wrong.

633
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,744
I wasn't broken.

634
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,314
I was sick.

635
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,919
And when you're sick,

636
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:30,256
you...

637
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,258
you got to let the people

638
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:36,395
who care about you help.

639
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,597
*

640
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:54,246
No matter what that judge says,
he did it.

641
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,150
He turned his life around,
forgave himself.

642
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:00,919
Puts things in perspective,
doesn't it?

643
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,029
Mr. Pearson.

644
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,966
I will sign off
on the diversion.

645
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,801
As long as you remain
in treatment

646
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,336
and don't re-offend
for two years,

647
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,737
all charges will be expunged

648
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,805
from your record.

649
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,347
Look, I'm sorry about before.

650
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,682
Nah, no matter how sorry
you think you are,

651
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:32,584
- I'm definitely more sorry.
- No.

652
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,854
I'm, like, the sorriest dude
in the history of sorry dudes.

653
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,324
I'm going to the pantry.

654
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:42,328
You'll be unsupervised
for the next 30 seconds.

655
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:55,707
Okay, that's enough!

656
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,209
You get on out of here, Malik.

657
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,885
I have a feeling that your
little performance at dinner

658
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,487
has more to do about me
than Andre.

659
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,888
Hey, guys.

660
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,323
-Hey.
-Hello.

661
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,524
-Hi.
-Hi.

662
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,526
Well, how was R & R time?

663
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,195
It was lovely.

664
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:19,398
Randall was the perfect
tour guide, of course.

665
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,301
-Hi.
-And I took about a million
pictures on my phone.

666
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,869
She was glued to that phone
all day,

667
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,371
except when she lost it.

668
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,972
What? Again?

669
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,374
I had to buy her
that new phone

670
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:29,741
'cause she lost the last one.

671
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:32,544
Now, the two of you
just leave me be.

672
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,281
I did not lose it, Randall.

673
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,917
Can I talk to you
about Thanksgiving?

674
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,455
What's wrong?

675
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,359
Nothing.

676
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,541
Here we are.

677
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,744
What are you gonna say?

678
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,447
If he won't even let me
sit down and join them,

679
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,349
I'll just...

680
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,618
give him the divorce papers
and walk out.

681
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,054
If he does...?

682
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,457
I'll think of something.

683
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,127
Well, don't be me, Cassidy.

684
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,330
Don't let it take 40 years
to get better.

685
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,433
You're the best cautionary tale

686
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,268
a girl could ask for.

687
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,076
When do you leave town?

688
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,579
I'm going to Philly
for Thanksgiving,

689
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:44,416
and then I'm back to L.A.

690
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:52,758
You know, the thing I did find
in the Marine Corps

691
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,826
was the thing
I wasn't looking for.

692
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,395
Friendship.

693
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,963
Community.

694
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:01,099
Over there, those guys
were my family, you know?

695
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:04,102
Then I got back here
and it was like I...

696
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,672
moved to another country
without a map.

697
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:14,045
Thanks for helping me
find my way home.

698
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,518
*

699
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,522
Hey.

700
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,194
I hope you find
your happy ending, Kevin.

701
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:31,897
I hope you find yours, too.

702
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,139
*

703
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,851
*

704
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,203
*

705
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,842
Now, of course I will.

706
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,244
Yes.

707
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,479
That is very kind of you.

708
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,047
Thank you so much.

709
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,216
Okay, bye-bye.

710
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,722
I got it.

711
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:31,990
Hey, Mom.

712
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,425
That's awesome.

713
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:35,927
-I knew you nailed it.
-Well.

714
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,063
So, now that I actually
got the job,

715
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:41,032
were you gonna tell me
what you said to Mr. Simons?

716
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:44,436
-What?
-Randall.

717
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,775
You just seemed so down
on yourself.

718
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,244
I just want people to see you
the way I do.

719
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,620
You...

720
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,122
You're so much like your father.

721
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,891
You know that?

722
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,628
It makes me... very proud.

723
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,129
Very proud.

724
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,537
I cannot believe I'm starting

725
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,240
an entry-level position
at my age.

726
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:27,513
I never would have seen
this coming.

727
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,852
Not in a million years.

728
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,558
-Sorry, I'm sorry...
-Mom, it's okay.

729
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,259
Shouldn't be putting any
of this on you, sweetheart.

730
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,094
I mean...

731
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,263
I am the parent
and you're the kid.

732
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,300
You know, you should be out
there having fun with Beth.

733
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:51,603
I don't need you
to worry about me. I promise.

734
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,739
I'm just happy that you need

735
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,507
to come here to do your laundry.

736
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,810
Mom, they have laundry
at the dorms.

737
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,946
I come back for R & R time.

738
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,350
Randall, Rebecca.

739
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,753
God, that was
one of the lamest things

740
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,321
-I've ever said, wasn't it?
-It was pretty lame. Yes.

741
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,456
Yeah, it was.

742
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,157
But I loved it.

743
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,977
Hi.

744
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,979
Hey.

745
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:52,163
You don't seem
like yourself today.

746
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,866
You had a few, mix-ups.

747
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,503
Yeah.

748
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:01,039
Miguel calls them
"senior moments."

749
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,376
Yeah, I get it.

750
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,413
But this felt like, 
a little more than that.

751
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,080
The whole thing with the phone.

752
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,183
I'm fine, Randall.

753
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:16,054
I'm fine.
I'm just... getting older.

754
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,690
-I don't recommend it.
-I know.

755
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:21,326
I'm sure it's nothing.

756
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,563
I was just wondering
if you've seen a doctor lately.

757
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,665
You know, I could call around,

758
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,600
set something up for you
while you're in town.

759
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,602
I'm only here for a few days

760
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:33,071
and I barely get to see
my granddaughters.

761
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,340
I'm not, I'm not gonna
go see some doctor

762
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,175
just because
you're overreacting.

763
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,376
I'm just worried
that there could...

764
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,845
-I said I'm fine.
-Mom.

765
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,047
Randall, enough.

766
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,682
Okay?

767
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,917
I'm still the parent here
and you're still the son,

768
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,318
in case you've forgotten.

769
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,924
Okay.

770
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,093
Okay, what?

771
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,362
- Forget it, it's all good.
- No, no, no, no.

772
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,598
If you want to say something,
go ahead and say it.

773
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:02,267
Mom, the only thing that I want
to say is that I love you.

774
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,570
And I'm concerned.

775
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:07,372
You're acting
extremely defensive

776
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,107
over absolutely nothing
right now,

777
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,410
and that's only making me
more concerned.

778
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:15,914
And for you to say that you're
the mother and I'm the son

779
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,717
after 20 years of...

780
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,252
- Of what?
- Nothing.

781
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,421
I didn't say anything.

782
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,991
Yeah, you did.

783
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:29,127
You said something very clearly.

784
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,631
And it was cruel.

785
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,533
And it was beneath you.

786
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,005
You know what? I'm tired.

787
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,073
I think I need to lay down
for a minute,

788
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,876
so could you... please leave?

789
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,649
Yeah.

790
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,493
*

791
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:17,375
Man.

792
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:21,513
Hey, you should come
to Philly with me.

793
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:25,050
For Thanksgiving.

794
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,153
I know the family
would love to see you.

795
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,524
I could do that.

796
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:35,226
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

797
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,897
Hey.

798
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:43,068
You're a good kid.

799
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:51,710
You're a good kid.

800
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:06,157
*

801
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,161
Who's my good boy?

802
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,963
Me.
