1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:02,579
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,679
Randall, I don't look
at you and see color.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,681
Then you don't see me, Dad.

4
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:10,116
Mr. Lawrence. Would you and your wife

5
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,517
like to come to the house
this weekend for dinner?

6
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:15,188
Mr. Pearson, I have a daughter.

7
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,990
Six months old. Got full custody,

8
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:20,259
and my-my parents help
out with her sometimes.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,347
She is 14. She is not seeing a
boy who puts babies in people.

10
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,596
We are in lockstep.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,880
Deja, you are telling me

12
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:31,615
that you took a baseball
bat to his Mercedes?

13
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:34,453
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:36,054
I'm...

15
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:37,989
I'm s-I'm sorry. I-I
would've given you back.

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,425
I'm serious.

17
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:42,593
I mean, I thought they would have, too.

18
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:46,030
What you doing after school?

19
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:50,160
Um, I got drill practice until 7:00.

20
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,184
Why?

21
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,753
Want to come with me to Max's?

22
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:54,388
Who's Max?

23
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,934
Are you for real right now?

24
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:57,369
You don't know about Max's Steaks?

25
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,072
Oh, my God. Y'all and
these cheesesteaks.

26
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:03,842
I swear, it's only bread and meat.

27
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:06,077
Deja, how have you been
living in Philly for this long

28
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:07,746
and you've never been to Max's Steaks?

29
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:12,210
Well, Randall only takes
us to touristy places.

30
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,785
So, I've been to the Liberty Bell,

31
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:16,787
I've been to the Rocky Statue

32
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:20,625
and the Franklin Institute
about three times already.

33
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:22,260
Come on. That's not Philly.

34
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,962
I mean, it's-it's Philly,
but not Philly Philly.

35
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,134
I told you I came here before, right?

36
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:32,970
With my mom and my grandma,
when I was, like, four or five?

37
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,139
Nah. Nah. Where'd you go?

38
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,375
I think we were visiting my uncle.

39
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:46,384
And all I remember was
being in the car and-and...

40
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,118
there were these Christmas lights,

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,952
but it was warm out. That was weird.

42
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,822
Oh, and-and the water.

43
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:55,925
The-the lights were
reflecting off the water.

44
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:58,528
That's-that's about it.

45
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,597
Dang, I hate that.

46
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:02,098
Hate what?

47
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,467
Not remembering things from
when my grandma was alive.

48
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,739
Hey, do you have any tests today?

49
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:17,212
What if we, uh, what if we skip school?

50
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:21,751
I'm-I'm serious. I
could show you my Philly.

51
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:24,421
Uh, I-I don't know. I mean, I want to...

52
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:25,788
Then go with that.

53
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,568
You're really not getting off?

54
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:06,762
Ladies, cancel your dinner plans.

55
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:08,664
Councilman Gomez
brought tamales to work,

56
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:12,268
and I may or may not
have taken a few too many.

57
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,135
What's wrong?

58
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:16,137
Principal Herbert called.

59
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:19,040
Deja and Malik skipped school today.

60
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,042
What?

61
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:23,186
You're not even supposed
to be seeing that boy.

62
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:25,888
He goes to my school. You want
to ban me from school, too?

63
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,472
- Excuse me?
- Did she just...

64
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,174
She did. Well, go to your room.

65
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,595
Now.

66
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,383
And you're grounded for...

67
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,218
- A decade.
- A decade.

68
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,221
I hope your day was worth it.

69
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:56,595
Philly!

70
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,620
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -

71
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,647
You sure are getting
dressed up for this dinner.

72
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,040
I don't think I've ever seen you

73
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,833
wear a sports coat on the weekend.

74
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,869
What are you talking about?
I always wear a sports coat.

75
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,303
Okay.

76
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:22,558
What?

77
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,873
Rebecca Pearson, I've
known you for 19 years.

78
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:27,484
Your "okay" is never just "okay".

79
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:30,477
I just think it's interesting
that Kevin's asked us to invite

80
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,522
Ms. Applebaum over for dinner for ages

81
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,707
and we've always said no.

82
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,776
But then, out of the blue, you decide

83
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,412
to invite Randall's
teacher over for dinner?

84
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,646
First of all, Ms. Applebaum...

85
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,149
she's not a teacher, all
right? She is the school nurse.

86
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,384
And the only reason
Kevin wants her over here

87
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,785
is because he has a crush.

88
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,018
- Mm.
- I mean, Randall talks

89
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,524
about Mr. Lawrence constantly.

90
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:53,117
- You're not the least bit curious about him?
- Sure.

91
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:56,129
But I can also wait for parent/
teacher conferences in a month.

92
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,465
- Bec.
- Okay.

93
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,898
Okay.

94
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,501
Okay.

95
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,673
Hey, babe, help me out.

96
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,342
In the Mecca by Gwendolyn Brooks

97
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,739
or The Weary Blues by the
one and only Mr. Langston Hughes?

98
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,381
You've read both of those.

99
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,248
- Help me with this, please?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,811
Mmm.

101
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,677
You smell good.

102
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,559
Book's not for me, though.

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,595
- No?
- It's for Randall.

104
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:32,164
I did a poetry series in class.
He really seemed to dig it.

105
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,001
You a troublemaker, Korey.

106
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,003
Or should I say, Korey X?

107
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,605
Wait, what? Me?

108
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:41,107
Oh, don't go acting all innocent.

109
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,059
Y-You're talking about
black consciousness poets

110
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,644
an hour before we go to have dinner

111
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:47,013
with your only black student
and his white parents.

112
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:51,150
You don't have to be Sherlock
Holmes to crack this case.

113
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,453
Look, Mr. Pearson asked me to
dinner. I didn't invite myself.

114
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,856
You could've just said, "Sorry, can't".

115
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,625
"I'm taking my incredibly sexy wife

116
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,326
to see Sister Act for the third time".

117
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,295
Trish, it's just dinner, okay?

118
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,296
Okay.

119
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,468
So, when you talked to
Malik's mom yesterday...

120
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,437
Uh, V-neck or crew?

121
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,705
Uh, feels like a V-neck kind of night.

122
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,707
Well, what was her vibe?

123
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,010
You get a sense of what
kind of people they are?

124
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,479
Rastafarian vegans who
love outdoor sports.

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,214
- Really?
- Nope.

126
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,165
'Cause I just invited
them to for dinner.

127
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,585
So we don't even know if
they're on board with our plan?

128
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,187
What plan?

129
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,023
Come on, Beth. There's a boat.

130
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,058
You and I are in the boat.

131
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,828
The plan is to get Malik's
parents to join us in said boat.

132
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,898
Destination: Splitsville Dejik.

133
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,257
It's Deja and Malik... Dejik.

134
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:42,648
Oh, please don't give them a ship name.

135
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,874
- Maleja.
- Listen,

136
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,566
this is not a recruitment dinner, okay?

137
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,105
This is for us to get to
know Malik's parents better.

138
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,074
Feel them out, see if
they're good people.

139
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,043
Maybe we won't even have
to keep the kids apart.

140
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,412
He's too mature for her and
he got her to skip school.

141
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,481
- Deja lied to us.
- I know.

142
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,849
But keeping the kids apart
didn't work out too well

143
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,752
for Romeo and Juliet's parents, so...

144
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,887
Hey. Look at my feet.

145
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:05,556
What do you see?

146
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,824
- A couple hundred dollars on the Amex.
- Mm-mmm.

147
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:11,328
Open toe shoes for an open mind.

148
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,097
See, the only way we're
gonna get through this

149
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:16,099
is to have an open mind.

150
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,501
And red wine.

151
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,369
Lots of red wine.

152
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,804
I'm gonna go check on the food.

153
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,439
If she just opened a dance studio

154
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,714
and he's working all kinds of hours,

155
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:33,584
- who's watching those kids?
- They probably have hired help.

156
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,587
- Do they?
- I don't know.

157
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:39,289
- They do pretty well for themselves, though.
- Hmm.

158
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,659
You know Randall's
brother was the Manny?

159
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,294
His brother is Morris Chestnut?

160
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,130
No, the-the white Manny.

161
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:49,089
His brother is white?

162
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,319
Why aren't you more upset

163
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,944
that your son is out
here skipping school

164
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:53,886
and gallivanting with his
little fast girlfriend?

165
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,504
Mom.

166
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,172
Deja's not like that.

167
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,759
Okay? It was-it was my idea.

168
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:02,712
After everything, you
still have the nerve

169
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,347
to have these dumb ideas?

170
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:06,916
Kel, the boy's only missed one
day of school in three years.

171
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,551
It ain't the end of the world.

172
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:10,552
Hmm.

173
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,856
_

174
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:41,690
I can't believe we're doing this.

175
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:44,316
- Well, thanks to you, we are.
- Food's almost ready.

176
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:46,157
Why don't you go upstairs
and get your sisters?

177
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:50,893
Look, I know you're mad at me,

178
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:52,995
but can you please not
take it out on Malik?

179
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,464
I'm not mad at you, I'm disappointed.

180
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,098
All right. Can we not do this now?

181
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,635
Uhp. They're here.

182
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,807
Hey. Open minds.

183
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:16,384
- Hello.
- Hi.

184
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,420
- Welcome to our home. Come on.
- Thank you.

185
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,255
Thanks.

186
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,224
Hey, kids, everyone.

187
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:24,492
Hey, Mr. Lawrence.

188
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:27,261
Hey. Randall, my man.

189
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,664
This is Mrs. Lawrence.

190
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:32,099
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

191
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,101
- Hey. Glad you guys could...
- Shh.

192
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:35,836
Baby's sleeping.

193
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,471
First stop on our Philly tour:

194
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,105
Max's Steaks.

195
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:57,106
All right. Let's go.

196
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,977
Yo, yo. What's up?

197
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,411
- Hey.
- What up? What's up, man?

198
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:03,212
- Hey, what's up, Leek?
- What's up?

199
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:04,915
- What up, Jamar?
- Ain't nothing.

200
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,083
- Uh, this is my friend Deja.
- What's up?

201
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,219
- Let me get two Virgils.
- Two Virgils.

202
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,055
Deja, everything on this menu
is fire, but that Virgil...

203
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:14,713
that's hands down the best
cheesesteak in all of Philly.

204
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,256
Aw, he just putting sauce
on it 'cause Chuck the owner

205
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,325
named it after his grandpa.

206
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,360
Yo, let me go put those
orders in for y'all.

207
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,496
Your granddad has a
cheesesteak named after him?

208
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,498
Yeah.

209
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,633
Yeah, uh, him and Mr.
Chuck were real cool.

210
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:30,303
God. You're lucky.

211
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,305
Why?

212
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:34,574
You got all these connections.

213
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:37,243
We literally walked up in
here and everybody said hi.

214
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:39,745
That's so dope.

215
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:42,481
I've moved around so much.

216
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:45,650
I was never anywhere long
enough to be a regular.

217
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,022
Come with me.

218
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,982
- Just come on.
- Hey. Hey, where y'all going?

219
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,317
- I'm about to be done with your food.
- Hold on a second.

220
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,238
Yo, yo, yo, everybody. Everybody.

221
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,873
Um, this is my friend Deja.

222
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,276
She's never been to Max's
before, but it's not her fault.

223
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:06,652
Y'all please say hi to her?

224
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,520
- Hey, Deja.
- How you doing?

225
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,788
Now you're a regular.

226
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:21,166
- Hey, Mr. Pearson.
- Malik.

227
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,502
Kelly, Darnell. It's
nice to meet you guys.

228
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:26,237
These are our girls, Tess and Annie.

229
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:27,906
And you know Deja.

230
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:30,250
Actually, I don't.

231
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:31,784
You're a beautiful young lady.

232
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,786
Thank you.

233
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:35,754
It's crazy that you have a baby.

234
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,143
So, dinner isn't quite ready yet,

235
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,803
but we do have wine, lots of wine.

236
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,824
Anybody care for some wine?

237
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,059
- No, thank you.
- I don't drink.

238
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,550
All right. Um, Kelly,
why don't you and I

239
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,677
- put the pie in the kitchen, all right?
- Yep.

240
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,854
Ladies, why don't you help
Malik get Janell situated.

241
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,522
Right this way.

242
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,146
Dinner on a weeknight must be a pain.

243
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:02,381
Sorry about that. Just
thought it was important

244
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:03,649
that we get together and talk through

245
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,064
what to do about the
kids sneaking around.

246
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:06,118
Nah, it's cool.

247
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,819
Plus, it gave me an
excuse to come down here.

248
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,412
I used to trick or treat
in this neighborhood

249
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:10,956
- when Malik was a baby.
- Really?

250
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:12,558
Yeah.

251
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,719
I always wondered what the inside
of these houses looked like.

252
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,522
- You must have broke the bank on this one.
- No.

253
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:20,189
Or not.

254
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,491
Good for you, Councilman.

255
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,560
Oh, no, it's just Randall.

256
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:26,161
You know, Randall is fine.

257
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,665
Hi.

258
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,801
I think Darnell just
implied that we're bougie.

259
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,302
- We are kind of bougie.
- Yeah, okay.

260
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,905
But I don't want him to think that.

261
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,472
Open-toed shoes, open minds.

262
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:39,009
I'm not sure how I
feel about your mantra.

263
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,743
How about a tour?

264
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,648
Well, this is my room.

265
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:48,752
Ignore that side of the room.

266
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,944
That's my brother. He's a bit of a slob.

267
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:53,146
Some of the brightest people are.

268
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,281
I don't think that theory applies here.

269
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:56,950
- Uh, Randall.
- Sorry.

270
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:59,686
So this must be where the
books in the house live.

271
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:01,245
Yeah. The library sponsored

272
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,395
a summer read-a-thon, and
I got so many new books,

273
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,126
my dad had to buy this for me.

274
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,618
Build.

275
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,730
I didn't buy that, I-I built that.

276
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,809
- It's real oak.
- Wow.

277
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,793
I was-I was thinking about maple,

278
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,707
but it's less porous.

279
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,576
Makes a huge, huge difference.

280
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:20,579
Really, you-you could have
used birch, uh, pine...

281
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,481
Hey, Jack, you can stop
naming types of wood.

282
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,649
Yeah.

283
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,451
It looks sturdy.

284
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,353
- Thanks.
- Hey, can we eat already?

285
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,616
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, we're gonna.

286
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,408
And stop fussing with your clothes.

287
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:36,025
I see what you did there, Randall.

288
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,993
I knew you'd notice.

289
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:42,497
Mm, but you made one little mistake.

290
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,501
'76.

291
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:48,404
- Bridge to Terabithia... '77.
- Oh.

292
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:49,905
I'm sorry, am I missing something?

293
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:51,207
Mm-hmm.

294
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,076
I organize the books in my
class by year of publication.

295
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:55,945
But I should have
trademarked my process.

296
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:58,981
Seems we have a copycat over here.

297
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,692
Holy crap, he's like a grown-up Randall.

298
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:02,785
- Kevin.
- Kev.

299
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:05,121
What? You don't see it?

300
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:08,791
- Excuse us a second.
- Um... should we eat?

301
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,126
- Definitely.
- Yeah?

302
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,826
- Yeah.
- Dinner's ready, so we can, um,

303
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,561
- trudge back downstairs.
- Great.

304
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,111
Her face is a whole mood.

305
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,328
We got murals like
this all over the city.

306
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,897
Kind of hard to believe people

307
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:36,965
used to call Philly Killadelphia.

308
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:39,401
It's beautiful.

309
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,277
What?

310
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,504
Um...

311
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:53,681
well, I was-I was about to
say something real cheesy,

312
00:14:53,682 --> 00:14:55,550
like... "No, you're beautiful".

313
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,721
Does that actually work on other girls?

314
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,025
I don't know.

315
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:08,228
Never really tried it before.

316
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,946
This is it,

317
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:22,549
the magic garden.

318
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,818
Crazy, right?

319
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,954
Are you okay?

320
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:03,757
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

321
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:05,759
Okay.

322
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,430
It's good, right?

323
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:13,199
- It's, like, real good.
- It's good.

324
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:16,516
Let the tour commence.

325
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,036
Commence the tour!

326
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:22,375
What is this place?

327
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:24,200
I used to stay near
here with my grandparents

328
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,695
when I was a kid.

329
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:28,347
This is, um...

330
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:30,882
just kind of like my backyard.

331
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:35,120
You know, I take Janell here sometimes.

332
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:38,122
This might be my favorite
spot in the city, actually.

333
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,328
Nah, actually...

334
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,530
this... is my favorite spot.

335
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:49,701
We could share it if you want.

336
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,736
Thanks.

337
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,886
I... I ca-I can't... I don't
want to be here anymore.

338
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,755
Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

339
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,423
I'm going now.

340
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:48,459
That was my...

341
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,311
I think the food is done.

342
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:09,079
Oh, shoot. Shoot.

343
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,082
Ah...

344
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,283
Let me give you a hand.

345
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,795
Thanks.

346
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:29,199
We want it baked, not burnt.

347
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,235
That's all right, I kind
of like my chicken cremated.

348
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,674
I, uh, I spoke with the kids' principal.

349
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:42,211
They're only getting
one day's detention.

350
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,189
The punishment could
have been much worse.

351
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,881
It was my boy's doing.

352
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:48,317
Guess he thought playing
hooky was smooth or something.

353
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,152
The kid's a damn romantic.

354
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:51,485
He gets it from me, God help him.

355
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:56,258
But he said he's sorry,
and it won't happen again.

356
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,793
And when he says something
won't happen again, it won't.

357
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:08,203
When he says someone's special, she is.

358
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:15,110
One day you're their biggest idol,

359
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,011
next day, someone else comes along

360
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:18,946
and becomes their whole world.

361
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,586
It's terrifying.

362
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:28,824
Yeah.

363
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:32,093
It's nice, because the
girls get their own rooms.

364
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:34,094
When we have guests, they double up.

365
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:38,467
Can I ask you something?

366
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,967
How long have you had Deja?

367
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,072
She's lived with us for about two years.

368
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:47,440
But we officially adopted
her about a year ago.

369
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:51,511
Must be hard raising
someone else's child.

370
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:55,484
No, because she's our daughter.

371
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,385
Of course. Of course.

372
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,487
I just meant...

373
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:04,758
She had a whole life before
she came into your family.

374
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,729
Malik said her mother was a drug addict,

375
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,362
she lived in a car.

376
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:10,329
That's a lot of baggage.

377
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,836
Yeah, she's been through a lot.

378
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:18,438
But, uh, so have you, right?

379
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:20,772
I mean, having to raise
your child's child and all.

380
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,742
Dinner's ready.

381
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:35,655
- Randall?
- Yes.

382
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:39,092
Can I get your help with the
chips and the dip in the pantry?

383
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:42,061
We're not having chips and dip...

384
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,236
You hide wine in the pantry?

385
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,937
I got three kids, okay? Give me a break.

386
00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:52,338
Randal?

387
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:53,573
Hmm?

388
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:55,335
This woman's about to
make me come out my spirit.

389
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,873
For real? 'Cause Darnell
seems like a nice guy.

390
00:20:57,874 --> 00:21:00,613
Oh. I thought we were all
about getting people in boats

391
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:01,981
and going to Dejik Splitsville.

392
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,883
I still am, I was just trying to be

393
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:06,052
all open-toed shoes and open mind.

394
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:07,319
I was wrong, okay?

395
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,821
I don't want them in our boat.

396
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,057
Kelly is trying to pin this
whole thing on our girl?

397
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:13,987
This dinner is about
to get awkward as hell.

398
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,954
It doesn't have to be... okay.

399
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:19,865
Ah.

400
00:21:23,336 --> 00:21:25,394
It's going really good. You
know, Mrs. Weber actually

401
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:27,319
let us pick out the ones we want
to study for science class.

402
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,087
Hm. Theropods or sauropods?

403
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,342
Theropods, duh.

404
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:35,480
- This is the most boring dinner in history.
- Kevin.

405
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:36,983
Don't be rude.

406
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:38,951
What? Ms. Applebaum wouldn't be talking

407
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:42,420
about dinosaurs at dinner.
She's way too cool for that.

408
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,289
You're so obsessed with her.

409
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,691
She's got big boobs.

410
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:46,792
- Hey, Kevin.
- Excuse me.

411
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:48,894
- Sorry.
- No.

412
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:52,010
It's my fault. 'Cause when
Randall and I start talking

413
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,398
prehistoric reptiles...

414
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,533
It gets really crazy.

415
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:57,368
... it's hard for us stop.

416
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,072
Didn't know you taught dinosaurs.

417
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:07,364
- Trish.
- Mm?

418
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:08,390
I have to tell you,

419
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:10,137
I've been admiring
your earrings all night.

420
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:11,949
- Where did you get those?
- Thanks, Rebecca.

421
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,986
I-I actually got them
from Taste of Afro-soul.

422
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:16,521
What's that?

423
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:19,657
It's-it's a cultural festival.

424
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:22,460
Yeah, a bunch of black
artists, they get together,

425
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:25,046
- and there's-there's food, there's music,
- Yeah.

426
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,373
there's art, jewelry,
there's some poetry.

427
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:29,375
Like the ones you're
teaching us in class?

428
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,110
Uh-huh, some, yeah.

429
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:35,780
Is it new... the, um, the festival?

430
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:38,320
- Uh...
- Yeah.

431
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:41,853
Yeah, I think it's been
around for a few years now.

432
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:45,121
- They hold it once a month.
- Mm.

433
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,561
Hey, if you don't mind,
Mr. Lawrence, can I come

434
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:52,597
with you and Mrs. Lawrence
next time you guys go?

435
00:22:52,598 --> 00:22:54,699
Randall, I don't think that
you should impose on them.

436
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,198
- That's not fair to just ask.
- Oh, no, no, that would not be

437
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,404
- an imposition at all. What?
- Korey.

438
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:05,175
Hey, you know, bud, we'll,
uh, go together as a family.

439
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,245
That way, when Mr. Lawrence,
when he has a family,

440
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:10,316
he can take them to that.

441
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,655
Absolutely.

442
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:21,324
You know, I-I actually
think it'll be good

443
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:23,326
for you to all go together.

444
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:25,395
Oh, we will.

445
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,596
- Good.
- Good.

446
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,766
This is way better than dinosaurs.

447
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:38,167
Deja. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Deja, Deja.

448
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,169
Deja, wait, wait, wait, wait.

449
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,104
Look, I-I-I'm sorry, okay? I
wasn't trying to do anything.

450
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,506
- I know, I know.
- Then what's wrong?

451
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,208
Look...

452
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,944
Malik, I've never liked anybody before.

453
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:55,116
You give me butterflies.

454
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:57,551
And...

455
00:23:58,227 --> 00:23:59,661
the way you look at me,

456
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:01,129
I mean,

457
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,965
I never thought anybody
could look at me like that.

458
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,367
And the crazy things
you say to me, I mean,

459
00:24:07,368 --> 00:24:08,836
are they for real?

460
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:11,038
I mean,

461
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,707
the men that my mom dated lied to her.

462
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:18,278
I only know one man who doesn't lie,

463
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,348
and now...

464
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:23,083
maybe I know two.

465
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:27,305
But you've done this before.

466
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:28,674
You've had girlfriends.

467
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,308
You have a baby.

468
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:35,780
I don't know if I can trust you.

469
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:41,185
I-I don't know if every time
you tell me I'm beautiful,

470
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:43,553
you just running game. I don't know.

471
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:47,791
All I know is I got plans for my life.

472
00:24:49,227 --> 00:24:52,697
Real plans, and this is all too scary.

473
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:54,331
I never should've skipped school.

474
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:57,000
Just please take me back.

475
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:05,209
We'll, uh, we'll be
right back with dessert.

476
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,077
Hey, Bec, do you want to get the pie

477
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:09,445
and I'll get the ice
cream and the bowls?

478
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:13,750
What is going on with you?

479
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:15,418
What?

480
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:18,921
- Jack.
- What?

481
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:23,860
If you're competing
with Korey for your son,

482
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:25,495
you're gonna win.

483
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,334
I mean, that man in there, he
could be, uh, Albert Einstein

484
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:32,869
and you would still win.

485
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,172
'Cause our son is
always gonna choose you.

486
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:37,807
Always.

487
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:39,076
But if you do that...

488
00:25:39,077 --> 00:25:41,845
if you make him choose...

489
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:45,049
then Randall's gonna miss out
on something really special.

490
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,017
Something...

491
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:49,753
something he really needs.

492
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:51,787
And then where would that leave him?

493
00:25:58,763 --> 00:26:02,031
Who's up for some pie?

494
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:11,140
I'm sorry, would you mind

495
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:13,176
if we said a quick grace?

496
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:15,378
- Mom, is that really necessary?
- No, it's fine.

497
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:16,680
We usually say grace ourselves.

498
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:18,748
We never say grace.

499
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:21,150
We haven't even been to
church since your campaign.

500
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:23,553
No, that's only 'cause, you know,

501
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:25,721
Sundays can be, uh...

502
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:27,957
Different families have
different traditions.

503
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,892
Some people say grace and go to church,

504
00:26:29,893 --> 00:26:32,213
and some people know that God
knows what's in their hearts.

505
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,603
All right. Uh, Kelly,

506
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:36,936
you want to do the honors?

507
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:42,210
Heavenly Father, we
thank you for this food.

508
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:43,969
May it nourish our bodies.

509
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,572
And, Lord, though we may not all

510
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:48,039
worship you consistently,

511
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,476
we thank you for blessing us anyway.

512
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:51,673
Amen.

513
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:54,012
Amen. Amen.

514
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:57,314
Thank you for that,
um... Let's-let's dig in.

515
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,719
Can you pass the chicken, please?

516
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,721
So, Darnell, how's business?

517
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,414
Got a body shop, right?

518
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,893
Yeah, yeah, we do
repairs and custom work.

519
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:10,628
Business is, uh, pretty
good. Appreciate you asking.

520
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,830
Well, if there's ever
anything I can do for you

521
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,232
as your Friendly Neighborhood
Councilman, you let me know.

522
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:21,549
What?

523
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,575
You didn't vote for me, did you?

524
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,143
What, you're a Sol Brown man?

525
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,644
Oh, no, no, no. I just, uh,

526
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,592
I just don't mess with politics.

527
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:30,747
I'll take care of mines

528
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:32,682
and whatever I could do
to bless the block, I do.

529
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:34,718
That's about it.

530
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,756
She's probably hungry. Get the bottle.

531
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:42,758
Come on, come on.

532
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:47,164
Good girl. It's okay.

533
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,399
Can I help with her?

534
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,134
Uh, I don't think
that's a good idea, baby.

535
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,402
No, it's fine, it's fine.

536
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,804
She, uh, she likes making new friends.

537
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,372
It's okay, it's okay. Come on.

538
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,810
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Hi. Oh, I want one.

539
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,644
No, you don't, not till you're 50.

540
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:05,214
Since Janelle is your daughter
and Deja's your girlfriend,

541
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:06,907
that kind of makes Deja her stepmom.

542
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:08,167
- Oh, my God, Annie.
- No,

543
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:10,836
- certainly does not.
- Not anybody's stepmom.

544
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:14,006
Okay, um, I-I think that a-a walk

545
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,466
will calm her down.
I'll just, I'll be back.

546
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:19,541
- I'll go with him.
- No. You know what, girls, upstairs.

547
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:21,747
- But why? Dinner isn't over yet.
- Yes, it is.

548
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:24,717
- What about Malik?
- Upstairs, now, please.

549
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:25,883
Come on.

550
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:37,730
All right.

551
00:28:37,731 --> 00:28:39,831
I think it's time for some real talk.

552
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:49,757
I'll go first. I don't
think that Malik and Deja

553
00:28:49,758 --> 00:28:51,907
- should be dating.
- We can agree on that.

554
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,743
They're just kids.

555
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:55,612
If it's about the school, you know,

556
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:57,712
kids skip school sometimes,
right? Didn't you?

557
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:02,468
No. Uh, but that's only
because Hanes Academy

558
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,136
had a very strict attendance policy.

559
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:07,676
Every school does. And
that's not the point.

560
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:08,773
What is the point?

561
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,192
Do I have to be the one to announce

562
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:12,427
the elephant in the room here?

563
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:14,395
I'm sorry, I didn't know
there was an elephant.

564
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:15,597
Please announce it.

565
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,999
Your son has a daughter.

566
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,901
Okay, but you knew
that when you let Deja

567
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:21,503
go to the movies with him last week.

568
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:23,738
- What movies?
- Deja didn't go to any movies last week.

569
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:25,974
Yes, she did. She... Malik told me.

570
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:28,042
She went to the movies
with him and his friends.

571
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:31,145
Are you kidding me? So
she's sneaking around now?

572
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,147
Mm. Not surprised.

573
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,416
Okay, you know what, you tried
it with me earlier, Kelly.

574
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,085
I'm-a need you to not make it a habit.

575
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:39,720
Your problem is not with me, okay?

576
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,155
Your problem is upstairs.

577
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:44,525
No, our problem is that Malik
is too experienced for Deja.

578
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,560
She never lied to us
before she met your son.

579
00:29:46,561 --> 00:29:49,364
And my son never cut school
before he met your daughter.

580
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:50,798
All right, so can we all just agree

581
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,400
that the two of them
are not good together

582
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:54,135
and leave it at that?

583
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:56,683
I don't think anyone here
wants an unplanned pregnancy.

584
00:29:56,684 --> 00:29:59,019
Oh, plea... Malik is
not having sex with Deja.

585
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,255
And you know that how,
hmm? Because he told you?

586
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:03,624
Did he tell you that about
Janelle's mother, too?

587
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,192
Hey, Beth.

588
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:07,226
Come on.

589
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:12,232
All right. Look, obviously, you're not

590
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,800
catching us at our best...

591
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,434
- Mm.
- ... but Deja came

592
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:18,638
from a tough situation, and
we brought her out of it.

593
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,474
And, frankly, we're a little
concerned that her spending time

594
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:23,475
with your son will take
her right back there.

595
00:30:25,412 --> 00:30:26,812
Where's that?

596
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,063
Nothing.

597
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:31,550
- Forget it.
- Uh-uh. No.

598
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:33,586
- You were saying something. Finish up.
- Yeah.

599
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:35,588
I mean...

600
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:38,258
Our son's gonna drag
her right back where?

601
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:40,085
The hood?

602
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:41,926
That's not what I was
trying to say, all right.

603
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:46,965
What are you doing?

604
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:50,035
I saw you eyeballing my tats earlier.

605
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:52,671
These ain't decorations, bro.

606
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,473
I earned each and every one of
these living that life for real.

607
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:57,474
But that's all behind me now.

608
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:01,013
Look, you can choose to see me

609
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:02,580
and only see my mistakes,

610
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:04,316
or you can choose to
see something different.

611
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:07,552
Just like you can choose to see our son

612
00:31:07,553 --> 00:31:10,421
as a kid from North
Philly, teenage father.

613
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:15,760
Or you could choose to
see a straight-A student,

614
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:18,762
a sweet boy that loves to make
his mother and daughter smile.

615
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:23,635
But what you not gonna
do is write him off.

616
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:25,635
I ain't having that.

617
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:31,308
I'm sorry.

618
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:38,182
Randall, Beth, I'm-I'm sorry I lied.

619
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:40,784
I'm sorry for skipping school yesterday.

620
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:43,786
I'm-I'm sorry I disappointed you.

621
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,226
Mr. and Mrs. Hodges,

622
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:50,594
I'm sorry for skipping
school with Malik,

623
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:53,897
but I am not sorry for liking your son.

624
00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:57,835
And I'm not sorry for yesterday,

625
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:00,170
because that was the
best day of my life.

626
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:05,208
- Hey, wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.
- Malik.

627
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:06,676
No, just, just hear me out, okay?

628
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:11,647
Deja, I don't have game.

629
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:14,351
I don't.

630
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:16,887
Janelle's mom was my first girlfriend.

631
00:32:16,888 --> 00:32:18,522
I still don't why she liked me.

632
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:20,290
I mean, we got football
players at our school,

633
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,658
I'm, like, this big.

634
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:27,630
But I get how you see me.

635
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:32,667
A lot of people see me like that.

636
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:37,707
I remember when I first told my parents

637
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,708
I got Jennifer pregnant.

638
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:45,580
The look on my dad's face.

639
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,123
You know how long my
parents been together?

640
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:00,328
22 years.

641
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,367
My grandparents were together for 60.

642
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:09,037
Hell, I bet my ancestors in
Africa were even booed up.

643
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:13,041
And I let them all down.

644
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:16,710
I like you, Deja.

645
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,049
That's the truth.

646
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:27,423
And when I tell you you're beautiful,

647
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,923
that's the truth, too.

648
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:36,664
Look, if you really want to
go back to school, that's okay.

649
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:37,999
I understand.

650
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But, uh...

651
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:45,205
I-I did have one more
place I wanted to show you.

652
00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:57,851
Show me.

653
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,057
Thank you for coming over.

654
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,026
Thank you.

655
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,481
Okay.

656
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,231
Okay.

657
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,412
Okay.

658
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:30,171
Korey.

659
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:34,908
Can I have a word?

660
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:38,378
I'll wait for you in the car.

661
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:44,818
Hey. Um...

662
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,955
Tonight was, um...

663
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:53,027
Look, Jack, we don't
have to tiptoe around it.

664
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:54,227
Tonight was awkward.

665
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,852
It wasn't my finest.

666
00:34:58,499 --> 00:34:59,899
Yeah, mine either.

667
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:03,535
Ever since Randall met you...

668
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:10,743
All right. If I'm being honest,

669
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:14,847
ever since Randall could talk,
he would ask me questions.

670
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:20,486
"Why is everybody staring at us, Dad?"

671
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:23,223
"Wh-why don't we have
any black neighbors?"

672
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:25,458
He-he would ask questions,

673
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,680
and I always had an answer for him.

674
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:30,964
I-I don't know how
good the answers were,

675
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:34,100
but I had them.

676
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:38,904
And lately, his questions have gotten...

677
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:40,805
very complicated.

678
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:45,155
And I feel like I'm letting him down.

679
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,982
That kid is my whole world.

680
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:56,455
And I...

681
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:58,356
I'm out of my depth here.

682
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:05,264
You know, I only applied to Hanes

683
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:07,099
'cause it's the best,

684
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,736
and I wanted to teach at the best.

685
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:12,970
But I knew I'd be the only one there.

686
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,940
So...

687
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,409
I guess when I met Randall...

688
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:20,711
... I understood him.

689
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:24,148
And then when I saw
that he was searching,

690
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,085
I just, I felt like I could
help him with all that.

691
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:29,587
- Well, you can.
- No.

692
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:34,125
I get him from 8:00 to
3:00, five days a week.

693
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:38,196
I mean, if I'm lucky,
one day, he'll remember me

694
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:42,065
as someone who was vaguely
important to him once.

695
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,537
But you're his father.

696
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:48,806
Yeah, you're gonna be a
grandfather to his children.

697
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,374
You're gonna be with him forever.

698
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,544
Korey, I-I can't teach
my son how to be black.

699
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,482
Oh, no.

700
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,250
No, don't, don't do that.

701
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,786
Okay?

702
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,821
'Cause you-you, you can't do that.

703
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:10,126
All right, hold on, one,
one second. Just hold on.

704
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,031
One second.

705
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:27,376
This... is The Weary Blues.

706
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:32,081
By one of the baddest scribes
ever to live, Langston Hughes.

707
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:34,283
I was gonna give this to Randall,

708
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:36,952
but my wife told me
to leave it in the car.

709
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:41,289
Randall is... he's really into his work.

710
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,770
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Well, um...

711
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,237
I'll see you at the
parent-teacher meeting.

712
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:57,538
- See you there.
- Yeah.

713
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,203
Hey.

714
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,107
Hi.

715
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:36,944
So... Mr. Lawrence.

716
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:40,247
He's a pretty cool guy. I
can see why you like him.

717
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:42,483
He's okay.

718
00:38:42,484 --> 00:38:45,853
No, he's, um...

719
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:47,453
he's pretty cool.

720
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,026
Yeah, he, he, he gave me this.

721
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:55,114
He said that you liked it a lot.
I'm planning on reading it, too.

722
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:58,833
- You are?
- Mm-hm.

723
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,635
This is a book of poetry, Dad.

724
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:02,236
What, I like poetry.

725
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:04,270
Sure you do.

726
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:07,205
Okay, I'll take that back, then.

727
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:16,882
You're grounded for a
week for lying to us.

728
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:21,386
It cannot happen again.

729
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:27,694
Randall and I talked, and we agreed

730
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:29,028
that you can see Malik.

731
00:39:30,064 --> 00:39:33,867
- Seriously?
- But supervised.

732
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:37,070
All right? Either in this house
when Beth and I are home,

733
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,804
or at Malik's house,
when his parents are home.

734
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:45,444
We didn't really get
to know Malik tonight...

735
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:50,216
... but we'd like to.

736
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:52,117
Mind telling us about him?

737
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:59,825
- Can I look now?
- Hold on, just wait a second.

738
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:01,393
Well, he's obsessed with cheesesteaks.

739
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:06,669
He's very confident. Not cocky.

740
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,933
And...

741
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,302
he's the type of guy
that walks into a room

742
00:40:10,303 --> 00:40:13,204
- and everyone notices.
- Now.

743
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,258
G.G., it's sticky.

744
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:25,017
Yeah.

745
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:26,986
And you're getting it
everywhere, baby girl.

746
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:30,055
- Dayje?
- Yeah, Mama?

747
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:31,323
Look outside, tater-tot.

748
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:33,425
You see the lights?

749
00:40:33,426 --> 00:40:34,926
They're pretty, right?

750
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:37,327
Mm-hmm.

751
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,768
The thing about Malik is,

752
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:47,571
he makes me feel like myself.

753
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:50,306
Like I have a piece of home.

754
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:54,511
Oh, damn, did I mess up again?

755
00:40:58,216 --> 00:41:00,316
No, you didn't mess up at all.

756
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,265
You know, I actually
memorized my favorite one.

757
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:19,234
You did?

758
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,338
Can I hear it?

759
00:41:29,747 --> 00:41:32,816
"I, Too".

760
00:41:32,817 --> 00:41:34,785
"I, too, sing America.

761
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,519
I am the darker brother.

762
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,255
They send me to eat in the kitchen,

763
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:41,024
when company comes.

764
00:41:41,025 --> 00:41:45,527
But I laugh, and I eat
well, and I grow strong.

765
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:49,198
Tomorrow, I'll be at the table.

766
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,801
When company comes,
nobody'll dare say to me,

767
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:53,069
'eat in the kitchen', then.

768
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,972
Besides, they'll see how
beautiful we are, and...

769
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,574
be ashamed.

770
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:06,014
I, too, am America".

771
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,088
We could read that together.

772
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:13,488
If you want.

773
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,423
I would like that very much.
