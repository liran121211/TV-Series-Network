00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,562
- Mom! Kevin!
- Hey. -What's up, buddy?

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,127
What do you say?
Get me up high.

4
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:06,218
There it is.

5
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,031
Stay the hell
away from my wife.

6
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:11,083
<i>She is her daddy's world.</i>

7
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:13,615
I want more for her
than you can offer her.

8
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:16,721
I will do everything I can
to stop this.

9
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:22,593
I did have a really nice time
tonight.

10
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:24,904
Okay.

11
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,747
- You can come inside for a water.
- All right.

12
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:29,000
- A water.
- Uh-huh.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,089
Every part of my body aches
like death right now.

14
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:35,249
Do you want to have sex?

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,159
And I'm cured.
You're a witch.

16
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:39,838
All right.

17
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,563
Okay, you can look.

18
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,774
Schwing.

19
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,646
Stop. That's my spot.
Stop.

20
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,081
Okay, what's the safe word?

21
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,565
Uh, spatula?

22
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,878
Oh!

23
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,199
Mm.

24
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,715
Wait.

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,566
Promise me we'll always be hot
for each other.

26
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,810
Easiest promise
I'll ever make.

27
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:25,599
Not even
if you paid me in gold.

00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,124
- Only for you.
- Mm.

32
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,818
I really want to.

33
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,341
But I promised my mom

34
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,067
I would have brunch with her.

35
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:01,710
Oh...

36
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,051
Killed the mood.

37
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,882
- Sorry.
- Killed the mood.

38
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,644
Do you think

39
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,036
you could maybe drop me off
at my parents'?

40
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:14,906
'Cause Jenny has my car.

41
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,484
Please?

42
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,398
Come on. It's 20 minutes away.

43
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,286
Yeah, no, it...
No, it's fine.

44
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,757
It's not that. I just, um...

45
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:26,906
I don't think your parents
really approve of me

46
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,421
after that first dinner
at the club.

47
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,498
- What?
- I just...

48
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,820
Think I was talking about myself
too much.

49
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:37,304
Jack, you never talk
about yourself.

50
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:39,023
I loved it.

51
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,709
Okay.

52
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:43,377
Okay, okay, fine,
I'll give you a ride.

53
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,311
But I just want you to know,

54
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,656
there is no such thing
as a free brunch.

55
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,390
Dad, come on. Let's go.

56
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,031
Whoa! Randall,
you're-you're like a ninja.

57
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,603
- Get dressed. I got to go to school.
- Oh.

58
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,038
It's 6:00 a.m., bud.

59
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,207
I want to get there early
to talk to Mr. Lawrence.

60
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,350
- He gave me a book to read.
- Mr. Lawrence again. -Oh, yeah?

61
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:17,711
Mr. Lawrence give you the book about the
tickle monster? - Stop. Dad, stop! Stop.

62
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,446
- Tickle monster is...
- Oh, my God.

63
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,649
Something died in your mouth.

64
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:23,450
- Oh, did it?
- Go brush your teeth.

65
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,119
- Come on. Let's go.
- You know what,

66
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,531
I think, uh...

67
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,544
I think I want to meet
this Mr. Lawrence.

68
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:30,740
He's made quite an impression
on you.

69
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,559
Parent-teacher conferences
are next month.

70
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,031
Or today.

71
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:35,695
- Yeah.
- Okay?

72
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,593
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,068
Mr. Lawrence.

74
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:42,781
Randall.

75
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,072
This is the latest
you've ever been early.

76
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:52,499
Uh, Korey Lawrence,

77
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:53,742
Randall's English teacher.

78
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,585
Jack Pearson, Randall's father.

79
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:57,785
I've heard a lot of great things
about you.

80
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,920
Oh. Well, uh,

81
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,589
your son is
a very curious young man.

82
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:04,968
He asks a lot of questions,
yeah.

83
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,475
So, how's<i> Notes of a Native Son</i>
going?

84
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:11,679
Great.
When James Baldwin was ten,

85
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,484
he wrote a play
his teacher directed.

86
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:16,036
Hey. You got a director.

87
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:17,730
Now you just need
to write a play, right?

88
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,009
- Hey, it was really nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,232
You have a very special kid
here.

90
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,180
I agree.

91
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:28,368
Randall, your mom's
gonna pick you up today.

92
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:29,607
Okay.

93
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:31,209
Love you.

94
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,153
So...

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,631
..how far did you get?

96
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,865
- "The Harlem Ghetto."
- Ah, yeah.

97
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,451
Wilkins is freezing me out.

98
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,055
Yeah, well,
you did cancel on him twice.

99
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:46,624
Screw it.
I'm going over there.

100
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:48,901
- To say what?
- I'm gonna ask him

101
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,331
if I vote for his housing bill...
with revisions...

102
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,842
Whether he'll support my grocery
store in the food desert.

103
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,628
Actually, no.
I'm gonna tell him.

104
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,579
- Yeah, you are.
- Yeah.

105
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,981
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

106
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,232
- Come on.
- Mm.

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,616
No, no, no.
I'm telling you, I'm up

108
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,507
five after nine, right,
and then the back tightens.

109
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:08,539
And I still had to swi...

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,685
Morning, gentlemen.

111
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:12,888
Sorry to interrupt
the golf banter.

112
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,596
Councilman, if this conversation
is gonna start or end

113
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:19,456
with the words "affordable
groceries" or "food desert,"

114
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:20,977
you can keep walking.

115
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,370
Actually, um, Councilman, no.

116
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,873
Uh...

117
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:27,674
I know I had to cancel
on you twice,

118
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,425
and I wanted
to make it up to you.

119
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,678
So, um,

120
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,417
if you ever wanted
to get onto Stillbrooke,

121
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:35,583
I have an in.

122
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,753
- Stillbrooke?
- Two-month wait for a tee time.

123
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,857
And, of course,
Pearson has an in.

124
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:41,472
Ha-ha-ha.

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,417
Yes, 'cause I'm a carpetbagger
with rich friends,

126
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,060
and you men of principle
don't want any part of that.

127
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,862
My offer stands.

128
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,201
It was nice talking to you.

129
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,318
Well, what about today?

130
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:55,873
Today?

131
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:57,662
- I'll make a call.
- Hmm.

132
00:05:57,928 --> 00:05:59,510
We could use a fourth.

133
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:04,043
Thanks, but, uh,
golf's not really my bag.

134
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,667
Golf. Bag.

135
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:08,980
Um, do you still want me?

136
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,317
Oh, we do now.

137
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,154
Ours is a money game.

138
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,708
All right.

139
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,216
Oh, God.

140
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:23,996
Just...

141
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,165
Uh...

142
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:26,396
Eh.

143
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,932
Mm...

144
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,902
Okay, what's wrong?

145
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,839
Eh. Aw, I'm just...

146
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,482
I'm creeping on my ex.

147
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,741
Ugh.

148
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,292
What's that even mean?

149
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,945
Oh. Uh...

150
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,365
I'm Internet stalking her.

151
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:42,534
God, you're old.

152
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,208
It's my-my ex, Zoe.

153
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,419
Uh, her documentary won a prize
at this Rome film festival,

154
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:51,789
and she's posted
all these photos.

155
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:53,926
And every single one,
she's with this hot guy.

156
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,208
See that?

157
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,871
- What do you think of that?
- Just friends?

158
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,765
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely.
- Yeah?

159
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,867
Yeah.

160
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:01,370
But they're also having sex.

161
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,646
Aw.

162
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:03,981
- What is this...
- What are... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

163
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:05,458
- No, no, no. What are you doing?
- I'm trying to make

164
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:07,641
- the picture bigger. What...
- Well, you didn't make it bigger.

165
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,309
You touched the heart, man.
You touched the heart.

166
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,100
- Now she knows I'm stalking her.
- What's your problem?

167
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,035
- I look like an... What's my problem?
- Yeah.

168
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,583
Everything here sucks.
That's my problem.

169
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:18,240
You know,

170
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:21,121
you don't need to stick around
here for my court hearing.

171
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,050
Yeah, no, I really do need

172
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:24,387
to stick around here
for your court hearing.

173
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,044
I told your vet counselor
that I would.

174
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,661
Which means...

175
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,826
a few more weeks.

176
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,841
Let's do something though.
You know?

177
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,817
You want to go in...
You want to go for a hike?

178
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:40,177
I've had more than enough hikes with
you, kid. - Okay.

179
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,771
Here we go.

180
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,723
Go to a meeting, Kevin.

181
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,893
Yeah, thanks.
Just went to a meeting.

182
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,302
Go to another one.

183
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,772
Oh.

184
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,686
Relax. It's okay.

185
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:08,952
Hey, Mr. Malone.

186
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:10,944
You, uh...

187
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,280
going out to play some golf?

188
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,683
No, no. I'm just gonna go
hit some balls.

189
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:16,254
Do you play?

190
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:18,311
Not really.

191
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,639
I mean,

192
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:22,756
sometimes I'll do a twilight
round over at Swenson.

193
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:25,354
Oh. You want to join me?

194
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,803
You know what,
I got a lot of errands today.

195
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,553
Thank you, though, sir.

196
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,459
All right. Some other time.

197
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,928
Are you sure?

198
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:35,497
I think it's really sweet

199
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:38,006
that my dad wants
to get to know you more.

200
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:42,811
Uh, Mr. Malone.

201
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,709
Maybe I will join you.

202
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,100
Come on!

203
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:47,233
Thank you.

204
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:50,006
It'll be fun.

205
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,022
- Tobe.
- Yeah.

206
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:53,882
You left the onesies
in the washer too long.

207
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:54,850
Huh?

208
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:56,093
They sat in the washer too long,

209
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,094
and now they're all mildewy.

210
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:58,327
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

211
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,725
I-I'm operating
on-on two hours of sleep.

212
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,434
I can't be good at laundry
and also work enough

213
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,996
to save money
for Jack's college tuition,

214
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:07,655
which, accounting for inflation,

215
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:09,467
will be $6 million a year

216
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:10,976
by the time
he's ready to go to school.

217
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:13,612
Okay, well, I'm operating
on two hours of sleep, too.

218
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,900
And I know I don't have a job,
but at least your nipples

219
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,342
don't feel like chew toys.

220
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,834
Wait, are you getting rid
of those?

221
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:20,084
They're so nice.

222
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,278
Um, these are way too big
for me now.

223
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:25,936
So I am donating them, yes.

224
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,472
I thought
they were your favorite.

225
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,908
Don't get rid of 'em.

226
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:30,277
Okay.

227
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:32,827
Okay. What?

228
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,624
Uh, nothing.

229
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:38,592
Never mind.
I'll keep 'em.

230
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,746
Tobe, what is going on?

231
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,866
We've been snippy with each
other for the past two weeks.

232
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,191
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
what hasn't been going on.

233
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,825
I'll tell you what hasn't
been going on for nine months

234
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,542
and 23 days.

235
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,577
We're tired.

236
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,979
And Jack is sleeping
right next to us.

237
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,795
I know. But he can't, like...

238
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,772
can't see us.

239
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,358
Um, he can hear us.

240
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:04,573
You.

241
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,276
So, y-you know what, we...

242
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,241
we need to get out of here.
All right?

243
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:09,936
We need to...
We need to find a...

244
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:12,907
an environment
that is more conducive to...

245
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,486
lovemaking.

246
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:16,475
Okay.
And when are we gonna do that?

247
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:18,569
I don't know. Today?
How 'bout today?

248
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,104
I already took the day off.

249
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,440
Huh? We can get your mom

250
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,084
and Miggy Stardust to come over.

251
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:24,420
They've been dying to babysit.

252
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,874
They've been begging us
to go out more.

253
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:27,178
Tobe, I don't know.

254
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,070
No, you<i> do</i> know.

255
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:31,491
You know we<i> have</i> to do this.

256
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:33,628
We<i> need</i> to do this.

257
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,465
For the sake of our sex life,

258
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:37,475
call your mother.

259
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:39,061
- Okay.
- Please call her.

260
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,755
- I'm going to.
- Please start dialing.

261
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,163
Okay.

262
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,621
Oh, oh, you got it,
you got it, you got it. - Oh.

263
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,417
Okay. Ooh.

264
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,300
- Oh.
- Hey.

265
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:53,659
- Thanks. I had that, by the way.
- Yeah.

266
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:58,665
Yeah, it's just, rep 99 and 100
are typically the hardest ones.

267
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,691
- Sure. You're back.
- Yeah.

268
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,621
I'm just trying to stay out
of trouble, you know,

269
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,949
not that you could actually get
into any trouble in this town.

270
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,918
- Mind if I, uh...?
- You're gonna do some pull-ups?

271
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,619
- Yeah.
- You want a boost? Wha...?

272
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:10,730
Okay. She's got it.

273
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,183
She has got it.
Wow. That's...

274
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,656
impressive.

275
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:17,175
- Here you go, Kevin.
- Hey.

276
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:18,698
- The usual.
- Thank you.

277
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:21,206
That's... You don't have
to deliver my...

278
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,034
Oxi-Protein PB Energy Spike?

279
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:24,870
- And did you add the...?
- Chia.

280
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,555
- Yes.
- Wow.

281
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:27,992
You're like my phone
anticipating my...

282
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,547
- Words.
- Okay.

283
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:31,934
Technically, you're not supposed
to have drinks

284
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:35,409
around the workout stations,
but I'll let it go this time.

285
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,184
Well, thank you
for letting it go this time.

286
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,792
- I appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

287
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,339
Ah.

288
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,182
The service here's amazing.

289
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:46,245
Yeah. She wrote her number
on your cup.

290
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:47,321
What?

291
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:50,251
Hey! Look at that.

292
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,144
No. No.

293
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:54,938
You know, AA discourages
romantic relationships

294
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:56,198
in the first year.

295
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:58,737
- And drinking.
- Wow. You really sold that.

296
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,604
Talk to your husband?

297
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,612
Not since the hockey game.

298
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,245
Really?

299
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:06,425
Divorce is on the table, right?

300
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,696
You don't have all this time.

301
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:10,878
Plus, you know what?
He could just meet someone else.

302
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,282
Like, take my ex,
for instance... Zoe, right?

303
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,332
It's only been, like, six months,
but yet, here she is,

304
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:17,269
jet-setting around the planet
with some

305
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,775
sandwich artist guy.
What do you think?

306
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,342
Huh? She into him?

307
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,361
Well, 20 bucks says
they had bathroom sex

308
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:25,017
right before
they took this picture.

309
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:29,642
She's gorgeous.

310
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,678
- Yeah.
- Why'd you guys break up?

311
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:36,403
She didn't want kids.

312
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,400
And you do?

313
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,853
Well, yeah, I want kid...

314
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:42,890
Why do you act all skeptical
and, like, surprised?

315
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:45,999
I don't know.
You don't seem... motivated.

316
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:47,492
You just moved
to the middle of nowhere,

317
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,477
and you spend all your time
with your grumpy uncle, and...

318
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:50,564
Yeah, to help him out.

319
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,588
It's temporary. Trust me,
I'll get back in the saddle.

320
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:54,190
I'm just saying,
you're not getting any younger.

321
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:57,743
I'm not getting any younger?
I'm 30, like, something.

322
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,358
I'm sorry. I missed that.
You're 30...?

323
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,531
- Can you enunciate a little?
- I'll enunciate, okay?

324
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:02,883
- Just enunciate.
- Okay, here it goes. You are very

325
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,046
annoying.

326
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:05,333
All right? Come on.

327
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,602
Spot me. Grab the 45s
if you can lift them.

328
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:16,860
<i>What you want is
what you get at McDonald's today.</i>

329
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:18,688
<i>- That swing...</i>
- Hey, bud.

330
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,477
- Hey.
<i>- That fantastic touch around the green.</i>

331
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:24,508
<i>- That smile.</i>
- His name is Tiger Woods.

332
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,931
Mr. Lawrence said he's gonna
change the game of golf.

333
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,862
Yeah, I've heard of him.

334
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,899
<i>Tiger Woods has won the world
junior title six times.</i>

335
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:38,188
<i>In fact, Tiger has won
so many trophies,</i>

336
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,844
<i>his mother says they can't
all fit in the house.</i>

337
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,797
<i>Some of his are stashed
in the garage.</i>

338
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,434
Hey, how about tomorrow
after school,

339
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:48,438
you and me, we...
we go play some?

340
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:50,157
Golf?

341
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:52,266
- Really?
- Yeah.

342
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,665
Yeah, we'll go hit some balls
at the range first,

343
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,534
and then we'll go par three.

344
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,197
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

345
00:13:59,284 --> 00:14:01,299
Sure. Sure!

346
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:04,086
Okay. Cool.

347
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,336
But I thought
you didn't like golf.

348
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,649
It wasn't the right fit for me,

349
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,789
and my ball always seemed
to find the water, but...

350
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,891
I think
you might be cut out for it.

351
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:31,414
Okay, gents, dollar a hole,
two dollar Nassau,

352
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,899
50 cent skins.

353
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,569
Pearson, you're up.

354
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:37,289
Oh.

355
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,172
Okay.

356
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:44,024
I'll say it again, gentlemen.

357
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:48,118
I don't have a very good history
with this game.

358
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,852
As in, I have only played
one time.

359
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,400
Fore!

360
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:05,391
Sorry!

361
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:09,610
- Oh, boy.
- Bubba.

362
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,047
Yeah.

363
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,457
- You're in the wrong cart.
- I sure am.

364
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:19,571
Sure as hell am.

365
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,418
<i>Ou est le métro, madame?</i>

366
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,651
Ooh, la, la.

367
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,641
What did you just say?

368
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:46,360
I said, "Where can I find
the subway, miss?"

369
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,453
It's the only French I remember

370
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,989
after backpacking
through Europe.

371
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:57,508
Um, can we dim the lights just
so it's a little more romantic?

372
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,063
As you wish.

373
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,208
Setting the mood...

374
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:05,407
- Oh.
- Wow.

375
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:08,646
- Oh.
- Oh.

376
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,024
My God, you are so hunky.

377
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:14,228
♪ <i>I don't need what you need,</i>
<i>I'm so unbothered by you...</i> ♪

378
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,687
Oh.

379
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,657
Mmm. Mm-hmm,
yeah, I remember.

380
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:22,801
Like riding a bike.

381
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,870
Oh.

382
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:31,208
It's okay.

383
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,571
Oh, it's not...
I just have...

384
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,141
I just have a lot on my mind.
It's...

385
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,124
Like what, babe?

386
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:43,331
I just need a minute
to clear my brain, you know?

387
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,953
Just...

388
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,735
empty my mind. Um...

389
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,321
Okay.

390
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,180
Want to watch Turner Classics?

391
00:16:58,414 --> 00:16:59,672
It's a great idea.

392
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,809
Yup, Turner Classic Movies.

393
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,845
TCM... that'll, uh,

394
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,137
get me going.

395
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:10,446
<i>- Well, here we are again.
- Yes.</i>

396
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:16,805
You are gonna need
to find the right clothes.

397
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:19,774
What? I thought we were just
gonna hit some balls.

398
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:20,813
Well, it doesn't matter.

399
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:23,100
Uh, you need
to wear a collared shirt

400
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,802
here at the club and no jeans.

401
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,836
Uh, you know what?

402
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:28,110
I forgot my credit card.

403
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:30,502
No, no, no, it's on me.
What size shoes do you wear?

404
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,284
No, sir, I don't feel
comfortable you buying me...

405
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:34,740
Hey, Dave?
I'm playing with Johnson.

406
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,267
You want to join?

407
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,993
Uh, sure. Sure.

408
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:39,716
Yeah, no.
We'll meet you right outside.

409
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:40,808
Okay.

410
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:42,227
Yeah.

411
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,344
Gonna take a lot more

412
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,013
than lowering the speed limit
to 55

413
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,183
to reduce our dependency on gas.

414
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:50,747
Yeah, what's your take
on OPEC, Jack?

415
00:17:51,564 --> 00:17:55,771
Well, I know the lines are long
where I work.

416
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,927
You work at a gas station?

417
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,604
Yeah. Part-time mechanic
at Vine Auto

418
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:05,747
when I'm not helping my buddy
frame houses.

419
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,013
Well, you hear that, Merrick?
Jack frames houses.

420
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:11,550
Doesn't your insurance company
specialize in construction?

421
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,263
Yeah, mostly umbrella liability.

422
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,105
Well, you must need smart guys.

423
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:16,927
Give Jack your card, Merrick.

424
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:18,889
Maybe he can come in
next week for an informational.

425
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,591
- Sure.
- Oh, it's-it's not necessary.

426
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,057
- No, no.
- Hey.

427
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,581
Thank you for that.

428
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,966
There's hope for you yet.

429
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,263
- Bam!
- Oh.

430
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:31,263
You didn't win the Masters,
Bill.

431
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:32,841
I mean, come on.

432
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,154
You triple-bogeyed
the second hole.

433
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:38,677
- Well... are you sure?
- Four.

434
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,345
Yeah, I am sure.
- Okay.

435
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,247
- Ask my caddy.
- Yeah.

436
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,732
- There's a hundred in it for you.
- Oh, I'm sure there is.

437
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:46,685
- <i>Better be sure...</i>
- Gin and tonic.

438
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:48,711
- Double.
- Double or triple?

439
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:49,836
Oh, I try.

440
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,618
- <i>Triple.</i>
- Can you back it up?

441
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:56,534
Wow. Look at us, huh?

442
00:18:56,778 --> 00:19:00,021
Yeah.

443
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:03,896
We should play for $1,000.

444
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,328
A grand? Really?

445
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,647
That's what Michael Jordan bets.

446
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,435
Okay, M.J., you're up.

447
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:10,060
Okay.

448
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:17,115
Mr. Lawrence says Tiger Woods is
gonna break barriers in golf.

449
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:22,622
Great putt.

450
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,192
Mr. Lawrence says I'm breaking
barriers at Hanes Academy, too.

451
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,044
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

452
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,443
'Cause they never had
a black kid on the debate team.

453
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,591
- I didn't know that.
- Mm.

454
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:34,940
Look at you.

455
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,474
Nice!

456
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,233
Yeah, I'm not saying it'll be as hard

457
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:45,615
for me as it was for Jackie
Robinson and Muhammad Ali, but

458
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,169
it'll still be hard for me,
you know?

459
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:50,349
Oh, you're gonna do just fine,
Randall.

460
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:54,189
You are insanely smart
and charming, and you're gonna

461
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,159
do just fine wherever
you want to go in life.

462
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:58,627
Thanks.

463
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:00,255
You know, when I was younger,

464
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:03,325
I never felt welcome
at country clubs.

465
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:05,490
People thought I...

466
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:09,833
I didn't... make enough money
or have the right job.

467
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:12,740
Probably why I stopped playing.

468
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,591
I let those people get to me.

469
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,880
That's not what I'm saying, Dad.

470
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,916
No, I...
I know what you're saying.

471
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:23,521
I do, and I'm gonna
do everything in my power

472
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:26,872
to make sure
that nobody gets in your way

473
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,761
or holds you back.

474
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,193
Okay.

475
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:35,833
Thanks.

476
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:45,527
Ooh.

477
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:47,419
Oh, right in the drink.

478
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:49,777
Dave, you should buy the kid
a lake house.

479
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,700
He loves the water.

480
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:54,115
You're up, Dave.
Show us the way.

481
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:56,979
Mm.

482
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:00,069
- Thank you, Sam.
- Sometime today.

483
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,638
He liked it so much, right,

484
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,788
that now every time we go
over to the mayor's house,

485
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,857
my wife has to make him
potato salad.

486
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:11,370
You know, the one thing
about potato salad...

487
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:13,497
Uh, they're off the green.
You can hit.

488
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,927
Oh, right on.

489
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:30,385
I'll walk.

490
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,552
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

491
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:42,005
Slow everything down.

492
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,450
You're too fast.
Look.

493
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:47,380
It's just back... and through.

494
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:48,904
Tempo.

495
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,006
Okay.

496
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:02,637
Slowing down really helps.

497
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,290
Thanks for the tip.

498
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,350
I also ran track.

499
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:14,952
- Ah.
- Now I think

500
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,389
I'm gonna go back
to grad school and maybe

501
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:19,492
get a degree in kinesiology
or nutrition.

502
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:23,161
Yeah. I am very much
into nutrition.

503
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:24,755
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

504
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,761
Like, uh, take now
for instance.

505
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:28,355
I'm starving, you know?

506
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:29,764
And we've been sitting here
for 20 minutes

507
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,193
and I've yet to see a menu.

508
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:33,075
I'm starting
to realize that, uh,

509
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:35,138
people from small towns
are never in a hurry.

510
00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:36,880
♪ <i>She's living in I.A.</i> ♪

511
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:38,255
Small towns aren't for everyone.

512
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:40,501
- Mm.
- But I remind myself

513
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,209
of something Richard Russo
once said.

514
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:44,712
- Yeah.
- "People in small towns,

515
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,781
"more than in big cities,

516
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,693
share a destiny."

517
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,325
Well, I like that.

518
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:55,159
- ♪<i> They say it goes...</i> ♪

519
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,667
I feel like, uh,

520
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,238
destiny sort of brought me here,
actually.

521
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:01,702
Yeah.

522
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:03,464
But do-do you see yourself
settling down

523
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:05,886
in a town like Bradford
after grad school?

524
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:09,847
I suppose if I met
the right person

525
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,226
and he wanted to live here,
I would.

526
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,425
It's a perfect town
to raise kids.

527
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:18,467
I love kids.

528
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:19,933
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

529
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:21,413
See? There,
we have something in common.

530
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,099
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

531
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:29,931
Charlie, I've changed my mind.
I'll go with the ribeye.

532
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:32,105
- How would you like that, sir?
- Rare.

533
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:34,316
Just knock off the horns
and wipe its ass.

534
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:46,823
Hey, seriously, Jack,

535
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,487
call me if you want to come in
for an interview.

536
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,972
Yeah, you two should set up
a time for next week.

537
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,957
Well, that, uh,
won't be necessary,

538
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:54,675
but thank you, Merrick.

539
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,408
Okay.

540
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:08,160
You okay, bud?

541
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,386
Yeah.

542
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:13,251
You sure?

543
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:16,676
I mean, you barely said a word
in the last couple of holes.

544
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,800
I don't think I want
to play anymore.

545
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:22,900
Randall, c-come on.

546
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:24,673
We got four more holes to go.

547
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,861
You know we don't quit
what we started.

548
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:28,667
We quit the dojo.

549
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,712
Do you remember that dojo
we went to a few years ago

550
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,471
with all the other
black families?

551
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,073
Yeah.

552
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,222
We went a few times,
but then we stopped.

553
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,027
W... You said you didn't want
to learn karate anymore.

554
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:43,652
Yeah, but you won't let me quit
soccer or baseball.

555
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:45,222
You don't want me
to quit golf.

556
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,628
I ju... I-I don't quite follow
you here, Randall.

557
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,623
Forget it.
Can we please

558
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,895
- just go home?
- H-Hold on a second.

559
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,800
Where is this coming from?

560
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,562
Is this Mr. Lawrence again?

561
00:24:57,649 --> 00:24:59,003
N-No.

562
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:00,960
No. You just, y...

563
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:02,567
You just don't get it.

564
00:25:02,654 --> 00:25:03,691
What don't I get?

565
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,360
What you said before...

566
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:08,324
about feeling weird at some
country club golf course.

567
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:10,222
Okay?

568
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,176
You felt uncomfortable
at a golf course

569
00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:14,691
and I probably wouldn't have
even been allowed on it.

570
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,806
Kiddo, I am sorry, okay?

571
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:25,190
That was a stupid thing to say.

572
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:26,660
I just... I-I don't...

573
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:29,418
I don't look at you
and see color.

574
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:31,503
I see my son.

575
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,433
Then you don't see me, Dad.

576
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:44,503
Now, remember,

577
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:48,917
you pull it back in one piece,
slowly... and let it go.

578
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:01,315
Oh, that was a good one.

579
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:03,168
And you were right
about the grip, too.

580
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:05,581
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- All right.

581
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:07,580
- Book them the honeymoon suite.
- Yeah, no doubt about that.

582
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,934
Carl, why don't you grab
your clubs,

583
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:10,589
go look for your ball
with Lester.

584
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:12,980
Randall, hop on in.

585
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,582
Thank you so much
for the meal.

586
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:24,753
You are more than welcome.

587
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,155
So, um...

588
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:28,292
what else is there
to do in this town?

589
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:29,521
And, um,

590
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,323
please don't say
the Zippo factory.

591
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,621
To be honest, there's nothing
really to do here,

592
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:36,277
- Mm.
- Except get high and have sex.

593
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,628
And I don't do drugs.

594
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,722
Uh, I know what you're thinking.

595
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:49,378
Even the tunnel's getting laid.

596
00:26:53,691 --> 00:26:55,027
Is it me?

597
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:56,956
Hmm?

598
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,252
Are you still attracted to me?

599
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:01,738
Are you kidding?

600
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,488
I don't know.

601
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,980
You have a whole new body.

602
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:07,847
- And...
- Kate, really.

603
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:09,996
I swear, I just have
a lot on my mind.

604
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:11,503
Okay?

605
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:16,605
Okay.

606
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:21,699
It is the pants.

607
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,079
- What?
- What you said to me

608
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:25,822
about keeping my old pants

609
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,779
in case I put
the weight back on.

610
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,782
Along with the pressure
of knowing

611
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:32,817
that if I didn't perform,

612
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:35,654
you would think it was because
I wasn't attracted to you.

613
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,683
Add stress and exhaustion
and...

614
00:27:38,771 --> 00:27:42,423
- Toby...
- Look, why-why-why did you say it?

615
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:43,924
You know,
is it because you-you doubt

616
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:46,164
that I can keep the weight off,
or because you're hoping

617
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:48,081
that I put the weight back on?

618
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:51,321
Okay, Tobe.

619
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,972
Let's just go home.

620
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:02,243
Well, I'm glad I'm driving.

621
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:04,526
You really put back
those G and Ts.

622
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:06,925
Oh, no. I'm... I'm fine.

623
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:09,528
Thank you, though,
for the, uh...

624
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,542
drinks and the round.

625
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:17,902
Jack, you really should
have taken that interview.

626
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:22,698
I appreciate the gesture,

627
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:26,019
but I don't need any help, sir.

628
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,144
Look, my father...

629
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:31,386
was a pipe-fitter.

630
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,236
He worked hard
to put me through college.

631
00:28:34,324 --> 00:28:35,792
And after I graduated,

632
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:39,148
I wasn't too proud
to take a job as a runner

633
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:40,886
at a brokerage house.

634
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:44,767
I rose up the ranks,
met the woman I'd marry.

635
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,212
I bought a house,
raised a family.

636
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,769
Yeah, I...

637
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,394
I joined a nice country club.

638
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:52,527
And-And this club is where

639
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:56,097
we are gonna celebrate
Rebecca's wedding.

640
00:28:56,949 --> 00:28:58,738
I see myself

641
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:02,004
walking her down the aisle
at St. Michael's,

642
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:04,673
and afterwards,
coming over here,

643
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:06,742
and raising a toast to her

644
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,644
and her husband
at the reception.

645
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:11,824
I see it all so clearly.

646
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:14,558
Question.

647
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,058
Do you see yourself here?

648
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,081
Randall said all that?

649
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:30,683
Yeah.

650
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:36,671
Well... he's getting older

651
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:39,933
- and figuring out his place in the world.
- Mm.

652
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,413
Hey, did we let him quit
the dojo too easily?

653
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,394
I mean...

654
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,199
were<i> we</i> threatened by it?

655
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,753
No.

656
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,855
It was a long drive.

657
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:56,057
And he wasn't excited about it.

658
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:57,597
It just...

659
00:29:57,801 --> 00:30:01,027
- It fizzled out.
- Yeah.

660
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:03,511
Yeah.

661
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:07,779
Oh, not a minute too soon.

662
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,367
Thank you, Lisa.

663
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,917
- Okay.
- There you go.

664
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:14,375
Could have been a lot worse

665
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,853
without the councilman's
lessons.

666
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,527
How'd you grow up
with a white father

667
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,224
and not know how to golf?

668
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,365
Tell me about it.

669
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,268
Hey, how did you guys
find the game?

670
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:25,341
Well, when I-I said
I wanted to learn,

671
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:27,455
my father painted
a golf pro's house

672
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:29,625
for free in exchange
for lessons.

673
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:31,493
Really? All right.

674
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:34,449
- Tiger winning at Augusta in '97.
- Mm-hmm.

675
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:36,564
Hey, my Aunt Lizzie.

676
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:38,291
She taught me
to putt like Lee Elder

677
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:40,659
and cuss like Red Foxx.

678
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,797
Well, thank you, gentlemen,

679
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:45,641
for dragging my sorry ass
around the course today.

680
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:48,143
Here is to fathers,
to Tiger,

681
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:50,808
and to Lester's foul-mouthed
Aunt Lizzie.

682
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:52,178
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

683
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,088
- If they could see us now.
- Mm.

684
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:59,594
Listen...
Why don't you find some time

685
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:02,690
to stop by the office,
we'll talk about your grocery store.

686
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,927
After we talk about
my housing bill.

687
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:06,795
- Yes, sir.
- Mm.

688
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:08,291
That's a sure shot.

689
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,961
That wasn't my shot.
I told you...

690
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,532
- You parked so far away.
- I'm sorry.

691
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,008
My uncle lives right here
so we got to kind of be quiet.

692
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:17,207
- I'll try.
- Okay.

693
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,664
- But I make no promises.
- You are trouble.

694
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:28,674
Hey.

695
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,243
Sorry.

696
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,385
Thought you'd be alone.

697
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:36,831
You didn't have
to send her away.

698
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,620
Sorry I interrupted.

699
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,198
That's all right.

700
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:45,300
You interviewing mothers
to bear your children?

701
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:48,870
Really? 'Cause I can catch up
with Donna.

702
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,752
I saw Ryan.

703
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,237
And?

704
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,151
Total fubar.

705
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,893
It started out okay, and then...

706
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:02,718
he got critical,
and I got defensive,

707
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:05,157
and then we started arguing,

708
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:06,971
and I lost my temper.

709
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:11,776
I'm sorry.

710
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:15,081
I told you it was a bad idea.

711
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,451
I don't blame Ryan.

712
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,157
I wouldn't want to be

713
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:20,555
with someone
as screwed up as me.

714
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:22,338
Hey, come on.

715
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:25,815
You've seen things.

716
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:28,362
You-you have seen things
that 99% of us,

717
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,365
we can't even imagine.

718
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,953
And yeah, you made
some mistakes

719
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,470
along the way,
but you're trying.

720
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,970
That doesn't make you
unlovable.

721
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,524
It makes you human.

722
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,290
I'm sorry.

723
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:05,025
- Hello? Anybody home?
- Oh, no.

724
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:07,937
They're, um, heading back
from The Grove now with Jack.

725
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:09,552
Oh.

726
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:13,670
I'm gonna unpack.

727
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:15,447
Okay.

728
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,256
Kate?

729
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:35,269
Okay.

730
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:38,913
Do you forgive me?

731
00:33:41,347 --> 00:33:43,084
For what you said

732
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:46,052
or for cutting up
the wrong pair of pants?

733
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:51,185
Both?

734
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:54,787
Baby,

735
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:56,436
I believe in you.

736
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:58,685
I always have.
I always will.

737
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,045
Oh, yeah?

738
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,420
Yes.

739
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:04,378
Do you believe me when I say

740
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:08,091
that you still fuel the furnace
that is my loins?

741
00:34:08,774 --> 00:34:10,927
Well, I could use
some convincing.

742
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,716
My attraction to you...

743
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:15,334
- Mm-hmm.
- Is purely primal, Kate Pearson.

744
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:19,099
You are nothing more to me
than a vessel for my feral lust.

745
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,935
And the rest of it,
the emotional stuff,

746
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:23,084
I cast aside with contempt.

747
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:24,586
Now,

748
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:29,177
do you want to take Toby 2.0
for a spin?

749
00:34:29,662 --> 00:34:31,896
I will drive you down
to the rims.

750
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:34,271
- Safe word?
- Mom and Miguel.

751
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:36,374
- Weird, but I like it.
- No, they're gonna be back

752
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:37,897
- in, like, five minutes.
- Good.

753
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:39,889
That gives us four minutes
to put ourselves back together.

754
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:41,591
- Oh? Yeah?
- Yeah.

755
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:07,131
I'm gonna marry
your daughter, Dave.

756
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:08,747
I'm... I'm gonna marry her.

757
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,295
I'm gonna get a good job.

758
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:14,599
Buy a real nice house.

759
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:16,435
A happy one.

760
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,291
With kids

761
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:21,360
running around the yard.

762
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:22,982
So...

763
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:26,571
let me ask you.

764
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,490
Do you see yourself there?

765
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:42,937
You're never gonna be
good enough for her, Jack.

766
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:45,741
Say again?

767
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,077
- Why don't you say that again?
- Oh, there he is.

768
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:55,077
There's the guy
I've been waiting for, huh?

769
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:56,461
Say it again.

770
00:35:56,548 --> 00:35:58,163
Uh-huh.

771
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,084
Jack?

772
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:01,952
Hey, Bec.

773
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:03,972
- I... Oh!
- Oh.

774
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,612
- You okay?
- Yeah, no.

775
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:06,988
- I'm fine.
- It was hot

776
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:09,206
out there,
and he just had a few too many.

777
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,010
I'm fine. You good? You okay?

778
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:14,308
- You, uh, you good?
- Hey.

779
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,181
Why don't we get you home?

780
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:19,343
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, I'll take you home.

781
00:36:30,597 --> 00:36:32,745
Jesus, Nick.

782
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:36,561
You scared the hell out of me.

783
00:36:36,649 --> 00:36:39,465
Why can't you just stay
at your own place?

784
00:36:39,553 --> 00:36:41,702
You have fresh cold cuts.

785
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:43,393
Yeah. Well, okay.

786
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,063
Well, you know, help yourself.

787
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:46,634
Of course.

788
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,901
I'm sorry.

789
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:54,042
We should've taken
that hike today.

790
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:02,050
- Night.
- Good night, Uncle Nicky.

791
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,159
Wait.

792
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:53,143
- Mr. Lawrence.
- Randall, my man.

793
00:37:57,035 --> 00:38:00,118
Mr. Lawrence,
can I, uh, talk to you a sec?

794
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:01,800
Sure.

795
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,308
Go on. I'll be right in.

796
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:04,972
Okay.

797
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:08,206
Thank you for taking
a special interest in my son.

798
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:09,706
He really looks up to you.

799
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:12,877
Uh, still, he's a...

800
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,855
12-year-old kid,

801
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:18,503
and if my son is asking
complicated, heavy questions

802
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,722
about his place in this world,

803
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,276
a simple heads-up to his parents
couldn't hurt.

804
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,073
Don't you think?

805
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:28,261
- A heads-up.
- Mm.

806
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:31,183
Okay. Anything else?

807
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,336
No.

808
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:38,573
Actually, would, uh...

809
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:41,119
you and your wife like

810
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:43,112
to come to the house
this weekend for dinner?

811
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:46,683
We'd love to.

812
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,706
Great. Saturday at 7:00?

813
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,128
- Hey, nice job, Randall.
- Thanks.

814
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:00,878
I'll do better next time,
I promise.

815
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:07,065
<i>Randall, hold on a second.</i>

816
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:08,534
Stop.

817
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:16,018
I'm sorry.

818
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,664
All right? I will...

819
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:23,683
listen better and lecture less.

820
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:26,743
Okay?

821
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,878
You are gonna be
a very important man, Randall.

822
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:40,505
And a lot
of important relationships

823
00:39:40,592 --> 00:39:42,274
happen on a golf course.

824
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:46,091
Me, I... I hit a ceiling.

825
00:39:46,495 --> 00:39:47,692
But for you,

826
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:50,695
there is only sky.

827
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:54,018
So don't get caught
on the outside looking in.

828
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:56,627
Sometimes you'll have
to play up to the competition,

829
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,721
sometimes you'll have
to play down.

830
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,809
But play the game.

831
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,948
Like father, like son.

832
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,334
What you want...

833
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:33,143
is to have a routine.

834
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:36,104
First,
you got to line your shot up.

835
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,408
And then you line your feet up

836
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,733
to the target.

837
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:47,067
- Okay?
- Okay.

838
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,495
Good.

839
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,316
Again.

840
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,529
Again.

841
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:27,661
<i>Again.</i>

842
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:49,255
This one's for you, Pop.
