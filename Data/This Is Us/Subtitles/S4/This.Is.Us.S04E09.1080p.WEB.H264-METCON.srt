1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:02,412
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:05,073
My nephew came back
into my life.

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,640
No matter how much
I told him to scram.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,976
You should come
to Philly with me.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,379
For Thanksgiving.

6
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:15,015
Deja, I'm sorry we haven't
taken you to see Shauna.

7
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,485
I'd actually like
to invite her here.

8
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,553
For Thanksgiving.

9
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,055
Aw, open up.

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,357
- There you go.
- Oh, my, this is...

11
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,326
Well, this is terrible timing.

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,995
Kate, you did it.
He's eating it.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,264
First solid food, buddy.

14
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,899
I'm not gonna go see some doctor

15
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,867
just because
you're overreacting.

16
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,545
- I'm just worried that there could be...
- I said I'm fine.

17
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,338
- Mom.
- Randall!

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,107
Enough.

19
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,848
- I hate Thanksgiving.
- Shh. Nicky.

20
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,059
And Layne finishes it out,

21
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,851
hitting the 101 mark

22
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,621
in touchdown passes
for a Lions win, 28 to 24.

23
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,689
- Yes.
- Dang it.

24
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,891
Pay up, daddy-O.

25
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,528
Jack!

26
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,664
Nicky! Where the hell are you?

27
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,836
It's okay.

28
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,915
What, too much thankfulness
going on in there?

29
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,993
Huh. Grandpa's three sheets
to the wind and won't stop

30
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,654
asking me if I'm scared
of being drafted next week.

31
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,057
Mom burned the bird
and Dad's about to blow.

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,892
And it's only 11:00.

33
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,637
Well, it's the best day
of the year, every single year,

34
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:34,795
like clockwork, isn't it?

35
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,029
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,932
You want to split?

37
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,469
And just ditch Thanksgiving?

38
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,514
Shoot.

39
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:57,851
Yo. Ready to, uh,

40
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,353
hit the road to Philly?

41
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,355
Wow, well, look at you.
You look sharp.

42
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:03,657
- I look like I'm in a Viagra commercial.
- You do not.

43
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,594
You look very, uh,
you know, newly sober chic.

44
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,330
I'm not sure about this, Kevin.

45
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,764
I'm telling you.
I'm 100% on this.

46
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,342
Pleated pants are in.
GQ did a whole spread.

47
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,702
I'm not talking about
pleated pants, you nitwit.

48
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,146
Uh, coming to your brother's
for Thanksgiving,

49
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,639
you know,
with your whole family.

50
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,642
- Nicky, everyone's really excited to see you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,977
They are... It's gonna be
perfect, trust me. Okay?

52
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,455
What are you gonna
do about that monstrosity

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,215
of a trailer out there?

54
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,818
Uh, I don't... I haven't, you
know, called to return it yet.

55
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,653
I don't...

56
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,464
I-I was thinking, you know,
after Thanksgiving,

57
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,056
I'd drive you back here

58
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,958
and maybe spend
a little more time in Bradford.

59
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,161
- Really? Hmm.
- Maybe.

60
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,667
All right.

61
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,839
Good morning, my turkeys.

62
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,674
Good morning, my giblets.

63
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,819
This would be easier to do
if you had two hands, you know?

64
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,821
Hey, why are we setting up
a card table in the foyer?

65
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,847
'Cause our dining table
only seats eight,

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,425
and we've expecting 13 guests...

67
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,651
with all the birth moms
and long-lost uncles.

68
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,985
Yeah.

69
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,920
- Just lean in, baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

70
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,056
Hey, Deja. You look nice.

71
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,858
Uh, you sure it's not too fancy?

72
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,860
- I think your mom will love it.
- Thanks.

73
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,396
Um, I don't know.
I'm still gonna change.

74
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,197
I'm not feeling it.

75
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,233
Oh, dear God,

76
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,168
please let Shauna be okay.

77
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,605
Deja is so nervous. I just want
today to go well for her.

78
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,607
Amen.

79
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,279
Just go talk to her.

80
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,247
It's Thanksgiving.

81
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,084
She probably wants to make up
as much as you do.

82
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,021
Hey.

83
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,257
You guys are up
and cooking already, huh?

84
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,026
Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,263
So, Randall, I'm putting, uh,
chorizo in the stuffing.

86
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:52,099
- Barefoot Contessa-style.
- Nice.

87
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,569
Mom, Kevin and Uncle Nicky are
en route and Kate just texted.

88
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:58,272
- Their flight is on time.
- Great.

89
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,107
Okay, so I'm gonna go set up

90
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,975
the VCR for Police Academy 3,

91
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,044
and let you guys have
an opportunity to talk.

92
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,679
Cool.

93
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,952
I got all
the traditional staples.

94
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,589
The saltines, the hot dogs,
the Kraft Singles.

95
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,504
Randall, I did not forget.

96
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,740
I was just gonna
make myself some tea.

97
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,942
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

98
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,953
You know, I also managed to make
the cranberry sauce this morning

99
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,280
- without blowing up the house.
- Of course you did.

100
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,586
Mom, I didn't mean
to overstep last night.

101
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,488
- I'm sorry if I...
- Yeah, you know, I-I...

102
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,857
really want to try
and put last night behind us.

103
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,792
I know. Me, too.

104
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,427
But at some point,
we need to talk about

105
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,838
what's going on with you.

106
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,673
- If we think this...
- Okay. I need some space.

107
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,699
I need to get out of here
for a minute.

108
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,534
- Where are you going, Mom?
- I don't know.

109
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,170
I'm gonna go get dressed
and just take a walk,

110
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,874
clear my head, I don't kn...
Maybe I'll go see a movie.

111
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,909
I'll be back in time for dinner.

112
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,546
And I would, um, appreciate it

113
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,250
if you kept this little argument
of ours between us.

114
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,656
- Of course.
- Okay.

115
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,559
I will pick up a pie
on the way back.

116
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,497
Dad, I can't find
the Thanksgiving box.

117
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,365
The Pilgrim Rick hat is in it.

118
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,747
Oh, and there's this really
funny hat that your Grandpa Jack

119
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,540
used to wear.

120
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,842
Oh, and we'll be listening
to Police Academy 3.

121
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:46,146
Which is kind of like PAW Patrol
but with humans and swearing.

122
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,048
My CrossFit group text

123
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,318
is going crazy for Jack's
first solid food video.

124
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,020
They love it, buddy. Huh?

125
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,355
And-and my Insta is-is,
like, blowing up.

126
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,059
The likes just keep rolling in.

127
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,996
- Toby, I have to tell you something.
- Okay.

128
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,434
Um, and listen,
I am, I am so, so sorry.

129
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,368
It was a total accident.

130
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,004
But, um...

131
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,016
Jack's first avocado was
actually at Gregory's house

132
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,608
when you weren't home.

133
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,244
What?

134
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,013
Yeah, he just, he wasn't
taking food that morning,

135
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,850
and-and when he went...
When Gregory went to feed him,

136
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,518
I just, I didn't stop him
and then...

137
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,954
Wow. This is...

138
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,723
So-so, you've just been lying
to me for the last 24 hours?

139
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,559
Tobe.

140
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,394
You feeding Jack was still
a real beautiful moment.

141
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,064
Was it, Kate?
'Cause thinking back on it now,

142
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,132
it seems kind of humiliating.

143
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,603
Okay... Toby, I'm home alone
all day with Jack.

144
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,605
Okay? And things
are gonna happen.

145
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,607
So what if he takes
his-his first steps

146
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,984
when you're at CrossFit?
What am I gonna do?

147
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,385
Should I, should I
just knock him down?

148
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,211
Yeah, okay, no, so it's my fault

149
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,781
that you fed him an avocado
and then lied to me about it.

150
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,415
Because I was at the gym.
Okay, got it.

151
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,084
I did not say it was your fault.

152
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,386
I meant that... You know what?

153
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,089
I'm sorry,

154
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,058
a-and I'm just, I'm tired.

155
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,660
Yeah.

156
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,672
- It's okay.
- You know what? It's okay.

157
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,799
It's okay.

158
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,400
We're all tire...
We're all tired.

159
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,603
It's probably why
I am overreacting

160
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,306
to AvocadoGate here.

161
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,277
There will be plenty
of firsts, right?

162
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,579
Right.

163
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,982
Like his first Thanksgiving.

164
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,184
- Yeah.
- This is your first one, buddy.

165
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,655
It's gonna be awesome. Yeah.

166
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,446
You know, I can't believe
you bet against Dallas

167
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,472
just because Dad
loves the Cowboys.

168
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,541
And with Jonny?

169
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,277
- Yeah.
- Touchdown Cowboys.

170
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,547
The extra point will tie it up.

171
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,981
Hey, how much did you bet,

172
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,818
- anyhow?
- Mm. 200 bucks.

173
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,521
- 200? Jesus...
- It's not like I can bring it with me.

174
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,557
You know what, stop.
You're not going to Vietnam.

175
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,125
You are not gonna get
your number called next week.

176
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,962
And the kick is good.

177
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:19,299
The Cowboys are going to
escape with a 24-24 tie.

178
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,004
Oh, co... What are you
grinning about? I-It...

179
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,973
ended in a tie.

180
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,741
All right? You got lucky.
It's a push.

181
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,743
No, it's not.

182
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,313
What do you got, points?

183
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,248
Jonny gave you points?

184
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,250
Happy Thanksgiving.

185
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,986
Thanks, Jonny.

186
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,559
- How much money is that?
- It's a lot.

187
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,238
It's really nice

188
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,440
- to finally meet you, Nicky.
- Oh.

189
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,176
Hey, this place is amazing.
You call this downsizing?

190
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,779
Don't test me, brother-in-law.
And, uh, what fell on your face?

191
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,581
Uh, walked into a wall.

192
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,593
- All good.
- Uh, it would be in the attic.

193
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,085
Yeah, the cardboard box labeled
"Thanksgiving" or "Holidays."

194
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,955
- Thank you so much for checking.
- Come on. My brother.

195
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,399
Happy Thanksgiving.

196
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,891
What happened to your face?

197
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,292
Eh, fly ball to the face.

198
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,695
Yeah. Nicky.

199
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,131
You look amazing.
Kevin Queer Eyed you, huh?

200
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,433
I don't know what that means.

201
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,935
- He does.
- Uncle Kevin!

202
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,503
Hey! There she is.
Happy Thanksgiving.

203
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,475
Thank you

204
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,645
so much, yes. I'll see you soon.

205
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,379
Great news.

206
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,790
The new owners of our old house
found the box

207
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,116
- of holiday stuff in the attic.
- Randall...

208
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,918
- Yes.
- You are really not gonna drive

209
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,553
all that way just to get a box

210
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,155
of our old Thanksgiving
tradition stuff?

211
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,957
I'll go get my coat.

212
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,625
That's my girl!

213
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,836
All right, well,
hurry your ass up,

214
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,470
because Shauna's
gonna be here at 2:00 and

215
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,472
I don't want to be here alone
if she shows up in a bad way.

216
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,432
- Understood.
- Uh, think I could ride along?

217
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,568
You... They're going to Jersey.

218
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,271
I don't mind. Gives me time
to get to know Russell.

219
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,973
- It's Randall.
- See?

220
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,641
Uh...

221
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:11,511
It's fine, Kev.
Annie, you're driving.

222
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,352
Where's my mom?

223
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,210
William?

224
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,283
Hey.

225
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,895
You know, I've been here for,
like, ten minutes.

226
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,996
You didn't come down and say hi?

227
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,389
Hey, Uncle Kev.

228
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,625
That is not my niece's
beautiful smile.

229
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,393
What's wrong? Tell me.

230
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,362
Testify! Get it?

231
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,664
Tess-tify.

232
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,666
I don't really want
to talk about it.

233
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,235
Oh, come on.

234
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,046
Besides, I need something
to get my mind off of

235
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,638
worrying about my uncle so much.

236
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,073
Fine.

237
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,342
There's this stupid meme
going around school

238
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,711
that everybody's posting
on Instagram.

239
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:22,549
"Post a pic of your number one
celebrity crush." Oh.

240
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,218
So what's going on?

241
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,821
I haven't come out
at school yet.

242
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,691
So I could post nothing
and be left out.

243
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,027
Or I can post the truth.

244
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,929
I have a crush on Zendaya.

245
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,899
Yeah?

246
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,100
That's my choice, too.

247
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,403
But your life won't
completely explode

248
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,538
if you say it.

249
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,410
Hey, let's get out of here.
Let's get a bite.

250
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,055
- There's so much food here.
- Yeah, but I need air.

251
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,413
You know? I need air.

252
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,648
- Let's go get some air. Come on.
- Okay.

253
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,587
All right, we're off to get
a pre-turkey snack.

254
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,092
And then there was Beth.

255
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:10,130
Uh, what am I, chopped liver?

256
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,033
Aw, Migs...

257
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,902
You know I love you.

258
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,275
Shauna, hi.

259
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,377
I know I'm crazy early...

260
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,546
Oh, that's no problem.
Come on in.

261
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,781
How you doing?

262
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:31,051
Good, Beth. Really, really good.

263
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,787
Good. Deja told me
you got a new job.

264
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,555
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

265
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,625
I'm working the front desk
at Delaware General Hospital.

266
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,728
The hours are long but
the benefits are really good.

267
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,764
Wow. That's fantastic.

268
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,400
This is a pineapple
upside down cake.

269
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,102
It's Deja's favorite, so...

270
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,413
Oh, she's gonna love that.

271
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,439
You're early.

272
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,644
Tater Tot. Oh! Mm...

273
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,247
My God, you are so grown.

274
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,516
And you're so beautiful.

275
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,453
You look better than ever, baby.

276
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,488
You, too, Mom.

277
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,424
Um, you want to help me
make cookies?

278
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,693
Lead the way.

279
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,270
William?

280
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,906
Excuse me, William, it's...

281
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,709
Can I help you with something?

282
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,380
I'm sorry, I thought...

283
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,815
I thought you were someone else.

284
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,051
Oh, well,

285
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,087
sorry to disappoint.

286
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,791
Uh, are you all right?

287
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,162
I'm... I am, I'm just
not from around here.

288
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:58,305
Actually, um, could you tell me
if there's a bakery nearby,

289
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,874
because I need to
pick something up.

290
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,010
- Hmm, a bakery?
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:06,213
Well, there is a nice grocery
store around the corner.

292
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,916
Fresh-made whipped cream cakes.

293
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,984
Yes. Yes.

294
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,652
That's what I'm looking for.
Perfect.

295
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,122
Thank you very much.

296
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,582
Thank you to Dad
for loving the Cowboys,

297
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,275
and thank you to me
for hating Dad.

298
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,619
Could you just... Could you
put it away, all right?

299
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,946
- Look, people are gonna start watching.
- Let them watch.

300
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,223
It's probably more dough
than they've seen

301
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,548
in their entire life.

302
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,551
Well, it's more money than we've
seen in our entire life.

303
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,286
Here's to that. Whoa, hey.

304
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,554
Oh, here we go.

305
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,888
Here we go.

306
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,799
You realize this is
five pounds of shrimp?

307
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,027
- Oh, we realize. Mm-hmm.
- Good luck.

308
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,862
Don't need luck.

309
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,132
This is a Thanksgiving
dinner, huh?

310
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,935
Cheers.

311
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,810
Good job.

312
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,412
Hey, Deja, check this out.

313
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,381
Whiskey Business.

314
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,216
- You get it?
- What?

315
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,550
Come on.

316
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,155
You don't know that?
You're too young.

317
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,291
Oh, Deja, come here, come here.

318
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,927
Look what just popped up
on my Facebook timeline.

319
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,963
Nine years ago today.

320
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:33,100
- My first Cupid Shuffle.
- Oh, look at your little feet go.

321
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,802
I remember that night.
Mrs. Henderson was so pissed.

322
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,971
Hey, Beth. You okay?

323
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,011
All right.

324
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,246
Here's the thing about AA, okay?

325
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,681
A big part of it is
sort of taking things

326
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,650
one day at a time, okay?

327
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,586
One step at a time,
one person at a time.

328
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,654
Okay.

329
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,189
Okay, so it got me thinking

330
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,625
instead of coming out
to everyone all at once, right,

331
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,693
well, what if you just
come out to one person?

332
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,429
Just a complete stranger.

333
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,007
Someone you don't even have
to look in the eye. Right?

334
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,132
Just to see how it feels.

335
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,535
You want me to come out to...

336
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,504
The drive-through speaker. Yeah.

337
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,506
Yeah. No pressure, though.
Okay? No pressure.

338
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,008
Only if you want.

339
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,876
But, I mean, think about it.
All right?

340
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,221
What could be less scary
than coming out

341
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,080
to a-a plastic clown head?

342
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,815
Oh, here we go.

343
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,125
Welcome to Happy Burger.
What can I get you?

344
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,527
Tell you what, I'm gonna do
a number four

345
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,230
and a chocolate shake.

346
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,036
I'm Tess Pearson, and I'm gay.

347
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,174
Uh, cool.

348
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,143
You want fries or onion rings
with that number four?

349
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,711
Fries, please.

350
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,524
- Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
- It's so good to be here.

351
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:59,219
Oh, my gosh, guys,
he's so beautiful.

352
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,488
Must be all the avocado.

353
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,923
I'm on the Gram now.
BigMig45. You should follow me.

354
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,996
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, our boy loves avocado.

355
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,529
Hey, do you guys have room
for this in your fridge?

356
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,199
It's, uh, it's my tempeh.
I'm on a special diet.

357
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,067
- We travel with tempeh now.
- Oh. Yeah.

358
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,421
- I'll find some room in the fridge for it.
- Yeah, thanks.

359
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,840
Oh, my God, this apartment...
This is downsizing?

360
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,675
- Yeah.
- Come on.

361
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,577
Wait, where is everyone?

362
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,283
And every year, someone wears it

363
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,452
and pretends to be Pilgrim Rick.

364
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,054
Wait, you're Grandpa Jack's
brother, right?

365
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,556
Yes.

366
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,059
So why haven't we met before?

367
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,395
Because your grandfather
erased me.

368
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,209
Hey, Annie, why don't you
go ring the doorbell?

369
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,202
We'll be right there. Nicky...

370
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,370
are you okay?

371
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,571
Yeah. I'm sorry.

372
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,939
I...

373
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,444
I thought I could handle this,
but it's too much.

374
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:01,781
I mean, his own granddaughter
has never even heard of me.

375
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,459
I knew he'd never talked
about me that much,

376
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,884
but I don't know...

377
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,888
- Hello?
- Yeah.

378
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,989
You must be Randall.

379
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,591
- I am.
- Come on in.

380
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,925
Thank you.

381
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:17,130
Whoa. Everything is different.

382
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,574
But I love what
you've done with the place.

383
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,500
Thank you.
It's such a beautiful house.

384
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,336
It really was... is.

385
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,238
It really is.

386
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,574
- Here's your holiday box.
- Thank you.

387
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,342
Grandpa Jack's hat!

388
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,979
- Now we're talking.
- Yes.

389
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,915
Oh, I also found these.
Uh, are these yours?

390
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,150
Um...

391
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:43,156
Yeah.

392
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,092
Sorry, my mom gave me these
as a housewarming gift

393
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
when we first moved in here.

394
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,130
Nobody loves music like my mom.

395
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,110
Excuse me. Hi.

396
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,845
Could you tell me where
the bakery is?

397
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,122
Yeah, it's just straight
down there

398
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,791
past the checkout aisles,
you can't miss it.

399
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,750
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

400
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,776
Ooh, so pretty.

401
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,044
That'll be $16.05.

402
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,880
Okay.

403
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,017
These...

404
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,786
bottomless purses,
I tell you what,

405
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,122
they're all the rage, but you
can never find anything in them.

406
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,092
Sorry. Okay.

407
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,065
I haven't eaten anything today.

408
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,368
I think that's why
my brain's a little fuzzy.

409
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,070
Good Chinese place
down the street.

410
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,807
Oh, that does sound good.

411
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,277
Okay. Thank you very much.

412
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,514
Thank you.

413
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,260
Wait, so there's
no dairy in this?

414
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,396
- 100% cashew, m'lady.
- Wow.

415
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,298
This is some
damn good nut cheese.

416
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,975
- Right? That's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, best I've ever had.

417
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,001
That whole tray is nut-based.

418
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,771
- What?
- Look, you get in the box with me for one week,

419
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,240
come meet my trainer KJ,
we'll get you on a meal plan,

420
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,276
you'll lose five pounds...
Bang... like that.

421
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,478
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

422
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:22,615
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,085
Not a bunch of weight, just...

424
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,455
Are you okay?

425
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,790
Yeah.

426
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,994
I'm ashamed. It's evil.
I'm evil, you know.

427
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,929
I can't even say it out loud.

428
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,798
OKAY, WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS:

429
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,568
you tell me your evil feeling
and I'll tell you mine.

430
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,176
I hate that Shauna's
doing so well.

431
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,145
Okay, that is bad.

432
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,547
I know, I know.

433
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,283
I was praying for her
last night.

434
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,285
Like, praying on my knees

435
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,054
that she would show up here
today in a good place,

436
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:06,225
but then... I see them
together watching

437
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,696
home videos, or busting out
inside jokes, and I don't know.

438
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:13,065
It's just simpler for Randall.

439
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,134
He's the only father
she's ever known,

440
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,805
but she already has a mom,

441
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,740
you know?

442
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,109
Where does that leave me?

443
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:31,618
Okay, I said my terrible thing,
you say yours.

444
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,389
I hate CrossFit Toby.

445
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,226
I do, I do.

446
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,862
I hate his food charts,
his "fat blocks,"

447
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,697
his CrossFit acronyms.

448
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,599
- What?
- Yeah.

449
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:49,101
You know, the first thing
I said to him when we met

450
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,003
was that I couldn't fall
for a fat person

451
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,415
'cause I was determined
to lose the weight,

452
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,040
I don't want anyone
to get in my way,

453
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,242
- and we-we broke up over it.
- Yeah.

454
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,445
And then we committed
to losing the weight together,

455
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,913
but we didn't.

456
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,452
And then we had a baby,

457
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,688
a baby with special needs,

458
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,791
and I have never been
more stressed, more tired,

459
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:15,294
more overwhelmed
in my entire life.

460
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,564
And then he goes
and loses the weight,

461
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:21,434
which is amazing,
but all I can think is he did it

462
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:24,236
without me.

463
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,406
You sh... you should tell him
how you feel.

464
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,042
N... I wouldn't even
know how to.

465
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,378
Honey, just figure it out

466
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,246
'cause if you're only going
to other people

467
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,116
about what's happening
in your marriage, it's...

468
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,919
it can be dangerous territory.

469
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,526
Why don't you pick one of those
and pop it in, Uncle Nicky?

470
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,171
Leonard Cohen?

471
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:03,275
Oh, man, my dad
used to love this song.

472
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,678
"So Long Marianne."

473
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,947
Loved listening to it.

474
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,517
Loved explaining it to us
even more.

475
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,519
Over and over...

476
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,630
This next song
was requested via mail from one of

477
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,155
our brave troops in Vietnam.

478
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,467
Hoping you're having some kind
of Thanksgiving there, boys.

479
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,459
Your loved ones
sure are missing you here.

480
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,697
No, no, no, no. Leave it.

481
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:27,033
It's Leonard Cohen. He's a poet.

482
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,768
Nicky, if I wanted a poem,
I'd read a book.

483
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,870
No, you wouldn't.

484
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,172
Just listen.

485
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,941
He's singing about

486
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,611
the love of his life
moving on from him,

487
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,313
but there's no bitterness
in him.

488
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,884
He's just grateful
to have loved her.

489
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,356
He was lost before he met her

490
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,859
and then she became his home.

491
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,894
And in the chorus, listen,
he's saying goodbye,

492
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,296
but he can't quite let go.

493
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,580
He's sending her away
and calling her back

494
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,982
in the same breath.

495
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,988
I just hope that
she came back to him

496
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,823
and that they laughed again.

497
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:56,055
I hope she went back to him
and they laughed together again.

498
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,590
Something my dad
would always say

499
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,626
whenever he listened
to this song.

500
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,630
Uh, nope, he called it a poem.

501
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:07,734
He'd give us all kind of hell
if we called it a song.

502
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:22,414
Can we, uh, make a quick stop

503
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,617
on the way home?

504
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,986
Sure.

505
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,229
- Everything good?
- It was delicious.

506
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,266
Thank you very much.

507
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,109
I just had it.

508
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,316
Come on.

509
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,352
Um, ma'am? Hi. Sorry.

510
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,254
Um, I need to call my son,

511
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,256
and I can't find my phone.

512
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,358
Um, uh, do you,
do you have a phone

513
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,694
that I can use?

514
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,595
A telephone?

515
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,964
- To call... Yeah.
- Oh.

516
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,465
Uh, great.

517
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,503
God.

518
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,006
I don't know his number.

519
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,141
I can't...
His number is in my phone,

520
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,010
and I need my phone to call him.

521
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,879
I need to call my son.

522
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:29,481
You're not helping me right now.

523
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,183
I need to call my...

524
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,371
You found it.

525
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,563
- There it is.
- Hey, Tobe.

526
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,032
- Yeah?
- Talk to you for a minute?

527
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,700
Yeah, of course.
Just give me one sec.

528
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:52,471
These are sweet potatoes.

529
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,673
They are orange.

530
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:58,410
They're like the regular
potato's sassy aunt.

531
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,851
What's up?

532
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,621
Happy Thanksgiving.

533
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,692
Happy Thanksgiving.

534
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,594
All right.

535
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,341
Oh, come on,
that was pass interference.

536
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,601
Hey, you like football now?

537
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,703
Oh, Dej,
I'm a die-hard Eagles fan.

538
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,706
- I bleed green and white.
- Since when?

539
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,608
Well, some friends
from work get together

540
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,510
every Sunday
and watch the games.

541
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,279
We all bring different dishes,
do a potluck.

542
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,381
I've gotten really into it.

543
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,221
Sounds like fun.

544
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,223
Um, excuse me a second.

545
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,360
After you.

546
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,262
Hey. Shauna.

547
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,698
You're early.
It's good to see you.

548
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,466
You look great.

549
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,603
Uh, Nicky, this is Shauna.
She's our, uh,

550
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:01,307
- adopted daughter's biological mother.
- Okay.

551
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,576
- Yeah.
- Um, I need a platter.

552
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,478
Oh, it's in the pantry.
Right here.

553
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,823
- Oh, got it.
- I'll be right with you, Shauna.

554
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,616
I can't wait to catch up.

555
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,218
Is my mom here?

556
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,586
- Not yet, baby.
- Huh.

557
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,823
- How's Shauna?
- She's good.

558
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,657
She has a job and an apartment,

559
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,827
and, um, made
an upside down cake.

560
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,061
That's a good thing?

561
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,496
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I'll be right back, okay?

562
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,134
Okay. Hey, guys. One sec.

563
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,745
You're reached
Rebecca Pearson. Please leave a message.

564
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,405
Hey, Mom. Uh, you haven't
returned any of my texts

565
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,074
and now your phone's off.

566
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,577
Trying not to worry, but, um,
it's almost time to eat,

567
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,748
so hope you're close.
Please come home.

568
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,451
Bye. What's up, sis?

569
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,854
- Hi.
- How're you doing?

570
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,789
Hey.

571
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:54,260
We're gonna sit down to dinner
as soon as Rebecca gets back.

572
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,561
Cool.

573
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,765
Your mom seems like
she's doing pretty great.

574
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,437
She is. She-she loves
her new job,

575
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,875
and she has a whole bunch
of friends.

576
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:13,445
She has a new apartment
and it sounds real nice, too,

577
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,715
um, even has a fireplace.

578
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,153
When I was growing up,

579
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:25,124
we'd always say one day
that we'd have a fireplace.

580
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:29,395
Now... she finally has one.

581
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,736
Why couldn't she
be like this for me?

582
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,639
Oh, honey.

583
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,215
Hey,

584
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:53,319
tell me the story
about that video.

585
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,154
What?

586
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,089
With you and your mom
and the dancing.

587
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,359
- Oh.
- Tell me about that day.

588
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,761
Um...

589
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,696
Yeah, I got it.

590
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,067
Our downstairs neighbor,
Mrs. Henderson,

591
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,737
um, she was as mean
as they come,

592
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,941
and... on that morning,

593
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:18,410
she was out front and
she asked me what we were doing

594
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:19,845
for Thanksgiving and I told her

595
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,714
we were bringing in takeout.

596
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,883
And then she said something

597
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:29,221
about how my mama
wasn't raising me right

598
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,723
and how maybe
if she knew how to cook,

599
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,692
she'd be able
to keep a man around.

600
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,095
- Ugh, Mrs. Henderson.
- Right?

601
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:41,067
And my mom knew Mrs. Henderson
hated when we made noise,

602
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,570
so there was no better revenge
in her mind

603
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,706
than teaching me
the Cupid Shuffle.

604
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,277
I mean, music cranked
all the way up,

605
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,412
feet stomping as loud
as we could stomp.

606
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,382
- Genius.
- It was... it was perfect.

607
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,819
Hey.

608
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:05,091
You may not have gotten
the fireplace, but...

609
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,126
don't let yourself
forget all the times

610
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,596
you had with her
when she was absolutely perfect.

611
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,534
Yeah.

612
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,322
Thank you for the
ride, Officers, but this is all

613
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,015
really unnecessary.

614
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:32,584
You're a long way
from Los Angeles.

615
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:37,123
Yeah. I'm out here
visiting family.

616
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:40,026
We always get together
for special occasions.

617
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,645
- Hey, hey.
- So...

618
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,356
Tell me, how did... you know,
how'd it go with Uncle Nicky?

619
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,648
Dude, it went great.

620
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,559
- Really?
- He's in the kitchen fixing something

621
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,787
to add to our dinner. Been very
secretive about it. It's cute.

622
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,057
- He is cute.
- Yeah.

623
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,125
- And still no Mom?
- No.

624
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,994
Why would she go off by herself
on Thanksgiving?

625
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,297
She must've really wanted to see
that new De Niro movie.

626
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,367
- Do you know who Steve Guttenberg is?
- Yeah.

627
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,840
He is one of my
top three favorite...

628
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,339
What about Michael Winslow?

629
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,209
- Excuse me.
- A sound effects genius.

630
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,744
Excuse me. Uh...

631
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,849
Well, I've learned that, uh...

632
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:40,052
traditions inspired
by Jack Pearson

633
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42,088
are sort of the backbone
of this shindig.

634
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,556
So...

635
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,193
So, uh... here goes.

636
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,161
Uh...

637
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,530
Thanksgivings growing up

638
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,266
weren't... you know, jolly

639
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,435
like this.

640
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:00,606
But... we made do.

641
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,845
So how bent you think
the old man's gonna be?

642
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,115
I think this one's
gonna be a doozy.

643
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,191
It was actually
the best Thanksgiving ever.

644
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:23,395
Okay, so then,
we'll do it again next year.

645
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,865
And the year after that.

646
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,068
And then again,
the year after that.

647
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,942
And we would've
kept that promise.

648
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,278
And we would've kept
that tradition.

649
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,281
But life, you know?

650
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,117
Got in the way.

651
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,289
So...

652
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:54,960
Here is five pounds
of Thanksgiving shrimp.

653
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,631
Yeah.

654
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,369
It's for Jack.

655
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:09,007
My brother. And, uh...

656
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:14,713
Yeah, to new...
family traditions, so...

657
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,784
- Enjoy.
- Hear, hear.

658
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,857
Jack, five-minute warning.
Everyone'll be here soon.

659
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,294
- Those hot dogs smell amazing.
- I know.

660
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,197
Our baby and I
need to eat them stat.

661
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,999
Have some shrimp.
There's five pounds.

662
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,150
It was really beautiful,
Uncle Nicky.

663
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,820
Eh... Hey, kid.

664
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,057
I think it's time for you
to get back to L.A.

665
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,359
Live your own life.

666
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:03,061
I'm gonna be just fine, Kevin.

667
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,565
And if I need you,
I'll call you.

668
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:09,235
If you need me, you call me.

669
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,574
- Okay.
- Good.

670
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,075
Okay. Yeah.

671
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:32,224
Feel like you disappeared on me.

672
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,325
- Look at this Pilgrim Rick.
- Pilgrim Rick.

673
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,419
I know, I know, I know.

674
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,521
Kate, will you grab my phone
real quick before he melts down?

675
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,747
- I got it.
- This is a special moment, Jack.

676
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,917
- Oh...
- There we...

677
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,428
That's what
you call full circle.

678
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,297
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

679
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,955
Hey, Kate?

680
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,561
Can you say shrimp? Can you say
five pounds of shrimp?

681
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:13,098
- Kate? Photo? Huh? Yeah?
- Yeah.

682
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,076
- We don't want to miss this; he's gonna melt down.
- Yeah. Yeah.

683
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,568
Okay. Okay.

684
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,036
Okay, ready?

685
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,105
- Say "shrimp."
- Got it.

686
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,373
Kevin!

687
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:24,376
Yo. What do we got?

688
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,811
How we doing?

689
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,479
The comments.

690
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,824
- That's what's up! See, this is great.
- I know.

691
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,917
Look at this.
These are great... oh.

692
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,552
- I sense joy here.
- Yes.

693
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,621
- I could use some. What's happening?
- Well...

694
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:36,931
Yeah, you can tell him.

695
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:40,258
Your daughter
came out on Instagram today.

696
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,860
- What?
- Yeah.

697
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,063
Wow, Tess.

698
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,599
- This is huge.
- Yeah. -Thanks. My phone is,

699
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,411
like, blowing up.
I've got to go deal with this.

700
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,236
- Yes.
- Yeah, of course, no.

701
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,971
My goodness.

702
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,140
- Well, look at you, Ray Donovan.
- Yeah.

703
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,413
- Just fixing everybody.
- Well, I don't know about that.

704
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,646
Brother. What's next for you?

705
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,682
Uh, next is, um...

706
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,187
I don't know, man.

707
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,790
You know, I-I spent two months
in that small town.

708
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:15,093
You know, spent every day
with-with two virtual strangers,

709
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,496
and, uh... I got to tell you,

710
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,106
I haven't had that feeling
since I was a kid.

711
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,032
You know? Just...

712
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:24,536
a feeling of, um...

713
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,339
just being responsible
for other people. You know?

714
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:30,609
Sense of a family. So...

715
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,779
I liked it. You know?

716
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,948
I liked it, so I think, um...

717
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,717
I think that's what's next
for me.

718
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,219
Yeah. For sure.

719
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,621
Absolutely. By the time I'm 40,

720
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,366
I'm gonna have a wife,
I'm gonna have a kid,

721
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,225
- the whole shebang.
- You should probably date somebody first.

722
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,695
You know, it's only nine months
till our birthday.

723
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,030
Why you always got to be a buzzkill? Huh?

724
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,533
By the way, where is Mom?
I'm starving.

725
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,067
Are you starving? I'm starving.

726
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:57,369
Uh...

727
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,013
All right, ma'am, you're home.

728
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,448
Everything's gonna be okay.

729
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,875
- Mom. Come on in. Hi.
- Hi.

730
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,244
Thank you very much
for bringing her home.

731
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,179
Thank God.
Mom, we've been, you know,

732
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,683
- calling nonstop.
- I'm sorry, I-I went out

733
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,285
to try and get you
a birthday cake to surprise you,

734
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,120
and then I got all...
turned around.

735
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:52,924
- I hope I didn't ruin your whole party.
- No.

736
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,994
- Happy 40th, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom. Thank you.

737
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:01,567
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, Mom.

738
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,503
- Here, I got you this.
- Thank you.

739
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:08,774
You came back.

740
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,375
I was getting worried.

741
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,910
Of course I came back.

742
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,045
That movie was
three and a half hours long,

743
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,214
and then the line at the store
was huge.

744
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,216
I left you a bunch of messages.

745
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,319
Oh. I turned off my cell phone
for the movie.

746
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,321
I must've forgotten
to turn it back on.

747
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,457
I'm sorry.

748
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:28,560
Hi, everyone.

749
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,608
All right, thanks.

750
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,109
Oh, how's she doing back there?

751
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,111
Uh, she's laying down.
She's a little nauseous.

752
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,013
My fiancée's

753
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:51,950
got morning sickness
at all hours of the day, so...

754
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,418
Oh, try ginger tea.

755
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,953
- That always worked for me.
- Yeah?

756
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,422
- Yeah.
- Ginger tea. Good tip. Thank you.

757
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,258
And, um, thank you very much
for bringing my mom home.

758
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,494
Yes, thank you.

759
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,163
Good luck with that.

760
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,098
Thank you.

761
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,636
Kevin, is Randall here yet?

762
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,005
No, Mom. Randall's not coming.

763
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,241
We're not speaking, remember?

764
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:23,181
Mmm, looks delicious.

765
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,016
Hey.

766
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,786
- And I'll just take that off your hands.
- Don't... Now...

767
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,188
Stop. Hey.

768
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,990
- Hmm?
- Um...

769
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,526
I'm really sorry, Mom.

770
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,894
About last night.

771
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,329
I was probably overreacting
and...

772
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,365
you know.

773
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:48,406
I was halfway through
the trailer of Cats...

774
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:52,410
when I couldn't remember
what movie I went to go see.

775
00:41:57,783 --> 00:42:00,451
I think I need to see a doctor.

776
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,556
Okay.

777
