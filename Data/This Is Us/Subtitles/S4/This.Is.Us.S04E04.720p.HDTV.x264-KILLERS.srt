1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,492
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:01,493 --> 00:00:02,884
I didn't need you to come.

3
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:04,476
I'm your brother's son.

4
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:06,168
And I have come here for you.

5
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:07,870
You want to go to jail?
Because that's what

6
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:09,885
your future holds if you don't
start taking this seriously.

7
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:11,444
How do I know you?

8
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,269
Oh, you were on a television show.

9
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,129
Jack can't see, but...

10
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,216
my son is gonna live
a life without limits.

11
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,218
Okay, look, Randall,
you're a very nice guy,

12
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,420
but please don't call me again.

13
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,622
I'm gonna marry her.

14
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:27,927
Huh. Check out these babies.

15
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,130
Goodbye, stakes. Hello, flying fatality.

16
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,399
- What can I shoot?
- Oh, nothing.

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,801
Are you sure you don't
want to go with me

18
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,427
to visit Randall at college?

19
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:38,819
... the basic tools of combat...

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,211
Mom, it's Parents' Weekend,

21
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:42,741
not Parent and Loser Sister Weekend.

22
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,510
Well, what are you gonna do today?

23
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,245
I don't know.

24
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,614
Maybe sit around and
listen to our one CD.

25
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,152
You know what?

26
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,553
I have an idea.

27
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,955
Why don't you...

28
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,525
... go to the record store in the mall

29
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,893
and buy some new albums?

30
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,030
- Hey, Kate?
- Hmm?

31
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,900
Promise me you're not just
gonna sit around all day, okay?

32
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,335
Please?

33
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,170
Okay.

34
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,612
That was a good walk, wasn't it, Jack?

35
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,613
Are you excited for
your music class today?

36
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,882
- Huh?
- So with everything

37
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,717
that kid's been through,
his first big outing,

38
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,085
and you're taking him to the Valley?

39
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,328
Yeah. Miss Mindy's Music Makers

40
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,289
is the best baby music class in L.A.

41
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,857
I mean, there's a wait list.

42
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,117
How about I give the
kid a pot and a pan to bang on,

43
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:36,462
and you pay me 40 bucks
an hour instead, huh? Yeah?

44
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,696
- Huh?
- Hey, Gregory.

45
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,965
- Hey, man.
- Hey, listen.

46
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,834
You know, he's so tiny here.

47
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,370
You sure it's not too early to
be taking him to music class?

48
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,771
Yes, it is.

49
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,506
Sorry. I'm slow.

50
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,575
- Thanks.
- The website said

51
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,377
for newborns and up. Plus, you know,

52
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,878
music is good for his development.

53
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,613
- That's what everybody says.
- Okay, but...

54
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,315
- I-I was just, you know...
- Tobe,

55
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,718
this is something that Jack
can do like every other kid.

56
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,622
He's gonna be tapping on
the drum, hitting the cymbal.

57
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,723
It's gonna be like a
little baby symphony.

58
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,994
Okay, then. We shall
go, and he shall jam.

59
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,719
All right. Come on, buddy.

60
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,831
Do we have everything?
Just want to get there early

61
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,365
so he's comfortable with the space.

62
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:17,002
Yeah, I've got extra diapers and wipes,

63
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,738
both pacifiers, two changes of clothes,

64
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,074
a UV blanket, a stylish
hat, a practical hat,

65
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,876
a cooler full of backup milk.

66
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,345
- How did the cavemen do this?
- Oh, did you get Monkey?

67
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,615
Monkey! Yeah. No, I didn't.

68
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,116
We never go anywhere without Monkey.

69
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,518
I'll be right back.

70
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,019
Monkey?!

71
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,766
Hey, you about ready?

72
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,534
Ready for this AA meeting, huh?

73
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,377
Ready to go? It starts in 15 minutes.

74
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,138
Rather not get kicked out
of this group, too. You know,

75
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,296
they got almond milk over
there, which I'm excited about.

76
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:56,542
Not easy to come by out here.

77
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,745
Not ready. Haven't had coffee yet.

78
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,547
Your roof's leaking again, huh?

79
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,449
Yeah.

80
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,942
Man, you sure you don't want

81
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:06,642
to just come stay with me at the hotel?

82
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,020
Very.

83
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,989
Well, I'll tell you
what. Why don't you...

84
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,891
why don't you at least let
me buy you a new trailer?

85
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,826
All right? Brand-new trailer.
I got all this Hollywood

86
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,545
douchebag money to throw around.

87
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:16,819
I could put it toward a good cause.

88
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,631
I'm not a cause. And no.

89
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,100
Right.

90
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,506
Oh, my God.

91
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,842
Oh, my God. Uh...

92
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:33,730
"Gee, Kevin, what is it?

93
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,422
I'd like to know, too. I'm concerned.

94
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,048
Can I help you in any way?"

95
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,720
They canceled The Manny.

96
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,023
That show was still on?

97
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,891
Yeah, it's still on.
They-they replaced me

98
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,593
with Morris Chestnut after I left.

99
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,663
I can't believe it's finally over.

100
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:54,233
I... shot that pilot, like, uh...

101
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,877
eight years ago.

102
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,005
Kev, this is really happening.

103
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,040
Yeah.

104
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,842
You are the star of a
huge network TV show.

105
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,778
It's just a pilot, you know?

106
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,680
Who knows if it'll actually be on TV.

107
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,283
What's going on? Are you freaking out?

108
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,752
Uh, maybe, you know,
a little bit, you know?

109
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,462
- It just, it just sort of feels like...
- Mr. Pearson?

110
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,957
- Yes. Okay.
- They're ready for you.

111
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,558
They're ready for me.

112
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,527
Mr. Pearson.

113
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,665
I never saw the show.

114
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,867
Saw a commercial once, though.

115
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,803
You were drinking out
of a baby's bottle,

116
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,638
and you weren't wearing a shirt.

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,640
Come on, Hollywood douchebag.

118
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,213
I know I'm forgetting something.

119
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,816
- Check your list.
- Okay.

120
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,251
What if I forgot to put
something on the list?

121
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,953
What if nobody shows up?

122
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,191
- Okay, what if when we get there...
- Wife of mine,

123
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,791
- apple of my eye...
- Get to the meat, baby.

124
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,293
- Get to the...
- You have been prepping

125
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,728
for the opening of your dance studio...

126
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,830
your very own dance studio,

127
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,099
what? For three months.

128
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,900
There's gonna be delicious food.

129
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,736
- There's gonna be dancing.
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,638
You are Footloose in Philadelphia.

131
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,006
Mwah.

132
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,841
Okay, well done.

133
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,043
- My meat is always well done.
- Don't ruin it.

134
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,045
Might your, um, stress level have to do

135
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,481
with a certain regal,

136
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,584
yet intimidating individual
who will be in attendance?

137
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,419
I am happy my mom is coming.

138
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,454
I really am.

139
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,257
But you know she always
thought this was a crazy idea.

140
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,227
- Yeah.
- And she's just so judgy.

141
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,195
Oh, she is Supreme Court-level judgy.

142
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:33,020
Look, you just focus on your opening.

143
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:34,199
I'll take care of your mom.

144
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,701
I'll be your firewall.

145
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,704
You handle my mom?

146
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,773
- I will.
- Okay.

147
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,342
Yeah, historically, she's
been a scootch tough on me.

148
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,911
Hasn't necessarily been
my biggest fan since, uh...

149
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,981
well, since we met, but
does any of that phase me?

150
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,617
Not today, Carol. Not today.

151
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,153
Um, can I go to the movies tonight

152
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,188
after the opening with some friends?

153
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,690
What friends?

154
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,892
New friends.

155
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,628
Might one of these new friends
happen to be a gentleman friend

156
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,297
that your mom saw you all... mmm?

157
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,667
Okay. Malik is a friend, and he's a boy,

158
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,970
and he invited me,
but it's a group thing.

159
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,439
- Okay.
- We need to meet him first.

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,973
We have to meet him first.

162
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,105
Your sister

163
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:31,823
has me worried because she
barely leaves the house.

164
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,818
Kevin likes New York. He
just hasn't figured out

165
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,110
the whole subway system yet.

166
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,669
And I...

167
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,072
need to think about getting a job, too.

168
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,705
I'm thinking about
becoming an astronaut.

169
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,240
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

170
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:53,936
Hi, Mama C!

171
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,113
- Hi, Mama C!
- Hi.

172
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,191
- Mm. Mm.
- Hi, Mama C.

173
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:58,216
Hi.

174
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,953
Mama C.

175
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:02,086
Hello, Randall.

176
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,755
That's a nice shirt.

177
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,189
Thank you.

- Big day.

181
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,373
- Yeah, this is it.
- Oh, very nice.

182
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:16,442
Well, looks like you'll have
more than enough parking.

183
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,773
Hold on. Hey.

184
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,908
- Your hip.
- My hip what?

185
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,443
Uh, I got it, ma'am.

186
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,645
Thank you, Deja.

00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,994
Beth's been working really hard,

190
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:41,197
and, uh, I think we have to remember

191
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:42,965
how much pressure she's under, you know,

192
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:46,301
and to take great care not
to... exacerbate said pressure.

193
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,061
You're trying to tell me
how to speak to my daughter?

194
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,206
No, ma'am. No. I-I... Mm, mm, mm.

195
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:52,875
All right, so here we are.

196
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,964
It's not huge, but, uh,

197
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,257
you know, we've been
working really hard, and...

198
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:59,192
Okay.

199
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,029
- What?
- Oh, my God, that smell.

200
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,578
What is that?

201
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,912
I can't breathe.

202
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:12,601
I'm, like, tasting it.

203
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:18,441
But the website said that the
AA meeting was at 10:00 a.m.

204
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:21,657
I know. We haven't
updated that website since,

205
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,965
- gosh, at least last winter.
- You can't do that. You can't

206
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:25,916
say that there's a meeting,
and then, there isn't a meeting.

207
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,460
- That's... deception.
- What's going on?

208
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:30,787
The meeting isn't till
3:00 p.m., and she's saying

209
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:33,247
that the website hasn't
been updated since...

210
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:34,672
What's happening to her face?

211
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,587
- I know you!
- Hi.

212
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,345
- You're the Manny.
- How you doing?

213
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:40,972
Kevin Pearson. It's
really good to meet you.

214
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:42,653
Oh, excuse me one second.

215
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:44,980
- Hey. Hey, you okay?
- I had breakfast

216
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:46,706
with my husband this morning,
and he says he thinks

217
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:49,008
we should proceed with the divorce.

218
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,829
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

219
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,432
I said nothing.

220
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,091
I put down my five bucks for my eggs,

221
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:58,368
and I left, so I need a meeting now.

222
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,182
We got, like, five hours
until the meeting starts.

223

224

00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:24,870
And now the pilot's no good.

354
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:26,196
It's probably not gonna get picked up,

355
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,554
which really doesn't
matter because the baby

356
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,813
will probably never stop crying anyway.

357
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,110
Okay, well, that I can't help you with,

358
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,668
'cause I'm so not a baby person.

359
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,293
That was terrible, Tobe.

360
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,756
Yeah, I guess we should've
e-mailed them ahead of time,

361
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,120
let them know about Jack.

362
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,728
Their website said
babies with all abilities.

363
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:48,788
But we also can't ignore the
fact that he's blind, all right?

364
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:51,115
There was too much stimulus
there. We overloaded him.

365
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,707
I mean, can you imagine
what it would be like

366
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,892
if a cymbal crashed in
your face out of nowhere?

367
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,478
Yeah. That's why I wanted
to get there early...

368
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,079
so he could adjust to the environment.

369
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,682
Instead, we're spending 20
minutes looking for Monkey.

370
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,609
Okay! I had Monkey, I went to get milk,

371
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,720
and I left Monkey in the refrigerator.

372
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,721
It happens.

373
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:07,947
- To who?
- To me!

374
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,773
Why didn't you just pack Monkey first?

375
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,765
- He needs Monkey to function.
- No, no, no, no.

376
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:14,216
He would've... he would've been
just fine with Other Monkey.

377
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,764
No. No, he wouldn't.

378
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,288
He turned on Other Monkey.

379
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,756
That would've made it worse, but...

380
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,077
you don't know that because
you've been spending

381
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,170
all your time at the gym, so...

382
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,262
Nice.

383
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:26,522
Wow.

384
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,815
Okay. All right, don't go home.

385
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,608
When he's all worked up like this,

386
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:33,468
it's the only thing that
calms him, is to be in the car.

387
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:36,295
Okay. Well, where do
you want me to drive?

388
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,653
Till the road ends. Follow
the yellow brick road.

389
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,555
Toby, I don't care.

390
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:52,422
Randall, you've looked over
there about a hundred times.

391
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:53,823
I'm guessing that's Beth,

392
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:55,625
that girl you went on a date with.

393
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,026
What?

394
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:59,362
Uh...

395
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,663
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

396
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:05,644
Okay. All right.

397
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:06,836
We're doing this.

398
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:07,871
- No.
- Yeah.

399
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:10,640
- Mom, Mom, no, no, no, no.
- Come on, it's okay. Let's go. Follow me.

400
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:13,410
Hi.

401
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:14,444
Sorry. Excuse me.

402
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:15,945
I'm-I'm Rebecca Pearson.

403
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:18,348
This is my son, Randall.

404
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:21,208
Oh. Rebecca, Randall, I'm Carol Clarke,

405
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,210
- and this is my daughter, Bethany.
- Yeah,

406
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:26,076
I-I think Beth and Randall
already know each other.

407
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:27,390
Do you mind if we sit,

408
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,292
- join you for a minute?
- I actually have

409
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:30,660
to get to class. Five...

410
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:32,061
Please sit down.

411
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:34,631
Thank you.

412
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:40,670
So,

413
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:42,639
how do you two know each other?

414
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,607
- Uh, econ class.
- We went on a date.

415
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:45,875
Econ class.

416
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,012
And what's your major?

417
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:51,004
Uh, maybe econ.

418
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,029
Or poli-sci.

419
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,412
Or potentially math,

420
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:57,140
although multivariable calculus
is kicking my butt right now.

421
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,756
The z-axis is...

422
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:02,859
ooh... throwing me for a loop.

423
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,500
I should, uh, really get to class.

424
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,135
Yeah, me, too.

425
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:13,937
Yeah, we can walk together.

426
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,505
I have class in the same building.

427
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:17,874
Um, okay.

428
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,310
Uh, well, Mom,

429
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,011
maybe you can go for a walk in the park

430
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:25,081
or I could give you the keys to my dorm.

431
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:28,060
Or I could just sit here and
chat, if Rebecca wants to stay.

432
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,787
- Oh, that won't be necessary.
- Oh, that would be lovely.

433
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:32,322
Yeah.

434
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:34,557
Have a good class, guys.

435
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:41,798
I had to guess, it's a dead possum.

436
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,969
Could be a dead rat or
a family of dead rats.

437
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,329
A family?

438
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,339
Ronny, uh, I know it's a Saturday.

439
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,931
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

440
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:52,475
- You probably have other appointments...
- We have 30 minutes

441
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:53,967
before people start showing up,

442
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:56,312
and we can't have an opening
with this horrible smell.

443
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:58,448
Can you get rid of it?

444
00:17:58,449 --> 00:17:59,779
I'll try.

445
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,472
Be tricky if it's a dead family.

446
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:03,686
Please stop saying that.

447
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,388
You got the keys to the crawl space?

448
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:06,756
Come on. I'll show you.

449
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:07,826
I'll come with you.

450
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:09,158
Oh, actually, Carol...

451
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,862
I mean, Mama C, maybe you should...

452
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,565
- What's that smell?
- Uh, air freshener

453
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,066
and dead animal thing.

454
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:20,403
Look, uh, Randall,
he's-he's a really nice guy,

455
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:22,906
- but sometimes our jokes are...
- Hey, hey, hey.

456
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:24,641
It's all good.

457
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:27,110
Okay.

458
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,978
Mr. Pearson!

459
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,313
Hey.

460
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:33,166
Uh, Randall, this is Malik.

461
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,614
Malik, this is my dad, Randall.

462
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,220
- Randall, please don't do anything weird.
- The famous Malik!

463
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:38,755
My man.

464
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:41,024
How's, uh...

465
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:42,692
- Ni-Nice to meet you, sir.
- Yeah.

466
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,594
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to... nice to...

467
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:45,795
Got you.

468
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:47,897
So, uh...

469
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,600
what-what grade are you in, Malik?

470
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,602
Oh, I-I'm a junior. I'm a junior.

471
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:54,771
Um, but-but Deja's in my math class,

472
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,940
'cause she's, uh... 'cause
she's kind of a genius,

473
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,274
so...

474
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,776
Shut up.

475
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:03,012
- Yeah, we're in agreement on that one.
- Yeah.

476
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,581
You live nearby?

477
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:05,815
Not too far. Not too far.

478
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:08,518
My-my dad, he owns a
body shop over on 29th.

479
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,319
And, uh, Mom's a manager
down at the Marriott, so...

480
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,921
Ah, the Marriott!

481
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:13,361
- Yeah.
- I'm a rewards member.

482
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,540
- Yeah?
- Yes, sir.

483
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,031
Okay. Okay, yeah. I'm sure
my folks would love to meet you.

484
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,791
You know, after Deja
told me who you were,

485
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,284
I read up on you, and... I-I really love

486
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,976
the work you're doing
down at the rec center.

487
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:25,345
Really important stuff. Really.

488
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,677
All right, listen, man.

489
00:19:29,678 --> 00:19:32,146
I'm gonna level with you, Malik.

490
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:35,649
We're new to town and
Deja's making new friends,

491
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,952
including a boy who is
two grades older than her,

492
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:41,821
and it's all a bit overwhelming
for my wife and me.

493
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,026
But, um...

494
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:49,529
but it means a lot that
you came down to say hi.

495
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,332
And I like the firm handshake
and the way you looked me

496
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,501
in the eye and the fact that I feel

497
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:57,237
confident that I could
physically squash you like a bug

498
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,304
if I needed to.

499
00:19:58,305 --> 00:19:59,706
Do you feel me?

500
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:02,108
Yeah.

501
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:05,211
Yeah. No, no, no, man.
No, I get it. Really.

502
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,071
Man, when my daughter gets old enough,

503
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,171
I plan on installing a
tracking device on her.

504
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:10,606
So...

505
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:12,541
- Right. Right. Yeah.
- No, really. Like, my daughter,

506
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:15,110
she created this little
flirty smile the other day.

507
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,236
Gave it to the mailman.

508
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,495
Yo, I was freaking out.

509
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:19,827
Uh...

510
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:22,017
I'm sorry, when you say "my daughter",

511
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:25,154
what do you mean by those words?

512
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,259
I thought...

513
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,294
I just assumed she told you.

514
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:37,399
Mr. Pearson, I have a daughter.

515
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,943
Six months old.

516
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:41,202
Janelle. Janelle.

517
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:43,381
I have full custody, and
my-my parents help out

518
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:44,382
with her sometimes.

519
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,681
He thinks it's just one

520
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,783
dead possum, baby, not a dead family.

521
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,654
You know the dude's wasting your time.

522
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:02,489
He's just in there
calling everyone he knows

523
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,357
and saying that the
Manny is in his office.

524
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:06,626
It's all right.

525
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:08,061
My uncle's probably not gonna let me

526
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:10,297
buy him one of these things anyway.

527
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:11,364
But what about you?

528
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,829
I mean, I know you really needed

529
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,364
that meeting this morning, huh?

530
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:17,666
Tell you what, I feel like I
needed a meeting this morning

531
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,267
after finding out that
my show got canceled.

532
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:21,470
Don't try to relate to me.

533
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,372
Talking about a television
show... a television show

534
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:25,040
you're not even on
anymore getting canceled.

535
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,375
My marriage is getting canceled.

536
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,859
Can't imagine why, you're
so pleasant to be around.

537
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:41,256
No. Wait. You know what? No.

538
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:43,125
Here's the thing. Maybe
I didn't fight in a war

539
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:46,628
but I'm allowed to have a crappy day
just like everyone else, okay?

540
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:48,497
Something that was really
important to me ended.

541
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:50,432
And, yeah, I know it
was a little goofy, okay?

542
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,624
But it was a big part of my life,

543
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,416
and when big things end,
it's hard not to imagine

544
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:54,660
how they started, so, please,

545
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:56,820
if you could just ease
up for maybe two seconds.

546
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:59,671
Oh, my God, it is you.

547
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,311
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

548
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:05,104
My husband works here and
he texted me at the gym,

549
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:06,626
and I just... you know.

550
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,853
My God, can-can I have a hug?

551
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:11,453
Well, yes, of cour...
Oh, you're coming in. All right.

552
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:13,822
Hey.

553
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:16,002
There you go.

554
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,228
What's your name?

555
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:18,753
- Gina.
- Gina.

556
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,879
My husband and I, we just
loved you on that show.

557
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,005
- Thank you.
- You were wonderful.

558
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:24,552
Thank you.

559
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,301
Would it be okay to get a selfie?

560
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:27,725
Well, yes, of course. Yeah, no.

561
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,671
I was actually, I was just
gonna ask you if I could get one.

562
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:32,207
This is gonna work out great.

563
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,573
- There you go. Oh.
- Uh-oh.

564
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:35,334
- My hand's a little...
- You know what? Check this out.

565
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:37,145
Watch this. Here we go, Gina.

566
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,513
I got long arms, right?

567
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:40,039
And...

568
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,541
You tell me if you
think that looks good.

569
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,852
I think you look gorgeous in that.

570
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:45,587
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. You like it?

571
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:46,855
I love it.

572
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:48,323
Oh, thank you so much.

573
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,258
You're welcome.

574
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,894
- Oh...
- Ooh, watch your back there, Gina. All right.

575
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,496
- Thank you.
- Good to meet you, Gina.

576
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:56,164
Good to meet you.

577
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:01,203
You have a weird life.

578
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:04,111
Don't we all?

579
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:07,214
I've been a dick.

580
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,684
Yeah, well, you know, it's...

581
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:15,889
I-I haven't fought in a war, but
I have been through a divorce.

582
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,981
You know? And I'm not
trying to relate to you,

583
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,461
it's just...

584
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:23,397
it's a fact.

585
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:25,733
It really sucks.

586
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,506
We got engaged in Spain.

587
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:35,242
I'd just finished my first tour,

588
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:37,211
fixing helicopters overseas, and...

589
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:39,380
I knew-I knew he was gonna propose,

590
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,048
'cause he insisted on meeting me there

591
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,550
when my ship came into port at Rota.

592
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:46,053
And I saw his phone

593
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:49,195
when his bonehead buddy
Triconi texted him saying,

594
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:50,930
"Did you put that ring on it yet?"

595
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,322
And he knew. He saw that I saw it,

596
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:54,895
but we both pretended like I didn't.

597
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:59,299
So... I got a manicure.

598
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,503
And then for four days,
he just messed with me.

599
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:04,810
You know, he'd point out, like,
these old couples and be like,

600
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,264
"Oh, God. I want to
be like them someday.

601
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:08,866
They're so cute and in love."

602
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:13,837
And he'd get real serious
again and be like...

603
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,372
"Do you want to get a beer?"

604
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:17,769
He did this for four days.

605
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,929
He messed with me for four days.

606
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,088
- But eventually... Yeah.
- He did it.

607
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:24,681
You know, on a bridge
where his grandparents met,

608
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,750
yada yada. Nailed it.

609
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:33,019
I just can't picture you in a manicure.

610
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,021
I know, right?

611
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:36,555
Yeah.

612
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:38,057
Uh, it was the first and last.

613
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:44,230
So now we're just living
in this little rental condo

614
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:46,465
until I can figure out what to do.

615
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:50,636
My God. You lost your
husband and your home.

616
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:52,338
I cannot imagine.

617
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,174
And Randall was supposed
to go to Howard University,

618
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:59,845
but he decided to stay closer to home.

619
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,710
He's had a tough year.

620
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:03,049
We've all had a tough year.

621
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,250
Oh, I understand.

622
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:05,918
I lost my husband last year.

623
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,553
What?

624
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:10,990
I had no idea.

625
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:14,093
I was just blabbing on.

626
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:15,728
I am so sorry.

627
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:20,666
H-How is your family coping?

628
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:25,337
Well, they are a tough bunch.

629
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:28,441
Although, Bethany was Daddy's girl.

630
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:29,942
They were inseparable.

631
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:37,583
Are we supposed to take
off our wedding rings?

632
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:39,885
No, ma'am.

633
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,353
I'm not taking off mine.

634
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,482
Yeah, I'm not either. I don't want to.

635
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:46,225
No, no, no. Not unless Harry
Belafonte comes knocking.

636
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,298
How do you seem so together?

637
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:57,436
'Cause I just feel like
at a moment's notice

638
00:25:57,437 --> 00:26:00,673
I-I could completely break.

639
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:03,378
Well, I've got a job that I love.

640
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:04,443
Mm.

641
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:06,859
A classroom full of wonderful students

642
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,652
who are counting on
me showing up every day

643
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,087
to make them love books.

644
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:14,987
My husband loved books.

645
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:17,089
You know, we used to read in bed.

646
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,554
Although, usually, he
would only get a page in

647
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,127
before he was snoring.

648
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,195
And I would lie there for hours reading,

649
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:26,132
listening to him snore.

650
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:28,609
It was about a couple
of months ago I realized

651
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,605
that I haven't read a book
before bed since he passed

652
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:35,374
and I wondered how he would...

653
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:38,544
well, what he would think.

654
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:41,947
What he would think about me
if he knew I'd stopped reading.

655
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:45,751
So I picked up a book
and started a new chapter

656
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:48,220
in every sense of the phrase.

657
00:26:51,191 --> 00:26:52,958
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

658
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,261
Oh, hell no. She's 14.

659
00:26:55,262 --> 00:26:57,597
She is not seeing a boy
who puts babies in people.

660
00:26:57,598 --> 00:26:59,012
We are in lockstep.

661
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:02,001
Okay, so we have taped up
the dryer sheets to the vent

662
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:03,702
and that is helping with the smell.

663
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:06,068
S-Sort of... What's wrong?

664
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:07,661
It's nothing to be
concerned about, just...

665
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:09,605
- Deja likes a boy who has a baby.
- It's that.

666
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,754
But we're gonna put
an end to it tonight,

667
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,476
so don't worry about it now, okay?

668
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:16,178
Everything is gonna be just fine.

669
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:18,214
So there's no way to
get rid of the carcass

670
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:20,449
without opening up the entire wall.

671
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,118
You just gotta let it decompose.

672
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,487
The smell will fade away
in about a week or two.

673
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,689
- A week or two?
- Sorry.

674
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,224
They're actually wonderful animals.

675
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:31,060
They're kinda cute, too.

676
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:32,561
This is an unmitigated disaster.

677
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:34,330
Mm, no. We-we will figure it out.

678
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:35,698
Who the hell's gonna want to sign up

679
00:27:35,699 --> 00:27:37,566
for dance classes in a rat cemetery?

680
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,036
- It's a possum cemete... it's not the time.
- Oh, this some...

681
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:41,737
And I know what you're
probably thinking, Mom,

682
00:27:41,738 --> 00:27:43,560
that this is some stupid pipe dream

683
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,518
that I'm so not
equipped to handle, so...

684
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,877
What are you talking about?
This isn't anyone's fault.

685
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:51,313
- You just have to reschedule.
- Mm-mm. We're not rescheduling.

686
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:53,082
Randall.

687
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,617
You can't have people coming...

688
00:27:54,618 --> 00:27:57,053
Okay, this is what we're going to do.

689
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:59,021
You're going to tell
people you are very sorry.

690
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:01,023
You're going to ask them
to come next Saturday.

691
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:03,325
You will double down on promotions.

692
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:05,094
- It's a shame.
- Don't tell me what I can

693
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:06,929
and can't do, Carol.

694
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,998
This is important to my
wife and I'm gonna fix it.

695
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,733
So we're not rescheduling. Am I clear?

696
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,208
And I apologize for
speaking to you in that tone.

697
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:22,044
But the content... holds.

698
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:33,823
I am not loving this
B-minus in poli-sci, Bethany.

699
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:41,549
Was that awkward, having
lunch with his mom?

700
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,683
No.

701
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:44,552
She was lovely.

702
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,746
What's the story with him?

703
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:51,148
We went on a date.

704
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:52,917
But it's probably not gonna work out.

705
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:55,728
It's probably for the best.

706
00:28:57,094 --> 00:28:58,361
What does that mean?

707
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,529
He's nice.

708
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,798
Very nice.

709
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,500
And grieving; his whole family is.

710
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:06,970
There are only two ways to
deal with a loss like that.

711
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,372
You hold your head up
high and move forward,

712
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,641
like we have, or you fold inwards.

713
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:17,213
Randall and his family
are still very broken.

714
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,650
You don't need broken
right now, Bethany.

715
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:22,519
You need strength.

716
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,989
You deserve it.

717
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,224
You deserve someone who sees you.

718
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:37,837
Stop.

719
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:00,911
He's still out.

720
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:03,046
Yeah.

721
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,165
I'm sorry.

722
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:12,202
I just...

723
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:14,104
I just want him to be
able to do everything

724
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,905
that all the other kids do.

725
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:17,107
He can.

726
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,243
He will. He just...

727
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:22,112
he has to take it one sound at a time.

728
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:23,546
That's all.

729
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:25,682
One step at a time.

730
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:27,484
Baby steps.

731
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:37,660
Let's go to the beach.

732
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:48,271
Hey, everybody!

733
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:50,099
I just wanted to thank you

734
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,743
for your patience in dealing
with our little switcheroo.

735
00:30:53,744 --> 00:30:55,945
- Yay!
- Thank you.

736
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:58,214
I'm gonna do a short demo for you all.

737
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:00,417
And then I'm gonna invite you up

738
00:31:00,418 --> 00:31:03,286
and I'm gonna teach you, right?

739
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,655
All right. Hit it, baby.

740
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:14,164
Oh, it's very nice
putting this together.

741
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,232
Thank you.

742
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,934
And I'm sorry...

743
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:20,837
for the way I spoke to you.

744
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:24,340
You've always seemed to
have a problem with me.

745
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,276
You haven't liked me
since the day you met me.

746
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:30,246
Randall, I have always liked you.

747
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,882
True, I didn't want you
to go out with Bethany

748
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:36,219
because I didn't think
you were right for her.

749
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,054
And I was wrong.

750
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:39,989
When I met you...

751
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:44,594
... I didn't see the strong partner,

752
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:47,363
father and man you would become.

753
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,048
You know, Uncle Nicky, I am so sorry

754
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,083
for pushing that trailer on you.

755
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,319
I mean, I thought it
was pretty cool, but...

756
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,554
different strokes.

757
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,489
Your trailer has a certain...

758
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,662
... rustic charm to it.

759
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:22,165
It was originally for someone else.

760
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,300
The trailer.

761
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,469
Uh...

762
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,404
Sally.

763
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:35,111
We, uh, started dating
before I got drafted.

764
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,647
I was too chicken to ask her out,

765
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,115
so Jack did it for me.

766
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:46,623
We wrote letters during the war.

767
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:49,893
We were gonna drive across
country when I got back,

768
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:52,128
but after a while,

769
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:53,853
I-I just stopped writing.

770
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:56,146
And I, uh...

771
00:32:56,147 --> 00:33:00,069
I got back, I was in
Walter Reed, and, uh...

772
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,804
I lost Jack.

773
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:05,475
And I lost my family, and...

774
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,410
I was pretty broken.

775
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,048
But I decided

776
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:14,517
I was gonna go for it.

777
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:17,453
One shot at a life.

778
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,690
And so I got the, uh...

779
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:23,326
'68 Boles Aero.

780
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,928
Practically took up all my savings.

781
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,765
And I... and I hitched it to my car,

782
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:31,234
and I drove to Sally's house.

783
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:32,669
I didn't tell her I was coming.

784
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,103
I just drove.

785
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:38,775
But she wasn't home.

786
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:44,213
Then what happened?

787
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,613
That was it.

788
00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:48,073
I realized...

789
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,689
it wasn't meant to be.

790
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:57,060
I drove off.

791
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:58,428
You didn't wait?

792
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:00,530
I mean, maybe...

793
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:02,465
maybe she comes back in 20 minutes,

794
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:07,003
and-and, you know, you'd
have a whole nother life, man.

795
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,007
I just knew.

796
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,142
You know? It...

797
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,378
was one of those moments.

798
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,448
Almost ready to shoot the final scene.

799
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,083
Just waiting on the baby to calm down.

800
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:21,117
- Yeah.
- Again.

801
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:23,353
I'm so not having kids.

802
00:34:25,923 --> 00:34:29,058
You know, look, I mean, maybe, uh...

803
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:31,007
maybe it's good if
this pilot doesn't go.

804
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:32,542
You know, maybe I don't
even want it to go.

805
00:34:32,543 --> 00:34:34,010
Okay, don't spiral.

806
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:35,602
I'm not. Hey, listen,

807
00:34:35,603 --> 00:34:37,613
I-I've been in L.A. for
what, like, ten years now?

808
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:39,415
I'm not even sure if I like it.

809
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,551
Yeah, and-and you know
what? I don't even know

810
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,686
If I really like doing this.

811
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,087
This what?

812
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:46,889
Acting.

813
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,393
Kev, this is what you've always wanted.

814
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,128
Is it, though?

815
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:55,898
I started acting

816
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:58,401
when Dad died because I
needed something to do.

817
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:00,628
And now I'm so close to it,

818
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:03,530
and I'm not sure if it's
actually what I want, you know?

819
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,610
I mean, what would you
do? Where would you go?

820
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:08,978
Someplace simpler, you know?

821
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:10,479
I-I would... I would...

822
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:13,583
Small town somewhere.

823
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,217
I don't know. Find a good woman.

824
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:17,053
Have a couple of kids.

825
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:23,993
Okay. Don't think about it.

826
00:35:23,994 --> 00:35:25,925
We're just gonna flip a coin.

827
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:27,617
Do you want the pilot to go or not?

828
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:29,932
- I don't.
- Mr. Pearson?

829
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:31,867
We're ready for you.

830
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,676
You want your husband back?

831
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:42,445
What?

832
00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:44,313
You want your husband back? Just...

833
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:46,415
- I'm not sure that's an option.
- Don't think about it.

834
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,797
Just flip a coin. Do
you want him back or not?

835
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:49,332
Yes.

836
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:53,923
Well, then, we should get him back.

837
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:57,010
That's very presumptuous of you. "We"?

838
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,695
"We". Yeah. I'm a very
presumptuous person.

839
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:01,163
You know that, right?

840
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:03,566
Hey.

841
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,768
I know that...

842
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,650
the show was a big chapter in your life,

843
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:11,044
and I'm sure that it
getting canceled was...

844
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,704
Yeah, sorry. No, I can't
do it. I can't care.

845
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,378
- Well, you did a little bit.
- Nah.

846
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:17,747
- Eh. Felt like it. Just a smidge.
- I don't. No.

847
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,459
- Hello?
- Hey.

848
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,086
I picked up a few things
for you at Jerry's.

849
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,534

00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,896
Start a new chapter.

882
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:15,330
Yeah?

883
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,432
Yeah.

884
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:18,767
♪ Under my feet. ♪

885
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:25,541
All right, I'll give.

886
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,142
What is this final scene of The Manny

887
00:38:27,143 --> 00:38:28,677
everyone's asking you about?

888
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:30,579
Oh, well, well, well,

889
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,581
look who's all of a sudden
interested in The Manny.

890
00:38:32,582 --> 00:38:34,883
Oh, okay. Never mind.

891
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:38,120
Okay, if-if you must know,

892
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:40,953
it was, uh... it was the last scene

893
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:43,592
of this terrible pilot, right?

894
00:38:43,593 --> 00:38:45,928
And the baby just...
it won't stop crying.

895
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,915
So I'm bouncing the baby,
I'm making faces at the baby.

896
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,796
Okay, c-can we get a different baby?

897
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:52,184
You know, d-don't
cut. Please, don't cut.

898
00:38:52,185 --> 00:38:54,169
Let me just, uh, let me
try something here, okay?

899
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,704
Be my guest.

900
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:01,310
What is that? Huh? What is that?

901
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:03,011
What is that? Huh? What is that?

902
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:04,446
Huh? What is that? Huh?

903
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,315
What is that? Huh? What is that?

904
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:08,684
And all of a sudden,
he just calmed down.

905
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:11,186
So they kept the cameras rolling, right?

906
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:14,723
And this angry baby and I just...

907
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:17,359
We connected.

908
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,528
And suddenly, the-the stupid Manny,

909
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:22,164
this stupid character
on this stupid show

910
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,245
with a stupid premise,

911
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:26,768
- became a real person.
- Peekaboo!

912
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,403
Hey, you did it.

913
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:29,838
Hey, that may work. We go with sweet

914
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,906
- instead of funny.
- Yeah.

915
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,531
He wasn't a joke anymore.

916
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:44,610
Oh, plus, they played this
really awesome Pink ballad

917
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:46,078
- underneath. Oh, yeah.
- Love Pink.

918
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,145
So acrobatic.

919
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:54,553
I've been thinking
about that day all day.

920
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,390
I didn't know what I wanted.

921
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:02,261
I made a baby laugh, and...

922
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:04,396
my life changed.

923
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:07,099
It's overwhelming if you think about it,

924
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,468
the power of these little decisions.

925
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:14,673
Hey.

926
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:16,241
Um...

927
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:20,679
Why'd you give me that lemon?

928
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,180
What?

929
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,449
Today at lunch,

930
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,985
you, um, passed me a lemon.

931
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:29,154
You didn't even say anything.

932
00:40:30,256 --> 00:40:32,057
Oh, um...

933
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:35,027
When we were on our date,
you ordered a Coke with lemon.

934
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:37,863
And at lunch, you had a Coke, so...

935
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,101
You noticed that?

936
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,804
Beth, if you knew how much

937
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,940
I've noticed about you...

938
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,065
Do you hear that, Jack?

939
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:18,136
The world is making music for you.

940
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:19,671
Do you hear the waves?

941
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:21,273
The wind?

942
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:22,841
Can you hear the seagulls?

943
00:41:22,842 --> 00:41:25,410
Do you hear that? Water!

944
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:26,645
Ooh!

945
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:36,822
Howdy, neighbor.

946
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:40,459
I told you, I don't want a new trailer.

947
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,694
Oh, I heard all that. It's
not for you. It's for me.

948
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:45,497
I was sick of staying
at the hotel, anyway.

949
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:47,065
Such an amazing view.

950
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:51,185
Did you see?

951
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:52,804
We have a message.

952
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:54,439
Hey, Mom, it's Kevin.

953
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,141
Uh, thanks for the brownies you sent.

954
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,276
I'm good. It's-it's raining a lot.

955
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:00,426
Uh, I actually might have
an audition next week

956
00:42:00,427 --> 00:42:02,681
- for a SunnyD commercial.
- Hmm.

957
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:05,267
Oh, and I got married. Uh, to Sophie.

958
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:06,885
Yeah, got married to Sophie.

959
00:42:06,886 --> 00:42:08,886
Um, can you send me some money?
