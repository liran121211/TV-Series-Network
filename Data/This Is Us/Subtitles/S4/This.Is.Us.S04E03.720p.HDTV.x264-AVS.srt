1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,691
Previously on "This Is Us"...

2
00:00:01,692 --> 00:00:03,345
Babe, are you sure that you want to go

3
00:00:03,346 --> 00:00:05,032
- to the grocery store now?
- Yeah, I like going

4
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,106
- when the store's not so crowded.
- Mm.

5
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,032
I know you don't have
a campaign manager.

6
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,726
- I want the gig.
- Happy to have you on board, Jae-won.

7
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:13,279
I know you want to fix things.

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,613
Fix me.

9
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:19,251
But you and your family...

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,879
It's just too painful.

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:51,203
_

12
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,695
- Hi, Nicky.
- _

13
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,129
It's nice to meet you.

14
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,298
I'm Dr. Ruiz.

15
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,500
I've been working with the
vets here for two years.

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,271
So, what's been going on with you?

17
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:34,821
_

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,081
Therapy works better if you talk.

19
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,438
I hate this sad, little room.

20
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,975
How's that?

21
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,687
You know we're only
80 miles from Canada?

22
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,822
I've never been.

23
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:09,128
I almost went once, with my brother.

24
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,163
But I didn't.

25
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,932
Why haven't you ever gone?

26
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,139
I can't stand maple syrup.

27
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,083
There's things that happened there

28
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,153
that you can't come back from.

29
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,689
You know, they... they
make you less human.

30
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,713
- Hey, Doc.
- Hi, Nicky.

31
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,316
So, listen, I was thinking...

32
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,452
Before we start today,
I have some bad news.

33
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,321
I'm being transferred to
a vet center in Arizona.

34
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,392
Our centers all over the
country are understaffed.

35
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,294
But you'll be working with Dr. Patterson

36
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,362
and I hear he is exceptional.

37
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,239
Nicky.

38
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,899
Watch your head.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,568
You watch your head, Officer Krupke.

40
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,053
I didn't need you to come.

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,067
Good morning.

43
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,104
Hey, Randall, slow down.
You're gonna choke.

44
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,306
It's the first day of junior high,
I want to get there early.

45
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,441
Well, you're not gonna be
early if you're in the ER

46
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,411
with Count Chocula lodged
in your throat. Chew.

47
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,847
Why do fancy schools start
earlier than normal ones?

48
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,515
Because we have bigger brains to fill.

49
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,685
Okay, nerd. Well, have fun
while we're home all day.

50
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,854
Mom, do we have any cucumber slices?

51
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,822
Why do you need cucumber slices?

52
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,958
I'm taking a me day.

53
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,005
Okay, so if I give you
a cucumber and a knife,

54
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,929
can I trust that you're
not gonna cut yourself?

55
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,531
I wouldn't count on it.

56
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,100
Mm-hmm.

57
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,372
Hey, Katie girl. Whatcha reading?

58
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,274
Do you think Cindy Crawford's pretty?

59
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,243
She's no Kate Pearson.

60
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,867
Oh, my God, Kate,
look, it's Suzanne Somers,

61
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,517
It's the thigh master lady.

62
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,086
- She's in our home.
- Ha, ha. Yeah.

63
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,824
Shelley lent me some new aerobics video

64
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,416
that I'm gonna try out in a little bit.

65
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,105
Oh. That's good.

66
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:27,304
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

67
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:28,663
I'm just, I'm in a mood.

68
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:29,955
You know? Mondays are hard.

69
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,442
I know that I've got, like, five days

70
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,177
of the red tape factory ahead of me.

71
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:36,293
Mmm. Well, I will be here
waiting at the end of every one.

72
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,629
Oh. I like that.

73
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,763
Can you guys be gross later?

74
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,295
Come on, Dad, seventh grade's calling.

75
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,431
- Seventh grade is calling.
- Seventh grade.

76
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:44,523
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

77
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:47,383
Have a great first day.
Thanks for the big hug.

78
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,390
Hi.

79
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,492
Hey.

80
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,494
- I'm Mr. Lawrence.
- I know.

81
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:17,198
I-I mean, cool. I'm Randall.

82
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,499
Nice to meet you, Randall.

83
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,226
- Please, have a seat.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:25,718
All right, kids, let's open
our books to chapter one.

85
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,012
Hey.

86
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:34,209
- What happened to Jae-won?
- He fell a little behind

87
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,117
at mile eight.

88
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:37,952
You say "mile eight" so casually.

89
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:40,287
You caught that, huh? Oh!

90
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,656
The Clarke School of
Dance grand opening flyers,

91
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,759
- hot off the press.
- Yes.

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,293
Everybody, take a stack

93
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:47,728
and give it to anyone
who looks like they need

94
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,954
a little rhythm in their life.

95
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,565
Hey, Tess?

96
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:55,002
I know you're nervous, but,
uh, it's gonna be great.

97
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:57,171
I know. I'm good.

98
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,106
Thanks, Mom.

99
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:02,042
Oh, you see my article in there?

100
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:04,421
You mean "Councilman Pearson Unhinged?"

101
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:05,703
Mm-hmm.

102
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,248
"Pearson takes his open door policy

103
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:10,608
to a new level by
removing his office door

104
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:13,854
from its hinges to show that
all are welcome for a sit-down.

105
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:17,343
Pearson spends every Monday
listening to constituents..."

106
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:18,697
Is that the article?

107
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,228
Yeah.

108
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,897
Hey, you think I come off as crazy?

109
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,919
No way, man. They called you bold.

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,100
They called me different.

111
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:28,002
- It says you're unhinged.
- Well, maybe I am.

112
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:30,070
- Boom.
- Boom!

113
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,640
Oh, uh, sometime today,
uh, I'd like to talk to you

114
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:34,475
about my proposal, if you've got time.

115
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,776
I always got time for you, J-Dubs.

116
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:38,212
- All right.
- I got to hit the shower.

117
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,815
Girls, you have an amazing first day.

118
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:44,084
You are all radiant women and
this town is lucky to have you.

119
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,887
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah. Love you guys.

120
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,823
- Love you, too.
- I was talking to my girls.

121
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:50,791
Sorry. Reflex.

122
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:54,562
Okay, so this is the brown velvet.

123
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:57,064
Do you like the soft fabric?

124
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:00,100
We're gonna have Daddy put up
these curtains this weekend.

125
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,609
So gurgle once if you like the velvet.

126
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,338
Can you do that? Can you do that?

127
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,162
Oh, wait, I thought, I was gonna
get to see you all dressed up

128
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,843
in your new client-wooing suit.

129
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,378
What, and risk sweat stains
before I even get to the office?

130
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,949
I'm not a daredevil. I
know my body's limits.

131
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,983
But you'll get to see it today at lunch.

132
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:17,451
Thanks again for agreeing to come.

133
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,053
They really wanted to meet my wife.

134
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:21,255
- Of course. Mwah.
- Mwah.

135
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:24,458
Okay, bye. Can you say bye-bye?

136
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:28,128
Bye. Aww...

137
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:31,065
- Hey.
- Hi.

138
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:33,434
Hi. We haven't had a chance
to introduce ourselves.

139
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:35,603
We just, um... just moved in.

140
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,282
Could you please tell your
husband to stop parking

141
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,081
in the middle of the sidewalk?

142
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:41,041
Yeah. Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's just that we have

143
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,776
this storage pod that we're unpacking,

144
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,495
so his car doesn't fit, you know,

145
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,080
- in the driveway.
- So park on the street

146
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,649
before I start calling
to have your car towed.

147
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:52,953
Okay. Wow.

148
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:55,379
We are never going to let Audio

149
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,781
poop in that man's yard.

150
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:10,477
Damn it. Damn it!

151
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,303
What's going on?

152
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,038
- You know the Marlin property?
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,040
- We laid the new foundation last week.
- Uh-huh.

154
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,342
20 minutes ago, Pritchard
got a call from the city.

155
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:22,610
Someone on our end forgot to schedule

156
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:24,013
the city water line inspection.

157
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:26,068
So now, we got to tear everything out,

158
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,569
have the city come take a look

159
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,805
and then start all over from scratch.

160
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:33,242
Whoever signed off on that
permit is done for, no question.

161
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:35,210
Oh, God. I hope it was Donovan.

162
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:36,931
I would love to see him go down.

163
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:39,114
You know, he microwaves fish
sticks in the break room?

164
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:40,306
Who does that?

165
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:43,719
I signed off on the
Marlin permit, Miguel.

166
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:47,176
- What?
- That was me.

167
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:54,303
Sir, my uncle Nicky
is extremely remorseful

168
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,832
about throwing that
chair through your window.

169
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,034
Isn't that right, Uncle Nicky?

170
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:01,770
Yes.

171
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,505
See?

172
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,574
It says here you have a hearing

173
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,342
in veterans' court in two months.

174
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:12,281
Um, he's facing, uh,
up to $250,000 in fines.

175
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:15,484
Or, uh, ten years in
prison. Sir, I mean...

176
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:18,053
... the man threw a chair, right?

177
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:20,689
It's not like he, uh, shredded a Banksy.

178
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,824
Right?

179
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:24,259
Um, anyway,

180
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,562
his-his court-appointed attorney, um,

181
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:28,897
said that if he could show
that he was committed

182
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:31,533
to continuing treatment
here at this facility,

183
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,955
um, that his sentence could be reduced.

184
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,270
Perhaps even pardoned.

185
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:41,643
I can have Dr. Patterson
do an evaluation today,

186
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:44,613
and we'll assess if Nicky
poses a further threat.

187
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:48,584
If he doesn't, I'll allow him
to continue his treatments here

188
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:52,221
on a probationary basis.

189
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,656
Batman, Robin,

190
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:55,858
how was your run today?

191
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:57,192
- Deadly.
- Invigorating.

192
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:59,127
Great job getting the
article out there, Shay.

193
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:00,353
Clearly it got us buzz.

194
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:02,494
Buzz? They called you "unhinged".

195
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,220
What was that, Bernice?

196
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:07,402
You have drinks with
Councilmen Wilkins and Ramirez

197
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:11,073
at 6:30 tonight to discuss
Wilkins' housing initiative.

198
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:12,500
Don't let this stunt make you late.

199
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,903
I wouldn't miss it.
And it's not a stunt.

200
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:20,688
Hi.

201
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,290
Wow. Good morning, everyone.

202
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,515
Uh, thanks for coming
here to talk to us.

203
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,527
I'm looking forward to
speaking with you all.

204
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,362
Uh, excuse me.

205
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,598
You want me to talk to
Bernice about the attitude?

206
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,533
Or find an aide with less attitude?

207
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,626
I can deal with a little attitude.

208
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,305
Bernice has more experience
than the rest of us combined.

209
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,473
We need somebody like her around.

210
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:41,075
Don't worry, my friend,

211
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,999
she'll learn to adore
me as much as you do.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,812
All right, who's first?

213
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:51,619
Hey, my man, hold up a sec.

214
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,721
Is this your first year here, too?

215
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:55,032
Nope, my third.

216
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:57,191
And I read in your
teacher bio that you just

217
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,693
moved here from Chicago.

218
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:01,229
And you love the Bulls. Well, me, too.

219
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,030
Mm.

220
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:06,534
Well, if it's your third year,
then you should know the rules.

221
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,169
I got to write you a yellow slip

222
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,471
for being out of dress
code with those shoes.

223
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:13,207
Yeah, but they're Air Jordans.

224
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,976
Like Michael Jordan wears.

225
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:19,881
Yeah, but Michael Jordan doesn't
have to abide by our dress code.

226
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:22,550
See, look, you want to
be in a place like this,

227
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,819
you got to look the part, okay.

228
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,123
That's why I rock a suit.
You know, like Arsenio Hall.

229
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,894
Sorry, man.

230
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:48,175
There he is.

231
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:50,378
- And this is Jack.
- Oh, my God.

232
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:52,146
- He's just six months old.
- Oh, God, those eyelashes.

233
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,347
Right?

234
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:55,016
That's pretty amazing.

235
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,318
We named him after his grandpa.

236
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:02,391
Oh, and here she is.
This is my wife Kate.

237
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:04,827
- Kate, please meet Debbie and Arjun.
- Hi, how are you?

238
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:06,729
Toby was just showing
us photos of your son.

239
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,097
He's ridiculously cute.

240
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,966
Oh, thank you.

241
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,502
Yeah, thankfully, 'cause
there's no return policy.

242
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:14,370
No, there's not.

243
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,405
But we are not here to talk about him.

244
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:18,117
We are here to talk
about database servers

245
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:20,176
and all of your other IT needs. So...

246
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:21,477
Your table is ready, folks.

247
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:22,664
- Come with me.
- Great.

248
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:24,614
Thank you.

249
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,616
You look great.

250
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:28,785
Thanks. So do you.

251
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:32,588
Oh, actually, you know what. Sorry.

252
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:34,140
I hate to be a pain, but it looks like

253
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,691
we're right below a vent here,

254
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,895
and a cool breeze can really
ruin a hot lobster bisque.

255
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:41,095
They have an amazing lobster bisque.

256
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,995
Uh, do you think we could
sit at a different table,

257
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:44,033
like that one over there?

258
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,701
Sorry, sir, those are reserved.

259
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,937
This is fine. We don't eat bisque.

260
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:51,374
I was gonna have bisque.
I love bisque...

261
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,812
He's actually asking because
I... can't fit in the booth.

262
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,549
I should come with a label, right?

263
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,185
"May contain uncomfortable moments".

264
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:06,556
I'm so sorry. There's a table this way.

265
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:08,724
Thank you. I love you.

266
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,540
Hey, boss, you, uh... you got a sec?

267
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,176
Pearson, yeah. What's up?

268
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:26,849
I was the one that signed
off on the Marlin property.

269
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,318
I don't know how I missed that

270
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,587
we didn't have the
water line inspection.

271
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:35,124
Do you know how much your
mistake is gonna cost?

272
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,294
20,000. That's money
straight out of my pocket.

273
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:42,198
I'm-I'm sorry. Okay, I don't
know how this happened.

274
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,933
I've never made a
mistake like this before.

275
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:45,701
Yeah, but now you have.

276
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,603
It's colossal.

277
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,740
I'm sorry, Jack,

278
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,909
you don't come back from this one.

279
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,485
Walk it out, shake it down...

280
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,088
Hey, Bug.

281
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,457
Do you want to try this with me?

282
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,183
- Sure.
- Really?

283
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:12,123
Well, sashay on in here, little cutie.

284
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,230
I'll show you how it's
done. It's really easy.

285
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,855
All we're gonna do is just follow along.

286
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,476
And don't worry if you mess up. Right?

287
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:18,767
- Mm-hmm.
- See?

288
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:20,402
See what she's doing? There you go.

289
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:22,104
Step, touch. Oh.

290
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,182
Now she's going back here.

291
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,809
Hey, Kev, can you get that?

292
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,645
This is interrupting my me time.

293
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,720
Hello?

294
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:40,155
Hey, hey, Kev, it's me.
Um, can you get Mom?

295
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,457
What's wrong?

296
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,825
I-I got in trouble,

297
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:44,526
and Mom and Dad have
to sign a yellow slip.

298
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,591
And I just feel like I can't breathe.

299
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,863
I'm really freaking out.

300
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,830
And do you think telling
Mom you got in trouble

301
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:51,860
- will make it better?
- Well, I don't know what's happening.

302
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:53,135
I don't know what to do.

303
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,375
Mom, it's Dylan.

304
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,576
I'm going to his house.

305
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:03,746
I'll meet you by the
side door of your school.

306
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,681
Don't call back here.

307
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,202
Come on.

308
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:31,273
Blanket, panda, Bradshaw.

309
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:34,677
That one's broken.

310
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:36,946
You have to use the
one around the corner.

311
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:38,547
Hmm.

312
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,951
You know your way
around this place, huh?

313
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,892
I come with my mom here.
She's seeing a therapist.

314
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,560
My dad said it's good for her.

315
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,429
Gotcha.

316
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,197
Want to play something?

317
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,732
I'll crush Mario Kart. Let's go.

318
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:01,236
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

319
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,538
- Oh...
- Ah, you bit it.

320
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,306
- Your turn.
- Yep. Funyun?

321
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:07,042
- Yeah.
- All right. Time for me to shine.

322
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:08,911
I gave you a chance to drive.
You give me a chance to drive.

323
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:10,835
I can't do very well when
you're backseat driving,

324
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:11,947
chirping in my ear the whole time...

325
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,649
No, I-I'm putting on
your rocket booster.

326
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,118
No, no, no! Oh, okay. Well,
that helped. All right.

327
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,193
Yeah, but you can't block the
screen, because I'm trying...

328
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:20,323
- Who are you?
- Hey, Mom.

329
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:21,714
This is my friend, Kevin.

330
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,592
- Oh.
- Kevin Pearson.

331
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,795
You are not at all what I pictured

332
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,696
when your son said his mom was a vet.

333
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:29,365
Well, you're not at all what I picture

334
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,300
when my son says he has a friend.

335
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,268
For the record, a 40-year-old man

336
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,807
hanging out with a
nine-year-old boy is...

337
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,272
- it's creepy.
- Oh, definitely not 40.

338
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,640
Well, definitely nine.

339
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,775
Let's get your backpack on, bud.

340
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,477
- Come on.
- Okay.

341
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,002
How do I know you? Oh,

342
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,377
you were on a television show.

343
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:46,405
Um... Who's the Boss?

344
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,183
Who's the Boss?

345
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:50,185
I'm 39 years old, lady.

346
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:52,087
I was on a show called The Manny.

347
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,489
- You ever see that?
- Uh...

348
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,723
and you're a vet.

349
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:58,193
No, no, my... Oh, my uncle,
right here, he's a vet.

350
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,529
You're the guy who threw a chair at me.

351
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,198
Well, don't flatter yourself, I
wasn't throwing it at you.

352
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,434
Mom, can they come
to the arcade with us?

353
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,870
Absolutely not. Come on, bud, let's go.

354
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,105
Goodbye now.

355
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,574
- So?
- Hmm?

356
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,177
- Well, how'd it go?
- Oh.

357
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,180
He thinks I'm a delight.
Welcome back anytime.

358
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,549
You wouldn't be offended if I
cross-checked that, would you?

359
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,129
Hey, Doc, hi.

360
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,422
Uh, I was just wondering
how that went with my uncle.

361
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:29,613
Yes, I'm gonna recommend
that we allow him

362
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:31,460
to resume receiving services.

363
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:32,895
Great.

364
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,563
But I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

365
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:37,775
None of us can help someone
who doesn't want to be helped.

366
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,677
Excuse me.

367
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,575
Oh, come on. Great.

368
00:18:55,852 --> 00:19:00,355
Robot, giraffe... diapers.

369
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,200
I mean, I busted a ball joint on my car

370
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:07,029
- on one of those potholes.
- I got you.

371
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,645
I'll bring it to the school board.

372
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,288
Hey, Jae-won, can we make
a note of that, please?

373
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,668
- Yeah.
- Councilman Pearson's office.

374
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:13,902
Oh, one moment.

375
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,571
Councilman Martell's on the line.

376
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,840
Uh, please keep holding
my calls till 6:00.

377
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,375
So, I first noticed it...

378
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,386
Have a great night, Miss Perez.

379
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,854
And that is how we
govern in District 12.

380
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:33,613
You need to leave for your drinks.

381
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:35,657
I hear you, Bernice, and
I'm one foot out the door.

382
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:37,526
J, you can prep me on the way?

383
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:40,681
Yep. And maybe we can talk about
my proposal, if there's time?

384
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,431
Oh, Batman would love
nothing more, Robin.

385
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,832
Can I be someone other than Robin?

386
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,767
I mean, he looks Asian,
but he isn't Asian.

387
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,503
- Amadeus Cho, maybe.
- Sure, buddy.

388
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:49,338
You can be Amadeus Cho.

389
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,359
Councilman Pearson, can I have a word?

390
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,468
No, we need to wrap him up by 6:00.

391
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,013
Well, I would have been here at 5:15,

392
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:58,469
but the number two bus was late,

393
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,315
so I had to walk 20 blocks to get here,

394
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:05,287
just to complain to you about
how the bus system is jacked.

395
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,789
- And it's only 5:59 by my watch.
- Sir,

396
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,325
why don't you come into my office?

397
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,339
Jae-won, please extend my apologies

398
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,498
to the other councilmen.

399
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:19,301
Tell them I will be there soon.

400
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,804
Yeah, I know.

401
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,175
Yes! Those nerds loved us.

402
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:28,844
Huh? You should help me
woo clients all the time.

403
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,010
We could star in,
like, a TNT procedural,

404
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,881
where we close IT deals.

405
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:34,583
We'd be cancelled after one season,

406
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:37,519
but the fans would
elevate us to cult status.

407
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,055
- Toby.
- Yeah?

408
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:42,491
- Take your shirt off.
- Yeah, bossy.

409
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,227
- Yeah, I like that for your character.
- Toby.

410
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,928
Look, I've got, like, a
half-day's worth of sweat

411
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:47,930
under this bad boy.

412
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:49,427
Trust me, you do not want to see

413
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:50,862
my matted chest rug.

414
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:04,846
Uh, holy crap.

415
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,631
Like, I knew that you
lost weight, but I d...

416
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:12,092
I guess I just haven't
seen you fully undressed.

417
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:13,967
I've just been so focused on Jack.

418
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,725
Yeah, I mean, I mean,
you've had a lot going on.

419
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:18,594
So have you.

420
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:22,164
New-mom stress has me up ten pounds.

421
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,407
New-dad stress means
that you have Popeye arms?

422
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:27,242
That doesn't make any sense.

423
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:32,841
Okay, I-I've been going to the gym

424
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:35,510
over the last few months.

425
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,579
On my lunch break, mostly.

426
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,783
Sometimes before or-or after work.

427
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:44,987
I've been doing CrossFit.

428
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,556
Why didn't you tell me?

429
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,945
Because you were being
this rock star mom,

430
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,181
and I didn't want to make you feel bad

431
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:54,930
for not having the energy
to go to the gym, or

432
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:57,637
stick to a diet right now, or...

433
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:02,571
Look, Kate, I had a
heart attack at age 38.

434
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:06,074
And with Jack...

435
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,744
He... his life is gonna
be challenging enough,

436
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,045
he doesn't need to have a dad
who's gonna drop dead one day

437
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:12,781
trying to teach him
how to tie his shoes.

438
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,324
Oh, like his mom might.

439
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,453
I didn't say that.

440
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:24,192
- Kate...
- I get it.

441
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:26,762
This just caught me a little off guard.

442
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:47,212
Jack?

443
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:48,546
Jack, what happened?

444
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:52,083
He fired me.

445
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:55,854
Yeah, I'm done.

446
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:01,993
Miguel... Hey. Hey. Where you going?

447
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,662
Miguel?

448
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:04,930
Rivas, not now...

449
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:07,999
Jack has been with this
company for almost 20 years.

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,539
He's a hard worker.

451
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,344
Has a great relationship with our crews,

452
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:13,747
and he brings the best chili
to the company cookouts.

453
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:16,983
- So if he goes, I go.
- Miguel, look, you don't have to...

454
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:20,613
I am your most successful
upper-level account manager.

455
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:22,172
Five of the eight most lucrative deals

456
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,066
we made last year, I
brought those clients in.

457
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:27,919
So I want you to ask yourself,
Pritchard, what's worth more:

458
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,011
the $20,000 that we're gonna lose today,

459
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:32,279
or the hundreds of thousands
that you will lose

460
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,106
when me, Jack, and all
my cash-rich clients

461
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:36,999
walk out of here. 'Cause I will do it.

462
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,802
I will walk out of here today,
and I will not look back.

463
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:52,304
Whew! That was so fun, right, Bug?

464
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,075
I would love to do
another one of these tapes

465
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:56,301
- with you sometime.
- Yeah, that would be awesome.

466
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,058
I'm gonna go get some
water. Do you want some?

467
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,127
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

468
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,750
What part of "tell your husband

469
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:26,553
not to block the sidewalk"
didn't you understand?

470
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:29,756
Really? Not now. Okay, dude?

471
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,358
I just found out my husband

472
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,059
has been sneaking off to get ripped,

473
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,141
while I'm just here at home
taking care of our son.

474
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:40,534
So really, I'm not in the mood
for your stupid curb drama.

475
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:45,092
I'm sorry you're having a bad day.

476
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:49,042
I had a massive stroke
two and a half years ago.

477
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:51,002
Almost punched my ticket.

478
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,861
I had to relearn how to do everything.

479
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:56,516
How to walk, talk, even
how to chew and swallow.

480
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,819
I finally did it, though.

481
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,388
And a week later, I lost my job.

482
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:04,191
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's awful...

483
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:05,425
Not done yet.

484
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:07,551
My only goal right now
is to be able to walk

485
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:09,511
just one pathetic mile.

486
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:11,937
So every morning, I
walk around this block.

487
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:14,363
I'm not fast, but I do it.

488
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,802
Unless your husband blocks the sidewalk,

489
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:17,037
and I can't get past.

490
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,306
If he does again tomorrow,
I'm keying his car.

491
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:21,375
This hand still works fine.

492
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:27,347
This is me storming away!

493
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:30,483
Don't blink, you'll miss it.

494
00:25:30,484 --> 00:25:32,586
All right, little mamas...

495
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:34,955
chicken parm is in the oven,

496
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:38,258
we have 30 minutes on the timer,

497
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:39,860
catch me up on your days.

498
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:41,328
I want to know everything.

499
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:44,614
My math teacher looks like Zendaya.

500
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:46,533
Wait, cute Spider-Man Zendaya

501
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:49,736
- or HBO drugged-out Zendaya?
- Wait, I'll be right back.

502
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:54,774
What about you, huh?

503
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:56,606
How was your day?

504
00:25:56,607 --> 00:26:00,180
You make any friends you
want to tell me about?

505
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:03,350
Not really. It was pretty average.

506
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:06,319
People, classes, you know.

507
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,358
Hey.

508
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,993
You got my text?

509
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:15,362
Yeah, I'm pretty good
at using the phone.

510
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:18,866
Listen, um...

511
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:23,270
You hear anything about me in school?

512
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:26,414
No. Like what?

513
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:28,539
I mean, you running for student council

514
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,777
or something lame like that?

515
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:34,840
No, no. Not quite. Um...

516
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:41,187
Thing is, I-I, I have a daughter.

517
00:26:41,188 --> 00:26:43,657
She's six months old.

518
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:46,259
I knew you might hear
about it at school,

519
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,829
and I didn't want to tell you over text.

520
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:55,001
Her-her, her mom and I were
together for a while, and...

521
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,537
... well, she got pregnant.

522
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:01,107
See, her-her parents
wanted to put Janelle...

523
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:04,744
that's my girl, Janelle, um...

524
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:06,279
wanted to put her up for adoption,

525
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,981
but me, me and my
parents didn't want that,

526
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:11,017
so... so we got her.

527
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:23,513
- ♪ Oh, yeah ♪
- Hey, I did the session.

528
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:25,632
You want to go to jail?

529
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:26,891
Is that what you want?

530
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:27,994
Because that's what your future holds

531
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:29,296
if you don't start
taking this seriously.

532
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:30,761
Yeah, well, at least if I go to jail,

533
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:33,555
you won't keep coming
around to bust my balls.

534
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:35,447
Hey! What?!

535
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:37,507
Did you know that I was
sober for over a year?

536
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:39,733
And then I came here and I met you,

537
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,500
and then, guess what, I
started drinking again.

538
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,450
- Did you know that?
- I didn't ask you to come back.

539
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:44,684
Well, I did.

540
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:47,210
I'm your brother's son, all right?

541
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:49,812
And I have come here twice now for you.

542
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,482
And if you're not gonna show
me a little bit of gratitude,

543
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:55,952
perhaps you can search
deep down inside somewhere,

544
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:58,187
and find, like, an
ounce of understanding.

545
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:03,092
Damn, I need a meeting.
You know, this...

546
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,029
I'm going to a meeting, and
you're coming with me, okay?

547
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,565
And I don't give a damn if
you wait in the car or not,

548
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:11,500
but I'm not leaving you
here, and I need a meeting,

549
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,501
so let's go.

550
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:16,172
Get up. Let's go.

551
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,158
Hey. You okay?

552
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,984
What'd you do?

553
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,481
I was out of dress code.

554
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:28,284
That's what you're freaking out about?

555
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:30,514
What, was your shirt
not tucked deep enough

556
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:33,055
- into your old man pants?
- This is not funny!

557
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:37,159
Come on. Let me see your slip.

558
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:43,399
You want Mom in a hurry
or Mom before bed?

559
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,559
Never mind.

560
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,603
- Wait, you can't do that!
- It's fine.

561
00:28:47,604 --> 00:28:48,821
I do this all the time.

562
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:51,774
This way Mom and Dad will never know

563
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,776
you got in trouble.

564
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,670
Come on, man, just calm down.

565
00:28:57,581 --> 00:29:00,116
It's gonna be okay. Calm down.

566
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:03,452
I don't know how
they let the quarterback

567
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:05,836
who won them the Super
Bowl become a free agent.

568
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:08,568
You sure the Eagles roster
is outside your purview?

569
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,769
Mr. Morris, I'm gonna
take your experiences

570
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,395
to the Transportation Committee.

571
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:14,964
- I really appreciate it, Councilman.
- I appreciate you, sir.

572
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:17,033
- Take care.
- 6:52.

573
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:18,668
Oh, my goodness, I know, Bernice.

574
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:20,670
I'm headed over there now.

575
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,371
Uh, excuse me.

576
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,974
Sir, that door's off
the hinges on purpose.

577
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:27,176
I just got a call about putting it back.

578
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:30,313
Having the door off is a fire hazard.

579
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:35,484
Uh, excuse me, everyone,

580
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:37,253
could you, could you give us the room?

581
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:40,493
Please.

582
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:52,101
I think I've been pretty
patient with all the eye rolls

583
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:54,470
and the sighs and the attitude.

584
00:29:56,217 --> 00:29:57,406
To be clear...

585
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:01,444
I am the councilman here. Not you.

586
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:03,446
Then you need to start acting like it.

587
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,414
Excuse me?

588
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:08,751
You're a politician, not a therapist.

589
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:11,878
You're new, naive, and you
have no track record here.

590
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:15,103
You need to spend your time
trying to get the 16 people

591
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,093
you govern with on your side.

592
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:20,529
Not gabbing with every
Joe Schmoe off the street.

593
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,233
But I shouldn't be telling you this.

594
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:26,669
Your chief of staff should.

595
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,671
And what are you saying?

596
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:33,442
You really want to serve
these people, hmm?

597
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:36,946
You need someone who understands
how city council works.

598
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:38,881
And who's not pulling double duty

599
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:42,018
as your best friend.
So what am I saying?

600
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:46,522
Let me be clear: You
need to fire Jae-won.

601
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,384
Our son soils an incredible amount

602
00:30:57,385 --> 00:31:00,792
- of clothing for a 14-pound being.
- Yeah.

603
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,501
His main passion in
life is making things

604
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:06,771
inside his body suddenly appear
outside of his body, so...

605
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:08,105
Yeah.

606
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:12,555
Hey, look, I'm, uh...

607
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,691
I'm sorry I kept all that
CrossFit stuff from you.

608
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:15,792
I shouldn't have done that.

609
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:18,962
It's just hard.

610
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:21,824
You know, seeing you
lose so much weight,

611
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:23,266
and I'm doing the opposite.

612
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,969
And it took me by surprise.

613
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,738
Seeing you in all
those new clothes today,

614
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:30,308
it really shook me.

615
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:34,611
But that's my problem.

616
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,246
I'm so happy that
you're getting healthy,

617
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:39,716
and you look amazing.

618
00:31:39,717 --> 00:31:41,784
Seriously, you look like
Vin Diesel's body double.

619
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:44,676
You know that The Pacifier's
my guilty pleasure.

620
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:46,278
Yes. All too well.

621
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,927
So no more secrets, okay?

622
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:53,096
No more secrets.

623
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:58,368
I'm glad you decided to come.

624
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:00,703
I'm just here for the snacks.

625
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:03,339
- Drinking gives me a salt tooth.
- Got it.

626
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:11,681
I mean, of all the AA meetings

627
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:14,017
in all the towns in all the world.

628
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:17,088
- You gonna really sit next to me?
- No, I'm sitting over there.

629
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:33,002
- Hey.
- Hey.

630
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:34,737
Can I sit?

631
00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:48,651
The boy I like has a baby.

632
00:32:48,652 --> 00:32:51,020
Damn.

633
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:52,889
I know.

634
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,686
Do you still like him?

635
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,328
It's... I don't know.

636
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,863
It's complicated.

637
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,703
You know, you seemed
pretty complicated, too,

638
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:08,204
when you showed up.

639
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:14,911
Okay.

640
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,046
Now it's your turn.

641
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:25,688
I thought the one good
thing about a new school

642
00:33:25,689 --> 00:33:28,825
would be that I didn't have to come out.

643
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:32,228
I could just be out.

644
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:34,597
But a girl I was sitting with at lunch

645
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:37,734
asked me if I thought this
football player was hot

646
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:39,735
and I said yes.

647
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:43,363
I don't know why.

648
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:47,844
And it sucks, like,

649
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:50,956
I used to want to talk
to my mom about stuff,

650
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:56,619
- but it's harder now.
- Yeah.

651
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,890
Well, sometimes,

652
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:04,494
even when you don't say anything,

653
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:06,796
they're still there, you know?

654
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:09,966
I mean, even when they
don't know what's going on,

655
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:13,436
Randall and Beth are just there.

656
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:16,806
That's one thing that's
really cool about this house.

657
00:34:22,346 --> 00:34:26,048
- Man, a baby!
- Oh, God.

658
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:28,684
- Please.
- Oh, stepmom?

659
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,004
Hey.

660
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:38,995
Hey.

661
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:40,430
So you good?

662
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:44,167
You were really freaking out today.

663
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:50,973
Randall, for real.

664
00:34:50,974 --> 00:34:53,943
Um...

665
00:34:53,944 --> 00:34:56,579
It felt like my heart was gonna explode.

666
00:34:58,415 --> 00:35:00,783
Do you think it was,
like, a heart attack?

667
00:35:00,784 --> 00:35:02,985
Kevin told me.

668
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:05,054
Maybe it was just, like, puberty.

669
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:08,624
They say your body does
a bunch of weird stuff.

670
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,394
Thanks for coming today.

671
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:15,231
Whatever. I was bored.

672
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:17,934
I kissed Stewart Alberghini at the pool.

673
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:21,210
Stewart Alberghini?

674
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:29,846
Would you ever like a
girl who's bigger than you?

675
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:32,315
I'm gonna marry Cindy Crawford.

676
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:34,850
She's, like, 5'9" and
way bigger than me.

677
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:39,255
Hey, do you know who Arsenio Hall is?

678
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:41,023
Randall, you really need

679
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:43,459
to stop spending all your time reading.

680
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,065
So...

681
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:51,200
Stewart Alberghini.

682
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:53,595
Okay, guys, thank you.

683
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,448
This is Miguel.

684
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:03,783
Hey, man, you busy?

685
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:05,236
Uh, no, I'm-I... Well, yeah,

686
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:08,148
I'm-I'm just going through
a-a mountain of paperwork here.

687
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,457
You doing okay?

688
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,959
Yeah, I'm still employed, so...

689
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:16,496
Hey, look,

690
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:18,698
I know we don't ever say

691
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:21,301
any mushy things to each other, but

692
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:22,326
I mean, if we did,

693
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:24,771
th-this would definitely
be one of those times.

694
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:28,108
Jack, are you... are you trying
to tell me that you love me?

695
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:29,166
Is that what you're trying to do here?

696
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,225
Because I got to tell you, man,

697
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:31,860
- I'm a married man, so...
- No.

698
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:38,084
No, what I'm trying to tell you is

699
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:41,054
if you ever need anything, big or small,

700
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:44,457
and I, and I hear that you
went to anyone other than me,

701
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,659
I'm gonna kick your sorry ass.

702
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:50,997
Well, I love you, too, snookums,
and I appreciate that.

703
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:53,133
You know what, I'm-I'm hanging up now.

704
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:55,101
No, wait, Jack, Jack.

705
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:57,171
Any time, man.

706
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,414
Hey, Kev, what are you doing?
You should be in bed.

707
00:37:07,415 --> 00:37:10,216
There's something we
all need to do right now.

708
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:12,419
I think it's important.

709
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:17,090
I'm off to a good start, huh?

710
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:20,293
What are you guys doing?

711
00:37:20,294 --> 00:37:22,095
I thought we could all watch

712
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:24,132
The Arsenio Hall Show together.

713
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:32,539
Just tonight.

714
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,707
Come on.

715
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:39,379
Hey. Did I miss Wilkins and Ramirez?

716
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,549
Yeah, no, they left,
like, ten minutes ago.

717
00:37:47,488 --> 00:37:50,690
How'd it go at the office?

718
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:52,492
Oh...

719
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:56,062
J?

720
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,015
Now I'm gonna go tell that handyman

721
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:03,206
to put the door back on the hinges.

722
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:07,740
You have a lot of
experience that I don't.

723
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:12,112
I know the value of what
you bring to the table,

724
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:16,583
but I can't have someone on my
staff who openly disrespects me,

725
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:19,119
my policies, and my friend.

726
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,889
You mean your chief of staff.

727
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,024
I'm sorry, Bernice,

728
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:27,794
today will be your last day.

729
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:35,902
Okay. I'll start getting
résumés tomorrow.

730
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:39,906
She called us naive. She right?

731
00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:43,610
Yes. We are naive.

732
00:38:43,611 --> 00:38:45,411
We're unhinged, right?

733
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:47,747
That's what Bernice and all
those old-school guys think.

734
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:51,587
If, at the end of your
term, you've maybe made

735
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:52,986
a couple good changes,

736
00:38:52,987 --> 00:38:55,334
and you spent most of your
time just playing power games

737
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:56,890
in city hall, is that what you want?

738
00:38:56,891 --> 00:39:00,760
We're not career politicians, Randall.

739
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:03,730
And this isn't some stepping
stone to some bigger gig for us.

740
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:05,103
This is the gig.

741
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:10,370
We're gonna have to
get a doorstop tomorrow.

742
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:12,906
Apparently having it off
its hinges is a fire hazard.

743
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:15,275
Oh, well, in that case, we're done for.

744
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:17,256
Hey,

745
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:22,015
- let's talk about your proposal.
- Yeah?

746
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:24,384
Okay.

747
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:27,954
So, um, Hannah comes in,

748
00:39:27,955 --> 00:39:29,656
and I'm gonna have the candles lit,

749
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:31,191
a martini in hand,

750
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:33,793
and "Everlong" by the
Foo Fighters playing.

751
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:35,277
The Foo Fighters, really?

752
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:37,043
Dude, the acoustic version?

753
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:40,433
Come... That is, like, the most
romantic song on the planet.

754
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:42,235
I will take your word for it.

755
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,908
That's my posse right here.
Give 'em a couple of these.

756
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:58,017
Honestly, I've been
struggling quite a bit today.

757
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:00,853
I've been wanting to drink pretty badly.

758
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:04,757
So, uh, I've been using this
technique that I learned.

759
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:07,727
They say you picture your...
your reasons not to drink

760
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:11,231
and then you, um, you just
sort of use them as a mantra.

761
00:40:11,232 --> 00:40:14,234
Like, for me, I-I picture, um,

762
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:17,904
I picture my nephew's room.

763
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:21,074
I picture, uh, his-his robot poster,

764
00:40:21,075 --> 00:40:23,543
panda lamp.

765
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:28,214
He's got this, um, this
handmade mini football stadium,

766
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:31,218
complete with a tiny Terry Bradshaw.

767
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:37,590
I wasn't sober when my nephew was born,

768
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:41,127
but I have been sober every day since.

769
00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:45,250
But sometimes I wonder why.

770
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:51,204
I'm not really doing
anything with my life

771
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:52,805
where I need to stay sober.

772
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:54,841
I just thought, at this point,

773
00:40:54,842 --> 00:40:57,844
my life would have a
little more purpose.

774
00:40:57,845 --> 00:41:00,313
I just broke up with this
really wonderful woman.

775
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:03,449
I just turned down this

776
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,586
really wonderful movie.

777
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:08,194
Was that a mistake?

778
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,658
I don't know.

779
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:13,826
I'm not getting any
younger, that's for sure.

780
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:16,562
You know, hopefully, with age,

781
00:41:16,563 --> 00:41:19,999
just comes a little
more, uh, gravitas, right?

782
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,568
But it's not up to us.

783
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:25,104
I mean, it could be, you know...

784
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:28,159
"Welcome to Jowl City" at
50, right? And then what?

785
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,177
I'm-I'm the guy in the
AARP ads that's, like, uh,

786
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,432
just thrilled to death that
he can still wipe his own ass.

787
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:37,250
I mean, if that's why
I'm staying sober, I...

788
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:41,287
I'm sorry, it's just
this is really stupid.

789
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:47,660
I mean, right?

790
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:51,030
Excuse me,

791
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:53,432
I need you two to calm yourselves.

792
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:05,812
If you can't be respectful,
you three need to leave.

793
00:42:31,872 --> 00:42:34,874
I'm not fast, either.

794
00:42:37,878 --> 00:42:39,846
We're gonna look like the toughest gang

795
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,167
in this neighborhood.
