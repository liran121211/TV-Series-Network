1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,724
Previously on "This Is Us"...

2
00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:03,060
You want your husband back?

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:04,662
Yes.

4
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:07,446
Well, then we should get him back.

5
00:00:07,447 --> 00:00:10,706
I think it's time we got
out of this place, you know?

6
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:13,068
Get into a home.

7
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:17,339
And start a new chapter.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,532
Hey, Mom, it's Kevin.

9
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,772
I got married, uh, to Sophie, yeah.

10
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,774
Got married to Sophie.

11
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:36,279
Babe?

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,215
I can't find it.

13
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:41,317
Hey, what about this? Will this do?

14
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:43,164
We can't have our first dinner

15
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,121
in our first house on terrycloth.

16
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:46,756
Found it.

17
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:49,149
See? This is perfect.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,828
It's gonna look so good on our table...

19
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,064
- Where's our table?
- Finding table.

20
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:04,100
- Hey.
- Morning. How'd you sleep?

21
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:06,435
Weird. I kept waking up
and forgetting where I was.

22
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:09,639
Me, too. I mean, we only
moved in a month ago.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,140
I feel like it's gonna take some time

24
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:12,341
for it to feel like home.

25
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:14,477
Can you grab me that other chair?

26
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:15,745
Please, Bug?

27
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:17,980
Do you really think a fancy
dinner is gonna make it

28
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:19,715
less bizarre that Kevin got married

29
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,684
five years after puberty?

30
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,619
He doesn't even understand
how a checking account works.

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,288
Kate, we've talked about this.

32
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,749
What's done is done. Now we
just have to support them.

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,761
I actually think it'll be fun
to have something to celebrate.

34
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:34,330
Randall's bringing his new girlfriend,

35
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:37,533
Miguel's gonna bring some
fancy bottle of wine...

36
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:38,968
And a sleeping bag.

37
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,271
What? He's here all the time.

38
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:44,607
He also talked the Realtor
down and fixed the gutters.

39
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:47,182
So I think that at least
deserves a dinner invitation.

40
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:49,478
I'm off to work.

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,681
Hey, how is work, by the way?

42
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:53,683
You seem to really be liking it.

43
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:56,586
Yeah, it's okay. A little boring.

44
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:01,691
Hey, does anyone actually work here?

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,094
- Go.
- I know, I'm gonna go.

46
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:08,231
Hello.

47
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:10,433
Yeah. Coming.

48
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,643
Baby, slow down.

49
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,311
I have to go over my
science presentation,

50
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:25,170
proof my English essay,
and review my Spanish vocab

51
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,649
before school.

52
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,351
All right, well, what's
Spanish for "chew"?

53
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:31,387
- Masticar.
- Then do that.

54
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:34,290
Good morning, my breakfast beauties.

55
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,160
Who's ready to own this day?

56
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:38,078
Hey, you were out early this morning.

57
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,958
- I didn't even see you.
- I did.

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,098
That's right. 'Cause we're early birds.

59
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,667
Getting that worm.

60
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:48,204
Ten miles. Best time. No big deal.

61
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:50,539
Ten miles? What are you,
training for a marathon?

62
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,708
I just felt good and I kept going.

63
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,544
Hey, Dej. Cereal?

64
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,514
One-third Corn Flakes,
two-thirds Cheerios,

65
00:02:58,515 --> 00:02:59,582
just like you like it.

66
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,550
You think cereal is gonna make me forget

67
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:03,984
you treat me like a child who
can't make her own decisions

68
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,076
about who to date?

69
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:07,356
That was the plan.

70
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:08,791
Okay.

71
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,827
You're gonna need a better plan, man.

72
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:14,096
Yeah.

73
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:15,298
Hey, Kate.

74
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,300
Okay, you have to tell
me what the baby gift is.

75
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:20,223
I don't. It'll ruin the surprise.

76
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:21,818
Oh, is it a pony?

77
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,744
Huh, Randall? I'd love a pony.

78
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,608
Or a, or a hot tub.

79
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,209
For a baby?

80
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,544
Look, I don't know.

81
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:31,046
The Pearson men are known
for their grand gestures.

82
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,348
It could be literally anything.

83
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,216
- Yeah.
- In the meantime, listen, I got to go.

84
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:37,110
I'm off to the gun show. All right.

85
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,936
Love you. Bye, Randall.

86
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,790
It's not a pony or a hot tub.

87
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,724
But it is from me and Kevin.

88
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,126
He made me promise I'd tell you that.

89
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:46,466
Even though it was my
idea, and I did everything

90
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,432
while he did nothing. So you call
me first when it gets there.

91
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:52,401
Okay. Hey, um...

92
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:53,703
I'm worried about Kev.

93
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:55,204
I mean, he bought a trailer?

94
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,372
In Pennsylvania?

95
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,683
Quiet's nice, huh?

96
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:12,188
It was.

97
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:16,859
So... what was it like
growing up with my dad?

98
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,061
Hmm? Tell me a story
about his childhood.

99
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:23,599
He liked ice cream.

100
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:29,138
Yeah. That's a good story.

101
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,274
That's-that's a great story. Uh,
I'm gonna expand on that a bit.

102
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:35,244
I remember when I was a kid,
my dad used to come home,

103
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:38,848
sometimes he'd bring these,
uh, these cartons of ice cream.

104
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,452
You know, the, the ones
with the cardboard sides

105
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,587
that you'd fold down,

106
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:47,256
leaving just a brick of ice cream?

107
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:50,493
Anyway, he'd, um...

108
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:51,685
- Right there?
- Right there.

109
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:53,211
He'd cut it like it was a cake.

110
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,046
Big old cut, oh!

111
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,839
God, I really loved that.

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,415
Nothing. Okay, great.

113
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,286
Mm. You, uh, you looking forward

114
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:19,388
- to the hockey game today?
- Yeah, I was.

115
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,176
- Yeah.
- But then I remembered

116
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,925
I don't really want to go, so...

117
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,261
Listen, they're honoring
vets at tonight's game.

118
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:26,896
They're inviting
Cassidy down on the ice,

119
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,130
it's a whole thing.

120
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,725
Plus I might have told her

121
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,266
I'd help her win her husband back.

122
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:34,103
You... have

123
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:36,372
strange relationships with people.

124
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:40,109
Might be the nicest
thing you ever said to me.

125
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,911
Councilman.

126
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:44,318
Ah... there's the man that
stood me up for drinks.

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,753
Thank you for meeting me.

128
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:48,112
I'm really sorry about the other night.

129
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,793
I hate missing a good Scotch

130
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,694
and a healthy debate on gentrification.

131
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:54,497
Well, it didn't sit too
well with a few councilmen

132
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:57,700
that you obviously had
better things to do, but we

133
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:00,341
consoled ourselves with steaks
at Del Frisco's afterward.

134
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:03,640
Yeah...

135
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:06,943
Ah, excuse me, this is
my daughter's school.

136
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:09,746
Hello. Yes.

137
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,987
So, did you talk to my wife? She didn't?

138
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:21,191
Okay. Um, I will be right there.

139
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,262
Councilman, I'm so sorry, I have to go.

140
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:29,666
Um... my daughter had a panic attack.

141
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:46,512

- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

142
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:53,860
Okay. Two of the legs are now

143
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:56,396
officially attached. We
just have to find the others.

144
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:58,381
Where is the big pot?

145
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,721
I can't make lasagna
without the big pot.

146
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:03,270
Oh, baby, that's a problem,
because I-I'm starving.

147
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,138
And I think, I think
I might have forgotten

148
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,773
to pack the big pot.

149
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:10,444
How about an hors d'oeuvre
to tide you over, good sir?

150
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,279
- Thanks.
- Hmm?

151
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:17,158
Bon appétit.

152
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,793
Aw.

153
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:23,490
I hope the salmon's not chewy.

154
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,193
- No, it's good.
- Uh, it's okay if you don't like salmon,

155
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,494
you know, or are allergic.

156
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,863
I totally forgot to ask
about dietary restrictions.

157
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:31,431
Uh, I-I like salmon.

158
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,493
What do you think, guys?
Should I, uh, open the wine

159
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,838
and let it breathe before
Kev and Sophie get here?

160
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,747
Yeah. I'll open the
wine and let it breathe.

161
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:45,144
I forgot the dill garnish. Hold on.

162
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,503
Ah, yes. Because a garnish
will make it less crazy

163
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:48,537
that Kevin got married.

164
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:50,372
- Kate, come on.
- It's true.

165
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,313
I keep a list of things
to fix around the house

166
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:06,273
'cause my mom needs help
now that she's alone.

167
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,275
Oh, actually, she's not alone.

168
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:10,077
I'm here all the time.

169
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,948
All right, I got the garnish.

170
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:15,330
Oh, that reminds me.

171
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:17,318
I brought a housewarming present.

172
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,886
What?

173
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,221
Tonight.

174
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:22,823
Um, there's a story behind it.

175
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,292
Don't worry. It's...

176
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,431
What, d-does everybody hate hot sauce,

177
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,366
- or... ?
- No, no, no. Um...

178
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,069
It's just that, uh...

179
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,837
Jack used to put hot sauce

180
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:38,238
on everything.

181
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:44,478
Uh, my dad loved hot sauce, too.

182
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,971
So much so

183
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,182
that he brought a bottle
of it wherever he went.

184
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:51,886
Um, as a gift, but it
wasn't actually a gift.

185
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,655
He just wanted to make sure
he always had hot sauce.

186
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,757
Um, yeah, he put it on-on eggs

187
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,759
and put it on burgers.

188
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,762
Um, one time, he even put it on Froyo.

189
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,931
Yeah, after he died,

190
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:07,168
I started bringing it as a gift, too.

191
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,273
- Well, thank you.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

192
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:17,311
Oh, that must be them.

193
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:22,016
Hey. This is weird, right?

194
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,717
- Hi, Mom.
- Look at you guys.

195
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:25,186
Let's try to be supportive for Mom.

196
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:26,520
There they are.

197
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,688
Oh, my goodness!

198
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:29,156
Come on in. Come in.

199
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:33,160
Uh, wife, would you like to enter?

200
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,795
Yes, husband.

201
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:36,030
Okay.

202
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,734
This is how we enter buildings now.

203
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:42,203
- Okay.
- Yeah.

204
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:43,637
Now, that's weird.

205
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:45,940
Thank you.

206
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,816
You want to talk about it?

207
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:59,220
- 'Cause I know a thing or two about...
- Please, no.

208
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:12,533
You know, it's okay.

209
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,678
Happens to me, too.

210
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Sometimes it just comes out of nowhere.

211
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:21,075
Like when I have a lot of
stuff going on in my life.

212
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:28,152
I won't even know that
I'm feeling that way,

213
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:31,285
and then it just catches
up to me all of a sudden.

214
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:33,153
Hey, baby.

215
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,489
I left the studio right away.

216
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,759
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

217
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,928
The nurse said she had a
little trouble breathing

218
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,763
and a rapid heart rate.

219
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:45,800
Probably brought on by some anxiety.

220
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:49,436
Is that what's going on? Huh?

221
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:51,505
- Feeling a little anxious?
- I don't know.

222
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,340
- I guess.
- It makes sense.

223
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:56,477
There's a lot happening.
New school, friends.

224
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:58,879
You put a lot of pressure
on yourself with your grades.

225
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,649
- I think you get that from me.
- S-Stop.

226
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,817
Stop saying I'm like you.

227
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:06,487
I don't want to be anything like you.

228
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:17,031
Hey, don't you, uh, don't
you have one of those

229
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,066
Vietnam baseball hats you
could wear or something?

230
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,868
You know?

231
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:23,966
You know, it's not like it's a-a
concert we all went to, Kevin.

232
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,440
No, no, it's, it's... I'm just
saying, like, it would be nice

233
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:28,472
if other people could
recognize you for your service.

234
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,684
You know what I mean?
That's sort of what this whole thing

235
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:32,242
is all about.

236
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,444
- You know what would be nice?
- What's that?

237
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,702
If I could just drink,
like, ten beers in a row,

238
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:39,275
you know, just to get through this.

239
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:40,677
Relax. I'm kidding.

240
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,245
I prefer whiskey.

241
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:44,247
- You made it.
- Hey!

242
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,698
Hey, congrats on the whole,
uh, you know, your whole thing.

243
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,284
- Oh. I guess.
- Yeah.

244
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:52,555
Um, Matty's dad's coming
to the ceremony, so...

245
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:54,257
Oh, okay.

246
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:56,092
Shut up.

247
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:58,728
He's just being a good
dad. He's bringing his son

248
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:01,431
- to see people clap for his mom.
- Mom!

249
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:02,527
- Hey.
- Kevin!

250
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,223
- What's up, buddy?
- Hi, bud.

251
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,501
What do you say? Get me up high.

252
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,504
There it is. Nice vertical.

253
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:10,506
- Hi.
- Hey.

254
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:12,308
Thanks for coming.

255
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:14,177
Dad!

256
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:15,912
Dad, this is Kevin. Isn't he cool

257
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,766
- like I said he was?
- Nah, come on. You know what?

258
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,873
You buy a kid one Kit Kat.
Good to meet you, Ryan.

259
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:22,326
Ah, glad to finally meet the adult man

260
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,934
that my nine-year-old son keeps saying

261
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,169
is one of his best friends.

262
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,124
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

263
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:35,232
You really do have the strangest
relationships with people.

264
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,758
I couldn't find the fourth table leg,

265
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,394
so we're just gonna have
to eat on the strong corner.

266
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,850
Babe, you're already
cooking three babies

267
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,977
in your belly, okay? You
don't have to do this.

268
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,579
It's our first night in our new home,

269
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,981
and I want everything to be just right.

270
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:02,684
- Okay.
- Here.

271
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:05,687
- Start on your salad.
- Huh.

272
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,524
Hey, Kev.

273
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,693
You recognize the salad recipe?

274
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:15,695
It's Emeril Lagasse.

275
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:18,222
- Who?
- Emeril Lagasse, you know,

276
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,666
the chef that goes "Bam".
We watched him together

277
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,301
all last year.

278
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,503
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bam.

279
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,372
- Yeah. This is him.
- Yeah, totally.

280
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,773
Awesome.

281
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,180
So how come you guys got married?

282
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,715
Mm. It was a sign.

283
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:37,550
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm. Tell them.

284
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,719
So, I'm walking down
the street in New York.

285
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,587
- Mm-hmm.
- Beautiful day.

286
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,824
I'm thinking about how
lucky I am to be with Sophie,

287
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,064
and I look up and I happen
to be in front of a theater

288
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,495
playing The Princess Bride.

289
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,930
- Oh.
- Our favorite movie.

290
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,064
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

291
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,699
Yeah.

292
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,662
Oh, so, then, that was the sign...

293
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:56,726
No, not all of it.

294
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,338
No, no, no. Um, across the
street, there's a church

295
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,108
that starts ringing its bells
and, like, two seconds later,

296
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,334
- a street vendor walks up selling...
- Rings.

297
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:06,394
- Bracelets, but definitely jewelry.
- Yes.

298
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,748
Yeah. Um, and, yeah.

299
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:13,753
In that moment, I
just realized that, um,

300
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:17,256
I couldn't wait another second
to start our lives together.

301
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,858
So...

302
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,960
And how could I say no to that?

303
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,428
Aw.

304
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,996
You want to see the wedding photos?

305
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,298
Yes. Please.

306
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,457
Of course.

307
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,592
I picked up the camera at a Duane Reade

308
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,370
on the way to the courthouse.

309
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,206
Uh...

310
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,076
- Oh, Polaroids.
- Ooh, I want to see.

311
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,611
We did a lot of 'em.

312
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,212
Oh, I'll pass them around.

313
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,947
- I'll get it.
- Wow.

314
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,583
Hey.

315
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,552
Hi. What are you doing here?

316
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,555
Well, I didn't want you to have
to go through tonight alone.

317
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,626
So, just got your address off
your application and I, uh,

318
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:57,696
picked your neighbor's daisies
and, uh, here I am, so...

319
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,132
Oh. That's so romantic.

320
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,734
- Yeah.
- And a little creepy.

321
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,369
That's me, just all together.

322
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,037
Hey, Bug? Who is it?

323
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,206
You sure you want to do this?

324
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,108
Bug? Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

325
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,576
- Okay. Come on.
- Definitely.

326
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,398
Everyone, um, this is
my friend from work.

327
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,247
- Hi.
- Hi.

328
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,716
Oh, I'm Marc.

329
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,219
I'm... Kate's boyfriend.

330
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,621
Uh... yeah.

331
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,364
You, uh, you and Cassidy
go to a lot of games?

332
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,500
She must be fun at
the hockey games, huh?

333
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,502
- I've never been. I hate hockey.
- Yeah.

334
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,204
Yeah, yeah. Hockey sucks.

335
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,405
Just awful.

336
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,114
I'm out of here.

337
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:59,215
What do you mean? You're
not... the ceremony

338
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,259
hasn't even started yet.

339
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,318
Uncle Nicky. Hey.

340
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,530
- I don't feel good here, Kevin.
- Pardon me. Hey.

341
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,811
Where are you, where are you
gonna go? You gonna go to a bar?

342
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:08,791
No, I just need to be somewhere else.

343
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,761
- Well, let me go with you.
- No, alone.

344
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,196
I'm fine. Please.

345
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:19,774
Randall, you have to
call me back and tell me

346
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,513
when this present is getting here. Okay?

347
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,215
I'm trapped in my house
with a tiny sleeping baby

348
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,115
and a dog who has to pee.

349
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,886
There's just no way
that this grand gesture

350
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:27,911
is going to be worth it.

351
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:30,537
Call me back. Bye.

352
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:33,993
It's here? Oh, my gosh.

353
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,095
Okay.

354
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,832
Hi.

355
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,167
Are you my present?

356
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,303
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

357
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,305
- Oh...
- No, I came to see the baby.

358
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,274
Okay.

359
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:52,177
- Very cool.
- So, your favorite band

360
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,079
is called Modest Mouse?

361
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,382
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, wait a minute, is-is that a band

362
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,284
or a shy cartoon character?

363
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,343
No, it's actually from

364
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,780
- a Virginia Woolf short story.
- Uh, yeah. And, um,

365
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,357
and so, like, the lead singer,
uh, like, he got started

366
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,927
by recording just, like,
these crazy experimental songs

367
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:10,262
with a distortion pedal
on his answering machine

368
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,377
and stuff like that, so, you know...

369
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,627
- Uh-huh. Very cool.
- ... it's pretty cool.

370
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:15,861
- So cool.
- Yeah.

371
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,705
So, what do you guys think of Marc?

372
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,341
Oh, he seems like he's really
into obscure music facts.

373
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,077
That's kind of his job. Kevin?

374
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,079
Uh, yeah, he's too old for you.

375
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,782
- Definitely too old for you.
- Uh, he's 23.

376
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,917
Dad was six years older than Mom.

377
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,097
How do you guys not like him?

378
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,755
Okay? He was nothing but nice to you.

379
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,899
- I personally don't have a problem...
- I don't know, it's just a feeling.

380
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,327
Like that time Grandma
wanted us to try escargot.

381
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:44,263
You know, we didn't need to try
it to know we didn't like it.

382
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,027
Marc is escargot.

383
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:48,334
- What do you guys think about Beth?
- She's great.

384
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:51,303
- Yeah? Cool.
- No, actually, she's perfect.

385
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,329
She even has a beauty mark
on her eye. Didn't know

386
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,789
that was a thing until
now, but it's adorable.

387
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,160
- Unlike Marc.
- Kate, come on.

388
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,379
You want me to lie? I love Marc.

389
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,082
- He's my new favorite.
- You... no, no. You know,

390
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,983
I don't even care about that, Kevin.

391
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:06,418
You got married without
telling me. Okay?

392
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,478
- I'm supposed to be your person.
- You know what?

393
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,492
- It was spontaneous.
- I'm with Kate here.

394
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:12,691
- Polaroids?
- Hey. What's going on in here?

395
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,792
Kate's freaking out.

396
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,518
No, Kev, I'm not freaking out.

397
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,056
I'm just, I'm not gonna sit here

398
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:19,498
and pretend that your
ridiculous marriage is real.

399
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,202
Man, so, who are you, again?

400
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,504
I don't know, Kate,
what are we supposed to do?

401
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,439
- Stay here and be sad all the time?
- Hey, bro, come on.

402
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,130
- What? We're being honest, right?
- Guys, stop.

403
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,609
You are so selfish!

404
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,212
- Enough. Enough!
- We should have been at your wedding, Kevin.

405
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:36,148
It is our first night
as a family together

406
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,717
in our new house, and I have spent weeks

407
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,069
getting this place together
so that it would be perfect.

408
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:45,157
Because this is where we move forward.

409
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,126
This is where we sit around a table

410
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,694
with napkins and placemats

411
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,763
and laugh and celebrate
and eat Cornish game hens.

412
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:53,899
And so help me, God, that
is what we are gonna do:

413
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,970
move forward.

414
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,337
And it doesn't matter that I
didn't have the right size pan

415
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,213
and that the hens are
all squished together

416
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:03,299
and they're burnt on the
top and raw on the bottom.

417
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,511
It doesn't even matter that
Kevin doesn't remember Emeril,

418
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,714
or that I have four whole
Polaroids of your wedding.

419
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,984
So pull yourselves together,
pretend you like burnt raw food,

420
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,586
get your whiny little asses
back out in those seats,

421
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,256
and enjoy my damn dinner.

422
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:25,703
Babe.

423
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:27,705
Oh, no, no, no. Wait
for it, wait for it.

424
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:30,507
You're a genius.

425
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,642
Yeah. I know.

426
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,077
Here. I can help.

427
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:37,414
There we go. Look how nice that is. Huh?

428
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:38,848
What's that smell?

429
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,618
Did you clean the oven out?

430
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,253
I thought that you did.

431
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:44,754
What?

432
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,391
- Oh, God.
- Oh. Okay.

433
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:51,061
Jack.

434
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:53,296
Oh, man.

435
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,931
Wow, baby.

436
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,000
Still looks good.

437
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,803
Okay?

438
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,851
Can we get sick from this?

439
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,826
So good.

440
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:27,672
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand

441
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,733
as we honor Bradford
County's Heroes of the Game.

442
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:38,127
Please give a round of applause

443
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:42,932
for U.S. Air Force Second
Lieutenant Alan Ellis.

444
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,437
And U.S. Marine Corps Staff
Sergeant Cassidy Sharp.

445
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,542
Yeah!

446
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:03,457
And finally, let's show our support

447
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,888
for U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer

448
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,890
Jon Gutierrez.

449
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,860
Hey, can you tell
Cassidy I had to take off?

450
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,729
She can bring Matty home whenever.

451
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,155
We thank you for your
service and dedication

452
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,234
to our nation's freedom.

453
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:23,031
Yeah, she's been in
her room for an hour.

454
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,240
We got to go talk to her.

455
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,742
Let me see if grilled
cheese can get her to talk.

456
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,286
You know, she loves my grilled cheese.

457
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,287
_

458
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:38,132
You okay?

459
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,938
Yeah. I'm fine.

460
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:57,206
Growing up, I never
shared genetic traits

461
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,808
with anyone I knew.

462
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,478
And when you and I had kids,

463
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:05,314
I couldn't wait to see
what they got from me.

464
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:09,518
Would they have cute ears,
be able to roll their tongues?

465
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:15,891
Having anxiety and panic attacks

466
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:19,428
is the thing about myself
that I like the least,

467
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,764
and I passed it on to her.

468
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:27,036
I hate that I gave this to her.

469
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:43,452
What did the doctors say?

470
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:45,454
They want to keep him another night.

471
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:48,857
Um, see how he adjusts
to the medication.

472
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:52,861
This must have been
building for a while.

473
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,066
He feels things getting away from him,

474
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,400
and then he...

475
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:01,070
works really hard to rein 'em in.

476
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,939
Like more time at the
office, more time at the gym.

477
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,575
And then he just pushes himself

478
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:08,977
harder and further and...

479
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,481
I should have saw the signs.

480
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,151
I had a tell when I was young.

481
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:20,956
Really? You had anxiety, too?

482
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:26,729
Back then they didn't
have a name for it.

483
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,032
They said I was
"fragile" and "sensitive".

484
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,769
But when it was happening to
me, I thought I was gonna die.

485
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,973
My mother would help
me through it, though.

486
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:40,737
She'd fill a glass with
seltzer water and tell me

487
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:43,909
the inside of my mind was like
the bubbles bouncing around,

488
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,981
trying to get out.

489
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:48,751
And we'd watch together
until those bubbles settled.

490
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:50,886
Eventually, I would settle, too.

491
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:57,059
Beth, out of all the things
I could have passed down,

492
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,561
I hate to think that it was that.

493
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:16,482
Babe, come on, it's gonna be
perfect, it's gonna be perfect.

494
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:17,883
- All right?
- Mm.

495
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:19,818
All right? You know, I think the smoke

496
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:21,420
gave it a nice hickory flavor.

497
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:25,791
- Hickory lasagna.
- Hickory lasagna.

498
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,860
Mm-hmm.

499
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:29,561
Mm-hmm.

500
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:38,971
Hey, are, uh...

501
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:40,873
are you okay?

502
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:45,477
Am I trying too hard?

503
00:24:48,147 --> 00:24:49,681
Are we...

504
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,683
are we unfixable?

505
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:58,924
Maybe this loss is just...

506
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:00,792
Too big.

507
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:02,794
You know?

508
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,796
Uh, you know, those...

509
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:07,399
those sound like questions
that can only be answered

510
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,067
by the wine that I brought.

511
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,602
No.

512
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:13,038
I've barely had a drink in ten years.

513
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,523
Well, lucky for you, over the course

514
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:19,313
of the many, many boring
dates that I've been on,

515
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,480
I have learned a lot about wine.

516
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:24,349
Okay, fine.

517
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,085
Okay. Uh, this...

518
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:30,188
is a bottle of Brunello di Montalcino.

519
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:33,892
They call it the King of Italian wines.

520
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:36,228
It's a hundred percent Sangiovese grapes

521
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:39,831
grown only around the
Tuscan town of Montalcino.

522
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,067
- Montalcino.
- Montalcino.

523
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:44,036
Very good. Now, the region is so small

524
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:48,507
that they can't produce
a top vintage every year.

525
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:52,010
The ripening season has to be perfect.

526
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,346
And there's nothing they
can do if the weather...

527
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:55,981
won't cooperate.

528
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:59,184
Maybe this year is too
hot. This year's too cold.

529
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:00,752
They, uh...

530
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:04,423
... they have to be patient.

531
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:09,795
They have to wait out the bad years...

532
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:13,098
believing that there
is a better year coming.

533
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,271
And it always is.

534
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,710
Thank you.

535
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,246
- Now give me that wine.
- Okay.

536
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:38,122
Thanks for the ride.

537
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:40,791
- Yeah.
- I thought we'd be...

538
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,892
having dinner together
afterwards as a family.

539
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:46,931
I'm so stupid.

540
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:49,834
You can't just wish a
marriage into working out.

541
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:52,369
The truth is,

542
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,371
I don't think there's much to save.

543
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:55,673
Forget love.

544
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:58,108
I don't even think he likes me.

545
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:07,914
Hey. Come with me.

546
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,005
Mom, I don't want

547
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:10,373
- to talk about...
- Come on.

548
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,290
Hey.

549
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,925
- Hmm?
- I need you downstairs.

550
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:17,127
- Can it wait for just a s... ?
- Nope.

551
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:30,341
You two don't like this
thing you have in common.

552
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:31,809
And I get that.

553
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,210
It's scary.

554
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:35,411
But it also made three

555
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:38,080
of my most favorite people
in the world who they are.

556
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:42,785
William would also get
anxious about things.

557
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,559
He was...

558
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,957
sensitive and artistic and caring.

559
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,425
But there's a fine line
between caring and worrying,

560
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:54,651
and sometimes that line gets blurry.

561
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:00,781
From the moment I met your father,

562
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:03,620
he was obsessed with
making everything okay

563
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,543
for everybody else.

564
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:07,645
And that took some getting used to,

565
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,047
but I loved him for it.

566
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:12,750
'Cause it meant he cared deeply.

567
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:14,619
Now, there's some things
you get from your dad

568
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,087
that you're gonna have
to navigate around,

569
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:18,756
but there are some gifts, too.

570
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:20,858
You give everything your all.

571
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,727
You're an amazing sister

572
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:27,298
and daughter and friend and student.

573
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,333
Now, look, we're gonna
get whatever this is

574
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,569
under control, okay? Believe that.

575
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:35,328
But I will not have you talking ill

576
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:37,542
about three of my most
favorite people in the world.

577
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:39,610
No way, no how.

578
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:45,917
Are you hearing me?

579
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,823
And if it ever gets to be too much...

580
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:04,902
Mm-mm.

581
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:06,838
Just take a minute...

582
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,374
... and wait for the bubbles to settle.

583
00:29:14,947 --> 00:29:17,114
William.

584
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:25,957
Um...

585
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:29,390
last week Ashley wanted to know

586
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:31,829
if I thought DeShaun was hot.

587
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:34,866
I should have just come out then,

588
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:36,500
like I'd planned to,

589
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,369
but...

590
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,572
instead, I said yes.

591
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:45,577
And now it's gonna be a whole thing.

592
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,919
That's a lot.

593
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,790
But we can figure it out.

594
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,395
Thanks.

595
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,963
So, the night your father
and I moved into our house,

596
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,632
I made a fancy dinner, too.

597
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,899
And, of course, I ended
up burning the lasagna.

598
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,099
So we had to open the window

599
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,205
to let all the smoke out of the kitchen.

600
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:50,875
And just as we were sitting down to eat,

601
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:53,878
a bird flies in through the window.

602
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:55,479
Oh.

603
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,281
- Okay.
- Whoa!

604
00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:58,816
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

605
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,151
Now, the important detail

606
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,087
of this story is that your dad was

607
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:06,590
- terrified of birds, terrified.
- Terrified. Yeah, he was.

608
00:31:06,591 --> 00:31:07,723
So...

609
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:09,527
he runs out of the room...

610
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:11,880
- Hey, Jack? 
- and he runs back in

611
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:13,798
with a tennis racket

612
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,566
and a pillow case, and he goes...

613
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:17,368
Don't worry, I'll catch it.

614
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:22,773
He must have

615
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:25,209
freaked the bird out, because
then the bird starts...

616
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,612
diving at him and chasing
him around the room.

617
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,939
And your father made the
most ridiculous squealing sound

618
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,317
I've ever heard.

619
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:37,872
So he's trying to get away from the bird

620
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:40,958
and protect me, I guess,
with the tennis racket...

621
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:43,961
- Wait, where did it go? Where did it go?
- Right there. Look, look, look.

622
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:46,330
Jack...

623
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:51,235
And somehow we knock over the lasagna.

624
00:31:55,173 --> 00:31:56,774
Bec?

625
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:07,485
And we just started laughing.

626
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:11,822
And that's when it
became the perfect night.

627
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:16,060
When we just let it be what it was.

628
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:28,539
We need to be able to think
about him and not only be sad.

629
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:35,246
We need to be able to
talk about the hot sauce.

630
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,948
Right?

631
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:42,119
He was perfect the way
that dinner was perfect.

632
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,991
He made us... so happy.

633
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,993
And that's all I want for you guys,

634
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:52,029
is just for you to be happy.

635
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:58,269
Then, let's have a toast.

636
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,404
- Please.
- To happiness.

637
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:01,739
- To happiness.
- To happiness.

638
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,508
Oh, and to Kevin and Sophie.

639
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:05,509
Yes.

640
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,744
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

641
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:09,447
To Kevin and Sophie, cheers to that.

642
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:10,448
Salud.

643
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:15,119
All right, this meal was
disgusting. I admit it.

644
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,754
- Who's still hungry?
- Me.

645
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,355
- Me.
- Me.

646
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:21,125
Me, too. I am tru...

647
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,272
You can keep the change.

648
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:26,360
Thank you.

649
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:29,745
Pizza...

650
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:34,264
- I'll get his, uh, stuff.
- Thank you.

651
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:35,699
You got it.

652
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:38,535
- Hey.
- Hey.

653
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:44,332
Here you go.

654
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,944
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

655
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:48,622
You know, your wife was, uh,
she was being honored tonight

656
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:50,649
for her service at that hockey game.

657
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,319
Man, she was excited when she
found out you were showing up.

658
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,175
If you were gonna stand there
and stare at your phone all day,

659
00:33:57,176 --> 00:33:59,792
why'd you bother coming?

660
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:06,832
Okay.

661
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,801
That's good stuff, man.

662
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:12,437
I met her when I was 15.

663
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:16,608
I smashed into her in the hallway

664
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:19,745
As I was walking into biology class.

665
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:21,780
And I knew,

666
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:26,752
I knew before her books
even hit the floor,

667
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:28,954
I had just met my favorite person.

668
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:37,129
That, uh, that ceremony
that you're talking about

669
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:43,001
honored the thing that broke
my favorite person in the world.

670
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:50,263
I was staring at my
phone because otherwise

671
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:53,545
I would have started openly
weeping in front of my son,

672
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:56,548
and that's not what he
needs from me right now.

673
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:01,349
I'm sorry, man. I-I... I didn't know.

674
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,722
Stay the hell away from my wife.

675
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,960
He's out. I'll be back
for him on Thursday.

676
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:09,962
Yeah.

677
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,170
What?

678
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:21,840
He still likes you.

679
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:43,670
It's all right. I'm sober.

680
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:47,641
Okay.

681
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,380
I'm not a storyteller.

682
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:56,335
And I don't like people.

683
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:59,019
I-I don't even like
you very much, and, uh,

684
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,289
you're the closest person I've
been to in the last 20 years.

685
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:12,833
You know, your father wasn't the, uh,

686
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:15,202
first person to do this.

687
00:36:16,604 --> 00:36:19,182
Uh, he learned that
trick from his father,

688
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,441
uh, your grandfather.

689
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:23,410
That man was a bastard,

690
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:27,314
but every now and then...

691
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,149
he could be kind of fun.

692
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:35,589
Yeah. What he'd do was...

693
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:42,013
... he would fold down
the sides of the carton...

694
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:46,933
hmm... so that it looked
like a, like a big cake.

695
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:49,336
And then he'd then get a knife

696
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:54,441
and just wave it over the ice cream.

697
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:57,544
And he'd, he'd ask, uh,

698
00:36:57,545 --> 00:37:01,515
"How-how good a boy were you today?

699
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:04,184
Were you kind of good?

700
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:07,020
Or were you real good?"

701
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:09,623
And depending on the answer,

702
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:12,058
that was how big a slice you got.

703
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,841
So...

704
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:30,710
How good were you today, Kevin?

705
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:37,083
Um...

706
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:41,521
I think I annoyed my uncle today.

707
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:45,392
Other than that, I think I
was pretty good.

708
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:48,061
Well, then, you get

709
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:51,898
a pretty good slice of ice cream.

710
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:07,514
I've been very good.

711
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,361
Uh, I need to give you your wedding gift.

712
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:21,480
- I hope it's an air popper.
- Oh. I-I hope it's cash.

713
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:22,982
- Kevin.
- Excuse me.

714
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:27,100
- Oh.
- No, it is a song.

715
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:29,102
For the newlyweds.

716
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:31,727

The Princess Bride.

717
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:34,341

- Good.

741
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:55,755
I think that'll be
really helpful for her.

742
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:59,492
And... I found one for you, too.

743
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,629
I don't need a therapist.

744
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,003
I'm good. Best I've been in years.

745
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:06,633
But you've been working crazy hours

746
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:11,137
and running ten miles a day and
constantly bouncing that knee.

747
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:13,348
You know, you don't have to wait

748
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,275
for it all to come
crashing down to get help.

749
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:18,478
Glad to know you think I'm gonna crash.

750
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:20,961
You know, when you had
your first breakdown,

751
00:40:20,962 --> 00:40:23,149
you thought that was
gonna be the only one.

752
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,220
All these years of just managing
it and making lists, babe...

753
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:30,205
We have resources now
and people who are trained

754
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:32,192
to deal with this kind of stuff.

755
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,596
I appreciate your concern.

756
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:39,366
- But I'm fine.
- Okay, I am worried

757
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,529
that we are just one big
emotional thing from this...

758
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,670

What?

766
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:40,134
I was trying so hard to hold it together

767
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:42,262
that year after your father died.

768
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:49,502
And I wanted to believe so
badly that you kids were happy.

769
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:53,873
I'm so sorry I didn't
see what was happening.

770
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:55,842
I didn't see it, either.
