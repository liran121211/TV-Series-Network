Sorry I'm late.

888
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:48,096
Hey, Dej.

889
00:43:48,097 --> 00:43:49,796
Hmm?

890
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,666
What's happening with your face?

891
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:58,472
What? Um, nothing.

892
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:08,182
All right, here's the plan.

893
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:09,817
I'll take a break and
stay home with him.

894
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:11,684
- Or her.
- Okay.

895
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:16,424
Tobe, no matter what he says,

896
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:18,891
he's gonna have an
amazing, incredible life.

897
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:21,628
Yes, he will, because he has

898
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:23,796
an amazing, incredible
mother who's going to give him

899
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,688
all of her amazing, incredible traits.

900
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:28,101
His dad's not so bad.

901
00:44:28,102 --> 00:44:29,769
- Is he? Huh?
- Yeah.

902
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,239
Well, maybe his dad will
give him his sense of humor.

903
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,274
But please, God, please,
please, please, God,

904
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:36,109
not his hairline.

905
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,945
- (CHUCKLES)
- Grow some hair, please.

906
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:41,381
You crush it at the restaurant,
and if you can make it home

907
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,715
every once in a while to see him...

908
00:44:42,716 --> 00:44:44,317
- Or her.
- Okay.

909
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:46,586
Well, that's great,
but it's not required.

910
00:44:46,587 --> 00:44:49,054
- Okay, guys.
- (JACK FUSSING)

911
00:44:54,427 --> 00:44:56,394
So...

912
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,333
Nothing's really changed
since the last procedure.

913
00:45:01,334 --> 00:45:05,471
Jack is still not following
cues or responding to tests.

914
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,906
I know it's been a long three months,

915
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:10,442
but now it's time to move forward.

916
00:45:10,443 --> 00:45:13,145
<i>Jack's retinopathy will not be reversed.</i>

917
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:15,947
<i>His eyesight will not return.</i>

918
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:17,315
Okay, we're here.

919
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:21,987
DOCTOR: The good news is
it's not total stage V.

920
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:24,068
He will be able to see some light,

921
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:26,258
<i>maybe some shapes.</i>

922
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:27,958
Am I lined up?

923
00:45:29,028 --> 00:45:30,295
You're perfect.

924
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:31,763
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,

925
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:33,398
Jack Damon.

926
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:35,399
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

927
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:53,685
Hi.

928
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:56,420
<i>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CONTINUE)</i>

929
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,326
Good evening. Hello. Sorry to interrupt.

930
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:03,060
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

931
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:05,129
I would like to dedicate this song

932
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,666
to a man who was a total stranger

933
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,801
just a few weeks ago.

934
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,937
I may be only Pittsburgh good,

935
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,740
but, my God,

936
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:19,377
he makes me feel like one day,

937
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:21,346
I will stand

938
00:46:21,347 --> 00:46:23,414
on the biggest stage in the world.
