"This Is Us"...

00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:03,789
I take office
in the next few weeks,

3
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:05,288
and God only knows
what kind of effect

4
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,796
that's gonna have
on my family.

5
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:08,343
We're moving to Philadelphia.

6
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:10,656
This is my friend Deja.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,390
Hi, hi, hi, Deja.
Um, Malik.

8
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:14,843
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:18,140
I think I might like girls.

10
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,757
We love you.

11
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:22,010
No matter what, okay?

12
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:24,010
Hello?

13
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,881
All right, um,

14
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,162
hold on one second.

15
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,475
It's Uncle Nicky.
He got in trouble

16
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,976
<i>in Pennsylvania.
He's being arrested</i>

17
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:31,929
<i>and he gave them my number
for the bail money.</i>

18
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:34,693
<i>Nothing's really changed
since the last procedure.</i>

19
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:37,130
<i>Jack's retinopathy
will not be reversed.</i>

20
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:38,929

Happy end
of summer vacation,

24
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,562
- Ah.
- Babe. Thank you.

25
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,460
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

26
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,381
Next week,

27
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:58,482
those irritable
prepubescent monsters

28
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,196
are no longer our problem
between the hours

29
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:02,781
- of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
- Ugh. Right?

30
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:06,085
- Hmm...
- Mmm, I actually hated that high five.

31
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,312
Me, too.

32
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:10,234
Hey, babe, can we please
just do something fun today?

33
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,243
I feel like we haven't even seen
the kids all summer.

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,726
Yeah, that's because they're
going into seventh grade.

35
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:16,719
They want nothing
to do with us anymore.

36
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:18,781
You know, they actually think
we're dorks.

37
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:20,929
Like, me, a dork.

38
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:22,911
- I know.
- Me.

39
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:24,226
Okay.

40
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:28,070
Hey, kids?
Get in here!

41
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,257
Hey, why don't we go
to the pool?

42
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,536
We haven't been to the pool
in forever.

43
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:34,180
Well, I could do,
I could do a pool day.

44
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,617
- Right?
- Yeah.

45
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:39,476
- Good morning.
- Hey, you two, eyes up here.

46
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:40,906
- Take those off for a second.
- Hey!

47
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:43,992
Hey yourself.
Exciting announcement:

48
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,677
we're doing a Pearson family
fun day.

49
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:47,265
We're gonna go
to the Greenview pool.

50
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,671
Do we have to?

51
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,976
There's a 90210 marathon on.

52
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:52,453
Yeah, I'm good to stay here.

53
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,594
I want to knock out two more
books to make sure that I win

54
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,937
this summer's library
read-a-thon.

55
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:01,289
Can we go
to the Greenview pool?

56
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:03,725
- Please.
- You big mope, don't hold out on us.

57
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:05,454
- Please. Please.
- Please.

58
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,433
Okay.

59
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,554
Hey, Nicky, it's Kevin,

60
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:12,990
uh, again.

61
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,732
Listen, I-I left you,
like, five voice mails, man.

62
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,805
Um, I'm just trying to make sure
you're okay.

63
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:20,515
And I-I know you texted me last week
saying that you were okay,

64
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:22,108
which was a little urprising,
actually,

65
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:24,531
'cause I didn't realize texting
was in your wheelhouse.

66
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:26,343
But, um...

67
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:28,373
Listen, man, I guess I'm looking

68
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,626
for a little more detail,
you know?

69
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:32,675
Uh, seeing as I did wire you
all that money for bail.

70
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,382
So...

71
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,725
Would you please call me
back?

72
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,078
Just want to make sure
you're okay.

73
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,039
Bye.

74
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:51,157
So, good news: my houseplant
finally grew a new branch.

75
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,436
So... which, for those of you
who aren't regulars here,

76
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:58,037
uh, my sponsor suggested
that I get something simple

77
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,014
to take care of.

78
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:00,899
Said it would keep me
focused.

79
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,816
So I got a ficus.

80
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,657
A Ficus benjamina, to be exact.

81
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,289
And good on my sponsor,
because that plant

82
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,123
is basically the only thing
in my life

83
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,204
that I feel in control of
right now.

84
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:15,659
Yeah?

85
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,769
- Ready for you, Kevin.
- Okay.

86
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,194
<i>I've been just sort
of going through the motions</i>

87
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:23,532
<i>on this new movie
that I just finished.</i>

88
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,579
All right, Kev.
Last take.

89
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,100
Mind if we try
something different?

90
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:28,897
You just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

91
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,273
<i>All right,
don't let this guy hide.</i>

92
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,786
<i>He's alone. Let him not be okay
for a second.</i>

93
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:33,945
- Sound good?
- Great idea.

94
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:35,945
Okay, all right, here we go.

95
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,862
Everybody to one.
Let's go.

96
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:39,936
Set!

97
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:41,945
- And... background.
- Background.

98
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:45,813
- Action!
- Go, guys, go, cops.

99
00:03:58,565 --> 00:03:59,726
And cut.

100
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:01,825
- Fantastic.
- That's a cut!

101
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,979
Great.

102
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,030
- Hey, man.
- Hi. Thanks for the opportunity.

103
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:08,633
I really appreciate it.
That was fun.

104
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:10,156
And, uh, thanks
for being a good sport

105
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,815
about all
the "I see dead people" jokes.

106
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:13,139
Yeah, that never gets old.

107
00:04:13,227 --> 00:04:14,321
- I bet.
- Yeah.

108
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:15,785
All right.

109
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:17,657
- You know, when... Sit down.
- Yeah.

110
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:19,789
You know, when you strip away
all the artifice,

111
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:22,936
all those tricks you use
to make yourself seem

112
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:25,826
appealing and charming
and handsome...

113
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,829
When you let all that crap go,

114
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,774
you're absolutely
incredible.

115
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:36,367
And I am...

116
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,571
...way in over my head
with my sister

117
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,084
and her new son.

118
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,076
<i>He was born premature,</i>

119
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:46,853
<i>and we just found out
that he's blind.</i>

120
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,681
<i>So I go to all the doctor's
appointments with them,</i>

121
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,641
<i>but I never know
what to say.</i>

122
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:58,146
<i>I never know what to do.</i>

123
00:04:58,813 --> 00:04:59,886
So...

124
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,993
there's that.

125
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:10,319
Hey.

126
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,285
Just saw
the new windows going in

127
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:13,786
over at the community center.

128
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,100
Yeah.

129
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:18,520
Got some real nice
double-paned beauties.

130
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:21,826
Almost as beautiful as
my wife.

131
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:24,332
Did you just compare me
to rec center windows?

132
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,902
They're double-paned windows.

133
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,092
It's the sexiest kind
of windows.

134
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,775
- Okay. All right.
- All right, all right.

135
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,023
So these are
the paint options

136
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,216
for my dance studio. - - Mm.

137
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,816
- Right? Which one do you like?
- Hmm.

138
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:37,537
Silver Whisper,
of course.

139
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,254
But no studio today.

140
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:40,412
I got big things planned

141
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,279
for the last day
of summer break.

142
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,835
Everybody's been
so busy getting

143
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:45,363
settled in
these past few weeks,

144
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:46,918
so I'm thinking

145
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:49,340
a classic Pearson
family fun day.

146
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:50,776
I'm down.

147
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,199
But good luck
getting these girls on board.

148
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,795
I don't know
if it's the hormones

149
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,208
or the stress
of going to new schools,

150
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:58,846
but they are definitely
getting meaner by the day.

151
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,735
Stop it. They are not
getting meaner by...

152
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,152
Hey! There they are.

153
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,090
The flyest females in Philly.

154
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,726
You don't need to give us
nicknames every morning.

155
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,458
No, sometimes,
you could just be like,

156
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,506
"Good morning, Tess.
Good morning, Deja."

157
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,886
- Meaner by the day.
- Mom,

158
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,745
can you take me
to get my hair cut?

159
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,019
Yeah, I would,

160
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:18,996
but your dad has a classic

161
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:21,735
- Pearson family fun day planned.
- Ooh!

162
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:22,748
It's gonna be epic.

163
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,373
I'm talking Liberty Bell.

164
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:26,553
I'm talking gorging
on cheesesteaks

165
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,012
- till you get meat sweats.
- Mmm!

166
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,160
Mom promised that I can get my
hair cut before school starts.

167
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:32,942
That's why I've been
growing it out all summer.

168
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,996
And you promised me

169
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:36,067
that we could ride the bus
together so you could decide

170
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,786
if I can take it to school
by myself.

171
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:39,066
Even though

172
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:40,786
I've been taking the bus
by myself

173
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:42,701
since I was eight years old.

174
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,277
All right.
All right, how about this?

175
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,865
Dej, you and I
will do a trial run

176
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,441
of the bus route to school.

177
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,621
Beth, you take Tess
to the salon.

178
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,005
And then we'll meet up
for a classic

179
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,935
- Pearson family fun afternoon.
- Ooh.

180
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:57,855
Unless something horrible
happens on the bus.

181
00:06:57,942 --> 00:06:59,756
- Ooh.
- Would you stop? Do you hear this?

182
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,029
Annie, my favorite child,

183
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,530
is there anything
that you'd like to do today?

184
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,156
I'm good with whatever.

185
00:07:05,497 --> 00:07:06,586
Bless your soul.

There's my hungry dude.

00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,251
Yes.

193
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:23,731
Is he done? 'Cause I got
to squish that little face.

194
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,862
Yes, he is.

Okay, Jack,

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,122
I'm gonna hand you

197
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,214
- Okay. Okay.
- Here comes Daddy.

198
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:32,903
- Got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

199
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,004
- Okay.
- Okay.

200
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,442
There you go. You're okay.

201
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,662
You want to come up here? Hey.

202
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,075
- Aw.
- Hey, buddy. It's me, your dad.

203
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:46,543
All you have to remember
is that I am the hairy one.

204
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,575
Huh?
There... Yeah, see?

205
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,200
There it is.

206
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,146
Now...
how are you feeling?

207
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,661
- Good.
- About today?

208
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:57,974
Yeah, I'm excited.

209
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:01,239
I mean, according to Dr. Dorsey,
this woman is amazing.

210
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,307
And Yelp.

211
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:04,732
There are specialists

212
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,154
who teach you how to raise
a blind baby on Yelp?

213
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,152
Oh, there's everything on Yelp.

214
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:11,583
But I cannot wait to learn

215
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,505
- some pro tips. I need 'em.
- Yeah.

216
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,372
- Right, Baby Jack?
- Yeah.

217
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,911
Can you feel Mommy smiling?

218
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,654
She's so excited
to learn pro tips.

219
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,505
She's so excited.

220
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,122
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

221
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,271
Uh...
A week ago, we found out

222
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,841
that there is nothing we can do
about his vision,

223
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:34,482
and you haven't missed a beat.

224
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,865
Now, don't get me wrong.
That... I think that's awesome.

225
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:39,544
I'm just...
I'm just checking in.

226
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:41,216
- That's all.
- I'm so good.

227
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

228
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,569
And I appreciate it.
Thank you.

229
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,411
- Okay.
- Thank you. How are you feeling?

230
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:48,700
Uh... I'm hanging
in there, I guess.

231
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:51,450
- Good. Good.
- All right.

232
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,052

do you want to go play a game?

269
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,099
Mom, stop talking right now.

00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:27,198
Hey, Carrie.
Hey, Jessica P.

271
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:30,185
- Cool cover-up.
- Oh, thanks.

272
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,560
- Want to come hang out with us?
- Sure.

273
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,552
Hey, Katie girl,

274
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,553
- I-I got five chairs.
- Uh...

275
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:39,320
Do you know who that is?

276
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,490
Carrie and Jessica P.?

277
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:44,042
Yeah, the most popular girls
in school.

278
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,128
I don't think they've ever

279
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:47,177
talked to Kate
a day in her life.

280
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,591
Come on, you heard them,
they-they like her cover-up.

281
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,865
Yeah. I don't trust that.

282
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:53,521
Hey, babe?

283
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,074
- Hmm?
- You know, there is an upside...

284
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:56,247
Why don't you lay back...

285
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:59,425
To kids that want
nothing to do with us. Ah.

286
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,372
- Hey, Kev.
- Yeah?

287
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,530
If your uncle wants to talk,
he knows how to find you.

288
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:12,570
Right.

289
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,786
I... I think that you should be

290
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,950
staying focused
on your sobriety.

291
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,443
Working and keeping busy has
been a really good thing

292
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,964
for you, maybe you should try
looking for your next job.

293
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:23,763
Yeah, maybe.

294
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:27,128
Now, we did read
in The Hollywood Reporter

295
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:28,800
that you're on some short list

296
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,458
for that new movie
with, um... What's...

297
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,152
- Uh, Spike Jonze.
- Spike Jonze.

298
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,987
Okay, hold on a second,
you two are reading

299
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:35,933
The Hollywood Reporter?

300
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,215
Oh, yeah, we got a subscription

301
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:38,645
- when we moved here.
- Wow,

302
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:39,895
that's terrifying.
Yeah.

303
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:42,581
Anyway, um, the movie shoots
in Chicago, right,

304
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,549
so I'd have to leave,
then I'm thinking

305
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,183
it might be best for me
to just stay here and

306
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,726
- help Kate with the baby, you know?
- Yeah, I...

307
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,724
I just think it would be good
for you to stay busy,

308
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:52,692
is all I'm saying.
All right,

309
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:53,988
- are we ready for this?
- Yeah.

310
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,981
- Yeah.
- All right. Here we come.

311
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,143
Hello?

312
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,159
Hi.

313
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:02,726
- Hi.
- There's my grandson.

314
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,716
Hi. - Hi. -Hey.

315
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:06,726
- There you go.
- Wow. This place is really

316
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,717
- coming together.
- Thank you. -Yeah.

317
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,726
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, Toby, every time

318
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,083
I see you,
I-I swear you're skinnier.

319
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:14,217
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

320
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:16,161
You doing paleo or aikido or,

321
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,887
yeah, are you
intermittent fasting?

322
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:19,991
More like, uh,
intermittent stressing.

323
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,951
You know, what-what you do is,
for 22 hours a day,

324
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:23,934
you stress, uh, uh,
over your baby,

325
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,390
and you stress
about your mortgage, and then,

326
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,231
you just sleep
for the other two hours.

327
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:29,700
- Hmm.
- Yeah, the weight just falls off.

328
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,686
Too bad
it doesn't work for me.

329
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:35,067
I keep telling you,
you have to stress harder.

330
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,942
Ooh, I think that's Anna.

331
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,585
Come on.
Let's all go wash our hands.

332
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:39,896
- Yeah. - Oh, hey.
- Hey.

333
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:41,737
- Hey.
- How are you doing?

334
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:43,686
Good. Madison,
please don't do the voice.

335
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:45,030
- Okay.
- Listen,

336
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,696
I... I'm great, Jack is great.

337
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,857
Today, we're just gonna
keep things very light.

338
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,856
- Right? And positive.
- Okay. Okay.

339
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,777
- Okay.
- I am... I am so your girl.

340
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:55,663
I was head cheerleader
in high school,

341
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,176
and I was one
of those bar mitzvah

342
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:58,608
party starters in college.

343
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,077
If there's anyone
who can keep things peppy,

344
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:02,777
you're looking at her.

345
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,663
I know you guys have been
through a lot

346
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,633
over the last couple months, but

347
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:09,452
today is about the next chapter.

348
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,482
Today, we're going to go over
the basics of how to care

349
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,561
for your blind infant,
to make sure

350
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,129
he has everything he needs
physically and developmentally.

351
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:20,631
Great. Great. Right?

352
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:22,655
We're so eager to learn.

353
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:26,495
What? Oh, you want
to take notes, Jack?

354
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:27,688
Oh.

355
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:29,918
He wants us to take the notes.
He's just gonna listen.

356
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,272
He's just gonna listen, right?

357
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:35,335
Ha! Too funny.

358
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:36,980
Okay.

359
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,215
Uh, so, first question.

360
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:41,411
- I know this is a new house.
- Mm.

361
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:43,043
Are you happy
with the furniture

362
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,085
- and where everything is?
- Uh...

363
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,366
Why? Are you
an interior designer, too?

364
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:49,475
I ask
because Jack is already starting

365
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,485
to absorb the layout
of the new home.

366
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,256
So, if the furniture stays put,

367
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:55,989
then it makes it easier
for him to learn each room.

368
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,372
- Mm.
- Different floor textures help, too.

369
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,608
Uh, carpeting in one room,
tile in the next.

370
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,867
That's smart.

371
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:07,667
Okay, so, I'd like
to start with an activity.

372
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:10,826
We will all take a notepad,
choose a room, and write down

373
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,538
anything you think
might be dangerous

374
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,952
or of concern to Baby Jack
once he starts to crawl.

375
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,389
What are we doing for you today?

376
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:26,168
I was thinking
something like this.

377
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:29,131
Oh, bold! I love it!

378
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,717
Here. Let me clean up my station,
and I'll come grab you?

379
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,514
Hey.

380
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,350
Are you sure about this?

381
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,805
Yup.

382
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,572
Okay.

383
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,460
As long as you're sure.

384
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:43,676
I mean, I-I want you
to express yourself,

385
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:47,004
you know, I really do, but this is...
this is a big decision.

386
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:50,483
I know, which is why you've made
me think about this all summer.

387
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,373
Can you just...?

388
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,869
So, this is what a bus is like.

389
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:02,686
I've been on a bus before, Dej.

390
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,668
I know this is important to you.

391
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:05,806
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around it.

392
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:08,153
- So, humor me here, okay?
- Okay.

393
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,090
Well, how about
we don't sit together

394
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:13,686
so you can see what it'll really
be like for me riding it alone?

395
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,065
It's a good idea.

396
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:18,096
Mm-hmm.

397
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,837
<i>I told you all the good stuff.</i>

398
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:32,883
<i>I told you all the good stuff.</i>

399
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:36,237
<i>I told you
all the good stuff, Grayson.</i>

400
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:47,823
People get buried
in their phones.

401
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,806
When I was growing up,

402
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:51,826
if you weren't home,
they didn't get a hold of you.

403
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:53,737
Frankly, I think people
get a hold of you

404
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:55,706
too easily nowadays.

405
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:01,787
I'd like to disappear
every now and then.

406
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,826
Excuse me.
Can I sit next to my daughter?

407
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:08,315
Yeah. All right.

408
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:16,410
What was he talking to you
about?

409
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,824
The Democratic primary.
I don't know.

410
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:22,544
Randall, he was a weirdo.

411
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:24,896
The bus is full of weirdos.

412
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,874
But I can handle myself.

413
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,879
Why do you even care
about riding the bus so much?

414
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:35,504
It's faster if I drive you.

415
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,947
You moved us here.

416
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:39,056
You wanted me
to live in Philadelphia,

417
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,676
so let me live in Philadelphia.

418
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:44,275
I am letting you live, Deja,
but I am also your father.

419
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:45,787
Okay, you're right,

420
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:49,535
but I also had a whole life
before I met you.

421
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:52,616
We grew up real different,
Randall.

422
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:55,134
The stuff
that makes you uncomfortable

423
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,837
reminds me
of where I'm from.

424
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,797
I get it.

425
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:02,261
But it is my job
to worry about you.

426
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,346
And you're only in
the ninth grade, and I'm just

427
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,716
not comfortable with it yet,
so maybe next year, okay?

428
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,720
Unbelievable.

429
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:18,029
M.C. Hammer is mad old.

430
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:19,597
Okay, I got one.

431
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,043
Which member of Kris Kross
do y'all think is cooler?

432
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:23,519
Definitely Kross.

433
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,863
Neither of them
are named "Kross," Randall.

434
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:28,923
I know.
I was making a joke.

435
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:31,129

How is your brother
blacker than you, Randall?

456
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,824
Randall's an Oreo!

457
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,072
I don't know what that is.

458
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,168
- Hey, is that your mom?
- Hi, ladies.

459
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:32,941
How are you?

460
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,238
Hi!

461
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:38,402
I just... I wanted
to see if maybe

462
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,129
you wanted to go swimming
with Dad and I?

463
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:41,762
Or play a little Marco Polo?

464
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,472
Um, I'm gonna stay here.

465
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,459
Okay.
Hey, Bug, um...

466
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:52,418
Have those girls ever wanted to
hang out with you before today?

467
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:56,103
I mean, I just want to make sure
that you're having fun, and...

468
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:58,760
Can you just go back
to Dad, please?

469
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,316
Yes.

470
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,074
You are looking very trim, Toby.

471
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,340
Yeah. Breastfeeding.

472
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,422
Burns calories.

473
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,342
- Ah.
- Yeah.

474
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:27,285
How are you holding up?

475
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:30,105
Honestly?

476
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,246
Hanging on by a thread.

477
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:33,408
Yeah.

478
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,884
I have... I've just...
I've never worried

479
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,712
about so many things
all at once.

480
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:40,739
Is one of those things Kate?

481
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:45,689
You know, a few months ago...

482
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:51,410
...when we found out
that, uh, something was wrong,

483
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,691
I remember
the new eye doctor coming in

484
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,269
and telling us that...
Jack wasn't responding

485
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:01,230
- to visual cues.
- Mm.

486
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:04,871
I remember him saying the word
"retina."

487
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,707
And then,
everything just kind of went,

488
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,472
"Wah-wah, wah-wah,
wah-wah."

489
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,066
You know, Charlie Brown's
mother, just noise.

490
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,058
And I look over,

491
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:19,705
and Kate is sitting up
real straight.

492
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,245
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, like when she...

493
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:22,949
when she really locks in
on something,

494
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:25,158
and she is nodding.

495
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:31,168
My amazing wife just...
nodding her head

496
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:34,761
as if someone is giving her
a bad weather report.

497
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:39,597
And she's, uh...

498
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,418
She has been that way
every single day since.

499
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,449
You know, just steady.

500
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,668
To be honest,
I'm kind of in awe of her.

501
00:20:57,902 --> 00:21:00,746
So I shouldn't be concerned?

502
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,683
She's overeating, Rebecca.

503
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:08,886
And I know that
that is just a way of...

504
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:11,433
dealing with difficult emotions.

505
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:16,691
But of all of the things that
I am worried about right now...

506
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,316
she's at the top of my list.

507
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,144
You know?

508
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:37,015
I know.

509
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:40,752
Yeah, I do know.

510
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:51,884
Hey, pretty lady.

511
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:53,306
What you sitting out here for?

512
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,931
Oh. Hey, guys.
How was the...

513
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,634
bus?

514
00:21:57,746 --> 00:21:59,860
I was gonna say,
"How was the bus?"

515
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,141
Yeah.

516
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:03,118
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

517
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:05,321
and say the bus ride
did not go well.

518
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,571
A man sat next to her,

519
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,313
I freaked out
and forbade the bus.

520
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,501
- Oh.
- So...

521
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:13,181
Deja's not too thrilled with me.

522
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,692
I'm gonna go out
on that same limb

523
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,149
and say that the haircut
didn't go so great, either.

524
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:21,478
- It did not.
- Mm.

525
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:27,884
She's just gonna look
so different, you know?

526
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,399
My little girl.

527
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,290
I love her hair.

528
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:34,821
I love when people say
that we look alike.

529
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:38,110
But, I don't know,
first it's the new haircut,

530
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:40,016
and then it's clothes, and...

531
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,126
before long the little girl
I knew like the back of my hand

532
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:44,993
is someone completely new,

533
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,251
and it just...
makes me so sad.

534
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:51,048
They're changing so fast.

535
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:54,259
I remember
when I was their age.

536
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:02,177
There was so much going on
in my brain.

537
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:06,498
And I'm talking real,
complicated adult stuff.

538
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,404
I hope moving to Philadelphia
was a good idea.

539
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:20,107
I know it's gonna be.

540
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:21,632
Hey, guys.

541
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:29,136
I-I know it's really different.

542
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,271
You know, I couldn't...
really picture it before,

543
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,323
but now that I see it...

544
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,935
baby, you never looked
more beautiful.

545
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:40,794
Really?

546
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,310
I love it.

547
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,193
- I love it.
- Me, too.

548
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:48,050
All right, come on,
we gotta get

549
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:51,536
our classic Pearson
family fun afternoon on.

550
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,068
All day today!

551
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,115
Hey! You ruined it!

552
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:00,801
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

553
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:02,491
- That's why!
- No!

554
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:06,310
- I'm not!
- Hey! - Yes, you are!

555
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:07,639
- No, I'm not!
- Hey, stop! Stop!

556
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,521
Both of you, stop!

557
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,044
- What's going on, huh?
- Nothing.

558
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,855
Nothing?

559
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,068
We were just roughhousing.

560
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,122
- So you're good?
- Yeah.

561
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:23,154
Yeah, we're fine.

562
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:25,318
All right.

563
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:40,294
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends,

564
00:24:40,382 --> 00:24:41,786
and you liked doing it.

565
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,083
You're supposed to be
my brother.

566
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:05,662
Hey. What's up?

567
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,957
Oh, they want to meet with me?

568
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,154
Oh, well, that's great.
That's great.

569
00:25:12,242 --> 00:25:15,262
Tomorrow?
Uh, well, tomorrow,

570
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,489
that means I'd have to get
on a flight tonight.

571
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,694
Uh...

572
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,731
just let me think about it,
okay?

573
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:24,911
Thank you.

574
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:38,201
...53 sharp corners
and four electric cords.

575
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:38,966
Mm.

576
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:41,846
♪ And two turtledoves... ♪

577
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:45,310
And a partridge in...
a pear tree, hmm?

578
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:46,482
Okay.

579
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:50,081
Any hanging cords
that a baby can pull down,

580
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,692
we also want to avoid.

581
00:25:51,864 --> 00:25:54,138
Yeah, we are all over
the electrical cords.

582
00:25:54,226 --> 00:25:56,325
And we have someone coming
to, uh,

583
00:25:56,414 --> 00:25:58,052
wall-mount that bad boy
next week.

584
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,638
I know we splurged a little.

585
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,255
We just wanted a great TV.

586
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:03,044
You know, have little Jack

587
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:05,343
starting to watch the Steelers
really young.

588
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:11,768
Yeah, and you'll
just explain to him

589
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:14,542
everything that's happening...
like you did with me.

590
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:17,567
Absolutely. Absolutely.

591
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,122
Mm-hmm.

592
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:22,591
Yeah, I'll just, uh,
narrate, and then he'll...

593
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:24,341
understand.

594
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,997
I'm sorry. I promised myself
that I wouldn't do this.

595
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:32,373
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm really sorry.

596
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,864
Just give me a second.

597
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,431
Please don't follow me.

598
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,548
Okay.

599
00:26:58,709 --> 00:26:59,873
Hey.

600
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,446
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

601
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,349
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay. Look, it's...

602
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:09,212
Relax, man, I'm trying
to have a moment with you, okay?

603
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:18,814
Am I a good person?

604
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,892
You know you're
187 days old today, Jack.

605
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,329
So, you know,
it's pretty important.

606
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,503
You know
how I know that?

607
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:34,290
Because I am
187 days sober today.

608
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,758
Which...

609
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:41,920
seems like an absolute eternity
when you're trying not to drink,

610
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:43,236
but I look at you, and...

611
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,314
it doesn't seem
like any time at all.

612
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,329
You're so...

613
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,900
new.

614
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:52,560
Not me.

615
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,806
I'm a year away from 40...

616
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:01,101
40 years old, and the most
successful relationship

617
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:04,077
I have in my life is
with a frickin' house plant.

618
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,001
Yeah, of course I think
you're a good person, Kev.

619
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,415
Why?

620
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,785
I do so many bad things.

621
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:26,282
Look...

622
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:27,947
you and me...

623
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,423
we come from a long line
of Pearson men

624
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,743
who've got a lot of...
mixed-up stuff

625
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:36,845
inside of us.

626
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:40,376
I should just take
that movie in Chicago.

627
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:43,501
Just take another movie,
you know, stay busy.

628
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,650
Focus on being clean.

629
00:28:45,738 --> 00:28:47,079
That's...

630
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,759
the important thing.

631
00:28:50,035 --> 00:28:52,179
And it's much easier on set,
anyway.

632
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:55,021
I mean, the director tells me
to do something, and I do it.

633
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,045
He says, "Smile," and I smile.

634
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,459
He says, "Laugh," and I laugh.

635
00:29:00,547 --> 00:29:02,311
He says, "Cry," and I cry.

636
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,550
And then he yells, "Cut!" and...

637
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,724
...and it's just me again.

638
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,529
I think that's the problem.

639
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:24,107
Hey, you want to know
what worked for me?

640
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,709
Hmm?

641
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,037
Having people
you care about.

642
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,873
People you want
to take care of.

643
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:37,045
That will turn you into the man
that you want to be.

644
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,397
But the fact that
you're already asking

645
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,438
these kind of questions...

646
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,326
that's a good sign.

647
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:47,897
Okay.

648
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:49,514
Thanks.

649
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,021
Hey.

650
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:01,217
Hey.

651
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:02,850
How long were you, uh...?

652
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:04,725
Just for a few seconds.

653
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,176
- Oh.
- But I heard

654
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,108
everything else
on the baby monitor.

655
00:30:09,037 --> 00:30:10,958
Aw, come on.

656
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:21,037
Are you okay?

657
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:24,357
Everyone's worried about you.

658
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:25,912
Mm-hmm.

659
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,748
I know.

660
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,318
You know,
so many doctors warned me.

661
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:39,232
So many doctors told me
not to have a baby.

662
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:44,303
Told me...

663
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:47,425
...about the risks,
but I decided to...

664
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,795
do it anyway.

665
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,375
It's hard not to feel
like it's my fault.

666
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,717
- Kate, come on...
- No.

667
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:57,131
Let me wallow.

668
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,148
Why does he cry every time
I go to pick him up?

669
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:11,311
Am I doing something wrong?

670
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,373
No.

671
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:15,834
- No.
- He, like, loses his mind

672
00:31:15,922 --> 00:31:18,217
every time
I go to pick him up. I...

673
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:20,365
- Oh.
- I don't think he likes me.

674
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:22,545
No, no, no, no, no.
He likes you fine.

675
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,647
You just,
you have to warn him first.

676
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,311
Right? Because he can't see you,
so you have to...

677
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,371
You got to brace him
for what's coming.

678
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:32,178
Right? So then you just,

679
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:35,010
- you narrate what's happening.
- Okay.

680
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:36,967
Right? So all the baby stuff

681
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:39,092
- that you normally do with your face...
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,943
...it's with your voice
and with your touch.

683
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:43,380
- Oh.
- Yeah.

684
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,975
Right? Okay.

685
00:31:45,643 --> 00:31:47,100
Hey, buddy, it's your mama.

686
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,764
Can you feel my hand?

687
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:52,096
Okay, I'm gonna pick you up now,
okay?

688
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:54,940
Okay, bud?

689
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,768
Okay.

690
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,518
Oh, my goodness. Hi.

691
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:00,557
Come here.

692
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:01,932
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

693
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,883
Okay, I'm gonna give you
to Uncle Kev, okay?

694
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:07,315
You're gonna love him.

695
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:09,424
And he always smells
really expensive.

696
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,214
I got you.

697
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,573
So I'm your Uncle Kevin.

698
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:16,089
Yeah.

699
00:32:16,177 --> 00:32:18,060
I'm gonna teach you
how to pick up girls.

700
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:20,061
We're gonna do that.
Or boys.

701
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:23,385
Or robots, if that's what people
are into in the future.

702
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:25,528
Oh, this is great.

703
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,682
Hey. Hey.

704
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,096
Oh, he's perfect.

705
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:34,237
Cliff really said
he wanted to kiss me?

706
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:36,469
Yes. Just go behind
the snack shack

707
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:38,503
and he'll meet you
back there.

708
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:42,588
Okay.

709
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:52,690
Hey, Kate.

710
00:32:53,092 --> 00:32:54,975
Stewart?

711
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:58,074
Oh, Stewart.

712
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,185
Who did you think
it was gonna be?

713
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:03,221
Cliff Ward.

714
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:05,944
Who did you think
I was gonna be?

715
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:08,510
You.

716
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:14,633
We can just stand here
for a minute

717
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,635
and they'll all leave.

718
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:18,135
Okay.

719
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,002
You know what?

720
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:25,979
No.

721
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:41,666
Okay, so tell me about this
movie offer in Chicago.

722
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:43,745
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna
take it, though, you know?

723
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:46,400
I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna
stay here with you guys.

724
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,992
'Cause I'm so helpful.

725
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:52,153
I wish that you would have

726
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:55,150
as much compassion for yourself
as you do for me.

727
00:33:57,092 --> 00:33:58,289
Go to Chicago.

728
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:01,074
Do this movie.
Focus on your sobriety.

729
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,916
You're gonna be Jack's uncle
for your entire life.

730
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:06,119
And he's gonna need you
at your best.

731
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,368
He's the luckiest kid
in the world

732
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:14,212
to have you as a mom,
you know that?

733
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,812
Aren't you?
Do you know that?

734
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:20,650
Let me look at you.

735
00:34:20,738 --> 00:34:21,731
Ah.

736
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:24,885
Oh, you're gorgeous.
You're gorgeous.

737
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:28,299
Okay.

738
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:30,603
So here's what's up.

739
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:32,978
I know this is all new

740
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:34,830
and I know
that everyone is worried

741
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:36,799
about us and about me.

742
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,673
Jack can't see,

743
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,634
but he can hear, he can sense,
he can feel.

744
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:43,999
And I don't want worry

745
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,744
to be the prevailing feeling
in this home.

746
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:47,676
I want it to be hope.

747
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,695
I mean, we spent the entire day
being worried about

748
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:53,783
what we have to limit around
here in order to protect him.

749
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,789
That's just not how we roll
in this house.

750
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:57,471
No... No offense, Anna,
I'm sorry.

751
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,367
I know that's like

752
00:34:58,455 --> 00:34:59,938
- a monster part of your job.
- It's all good.

753
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:02,517
Okay.
My son is gonna live

754
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:03,853
a life without limits.

755
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,986
I know my family
can't give him sight,

756
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,956
but they can damn sure
give him that.

757
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:10,752
So... who's in?

758
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:15,765
Well, you had me at,
"Okay, so here's what's up."

759
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:17,084
Mom?

760
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,627
Of course I'm in.
Of course.

761
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:22,666
I know that w-we're all
trying to have a family moment,

762
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,297
but he... this is a... his, uh,
pants are a disaster right now.

763
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:27,408
He's... That's foul.

764
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:28,496
Oh.

765
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:30,971
Did he just laugh?
Did you just laugh?

766
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:42,573
- We really have to do this?
- Yes, we have to.

767
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:43,928
And we're gonna do
a thing first,

768
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:45,895
so settle in.

769
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:48,489
Uh, there's no denying it.

770
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:50,225
You three are getting old.

771
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:53,214
Old as dirt.
So I think it's time,

772
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:55,489
uh, we let you girls in
on a little game

773
00:35:55,577 --> 00:35:57,114
your mother and I play.

774
00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:59,645
It's called
"Worst Case Scenario."

775
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:00,825
- No.
- Ah.

776
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,746
Now, the rules are simple.

777
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:05,606
We all go around and we say
"worst case scenario,"

778
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:09,213
and then our biggest fears
as to the worst possible way

779
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,225
our lives could go
from this move.

780
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,457
Now, if you don't want to go,
you don't have to, but...

781
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:14,942
Worst case scenario:

782
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,918
Randall never gets over himself

783
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:19,044
and I have to spend
the next four years

784
00:36:19,132 --> 00:36:21,411
trapped in my room
like Rapunzel.

785
00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:23,661
Wow. That was good.

786
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:25,411
I'm a fast learner.

787
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:26,532
My turn.

788
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,755
Worst case scenario:

789
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:32,122
Tomorrow when Deja takes
the bus to school, she forgets

790
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,817
to text me the moment
she arrives,

791
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:36,942
and then I'm forced to ground
her until she turns 18.

792
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:38,275
W-W-Wait.
You're gonna let me...

793
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,481
A text the moment
you get to school.

794
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:42,122
Every single day.

795
00:36:42,419 --> 00:36:43,716
Yes, sir.

796
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:46,122
All right, worst case scenario.

797
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:51,075
Um, that I project
my own stuff

798
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:52,966
on to you girls,
making you feel

799
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:55,698
anything less than your
wonderful, beautiful,

800
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:58,332
wildly unique selves.

801
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,942
Tess.

802
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:03,114
I don't have one.

803
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:04,395
Nothing?

804
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:06,598
Nope.
Philly looks good on me.

805
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:08,848
Worst case scenario:

806
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,591
All of my friends back home
forget about me.

807
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:15,411
Wow, babe. Have you been worried
about that?

808
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,747
Why didn't you say
anything sooner?

809
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:20,008
I'm just messing with you.

810
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:21,153
All right.

811
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:22,583
So...

812
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,559
We ready to do this?

813
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:27,848
Last one up the steps is

814
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,081
- buying cheese steaks.
- Wait! - Wait! - Wait!

815
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:30,674

Mm.

826

he's a good person.

827
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,807
- What?
- Yeah.

828
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,399
What did you tell him?

829
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,823
Something... Something about
complicated men.

830
