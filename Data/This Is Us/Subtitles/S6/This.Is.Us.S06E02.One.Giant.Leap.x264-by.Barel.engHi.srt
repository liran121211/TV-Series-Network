00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:09,582
This dress is not too much. I love it.

356
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:15,554
I love you.

357
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,177
I don't know whether to
keep you here or show you off.

358
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:23,571
-Show me off.
-[both giggle]

359
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:28,394
I seem to remember you having a brother, Nicky.

360
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,741
Yeah, Jack. He's dead.

361
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,399
He was my husband.

362
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,552
And he was Miguel's best friend,

363
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:37,610
but he didn't, he didn't snake his widow.

364
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,788
I see.

365
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,304
I think.

366
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:44,401
Nicky, help me.

367
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,085
It's so long ago.

368
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:48,395
Where did we meet?

369
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,624
At the vet's.

370
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:54,765
Ah, okay.

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,112
We worked together one summer

372
00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:00,667
at the veterinarian clinic in Pittsburgh.
-Yes

373
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:03,947
In June... of 1969.

374
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:07,157
And you were wearing a long,

375
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:09,055
red floral dress.

376
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:14,673
And I sort of asked you out on a date,

377
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:17,700
which we spent in the back of your...

378
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,100
Volkswagen van

379
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:22,613
you named Pearl.

380
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,051
And you, uh...

381
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,839
You deflowered me

382
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,491
under a moon

383
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,559
that men had just walked upon.

384
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,160
Oh, my God.

385
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:40,650
Yes.

386
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:44,516
Yes, it's all coming back to me now.

387
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,030
The moon.

388
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,346
Your parents.

389
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:50,694
-Salisbury steak. [laughs]
-[laughs]

390
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:52,006
Oh, gosh.

391
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,835
For a minute there I thought I had

392
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,217
early onset Alzheimer's.

393
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:58,115
Or not just early.

394
00:19:58,116 --> 00:19:59,531
Plain old Alzheimer's.

395
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,878
-[laughs]
-ERIC: Deflowered, huh?

396
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:06,107
Seems my wife defoliated much of the northeast.

397
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:08,263
You reaped the rewards.

398
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:10,207
ERIC: Oh, she could teach a master class.

399
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,370
SALLY: Ah. Cheers.

400
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,234
MIGUEL: This meal is excellent.

401
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:17,203
You know, Rebecca has a
cold asparagus soup recipe.

402
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:19,758
JACK: Perfect end to a perfect day.

403
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,455
[chuckles]

404
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:25,421
I'm gonna get one of these sometime.

405
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:26,408
Someday.

406
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,387
I mean, after we buy

407
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:31,079
a sensible family car, of course.

408
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:33,496
You know, maybe like a midlife crisis purchase.

409
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,291
-Just warning you.
-[laughs]

410
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,021
I always thought the wind in
my hair would be overrated,

411
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:44,576
but it is properly rated.

412
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:50,722
A car like this can make a person feel immortal.

413
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,861
I don't need a car to feel that.

414
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,940
I got you.

415
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:02,387
I'm not even a cold soup guy,

416
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:05,217
but hers is just some...

417
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:07,599
I do have Alzheimer's.

418
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:12,815
Yeah, I have, um,...

419
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:15,779
plaques forming on my brain,

420
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:19,570
and no amount of medications or...

421
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,889
word exercises will cure me.

422
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:23,925
First goes the short-term memory,

423
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,535
and then the longer ones, one by one.

424
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,999
Or is it... a thousand each day?

425
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,589
I don't even know.

426
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,171
Sometimes I think about...

427
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,267
what my very last memory will be

428
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:41,443
before the candle goes out.

429
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,398
I am so embarrassed.

430
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,711
Rebecca, I'm sorry. I-I had no idea.

431
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:53,299
No, no, no, you wouldn't know.

432
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:57,101
You would think that this diagnosis

433
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:59,478
would help me sweat the small stuff less,

434
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:02,101
but not really.

435
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:04,310
I just, this morning,

436
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:07,417
rolling out the garbage cans
before we left was something

437
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,557
that kept nagging at me.

438
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,904
Even during this dinner, this strange dinner,

439
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,079
I thought about them.

440
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:15,657
You'd think

441
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:18,428
that we would stop sweating the small stuff

442
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,430
as we got older, when

443
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:25,670
bigger things started happening to us, but nope.

444
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:29,922
Not the case.

445
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:33,842
It's so strange, isn't it?

446
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:38,980
ERIC: The deck.

447
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:43,802
I-I worry about the deck we-we built out back.

448
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:45,610
Um...

449
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,493
it was built without permits,

450
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,080
and I'm afraid it's gonna collapse,

451
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,151
or the city's gonna find out
and, you know, come after me.

452
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:55,524
It's stupid, I know, but I wonder

453
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:59,158
how many, uh, months I've spent

454
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:01,989
thinking about that day.

455
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:06,577
I still look at my hairbrush in the morning,

456
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:08,653
looking for fallout.

457
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,275
It's kind of my signature thing, my hair.

458
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,173
You have great hair.

459
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,451
-MIGUEL: You, too, Nicky.
-Thank you. -[Sally chuckles]

460
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:19,977
I've only lost, like, seven strands in 30 years.

461
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:24,395
But still, I worry that I'm
gonna lose all my hair.

462
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,865
The years that I have lost

463
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,056
worrying about something that never happened.

464
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:33,381
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

465
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:37,300
NICKY [sighs]: Oh, God,

466
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:40,204
I wonder how many years

467
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,969
I spent thinking about Sally.

468
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,075
I mean...

469
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:49,745
Oh, like, decades maybe? I don't know.

470
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,557
But, uh, you know, uh, I d--

471
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,563
I don't regret that.

472
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:57,152
That, um...

473
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:00,880
those lost years.

474
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:03,110
I think...

475
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:04,401
I think it got me through.

476
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:08,992
It gave me, uh, reason to hope

477
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:12,029
that, you know, one day
something good might happen

478
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:13,963
to me.

479
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,776
Maybe it was all leading up to this, the...

480
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:24,214
most awkward meal of all time.

481
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:29,875
But not a waste of time.

482
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:32,222
No way.

483
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,293
Not for me.

484
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:39,574
That's lovely, Nicky.

485
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:45,269
ERIC: You know, the only
true love is unrequited love.

486
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:48,065
So maybe it's better to love

487
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,447
an idealized version of your partner.

488
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,242
[laughs] I don't know.

489
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,865
I hope everyone saved room for dessert.

490
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,765
I regret buying our satellite dish.

491
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:03,598
When we got it,

492
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,877
our den became Eric's retreat.

493
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,699
Now we watch TV separately,

494
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,612
we eat our meals separately.

495
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,270
I cook chickens for the week because

496
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:24,550
I don't know when he is going to want his dinner.

497
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:26,526
Sal,

498
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,416
that wasn't keeping

499
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,625
in the spirit of the topic.

500
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,455
We were talking about
not sweating the small stuff,

501
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,123
not airing your bigger issues
with me in front of strangers.

502
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,600
They're not strangers, Eric.

503
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:46,563
Nicky is an old friend...

504
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:53,017
...who has pined after me for 50 years

505
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:56,717
while you have treated me

506
00:25:56,752 --> 00:25:58,409
like a line cook.

507
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:03,931
I've known him longer than I have known you.

508
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:07,072
The only reason I don't

509
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,676
bring up the small things

510
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:13,355
is because the big things leave me no room

511
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,935
to worry about anything else.

512
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,722
Bourbon, gentlemen?

513
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:37,551
Yes, please.

514
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:40,209
I'm an alcoholic.

515
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:43,419
Yeah, he is.

516
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,791
[Sighs]

517
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:10,463
We were inseparable when we were young.

518
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:15,292
First two years we were married, sex every day.

519
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,763
Twice on Saturday.

520
00:27:17,764 --> 00:27:21,216
-My.
-[laughs]

521
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,703
He couldn't get enough of me.

522
00:27:25,737 --> 00:27:29,811
-I was something else back then.
-I can see that.

523
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,881
I bet you turned heads, too.

524
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,539
Well...

525
00:27:34,574 --> 00:27:37,033
I had my days.

526
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:39,519
[chuckles]

527
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,099
My first husband got the showroom model of me.

528
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:46,724
Miguel... got the...

529
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:50,590
used classic with a ton of miles.

530
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:51,638
Well,

531
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:54,816
he seems to worship you.

532
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,842
I struck gold twice.

533
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:10,485
I stopped taking pictures of myself.

534
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:12,129
That was my thing:

535
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,924
Completely open self-portraits.

536
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,963
-Hmm.
-Then it stopped.

537
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:31,520
