00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:24,645
-Mwah, mwah, mwah.
-Okay.

179
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,851
All right, thank you-- That's a lot of beard.

180
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,770
Oh, gosh, you guys, 36 blissful hours

181
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,300
until I have to listen to the
Southwest flight attendants

182
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,297
turn the safety protocol
into a parody song again.

183
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,663
Wait, you love that. That was, like,

184
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:39,194
your favorite part of the whole trip.

185
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:41,257
I know. I've gone dead inside.

186
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,821
Well, uh, let me help. Let me help.

187
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,429
I'll run to the store, I'll
grab something special,

188
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:47,417
uh, I'll come home, I'll
cook it up, we'll have dinner.

189
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:50,080
Oh, actually, Kev, um,
Toby and I have plans tonight.

190
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,395
And we already have a
sitter, so the kids are covered.

191
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,275
We're going a recital at my school.

192
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:57,070
Yeah, they're doing
selections from The Lion King.

193
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,901
You know, if they do "He Lives in You,"

194
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,134
I'm gonna lose it.

195
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:02,398
-I'm gonna lose it.
-Mm.

196
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:04,202
Oh, also, we're going to Menchie's.

197
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:05,735
-Oh, you're going to Menchie's?
-Yeah.

198
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,608
Ah, you guys really know how to party.

199
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,456
Uh, actually, we do. We're gonna tornado

200
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,309
all the nonfat frozen yogurt flavors.

201
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:13,517
Okay, well, you go do that. Don't worry about me.

202
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,014
I've got to go to rehearsal.

203
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,514
Manny say what?

204
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:18,943
The reboot? How's it going?

205
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:22,427
It's a good distraction while
Madison and I sort of adjust.

206
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,063
Plus, I don't have to rip my
shirt off at every act break.

207
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,110
Which is why I'm gonna steal
some of Jack's French toast.

208
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,830
Thank you very much, Jack. All right.

209
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,262
-Bye, guys.
-Okay, now, here's the question.

210
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:34,658
How many kisses can I get in in 36 hours?

211
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:36,488
'Cause I think I can break the record.

212
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:38,486
Should I start with your hand? Ready?

213
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,483
One, two, three, four, five, six, a million.

214
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,356
-So many kisses.
-Yeah, that's pretty fast, right?

215
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,620
Should I give you some on
your hand? Mwah, mwah, mwah...

216
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:50,580
-Dad!
-Guys, guys, hey, look, I know we're all excited--

217
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:51,880
Come here, Kev, come
on-- I know we're all excited,

218
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,567
but we're just gonna have to wait our turn.

219
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:55,232
But what if they run out of candy?

220
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:56,730
They're not gonna run out of candy, bud.

221
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,129
So, hey, look, let's just, let's get some snacks

222
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,559
and then we'll go find our seats.

223
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:01,856
-Hi.
-Hey, can I help you?

224
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:04,852
Yeah, can I get, um, three little popcorns,

225
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:08,382
some, uh, ooh, some Raisinets-- three of those.

226
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:10,380
And, uh, do you have coffee?

227
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,844
Sure do.

228
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:13,542
-Great, it's been a long week.
-Daddy?

229
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,617
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna live at work forever?

230
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:19,169
Uh, I don't live at work, Katie girl.

231
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,415
I live with you guys, remember?

232
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,697
My dad worked a lot.

233
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,964
I resented it at first,

234
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,254
but look at me now.

235
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,187
Mm. How much are those?

236
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,462
-Eight dollars.
-Eight bucks. Great.

237
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,284
Eight bucks, okay, there's eight.

238
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:36,281
Got the coffee, got the
popcorns-- Here we go, let's go,

239
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,755
let's go, come on, come on,
come on, we eat that inside,

240
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:40,089
we're gonna eat that inside.

241
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:44,348
-All right, should we rehearse one?
-Do it

242
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:46,968
All right, now, on the day,
we'll have the real twins here--

243
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,361
Lord help us-- but for now
we'll just use the jelly babies.

244
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:52,291
-Oh...
-Kevin, were those babies this creepy when you were the Manny?

245
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,532
Well, um,

246
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,399
you know, their eyes were somehow even deader

247
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,362
and they always smelled like roast beef, so yeah.

248
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:00,927
Okay, gang, um, why don't we

249
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:02,058
pick it up from the toast?

250
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,788
Taking it from the toast.

251
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,254
Um, okay, that's me.

252
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:08,118
- "Today was a good day."
-And action.

253
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,581
-Thank you.
-Yes.

254
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:11,080
Today was a good day.

255
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,012
Um,

256
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,465
I'm lucky to have all of you in my life.

257
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:17,606
My beautiful wife, my amazing stepdaughter.

258
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,835
-Can I get my nose pierced?
-Not a chance.

259
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:25,496
My cute little babies who
are the twinkle in my eye.

260
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,051
And you.

261
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:31,497
Gang, it's-it's moments like this, right?

262
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,818
Just being together, enjoying each other.

263
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,723
Nothing else matters.

264
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:38,545
You're my world. My life.

265
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,766
You make me whole.

266
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,466
Sorry. Yeah, um... Sorry about that.

267
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:51,529
"With you, I feel like I can do anything."

268
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,497
And then I say,

269
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:54,655
"Drink up, little man."

270
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,523
And hopefully baby Archie will cheers,

271
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:59,163
knocking over his milk, cuing the Manny to say...

272
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,362
I got that.

273
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,780
That's why I always bring
an extra muscle tee to work.

274
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,177
You never know with this guy.

275
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:08,842
Laugh, laugh, laugh,

276
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:10,439
and cut. Great.

277
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:11,770
Let's move over to the living room

278
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,745
and we'll rehearse scene 12.

279
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,962
I think that's gonna be a really nice moment.

280
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,978
Oh. Uh, well, th-- Yeah, thanks. Hope so.

281
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,245
Hope so.

282
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,454
You okay?

283
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:27,418
Yeah, it's-- You know, I just, I feel weird

284
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:29,385
saying all that stuff to these dolls, you know?

285
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:30,748
I-I...

286
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,650
I didn't get to spent any
time with my kids today.

287
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:37,951
Hey, um, some of us are
going out after rehearsal.

288
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,780
You should come.

289
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:50,090
Okay, there's four sides: One, two, three.

290
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:53,413
-Good job.
-Okay, it's gift time.

291
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,640
Babe, I just put Hailey down.

292
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:59,436
Okay, it's gift time.

293
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:01,585
You want to see what I got for little Jack?

294
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,607
-Yeah.
-Okay, check this out.

295
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:06,771
It is a beeping football.

296
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,699
You turn it on, and it makes a sound.

297
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,597
We can roll it back and forth to each other

298
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,129
and get our Eli Manning on.

299
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:15,530
I picked Eli because he's
the cutest Manning, obviously.

300
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:18,086
Listen, this is gonna wind him up,

301
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,725
and he has to go down for his nap before 3:00,

302
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:21,781
especially if a sitter's coming tonight.

303
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,422
But you can play, you
know, when he gets up, okay?

304
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:26,671
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And you really don't have to come

305
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:30,613
-bearing gifts every time.
-Okay, all right.

306
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:34,032
I guess, uh, I guess you
don't want your present, then?

307
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,138
-Oh, no, I want my present.
-Oh, you--

308
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,236
-Oh, you do. Okay, okay.
-I do. I didn't know I was getting one.

309
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:40,424
Um, I know how you're always so annoyed

310
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,021
about losing the remote control.

311
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:44,241
So I picked this up in Chinatown

312
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,084
so you'll always know where it is.

313
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:49,147
Oh. That's sweet.

314
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:52,043
It's beautiful. Thank you.

315
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:54,460
And I've always wanted.

316
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,626
Open it.

317
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:57,759
Okay.

318
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,584
Babe.

319
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,630
What?

320
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,028
Oh...

321
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:07,024
-Um...
-Open the purse.

322
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,786
The purse is for you to carry tonight.

323
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:12,351
And the gift card is for you
to get your hair blown up.

324
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:14,149
-Blown...
-Blown-blown down.

325
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,269
Uh, blown out.

326
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,010
While I watch the kids.

327
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,340
My Zoom call got canceled, so you go do you.

328
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,005
Go get your hair done.

329
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:24,468
Go get your hair done.

330
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:26,033
-Okay.
-Yeah, listen to the man.

331
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:29,263
-Okay.
-Okay, I'll see you boys soon.

332
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,128
-Thanks, babe.
-Oh, you got it.

333
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:33,591
-You got it.
-Yeah. Say, "Bye-bye, Mama."

334
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:34,990
Bye-bye, Mama.

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,321
Bye, Sweet Pea.

336
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,450
Oh, babe, do you need me
to go over the schedules?

337
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,782
'Cause they change constantly.

338
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,157
And he has to be down for his nap by 3:00.

339
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,782
Kate, they're my kids, too.

340
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:46,807
All right? And I think, if you'll recall,

341
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,573
I was a pretty good stay-at-home dad myself there

342
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,804
for a while.

343
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,683
So I think I can watch them for an hour.

344
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:53,598
Okay.

345
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:55,730
Thanks, babe.

346
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,895
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

347
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,104
-Thank you.
-Say, "I love you, Mama."

348
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,058
-Bye, boys.
-Love you.

349
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,490
Okay, Deja.

350
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,486
Welcome to the Randall Pearson School of Driving.

351
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:06,272
I'll be your instructor Randall Pearson.

352
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:08,281
Allow me to put on some background music

353
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,878
as I talk you through some of
the safety features of the vehicle.

354
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:12,508
Okay, I can't do this

355
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,416
if we're gonna listen to your old man music.

356
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,741
Oh! "Old man music"?

357
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:18,931
That... that's hurtful.

358
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:21,895
Mm-hmm. To my ears.

359
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,928
It's good speed.

360
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,192
Make sure you keep that distance

361
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,928
between you and the car in front of you.

362
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,314
-Got it. Thanks.
-You're doing great, Dej.

363
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:33,612
♪ But, baby, it's true... ♪

364
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,811
Glad we finally found time to do this.

365
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,039
Haven't had a lot of time to talk lately.

366
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,903
So, how's school going?

367
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,543
Uh, fine.

368
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:45,232
-You know Ms. McNamara?
-Your chemistry teacher?

369
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:46,631
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

370
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:48,261
Well, she's getting into stand-up comedy.

371
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:50,204
Okay.

372
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:54,021
And she tries out her jokes on us.

373
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,385
-But, like, bad ones.
-Mm-hmm.

374
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:57,886
Um, like,

375
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:00,921
"Why can you never trust atoms?"

376
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:04,124
Because they make up everything.

377
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,902
You are worse than Ms. McNamara.

378
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:10,833
Oh, man.

379
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,097
All right, look, we're about to merge.

380
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:17,257
So, uh, put on your signal...

381
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,223
...and check your mirrors.

382
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:23,018
And when you feel like you got space, go for it.

383
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:25,083
--AUTOMATED
VOICE: Message from Malik.

384
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:27,292
Watch the merge, Deja.

385
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,742
Can't stop thinking about last weekend.

386
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:31,352
-Wish you were here now.
-Oh...

387
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:33,213
Hands on the wheel, Deja.

388
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:34,803
Can't really sleep.

389
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:37,183
The bed feels too big without you.

390
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:39,341
Ready to reply?

391
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:51,459
She took a six-hour bus ride four states away,

392
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,082
and we had no idea.

393
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:54,666
-What if something happened?
-Let's kill her.

394
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:56,578
Let's dig a hole in the
backyard and bury her in it.

395
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,931
And it's not just how dangerous
it could have been, Beth.

396
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,963
It's the lying.

397
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:04,592
And it wasn't just one lie,
she lied right to our faces.

398
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:06,423
Right to our faces.

399
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,487
Okay, hold up.

400
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:09,815
I feel like we need to pick

401
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:11,512
which one of us is gonna unravel here

402
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:12,954
and which one of us is gonna stay cool.

403
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:14,974
I'm already pacing, Beth. I'm up.

404
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,840
Okay, fine, I'll stay cool.

405
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,803
She is grounded.

406
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,103
Phone, gone.

407
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,799
Food, maybe.

408
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,164
And she is forbidden from
seeing Malik for forever.

409
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:25,562
Can we put her back on Zoom school?

410
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:27,003
I feel like that's kind of punishing ourselves,

411
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:29,057
-so I want to hold off...
-We need to make an example

412
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,942
of her Tess and for Annie.

413
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:34,347
Maybe we should ground
them all just to get ahead of it.

414
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,868
Randall, you're so hot,
I'm gonna need an ice bath.

415
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:38,812
So why don't I go talk to her?

416
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:41,408
Why, Beth? So she can lie some more?

417
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,373
Huh? Huh-- You know what? I'm too hot.

418
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,202
I'm too hot ri-- I-I'm-a go for a run.

419
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:47,653
-That's what I'm-a...
-That's a good plan.

420
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:52,096
I know, my little immigrant.

421
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:55,358
You want to find your family.

422
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,288
-And you will.
-But how?

423
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:02,016
It's so far away and it's so big.

424
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:04,546
I'll never find them anyway.

425
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,344
-Where are you going?
-This movie's dumb.

426
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:10,406
But did you say "never"?

427
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,103
So young and you have lost hope

428
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:15,101
Oh, this is America.

429
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,998
You can just keep it open.

430
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,827
I swear, this is not why I invited you.

431
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,825
But if Dad's buying, let's order shots.

432
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:24,057
-You guys want some shots?
-Heck, yeah.

433
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,254
Uh, can we get six shots of tequila?

434
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:27,984
Thank you. To Kevin.

435
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,981
-Cheers.
-Kevin.

436
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:31,722
Oh, thank you.

437
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,242
It's so impressive

438
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,338
how you can be around people and not drink.

439
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,469
Oh, uh, you know, I-I...

440
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:43,938
I'm better off without it, trust me. It's...

441
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,638
Should you be drinking, though, honestly?

442
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:47,061
I mean, aren't you, like, 17 years old?

443
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:50,024
-I'm 25. I just look young.
-Okay.

444
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:53,020
Well. That's great.

445
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,118
I was thinking that, maybe after this,

446
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:56,781
we could go check out White Sea at The Echo.

447
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,181
Do you know her?

448
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:01,709
She used to be the keyboardist for M83.

449
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,440
I-- no-- I don't think I do know her.

450
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,138
I'm not sure

451
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:07,179
anything that you just
said was English, actually.

452
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,335
Give me your phone. I'll show you a clip.

453
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,689
Here you go.

454
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,326
Oh. Oh.

455
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,257
Um...

456
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:23,449
Excu-- Uh, excuse me.

457
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,812
Hey, Kevin, look at this.

458
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:30,739
One, two, one, two.

459
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:33,635
Franny, walk to Mama. Walk to Mama.

460
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,965
Come here. Yes! Ooh...

461
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:39,228
Oh, this is...

462
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:42,392
You know, I can't-- uh, I-I got to go.

463
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:44,422
I'll be ba-- I'm not, I'm
probably not gonna come back.

464
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:47,218
-What?
-I-- Just-just keep it open.

465
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:49,117
Okay, so usually he's in his jammies by now,

466
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,647
but, uh, he's a little off-schedule today, so...

467
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:54,210
That's okay. We can get you
into your jammies, right, Jack?

468
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,775
-Hey.
-Hi.

469
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:57,307
How old is McKenna?

470
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,738
Looks like she just turned 12.

471
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:01,468
Um, 17-ish?

472
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:04,264
She's been really great
this past month, and she is,

473
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:05,795
honestly, amazing.

474
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,095
Thank you.

475
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,059
Although the kids are usually asleep.

476
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:10,457
No!

477
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,122
Sorry, he's cranky. He didn't have his nap.

478
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:14,552
'Cause his dad bought him a new toy and...

479
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:16,117
Uh, which he loves.

480
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:17,715
It's a football that beeps.

481
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,512
-And he loves it.
-Yeah,

482
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:20,877
and he had to play with it, right,

483
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,241
-'cause it started beeping and...
-No!

484
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,406
-Okay. I'll get it. I'll get it.
-Oh, uh, sorry.

485
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,668
-No.
-I'll get it. I got it, I got it.

486
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:29,233
Great, well, now I'm gonna be worried

487
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:30,999
about him when we're at the recital.

488
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:33,262
Kate, you just need, you need to relax. Okay?

489
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,826
Really? What you needed to do

490
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:36,202
was put him to bed at 3:00 like I asked you to.

491
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:38,988
I-I'm sure we-we're gonna be fine.

492
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:40,652
I'm sure that we're gonna be late.

493
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,583
You know what? Here,
why don't you just go ahead--

494
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:45,098
Here's that and here's this--

495
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:47,711
And I'll just stay here and make
sure that Jack goes down, okay?

496
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,674
Oh, thank God.

497
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,763
I'm gonna grab my bag.

498
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:53,627
All right.

499
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,114
So, I'll just go alone?

500
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:59,360
Kate, I know you worked hard
on this. You should be there.

501
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:01,759
I'll just, I'll-I'll catch the next one, I guess.

502
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,246
You want some chicken?

503
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:06,111
-Yes.
-Yeah, okay, here you go.

504
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,503
There you go. See? We're doing great.

505
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:13,630
Okay.

506
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:19,271
How'd you get in here?

507
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:23,949
Get me that mouse!

508
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,446
Where's your brother?

509
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:27,943
-He left.
-What do you mean, he left? When?

510
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:30,307
Get your coats. Come on, let's go.

511
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:32,737
Come on. Let's go. Come on, let's go.

512
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:34,311
♪

513
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:40,595
Come here, come here. Kevin?

514
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,625
Hey, excuse me, hey. Have you, have you seen

515
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:44,988
a little blond boy a-about the
same height as the two of them?

516
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:47,919
I think I saw him go out in
the mall about an hour ago,

517
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,447
-but I'm also incredibly stoned.
-Go, go.

518
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:54,319
-So, yeah.
-Come on, come on. Come on.

519
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,767
Hey. Hey.

520
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,299
Hi.

521
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:05,139
Hi.

522
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,833
What happened?

523
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,388
He went to the food court
looking for free samples

524
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:12,319
and got a little turned around

525
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:15,747
and they found him crying
outside of Spencer Gifts.

526
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,645
Mm-mm.

527
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:20,586
I-I don't understand. How
did they know who to call?

528
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:27,799
You got to be kidding me.

529
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,065
You guys want to go home?

530
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,696
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, let's do it.

531
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,559
-How was the movie?
-Half of it was good.

532
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:35,523
Yeah, 'cause we only watched half of it.

533
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,054
Thank you.

534
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:40,284
Have a good night.

535
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:42,581
Ellie, that was amazing.

536
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:44,511
We should have always used you on alto.

537
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,776
-Thanks, Miss Kate.
-You're welcome. Good night.

538
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,673
-Good night.
-Kate. Kate.

539
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:51,270
Huh? I'd have to say,

540
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,866
that was one of the most
successful recitals ever.

541
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,097
-Aw.
-But in-in fairness,

542
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,428
parents rarely boo their blind children.

543
00:21:58,438 --> 00:21:59,869
Eh...

544
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:04,587
I, uh, I thought I was finally gonna meet

545
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:06,384
the, uh, the famous Toby.

546
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:08,082
Uh, yeah, he had to stay home with the kids.

547
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,145
Ugh. Kids are the worst.

548
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:12,312
That's why I try to never be around them ever.

549
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:13,809
Good job, Alyssa. Well done.

550
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:16,206
-Thank you.
-Okay. Night night.

551
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:17,703
You know, it's not the kids' fault.

552
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:21,632
It's really not anyone's fault, um, but...

553
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,796
-You probably don't want to hear about it, so...
-Not really.

554
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,360
It's just that we had this stupid argument,

555
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,357
you know, about the kids'
schedules, and it just sucks

556
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,700
because he's only here for the weekend.

557
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,485
It's not a big deal.

558
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:35,847
And I certainly should not
be talking about it at work.

559
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:39,477
My wife and I had a stupid
fight that went on for years.

560
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:42,223
Uh, bath towels.

561
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,370
She would never hang them up. It made me crazy.

562
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,831
And every day I'd go to
work and I'd start my class

563
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:52,385
by announcing whether or
not she hung up her towel.

564
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:55,324
And then, one day, I just, um,

565
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:59,485
I stopped giving the report,
because it became pretty obvious

566
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:03,631
that we had problems that were much bigger

567
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,870
than bath towels.

568
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,107
It-it wasn't really an anecdote
I wanted to share anymore.

569
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:11,603
So, as annoying as it is

570
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:13,834
that you told me about your
stupid fight with your husband,

571
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:15,931
just, uh,

572
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:17,662
take it as a good sign

573
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:20,084
that you're still talking about it.

574
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:22,381
All right, I got to lock up.

575
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:25,263
♪

576
00:23:58,422 --> 00:24:00,452
♪

577
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,195
Where is she? Where's our little Allyson Felix?

578
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:13,603
You know what I was gonna
do, I was gonna stop by,

579
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:15,001
I was gonna get some running
shoes before I came over here.

580
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:16,399
I thought that'd be kind of funny, but then I got

581
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:17,888
so excited, I thought, "No, just go on by

582
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:19,564
and see where she is." You blink, you miss her.

583
00:24:19,564 --> 00:24:20,851
Where'd she go? Where is she?

584
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,404
What are you, what are you doing here?

585
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:25,858
I came to see Franny walk.

586
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:29,011
It's 7:30. She's asleep.

587
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,889
Okay, but y-- I mean, you
couldn't have kept her up

588
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:32,687
for, like, another 20 minutes?

589
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:35,016
Kevin, come on, I can't
change their sleep schedule

590
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:37,348
-every time they do something.
-Someth-- This isn't something.

591
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:39,378
She, she propelled her body

592
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:40,877
in a forward motion in an upright manner.

593
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:42,907
This is not something. This is a major milestone.

594
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,839
This is huge.

595
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,402
There will be a million major milestones.

596
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:50,317
We're not gonna be there for every one of them.

597
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,060
You mean I'm not gonna be
there for every one of them.

598
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,480
Kevin.

599
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,788
Madison, I took this stupid
job so that I could be close

600
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,064
to my kids so I could see 'em all the time.

601
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,852
It turns out, I can't.

602
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,316
What are you talking about?
You were here this morning.

603
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:04,989
You're gonna be back here again tomorrow morning.

604
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:06,944
She will live to walk another day.

605
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:08,175
Yeah, and it won't be the same.

606
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:09,874
It won't be the-- You know, this sucks.

607
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,337
You know, it's like you
get all of the firsts, right?

608
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:14,934
And then I'm supposed to,
what, uh, just cling desperately

609
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:16,965
to my phone, j-just hoping for a text from you.

610
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,296
I immediately sent you a text.

611
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:20,671
You sent me a video, well, thank you very much,

612
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:22,192
I feel so connected to my children.

613
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:26,020
Look, I am sorry that you are feeling feelings

614
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:27,419
or whatever you're doing right now,

615
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,316
but this is not a picnic for me, okay?

616
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:32,312
Yes, Franny walked today, and it was adorable,

617
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,842
and I am genuinely sorry that you missed that.

618
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:37,606
But an hour before that, Nick barfed all over me

619
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:38,838
while I was trying to wolf down

620
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:40,235
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

621
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:42,400
and now I have to somehow clean it out of my hair

622
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,797
before Elijah comes over
so that I don't seem revolting

623
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:47,793
and end up alone forever.

624
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:51,756
Clean the baby vomit out of
my hair, not the peanut butter.

625
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:54,747
Although I think I also have
peanut butter in my hair.

626
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,070
I... I know how badly you
want to be in their lives.

627
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,445
And you will be, but we're not together.

628
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,728
And so that means that sometimes

629
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,068
one of us is gonna feel left out.

630
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:28,053
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you're right.

631
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:34,236
Can you do me a favor, when she wakes up,

632
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,710
will you tell her that her dad came by?

633
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:40,561
Tell her that I'm proud of her?

634
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,603
Okay.

635
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,197
Okay.

All is well. Kevin is happily
playing with his Legos,

638

not a care in the world.

to start making memories now, Bec.

Like, important stuff,

real stuff they're gonna remember

-for the rest of their lives.
-Mm-hmm.

648

And now, every time Kevin
thinks about that first movie he saw,

649

he's just gonna think about
a day he was traumatized.

Let me tell you about our
trip to the park yesterday.

652

All the kids wanted to do

653
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:50,141
was ride the rocket slide, but it was closed.

654
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:53,604
And Kate had to pee, but there was no bathroom,

655
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:55,002
and Kevin and Randall

656
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:56,900
were fighting over the last Capri Sun.

657
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,097
It was a mess.

658
00:27:58,107 --> 00:27:59,330
We got to the car

659
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,594
and everybody was crying, myself included.

660
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:07,088
And just when I thought it
was the worst day ever, um,

661
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:09,983
a ladybug landed on the dashboard.

662
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:12,213
And Kevin tells us

663
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,279
it's good luck.

664
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:17,708
And Randall says that
ladybugs have two sets of wings.

665
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:22,150
And Kate decided to name it.

666
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:24,318
-Linda.
-Linda the Ladybug.

667
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,258
So, when I was tucking them in last night,

668
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,909
that's what they remember from the day.

669
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:33,670
Not the crying, not the Capri Suns, but

670
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:36,109
Linda the Ladybug.

671
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:39,343
Until a day is over, there's always a chance

672
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,618
you'll remember it for something else.

673
00:28:58,163 --> 00:29:00,084
All right, Beth.

674
00:29:00,094 --> 00:29:01,126
-Here's what we're gonna do.
-We're not gonna be able

675
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:03,845
to ground this out of her, Randall.

676
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:05,411
That girl is completely in love.

677
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:07,108
Doesn't give her an excuse.

678
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:09,405
It's like how you and I felt at the beginning.

679
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,504
If somebody would have told
us we couldn't see each other

680
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:12,679
for months, we would have found a way.

681
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,200
So what are you saying, Beth?

682
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:15,398
That, because she's in love,

683
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:16,475
there shouldn't be any consequences?

684
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:18,161
Oh, no, there's gonna be consequences.

685
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:19,660
Like, she's not gonna see this again

686
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,968
until they come out with the iPhone 30.

687
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,122
-Okay.
-But...

688
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:26,484
this isn't just about what
happened... last weekend.

689
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:29,113
This is...

690
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:31,696
We thought our daughter was a child,

691
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:34,150
playing Candy Land,

692
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:36,904
but she's out here playing The Game of Life,

693
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:38,902
and we have to adjust.

694
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:46,792
Randall, take a big sip of my wine.

695
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:48,322
I don't want a big sip of your wine.

696
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:52,000
-I just ran for five miles.
-Drink the wine.

697
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:58,273
I'm taking Deja to get birth control.

698
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:14,725
Hey.

699
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:19,051
I was trying to sneak in
undetected in case, you know,

700
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,384
"grown-up time" was still going on.

701
00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:24,213
Which is-is kind of "gross,"
you know, I keep saying "it"

702
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,342
because you're married to my "sister."

703
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:30,538
-Why are you doing that?
-I-- You know, I-I'm so tired, man,

704
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,636
I-I don't even-- I can't, you know...

705
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:34,733
Well, you don't have to worry about it,

706
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:37,795
'cause grown-up time was a bust.

707
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:40,326
Kate went to the recital all by herself.

708
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:43,489
I literally just got both
kids down for the night.

709
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,397
Which, it turns out, is a
nightmare when the nap schedule

710
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:47,385
-is all out of whack.
-Ooh, yeah,

711
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:49,313
no, you don't want to mess with the nap schedule.

712
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,753
So I hear.

713
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:54,874
What's all this? You, uh,
you taking off tomorrow?

714
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:57,372
Yep. Bright and early,

715
00:30:57,382 --> 00:31:02,931
so I can make it in time for
the 9:00 a.m. staff meeting.

716
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:04,307
Yeah, at least you have an excuse, you know?

717
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:07,360
I live in the same city
as my kids, I feel like a...

718
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:10,831
a stranger, so...

719
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:15,116
You know, when I first found
out I was gonna be a dad,

720
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:18,977
I kept trying to picture
it, you know, in my head.

721
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:24,570
And the image that kept
popping into my mind was, uh,

722
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,747
family dinner, dinner table, you know?

723
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:30,313
Mom, dad, couple of kids.

724
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,625
This was gonna be us.

725
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:37,289
Me, Madison, the two kids.

726
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:40,551
Square, you know? A solid... unit.

727
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,615
Well, for what it's worth, that dinner table

728
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,613
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

729
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,810
I sat through plenty of dinners with my parents,

730
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,658
who clearly couldn't stand each other.

731
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:53,900
I think kids would much rather
have parents that are happy

732
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,135
than parents who are together.

733
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:58,208
Yeah,

734
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:01,062
but I'm not happy.

735
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,634
You know, it's funny, when...

736
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,120
when we're kids,

737
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,377
we always,

738
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:14,747
we build houses that are, uh, square,

739
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:17,728
because we think...

740
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:21,150
that that is the strongest shape that there is.

741
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:26,821
But, turns out...

742
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:33,722
...a triangle is the strongest shape in nature.

743
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,587
Strong base.

744
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:38,928
It's capable of holding infinitely more weight...

745
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:45,484
It is the most stable shape that there is.

746
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:52,625
See?

747
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,729
So maybe you should just
stop thinking of your family

748
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:59,623
as a square and start
thinking of it as, you know,

749
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,938
you,

750
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,077
Nick,

751
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:05,208
Franny.

752
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,875
A triangle.

753
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:10,665
The hell are you talking about right now, man?

754
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:15,739
I don't, I don't know. I have no idea.

755
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:17,545
I thought I was gonna be
having sex with your sister tonight.

756
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:20,926

771
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:37,804
don't make me have this conversation with you.

772
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,933
You know, today, when I saw you behind the wheel

773
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:44,848
of that car, I thought...

774
00:34:46,288 --> 00:34:49,274
"She looks ridiculous.

775
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:52,421
She's way too young to be driving."

776
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:56,328
Because,

777
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:59,130
to me...

778
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,255
...you look exactly like the little girl

779
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:06,985
who came to my doorstep with everything she had

780
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:10,458
in the world tucked into one bag.

781
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:15,474
Now, rationally, of course,

782
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:19,402
I knew that this little girl had
already grown up quite a bit.

783
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:24,096
And I knew that the rest of
the growing up was still coming.

784
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:27,135
I just didn't realize that
it would come so quickly.

785
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:33,386
And maybe that's why I'm
having a hard time with this.

786
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:39,354
'Cause I missed the first 12 years of your life,

787
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:43,774
and I guess now I'm
just trying to stall for time.

788
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:50,773
To hold on to that very
particular version of my Deja.

789
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:56,489
So...

790
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:00,219
if you would be so kind,

791
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:03,981
please be patient with me

792
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:08,641
as I wrap my head around this new,

793
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:10,793
beautiful,

794
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,180
grown-up you.

795
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:25,287
Mm-hmm.

796
00:36:25,297 --> 00:36:28,017
That being said,

797
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:31,879
you are still a junior in high school,

798
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,799
and you will not be going to visit your boyfriend

799
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,939
in Boston again anytime soon.

800
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:47,464
Well, that's going to be a problem.

Ha, uh...

805
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:43,491
Because I'm sleeping on my sister's couch

806
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:45,720
even though I have enough
money to buy a big, fancy house,

807

and because, Cassidy, I...

808
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,511
...was about to
call my 25-year-old costar

809
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,475
who plays my stepdaughter for a booty call,

810
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:59,670
and you live across the country
and you were born before Y2K

811
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,467
and I figured you were the better option.

812
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,485
You really know how to flatter a girl.

813
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:06,117
Hmm.

814
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:17,790
Hi.

815
00:38:21,186 --> 00:38:23,607
So, I went to Menchie's

816
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:25,638
and did the whole tornado yogurt thing myself.

817
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:27,868
And, yeah, I got some severe looks from Darcy

818
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:30,774
behind the counter, but I don't care.

819
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:36,898
It is really tough

820
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,085
with-without you here.

821
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,817
I know.

822
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:50,674
Listen, you-you know our kids
way better than I do right now.

823
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:52,365
That's just the truth,

824
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:55,271
and I should be following your lead.

825
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:01,326
Now, I know I don't need
to buy any more presents,

826
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:05,088
but I want to get one more
thing, and it's for all of us.

827
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,970
Can I show you?

828
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,651
Okay.

829
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:11,557

-We already have a grill.
-Au contraire, mon frère.

833
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,954
This is no mere grill.

834
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:25,221
This is a smoker.

835
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:26,483
This is the Big Green Egg.

836
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:29,116
This smoker will outlast time, global warming,

837
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,851
and all the other awful things coming our way.

838
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:32,875
Look, Kate,

839
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:35,140

to be about us being apart.

841
00:39:37,761 --> 00:39:41,304
So let's make some memories

842
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,846
of us being together.

843
00:39:42,856 --> 00:39:45,009
Let's have big old cookouts and let's eat food

844
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:47,739
that took me, like, 900 hours to cook.

845
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:50,636
Let's be... smokers.

846
00:39:50,646 --> 00:39:53,298
-Okay. Let's be smokers.
-Okay.

00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,995
Check this out. Okay. This
is, this is the biggest version.

848
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:58,459
They make all kinds of accessories for it.

849
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,389
Good things come to those who wait.

850

to keep using that thing.
