00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:02,903
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:07,007
Rebecca. Matt Dickson from the PTA.

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,243
-Do you want to get coffee with me?
-Yeah.

4
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:10,911
My manager said if I'm gonna take acting serious,

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,246
I got to be in L.A. pretty regularly.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,647
So, what, you're just gonna, like,

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,683
constantly be in L.A. while I'm in New York?

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,251
How is this marriage gonna work?

9
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:18,852
I reached out to a job recruiter.

10
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,489
She got back to me with listings

11
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,324
from some traditional dance conservatories.

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,825
These dance academies

13
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,760
took something I love

14
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,262
and made it joyless.

15
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,863
We're gonna learn the new combination.

16
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,432
Sonya here will demonstrate.

17
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:34,935
Go in there and do what you always do.

18
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,937
Blow us all away.

00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,778

22
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,583
-Daddy, tell me the story again.
-Hmm.

23
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,352
-Again?
-Please,

24
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,855
-Daddy?
-We were right here in Kingston.

25
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,459
You were 18 months and hadn't walked at all.

26
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,728
Your mother was worried to death.

27
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,198
But then we were all at a party

28
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:06,967
for your Uncle Clem at Hellshire Beach.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,138
He said, "The girl must know good music."

30
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,640
And he put on Burning Spear,

31
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,542
and just like that,

32
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,710
it took hold of those little legs of yours

33
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,078
and picked you right up off the ground.

34
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,381
You danced straight to me.

35
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,983
And right then, you became

36
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,987
-my little island girl who danced...
-Who danced before she walked.

37
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,524
That's right.

38
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,462
You've always done things in your own time,

39
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:35,929
baby girl.

40
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,333
We have

41
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,335
eight studios on the premises,

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,172
and most of them have classes going all day.

43
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:47,575
-I'll get you a map.
-A map. Wow.

44
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,577
Two, three...

45
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,582
Two, three, four...

46
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,517
I'm so pleased we're moving forward

47
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,320
with your idea for a scholarship program.

48
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,923
I know it wasn't easy
convincing the board of directors.

49
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,993
Thank you. Twisted some arms so hard,

50
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,695
I almost broke 'em, but, uh...

51
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,031
I just really believe there's
a lot of untapped talent

52
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,301
that could really thrive here.

53
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,937
I trust you'll find them.

54
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,639
Welcome aboard.

55
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,983
How's it going?

56
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,721
Not good, baby. Not good.

57
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,825
I have over 200 applicants and only 15 spots.

58
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,960
The fate of this whole program

59
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,995
rests on me choosing the right dancers.

60
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,468
All you have to do,

61
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,670
turn off this.

62
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,372
Trust this.

63
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,873
My belly?

64
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,375
That's just telling me to stress-eat

65
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,676
those Thai dumplings in the fridge.

66
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,846
No, silly. Your gut.

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,749
It's never steered you wrong.

68
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,018
Now, if you're accepted,

69
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,920
we'll cover the cost of tuition,

70
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,989
competition fees and pointe shoes.

71
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,892
That's amazing. I go
through, like, two pairs a week.

72
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,994
I practically live at the studio.

73
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,929
Uh, she'll have to keep up with her studies.

74
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,265
That's most important.

75
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,701
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

76
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,871
-Let me show you a few more studios.
-Okay.

77
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,673
Congratulations, everyone.

78
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,008
You made it. Now, most of you

79
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,344
haven't trained at this level
at your old dance studios.

80
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,947
Right? This space can be intimidating.

81
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,183
Don't worry. They got maps.

82
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,186
But I want you to remember

83
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,854
that you belong.

84
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,924
So take up space. Yes?

85
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,461
Now, you'll have an opportunity

86
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:50,464
to demonstrate your hard
work at our fall showcase,

87
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:53,534
which could lead to an apprenticeship

88
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,603
with a professional dance company.

89
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,970
Okay?

90
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,906
So, now I want you all to turn around

91
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,774
and face the mirror

92
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,277
and repeat after me.

93
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,881
I can, and I will.

94
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,751
I can, and I will.

95
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,421
Again. I can, and I will.

96
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:17,157
I can, and I will.

97
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,970
She's not as polished as our other soloists.

98
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,540
I don't think she'll be ready for the showcase.

99
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,676
She'll be ready.

100
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,778
Trust me.

101
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,914
Okay.

102
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,916
I will.

103
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,753
You're one of a kind, baby girl.

104
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,356
Don't ever forget how special you are.

105
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,509
I don't understand why we
had to go food shopping so early.

106
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,210
I mean, Thanksgiving's not for three days.

107
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,481
So, the key to a successful
Thanksgiving is to strike early.

108
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,016
See, you learn that once you've
had to tussle with an old lady

109
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,018
in aisle three over the
last can of cranberry sauce.

110
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,720
-Oh.
-I can't wait

111
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,790
until Kev and I get to host Thanksgiving one day.

112
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,626
In our amazing loft with exposed brick

113
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,894
that we'll buy

114
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,162
when Kevin becomes a famous actor.

115
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,831
Right, babe?

116
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,834
So, we got three kinds of
stuffing and no extra beer?

117
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,571
Wow, are we that unbearable
to be around? Got to be drunk

118
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,139
- to hang out with us? -
-Ha ha.

119
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,808
-I didn't buy it at all.
-Well, then, next time

120
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,343
you can choose the movie. Oh!

121
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,847
Guys. I didn't know

122
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,182
that anyone was gonna be home. Hi.

123
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,918
-You got in early!
-Hi.

124
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,186
-Hi. Hey, sweetheart.
-Hey.

125
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,688
-How you doing?
-Oh, I'm good.

126
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,157
-Oh.
-What's up?

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,893
Oh! Sorry. Now I'm all flustered.

128
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,362
Uh, um, guys, this is Matt.

129
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,899
Matt, this is Kate and Kevin.
Um, Kevin's wife Sophie.

130
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,336
-Hi.
-And then my other son Randall and his girlfriend are in D.C.,

131
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,838
but-but he'll be here for Thanksgiving.

132
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,005
-Oh, great.
-Yeah.

133
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,674
Oh, and this is, uh, Miguel.

134
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,175
-Hey.
-A good family friend.

135
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,677
Hey. Matt Dickson.

136
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,712
-Hey, Matt. Pleasure. Yeah.
-Hi.

137
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,614
Hey, I picked up the turkey
for our three-day brine.

138
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:24,351
Oh. Thank you. Yeah, uh,
Miguel and I saw Emeril do it,

139
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,019
and we just thought, "Eh,
you know, what the heck?"

140
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,555
Yeah. We were like, "Brine not?"

141
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:31,358
"Brine not?"

142
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,227
I-I love a good brine. You know.

143
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,697
But since the divorce, I've just
been keeping things low-key.

144
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,032
You know, just me and my Hungry-Man.

145
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,439
You know, you're welcome to join us.

146
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:47,941
Oh, no. Look, I-I don't want to impose.

147
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,310
Oh, come on. I insist.

148
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,312
-Really?
-Yeah.

149
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,315
Well, in that case, I'm bringing
my famous pumpkin pie.

150
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,317
-Oh!
-Yeah.

151
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,487
It's not famous at all.
It's from the grocery store.

152
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,988
-Oh.
-Lucky for you all.

153
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,793
Um... Well, uh, nice to meet you all.

154
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,096
-Yeah. Bye.
-Bye.

155
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,605
Well, this isn't gonna be awkward at all.

156
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,673
Can't wait.

157
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,080
-Kevin, it's so nice of you to do all of this.
-No problem.

158
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,950
Are you kidding? The eggs are
warming, the kids are sleeping,

159
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,319
and the next batch of red velvet waffles

160
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,922
will be ready in T-minus four minutes.

161
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,124
You know what we should do?
We should make a thing of this.

162
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,827
Right? We could call it, um, Brunch and Beauties.

163
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,129
'Cause I feel like we're beautiful people.

164
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,131
-Uh... -Eh.
-Brunch and Beauties. No?

165
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,966
We don't...? Okay, well, you
know, we'll pitch on it later.

166
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,168
Kevin's trying to show that
he's supportive that I'm dating.

167
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,003
Yeah, I know. It's really cute

168
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,605
-when he tries to make it look natural.
-Mm-hmm.

169
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,174
Elijah, these blueberry muffins are insane.

170
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,109
-Really, they're from scratch?
-Yeah.

171
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,378
I'm kind of a baked goods snob.

172
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,313
It's homemade or bust for this guy.

173
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,815
Well, maybe you can whip up another batch

174
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,517
-for me to take to Thanksgiving.
-Sure.

175
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:06,286
Madison, you are gonna
love Thanksgiving at the cabin,

176
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,622
by the way. And I can't
wait for the twins to see me

177
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,823
in the Pilgrim Rick hat.

178
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,559
Although I do hope it doesn't scare Nicky,

179
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,026
because he gets really weird around hats.

180
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,299
Uh, well, what about you?
You got plans for the holidays?

181
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,570
Oh. Um... Well, you know,

182
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,304
it's probably just gonna be
a quiet one with the family.

183
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,073
-Hmm.
-Hey, is that beauty

184
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,676
-yours?
-Yeah. Yes, she is.

185
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,511
This is a Gibson J-45.

186
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,013
This is the guitar that Bradley Cooper used

187
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,481
in A Star Is Born.

188
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,849
I'm just kind of getting the hang of it.

189
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,517
Yeah, that sounds great, man. You're a rock star.

190
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,319
Yeah. Well, I've been taking

191
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,721
Springsteen's online MasterClass,

192
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,155
-so...
-Mm-hmm.

193
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,657
You aren't talking to me at all, are you?

194
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,325
-Mm. Work call.
-Yeah.

195
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,260
These are insane. Are these you?

196
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,162
-Yeah.
-I love you.

197
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,530
No, not you, sir.

198
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,499
Talking to a man named Elijah.

199
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,702
He's doing a deal in two different time zones,

200
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,336
so, like, eight of the 16 hours

201
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,105
that he's been back? It's been that.

202
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,240
I never thought that I
would get jealous of AirPods.

203
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,842
-Aw.
-Yeah.

204
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,843
I thought that his ears were mine

205
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,044
once we said our vows, but...

206
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,379
Well, listen, you don't have to come

207
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,081
to the-the pilot taping of The Manny tomorrow.

208
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,683
Why don't you spend some quality time with Toby?

209
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,551
Are you kidding? It's not every day

210
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,020
that our brother gets to star

211
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,088
in a reboot of a show that made his career

212
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,389
and then almost cost him his career.

213
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,925
-We're gonna be there.
-Okay.

214
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,727
-All right. All right.
-Oh, man.

215
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,429
That all sounds so exciting.
The live audience and all.

216
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,531
Well, why don't you and Madison
come? Come to the taping.

217
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,299
-Seriously?
-Yes.

218
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,301
-Be great.
-Okay.

219
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,469
-Yeah.
-Great! Terrific.

220
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,071
-Yes.
-Now,

221
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,541
-let Brunch 'N' Stuff begin.
-I like it.

222
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,809
-Brunch 'N' Stuff.
-Yeah.

223
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,544
-All right.
-Better.

224
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,647
All right, well, we're getting
there. We're getting there.

225
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,317
We have to get the bread pudding.

226
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,786
My dad and I

227
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,120
used to come here sometimes,

228
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,123
and we'd skip dinner and go straight to dessert.

229
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,793
Bread pudding it is, then. All right.

230
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,628
I'm so excited

231
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,697
to be exploring D.C. with you.

232
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,705
What's wrong?

233
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,709
That's my old ballet teacher.

234
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,614
I haven't seen him since I quit dance.

235
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,408
May I?

236
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,278
Sorry. I hope that it's okay
that I'm here. I just wanted

237
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,815
to get a little practice in
before the showcase tonight.

238
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,282
No need to apologize.

239
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,351
Pirouettes used to be tricky for me, too.

240
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,053
My old dance teacher taught me

241
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,990
to imagine a string, right, from the crown

242
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,626
of my head pulling me all the way up

243
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,494
to the ceiling.

244
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,997
Yeah.

245
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,366
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

246
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,537
Why'd you pick me?

247
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:16,476
I feel like I'm playing catch-up
to everybody else here.

248
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,245
I was the best at my old dance studio.

249
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,346
But here?

250
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,381
I'm not the skinniest

251
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,284
or the most flexible. I don't
even have the best feet.

252
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,723
My dad wants me to be a lawyer like him.

253
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,494
You know, my mom was a lot like your dad.

254
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,998
She wanted me to be an educator just like her.

255
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,834
This whole dance world never made sense to her.

256
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,570
But I fought to be a part of it.

257
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,806
Just like you did.

258
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,011
Stacey, I chose you because I saw a fire in you

259
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,913
that I recognized in myself.

260
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,652
Try again.

261
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,823
Try again.

262
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,934
Our new neighbors are just like you.

263
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,036
Hey.

264
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,370
Where's Sophie?

265
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,806
She's on the phone with her mom.

266
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,640
Well, do you think my feet are too big?

267
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,543
No. There's just more of you to love.

268
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,216
Are you gonna say something about my weight?

269
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,084
Do you want me to?

270
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,054
No.

271
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,523
You gonna say something about my drinking?

272
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,093
Do you want me to?

273
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,497
No.

274
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,502
L.A.'s been tough.

275
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,806
I joined an acting class,

276
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,641
you know, hoping it would help me.

277
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,810
That's great, Kev.

278
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:00,180
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, but now you want to tell me

279
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,514
what's really going on?

280
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,020
Kevin.

281
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,527
I met this girl.

282
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,832
And she was really cool,
so we started hanging out.

283
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,767
You know, I've been lonely

284
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,171
because, between Sophie's
classes and my auditions,

285
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,638
you know, we don't get much time to talk.

286
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,741
Kevin, what did you do?

287
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,880
It was just one time.

288
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,815
I swear.

289
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,152
Oh, my God.

290
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,788
Oh, God, Kevin. K-K...

291
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,991
How could you do this to Sophie?

292
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,026
How could you do that? She loves you so much.

293
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,095
Don't you think I know that?

294
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,298
I can't even look at her, Kate.

295
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,732
Every time I'm in the same room as her,

296
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,034
I feel like I'm gonna throw up from the guilt.

297
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,103
Good.

298
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,509
-You need to tell her.
-No.

299
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,011
It will kill her, Kate.

300
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,678
What if she doesn't forgive me?

301
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,347
Okay, well, what...? So, what do you expect?

302
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,016
What... What am I supposed to do?

303
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,517
I'm supposed to keep this from her now?

304
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,185
She's one of my best friends.

305
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,221
And I'm your brother.

306
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,824
This is incredible. Everything looks so real.

307
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,492
Yeah. The first time Kev brought me backstage--

308
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,829
You wouldn't believe it--
The host of Survivor was there.

309
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,265
-Jeff Probst?
-Jeff mother-lovin' Probst.

310
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,167
-What did you do?
-Uh, I freaked out.

311
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,069
I spilled my cold brew from crafty all over him.

312
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,570
Crafty is craft services. It's where they keep

313
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,005
-all the snacks. Yeah.
-Oh...

314
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,340
Yeah, stick with me, kid.
I'll show you the ropes.

315
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,774
-Hey! What's up?
-Hi.

316
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,843
Thanks for coming. Thanks
for coming. Thanks for coming.

317
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,679
Hi. So good to get to spend some time with you.

318
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,414
We haven't seen you since, what, breakfast?

319
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,451
-Toby.
-What? It's a joke.

320
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,853
'Cause we-we live together. Never mind. I'll get

321
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,555
-one of the writers to punch it up.
-Mm.

322
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,123
A punch-up is when the writers take a bad joke

323
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,791
-and they make it funny.
-Oh, I know.

324
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,027
I learned that from the Friends reunion.

325
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,029
Hey, I saw a gumball machine

326
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,466
on the way in. Now, are the gumballs real?

327
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,634
They are. They're real, yeah.

328
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,370
Not only that, but you
don't have to put a quarter in,

329
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,038
-so you can just have at it.
-Really?

330
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,907
-Yeah.
-Thanks. Okay. Okay, you know what?

331
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,977
I'll bring some back for the group.

332
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,211
-Thank you.
-Oh, thanks.

333
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,213
And I have to take this.

334
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,148
Sorry about the... joke.

335
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,084
-It's all right. Don't worry about it.
-Thank you.

336
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,918
Yello.

337
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:22,555
Oh, hey, Madison. Listen, I sent you

338
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,391
some flight options for
Thanksgiving. I don't know

339
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,658
if you saw or not, but I'm thinking we

340
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,260
should book early because, you know, the seats

341
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,163
tend to fill up... What-what...
What's this? You keep looking

342
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,332
at each other. What am I missing?

343
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,167
Is this an Elijah thing? Because obviously,

344
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,602
I mean, he's more than welcome to come.

345
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,804
Kevin, can we talk about this later?

346
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,472
I don't want to do this here

347
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,673
on such an important day for you.

348
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,142
No, you just want to sit here and continue

349
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,645
to share ominous looks with each other.

350
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,281
Okay, fine.

351
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,949
Um...

352
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,851
I don't want to go to the cabin.

353
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,522
I want to spend Thanksgiving with Elijah

354
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,492
here in L.A. With the twins.

355
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,830
Hey, Kevin? We need you on set.

356
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,832
Oh.

357
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,434
Perfect.

358
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,868
Um...

359
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,407
Well, hey, you know, um, to be continued.

360
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,385
We don't have to stay.

361
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,654
We can get the bread pudding to go.

362
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,624
I saw that man every day

363
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,693
from when I was 12 to 17.

364
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,129
I was his favorite,

365
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,699
until I started struggling,
and then he just dropped me.

366
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,073
When my dad died, he didn't
even pick up the damn phone.

367
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,907
Want me to go over there

368
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,576
and show him where his ballet shoes can go?

369
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,711
No.

370
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,916
But I will.

371
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,723
Hey. I'm right here.

372
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,402
Bethany.

373
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:19,172
It's so nice to see you. How long has it been?

374
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,341
Uh, 23 months.

375
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,111
Wow. That long, huh?

376
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,213
Well, you look well.

377
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,517
So, w-what have you been up to? Fill me in.

378
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,685
Um...

379
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,587
I'm an architecture major at CMU.

380
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,626
That's wonderful. I always
knew you had a bright mind.

381
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,797
Why don't you stop by the
studio one of these days.

382
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,166
The girls would love to see you.

383
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,737
-Sure.
-Yeah.

384
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,472
Great.

385
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,311
Take care.

386
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,150
Um...

387
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,219
Let's just forget about the bread pudding and go.

388
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,787
Let's go.

389
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,322
Yeah.

390
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,125
All right, let's go.

391
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,966
Hey, phones off, now.

392
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,169
-Hey, guys. You made it.
-Hey.

393
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,636
How you feeling?

394
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,005
Excited and terrified.

395
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,774
Which for some reason

396
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,742
is making me have to pee a lot, you know.

397
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,344
It's like I'm about to get onstage and perform.

398
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,246
But this should be the easy part for you.

399
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,614
You already done all the hard work.

400
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:35,848
Now, you just sit back and watch.

401
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,917
That's what I thought, but when you perform,

402
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,319
it's like you have some control.

403
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,820
Now, I'm just the lady waiting in the wings,

404
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,356
hoping everything goes well.

405
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,160
I can't fail at this again,
Randall. I just... I can't.

406
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,928
You won't.

407
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,299
I'm sorry. "You won't" is not good enough.

408
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,700
Okay? I don't mean

409
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,934
to put too much pressure on you, baby,

410
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,469
but I'm freaking out right now,

411
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,471
and I'm gonna need one of
your all-time greatest pep talks,

412
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,507
and I'm gonna need it now.

413
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,309
Beth Pearson, you're an incredible human being...

414
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,811
Damn it. I got to pee again, baby. I'm so sorry.

415
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:05,878
Okay.

416
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,318
Not to brag, but...

417
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,320
I think we may have Emeril beat.

418
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,987
Emeril should be watching us on TV.

419
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,992
Well, at least we don't
have to worry about dessert,

420
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,329
since Matt is bringing his "famous" pumpkin pie

421
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,331
to the Thanksgiving he invited himself to.

422
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,733
What? I invited him.

423
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,135
Yeah, well, he didn't really
give you much of a choice,

424
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,238
did he? I mean, what else were you gonna do?

425
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,872
This needs some brown sugar.

426
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,481
What's going on down there?

427
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,015
You know, they've been crying for hours.

428
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,251
They're gonna grow up to sound

429
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,152
like Gilbert Gottfried, aren't they?

430
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,420
Aren't they?

431
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,388
Are you okay?

432
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,756
Let me help.

433
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,558
I knew this wouldn't go over well.

434
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,760
It's a lot to spring on him.

435
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,596
Maybe it's just easier if I
bring the twins to the cabin.

436
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,198
...for the next Marvel
superhero movie. I think I've got this.

437
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,604
You know, I just, I want to be
a good dad to my kids, is all.

438
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,672
I-I want to be the best dad

439
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,173
to my kids 'cause...

440
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
that's what my kids deserve.

441
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,110

Earth to Kate!

446
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,121
Oh. What? Did you say something?

447
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,525
Yes. I said that I brought
my Thelma & Louise DVD.

448
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,793
Rewatch session tonight?

449
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,628
Sure. I mean,

450
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,563
you know I can't resist Brad Pitt in those jeans.

451
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,334
Kevin's being weird.

452
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,170
What do you think is going on?

453
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,574
Have you noticed the drinking?

454
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,477
Yeah. Yeah.

455
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,413
I, um...

456
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,615
You know, I-I think he's-he's...

stressed about career stuff.

458
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,620
It's taking a lot longer than he'd hoped it would

459
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,822
to get started with the acting stuff.

460
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,160
Yeah, you're-you're probably right.

461
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,163
Thanks, Thelma.

462
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,666

-We about to kick Thanksgiving's ass.
-Hear, hear.

468
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,320
Salud.

469
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,989
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

470
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,325
Oh, Mrs. Pearson, Matt is so sweet.

471
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,161
-I'm happy for you.
-Thanks.

472
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,664
-Do you see it going the distance?
-Oh.

473
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,700
I don't know. We're having fun.

474
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,502
Wow. What a rave.

475
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,872
He's a nice guy, and

476
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,174
we're having a good time. I mean, it's...

477
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,510
it's not the great romance that you two have,

478
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,546
but that's once-in-a-lifetime stuff.

479
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,016
This jet lag's killing me. I'm gonna go lay down.

480
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,485
Okay.

481
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,898
Are you mad at me about something?

482
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,065
No. Of course not.

483
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,368
Then-then what is it?

484
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,575
Soph, I made a horrible mistake

485
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,243
that I'll regret for the rest of my life.

486
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,515
What?

487
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,618
It happened one time,
and it didn't mean anything.

488
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,157
The girl from your acting class?

489
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,959
Yes.

490
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,234
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

491
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,369
You are all that matters to me, okay?

492
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,605
The last thing I'd want to do is hurt you.

493
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,908
Okay, I... I knew that something
was wrong. I even asked Kate.

494
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,077
Don't be mad at Kate. I
begged her not to say anything.

495
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,850
I-I'm sorry,

496
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,685
Kate knew?

497
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,086
I had to tell somebody. Sophie,

498
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,354
it was, it was eating me up inside.

499
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,890
That must've been really hard for you.

500
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:11,891
No.

501
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,594
No, that's not what I... Soph...

502
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,901
Here he comes.

503
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,470
Kevin, that was amazing.

504
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,971
-Thanks.
-You improv'ed

505
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,706
that Mount Everest joke, didn't you?

506
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,140
'Cause I told Elijah I could tell...

507
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,909
You are aware that Thanksgiving
is my family's holy day,

508
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,378
-right?
-We're doing this here.

509
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,114
Guys, the prop guy said
that this thing costs $20,000.

510
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,316
Yeah, that's right. It does,
and it's not a toy, so...

511
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,151
Oh. Sorry.

512
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,488
This is what you want? This
is how you want to do things?

513
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,055
Just, you know, split up the holidays

514
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,624
like-like, what, we're some,

515
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,325
we're some angry divorced couple

516
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,894
that can't stand to be in the
same room as one another?

517
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,663
-This is what you want for our kids?
-Of course not.

518
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,331
-That's not fair...
-Kevin, it-- Kevin, it's my fault.

519
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,333
All right? I'm the one that invited Maddy

520
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,335
-for Thanksgiving...
-You know what, Elijah? The only man allowed to speak

521
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,104
is the one holding the
jelly baby, and that is me.

522
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,840
Don't be rude to him, okay?

523
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,609
I am not trying to keep the kids away

524
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,811
-from you.
-Well, you could've fooled me.

525
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,614
A-And by the way, I just-- you know,

526
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,516
I got to say, I think...

527
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,150
I think it's really selfish

528
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,519
that you could be robbing my mother

529
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,587
of what could possibly be her last

530
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,022
good Thanksgiving with the twins.

531
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,291
Kevin,

532
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,927
I am well aware

533
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,929
of how big of a deal this is for you, okay?

534
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,130
Kate thought it would be best

535
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,464
if I told you after the first taping...

536
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,500
Yeah, no, a-and thank you for that, Kate.

537
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:28,968
-I appreciate it.
-Kevin...

538
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,270
You know what? Here,
Elijah, just, you know, just--

539
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,039
It's... it's all yours.

540
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,610
I'm sorry about that.

541
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,311
No.

542
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,880
Don't be.

543
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,119
Soph?

544
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,221
Hey. Hey. Soph.

545
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,990
Soph, where are you going?

546
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,560
Kevin told me everything.
Thanks for having my back.

547
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:56,195
Sophie, I-- Sophie, I'm sorry.

548
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,498
I'm... What was I supposed
to do? He's my brother.

549
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,501
Got it.

550
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,170
Tell your mom I said bye, okay?

551
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,072
No, hey, Sophie, listen,
you don't have to go like this.

552
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,275
Bye, Kate.

553
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,696
Are you okay?

554
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,965
No. I'm not okay.

555
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm eating gluten-free cookies
that taste like cardboard.

556
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,535
I'm pretty far from okay.

557
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,137
What was that back there, by the way?

558
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,105
You didn't have my back at all.

559
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,306
Oh, that's rich.

560
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,076
Kev, I've had your back our entire lives,

561
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,712
and it hasn't exactly been a cakewalk.

562
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,248
Okay? You take one step
forward and 16 steps back.

563
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,050
-That's not fair.
-Okay,

564
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,885
so you're finally supportive
of Madison and Elijah,

565
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,219
but when it comes to your holiday plans,

566
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,821
16 steps back.

567
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,056
No. Look, that's...

568
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,625
Kev, you needed my support, right?

569
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,460
So, I let you crash at our place,

570
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,962
even though it's not great
for our marriage right now.

571
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,765
Madison needs my support, too.

572
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,166
But I also would like...

573
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:43,002
No, Kev. You didn't fall in love.

574
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,837
Right? You couldn't say it.

575
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:47,239
So, you expect her to lug babies on an airplane

576
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,975
to go see your family?

577
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,242
Come on, have a little more respect

578
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,244
for the woman who's raising your kids.

579
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,147
She just wants a quiet Thanksgiving

580
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:56,649
with the kids where she can create

581
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:57,850
her own holiday traditions.

582
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,586
-Yeah, with Elijah.
-Yeah, with Elijah.

583
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,322
Who is a good man who
is falling in love with her--

584
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,624
Something she's never experienced before--

585
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,093
And she should be able to enjoy that

586
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,627
without being made to feel guilty.

587
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,401
Yeah.

588
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,671
Yeah.

589
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,944
I'm s-- I know that you always
have my back. I know that.

590
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,646
Yeah, I do.

591
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,549
And if-if you and Toby need
your space, just... tell me.

592
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,984
Yeah, Kev,

593
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,486
that's-that's not even our problem right now.

594
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,856
We have a lot more going on than that.

595
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,900
Oh, God.

596
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,692
Are you hurt?

597
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,227
I don't think so.

598
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,796
Okay. Let's get you up.

599
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,532
I can't.

600
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,467
I'm sorry.

601
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,303
I let you down. I let...

602
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,972
I let them all down.

603
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,911
You know, when I was dancing, I fell.

604
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:09,648
It was a different kind
of fall, bigger than this.

605
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,786
I felt so alone.

606
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,326
Stacey, I want you to know

607
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,795
that I will sit with you on this stage

608
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,431
until everyone in this audience gets bored

609
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,434
and tired and leaves one by one.

610
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,536
Or...

611
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,306
...you can get up,

612
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,076
you can start again,

613
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,111
and I'll be waiting for you right offstage

614
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,346
after you take your bow.

615
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,282
Either way, know two things,

616
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:47,186
you cannot disappoint me.

617
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,690
And I ain't going nowhere.

618
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:58,831
You're gonna forget a lot about these years,

619
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,032
but look at your mother,

620
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,869
right now, and remember this.

621
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:05,171
Don't you ever forget

622
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,373
how incredible that woman is.

623
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,645
Take it from the top, okay?

624
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,815
All right. Let's go.

625
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:50,049
Kevin, it is late, and I am too tired to argue.

626
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,184
No, I know. It's-it's not that.

627
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:53,886
I-I just came by to say...

628
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,990
...that I think you should celebrate Thanksgiving

629
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,725
however you want to celebrate Thanksgiving.

630
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,395
I mean that. The last thing you need

631
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,264
is a cross-country trip to, what,

632
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,566
witness 50 Pearsons watch Police Academy 3

633
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,836
for the 300th time and argue over an old hat?

634
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,538
Thank you.

635
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,841
You were good out there today.

636
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,078
You stole the show from a guy half your age.

637
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,380
-That is a feat.
-Yeah. Well, thank you.

638
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,682
-He's three-quarters my age, but...
-Hmm...

639
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,217
-Yeah... Okay.
-I don't know...

640
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,518
-Well, thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

641
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,955
-Have a good night. All right.
-Good night.

642
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,095
Hey, Kevin.

643
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,796
Hey.

644
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:41,267
Oh, listen, um, Madison and I talked, and, um,

645
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,868
Thanksgiving's all yours, man, so...

646
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,370
Everything's good.

647
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,637
That was real decent of you. Thank you.

648
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:49,308
You're welcome. No problem, no problem.

649
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,576
Is that it? We good?

650
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:55,914
Listen, um...

651
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:59,651
I'm painfully aware that
people see me as the nice guy.

652
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,253
Oh, come on, this isn't necessary.

653
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,788
Yeah, I-I'm not done.

654
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,825
I'm also well aware that Maddy

655
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:10,096
is eons out of my league, but she likes me.

656
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,332
She actually likes me.

657
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,667
And...

658
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:18,337
I like her. Oh, man, more than you know.

659
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,139
No, no, I'm-I'm getting the gist.

660
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,474
Yeah, right. I-I guess what I'm saying is...

661
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,678
...I hope you're not biding your time

662
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,948
and playing nice because
you think I'm going away.

663
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:32,384
Because if you are...

664
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,455
...you're gonna be waiting a long time.

665
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,828
Point taken.

666
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:46,698
Okay. Okay.

667
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,134
Thanks.

668
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,302
-Later, man.
-Yup.

669
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:01,547
Thanks again for all your help.
You are one hell of a sous-chef,

670
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,849
-Miguel.
-Oh, that would be one hell of a compliment,

671
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:07,386
-except I'm pretty sure that you're my sous-chef?
-Mm.

672
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,687
-No. You are.
-Really?

673
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,990
-Yeah.
-I think that... Mm.

674
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,159
Okay.

675
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:17,296
Um, I'm sorry about earlier.

676
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,132
The little digs at Matt. Way out of line.

677
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,668
He seems like a really nice guy.

678
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,403
-He really does.
-Your opinion

679
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,305
matters a lot to me, you know?

680
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,575
And I hate to break it to you,

681
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:33,712
but you're-you're basically
my best friend, Miguel.

682
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,150
Back at you.

683
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,421
Oh, um, I was thinking,

684
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,491
I'd like to invite Marguerite
to Thanksgiving, too.

685
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,259
-If that's okay?
-Oh.

686
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:48,927
I thought Marguerite was old news.

687
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,996
Yeah, well, Marguerite made a comeback.

688
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,132
Turns out she has a hell of a golf swing.

689
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,836
Well, good for Marguerite.

690
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,871
Yeah. I look forward to meeting her.

691
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,940
-Great. Okay.
-Okay.

692
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,189
Hmm.

693
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,525
Kev, Kev, Kev. Shh, shh, shh.

694
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,527
Could we just keep the jam sessions

695
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,195
to the daylight hours, please? I'm still working

696
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,197
-out here.
-No problem. Sorry.

697
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,966
Sorry. Oh, hey. Real quick
tip. Just brother to brother,

698
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,235
that whole Bluetooth thing?

699
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,737
It's driving Kate crazy.

700
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:35,641
-Thanks for the heads-up.
-No problem.

701
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,309
You know, in fact, uh, just a little tip for you.

702
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,245
The reason I'm out here
pacing around on my Bluetooth

703
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,047
is because I usually take
these phone calls in this room.

704
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,216
The room that you're
currently using as an Airbnb.

705
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,985
-So that's...
-Okay. I was just trying to help you out, man.

706
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,887
-Uh-huh.
-All right? But if you want me to leave,

707
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,923
uh, you just say the word. I can...

708
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,426
You have a good night, Kevin.

709
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,095
-Okay. You have a good night. Okay.
-Okay. All right.

710
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,745
Girls are upstairs

711
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,848
giving you rave reviews between flossing.

712
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,851
-Our girls?
-Mm-hmm.

713
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,653
You coming up?

714
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,721
Yeah. I'm right behind you.

715
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,574
Whitmore Ballet
Academy. Vincent speaking.

716
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,076
Hi, Vincent.

717
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,978
It's Beth.

718
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,380
Bethany Clarke.

719
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,882
Um, well, Pearson now, but, um...

720
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,718
I used to be a student of yours.

721
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,887
Well, Bethany. How wonderful to hear from you.

722
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,056
Still burning the candle at both ends, huh?

723
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,759
Well, I wish I could say I
pulled back over the years,

724
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,394
but, uh, here I am.

725
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:45,297
My wife is not pleased.

726
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:48,567
Um, how have you been?

727
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,237
I'm well. I'm really well. In fact,

728
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,106
I'm the head of new student
recruitment and development

729
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,309
for the City Ballet of Philadelphia.

730
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,411
Wow. Would you look at that?

731
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,948
I always knew you'd go far, Bethany.

732
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,016
I always saw that in you.

733
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,956
Was there, um, something else?

734
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,925
Yeah.

735
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,994
Um...

736
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,870
I was with you every single day, Vincent.

737
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,606
During my formative years,

738
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,977
you were my sun and my moon and...

739
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,213
Hell, you were like a god
to me, if I'm being honest.

740
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,848
And...

741
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,652
It meant so much that you chose me

742
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,988
out of all the other girls to be your favorite.

743
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:47,025
That confidence you had in me meant everything.

744
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,029
I was ready to be your star.

745
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,567
But, uh...

746
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,168
when my dad died

747
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:00,071
and I couldn't perform up to your standards,

748
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,740
you just...

749
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,209
...tossed me aside.

750
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,911
You literally...

751
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,814
You literally replaced me with someone else

752
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:13,018
without a word of comfort or explanation.

753
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,986
You just...

754
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,689
didn't look back.

755
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,194
Well, I'm-I'm, uh, I'm sorry
you felt that way, Bethany,

756
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:26,998
but it wasn't my job to, uh, coddle you.

757
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,268
It was my job to give you
the technique you needed

758
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,504
-to be a star.
-Yeah. You're right.

759
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:36,207
And, um, and I probably reached my peak, but...

760
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,778
When I think about it, that...

761
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,915
...failure, it...

762
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,686
it turns my stomach like I'm on a roller coaster.

763
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,888
I...

764
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:53,559
It's the part of me that made me feel so small.

765
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:56,528
And it's the part of me that...

766
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:00,632
I tried to hide from my
husband and from my girls and...

767
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,234
It's the part of me I hated.

768
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,638
Well, Bethany, I, uh,

769
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:09,407
I-I don't know what to say.

770
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,880
I thought I would dance on
the world's biggest stages.

771
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,949
But I've learned that there is power...

772
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,654
...in waiting in the wings.

773
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:26,458
In being there for the dancers that are stars

774
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,693
and the ones that aren't.

775
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,296
I...

776
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,601
for so long had put a part of myself away.

777
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,605
But not anymore.

778
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,977
I'm the little island girl who
danced before she walked.

779
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,179
And you took that from me.

780
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,719
But now I'm taking it back.

781
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,723
I know who I am.

782
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,127
And I know what I was meant to do now.

783
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,303
Mrs. Pearson?

784
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,339
The new recruits are in the
main studio and would love to hear

785
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,374
-from you.
-Okay, thanks. I'll be right there.

786
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,209
And this came for you.

787
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,611
It's from Stacey Robins.

788
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:04,189
Don't ever forget

789
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,991
how special you are.

790
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,193
Our little island girl

791
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,362
-Who danced before she walked.
-Who danced before she walked.

792
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,933
You're going to change the world one day.

793
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,180
