00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:45,566
(laughs) It's in your phone.

175
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,274
(line ringing)

176
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:56,528
(♫ phone ringing)

177
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:58,815
-Hey.
<i>-KEVIN (over phone): Hey.</i>

178
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,342
What're you doing?

179
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,299
Well, I'm officially at my lowest point

180
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,484
since the divorce was final last month.

181
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:07,275
Matty left for five days with Ryan, and...

182
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:10,094
currently cleaning up his Pokémon cards

183
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,224
and trying not to cry.

184
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,409
Um, listen, I have an idea.

185
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,034
Why don't you

186
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,905
come out with me to the cabin this weekend?

187
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,115
There's an extra room, and
Uncle Nicky's supervising

188
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,305
the construction. I'm sure he'd be...

189
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,565
happy to see you.

190
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,121
<i>Oh, and he's bringing his new girlfriend.</i>

191
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,207
Uh... I mean, yeah, I could...

192
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,994
I could do that, maybe.

193
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:34,580
Wait, is this a sex thing?

194
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:35,974
<i>Oh!</i>

195
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:39,027
(stammers) Um... No.

196
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,951
No? I mean,

197
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:42,377
<i>we are both adults, right,</i>

198
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:44,606
<i>who have slept with each other in the past.</i>

199
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,492
Uh, we're both very single,

200
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:48,118
both very lonely.

201
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,009
<i>I don't know. What's-what's your temperature</i>

202
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,545
<i>on this being a sex thing?</i>

203
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,825
I mean, I could go either way.

204
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,085
It'd be nice to know, though,

205
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,380
'cause it'll change my packing and grooming.

206
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:59,372
<i>Of course. Yeah.</i>

207
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,727
I mean, am I open to it? Yes.

208
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,818
Am I expecting it? No.

209
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,007
Did I ask you with that in mind?

210
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,463
No, but then-then you said,

211
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:10,354
"Is this a sex thing," and I-I...

212
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:11,846
-I perked up.
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

213
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,524
Send me the address. I'll be
there by tomorrow afternoon.

214
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,451
See you there.

215
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:20,639
<i>RANDALL: Hey! Greetings,</i>

216
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,335
wife of mine.

217
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,658
-How's things?
-(inhales sharply)

218
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:26,283
Hmm...

219
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,824
Mm... Mm.

220
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:33,317
-Whoa.
-Mm.

221
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,937
-Good day?
-Good day?

222
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,729
Not really.

223
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:39,554
I'd say it was a borderline crappy day.

224
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:41,512
There's meetings and red tape,

225
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:44,365
lackluster lunch salad.
-I keep telling you, you have

226
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,891
-to have a carb at lunch, baby.
-Yes.

227
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:48,413
-I told you that. Get a potato in there somewhere.
-(chuckles)

228
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,152
But it is Friday night,

229
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:51,873
and I have the entire weekend ahead of me

230
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,003
with my beautiful, overworked wife.

231
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,409
Including a romantic dinner tomorrow night

232
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:59,359
at the Thai spot on 9th
Street with that branzino.

233
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,081
Ooh, the branzino. That's a sexy fish.

234
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:04,038
<i>Okay, and after that, I'm thinking maybe we</i>

235
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,096
do a little dancing. What? What?
-No. No.

236
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,688
I'm gonna have to burst this fantasy bubble

237
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:08,883
before I get too depressed.

238
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,807
We can't do tomorrow night.

239
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,770
Sí, se puede. We can, and we must. Why? Why?

240
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:16,779
Um, because Deja said that
Malik is in town for 24 hours

241
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,590
and wants to have dinner with us tomorrow night_

242
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,450
Correction, make dinner for us tomorrow night.

243
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,116
He wants to make us dinner?

244
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:25,106
-Mm-hmm.
-What's his game?

245
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,744
I don't know, but it smells
a little branzino to me.

246
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,404
Huh.

247
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,588
Well, maybe it's an apology

248
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,131
for participating in her secret trip to Boston

249
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:36,852
and the lying and the...
stuff I don't like to talk about.

250
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:39,605
I hope it's an apology, but I don't know.

251
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,094
-Hmm.
-Kind of feel like we need to...

252
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:44,277
"worst case scenario" this bish.

253
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,942
You go.

254
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:47,618
Okay.

255
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,345
Well, obviously,

256
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,380
-she's pregnant. Go.
-(scoffs) God.

257
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:53,669
-They went to Vegas...
-Mm-hmm.

258
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,825
...and eloped while we were sleeping.

259
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:58,637
-Not preggo, just married. You go.
-Okay.

260
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,932
Malik brings out dessert and
there's an engagement ring

261
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:03,324
in Deja's soufflé,

262
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:06,025
and he proposes to her in front of all of us.

263
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:07,752
He pulls me out onto the back porch

264
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,992
before he proposes to ask
for permission, and, uh...

265
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,082
I don't know, he chooses the back porch because

266
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:16,068
we've had some really good talks out there...
-Play the game, Randall.

267
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:17,941
-Um...
-(knocks on table)

268
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,685
You go.

269
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,742
Deja wants to adopt Malik's daughter,

270
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:25,516
and they move in here
together and live with us forever.

271
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:33,345
-We need a new game.
-Mm-hmm.

272
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:36,339
 -(sighs)

273
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,263
All right.

274
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,888
What do you think?

275
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,850
Hat or no hat?

276
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,439
Uh, no hat.

277
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,232
Guys in hats are usually trying
to hide their hair, and you have

278
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:47,748
-great hair.
-Oh.

279
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,484
I really like your curls.

280
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:51,208
What about my lipstick, is it too much?

281
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,528
No. (stammers) You look, um...

282
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,759
very nice.

283
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,147
(groans) It's too much.

284
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,608
-Okay.
-(sighs)

285
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,963
-(sighs)
-All right.

286
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:02,579
You ready for this?

287
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,518
Not at all.

288
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,722
-(♪ bell dings)
-Okay, let's see, um...

289
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,172
I have three children,

290
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:10,947
all the same age,

291
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:14,120
and I currently live with my daughter.

292
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:16,812
-(♪ bell dings)
-Actually, I'm-I'm not divorced.

293
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:18,977
I'm a widow, actually.

294
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,299
I know, sad, sad, sad.

295
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,355
-(♪ bell dings)
-There was a fire,

296
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,977
and our whole house burned down. (chuckles)

297
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,731
We lost almost everything.

298
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:30,856
-(♪ bell dings)
-He didn't even die in the fire.

299
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,644
He died of a heart attack in the hospital after.

300
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:35,234
-(♪ bell dings)
-He saved the dog. (chuckles)

301
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,125
-(♪ bell dings)
-They call it a widowmaker.

302
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:40,111
-(♪ bell dings) -I wasn't even in
the room. I was eating a candy bar.

303
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:42,998
-(♪ bell dings)
-I don't think I'm doing great.

304
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,054
Yeah, me neither.

305
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,349
Oh, by the way, I'm Miguel,

306
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:48,737
and I'm divorced.

307
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,239
I live in a different state from
my kids, and they hate me.

308
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:53,286
Oh, hi, Miguel. I'm Rebecca.

309
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,594
I'm a widow who can't seem

310
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:58,368
to stop talking about her husband's death.

311
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:00,813
-(♪ bell dings)
-Oh, um,

312
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:03,799
if this next one's a dud,
can we just get out of here?

313
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,068
-Deal. (chuckles)
-Great.

314
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:08,031
See you soon.

315
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:18,431
<i>-REBECCA: Hi! </i>
-Rebecca.

316
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:19,593
Matt Dickson,

317
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,323
from the PTA.
-Oh

318
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,080
It's nice to see you again.

319
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:25,840
It's good to see you, too.

320
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,831
How are you?

321
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:28,958
(laughs)

322
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,750
Okay, so, today is officially

323
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,704
-take most of your family to work day.
-(laughs)

324
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,295
I brought Jack

325
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,008
and Hailey and my mom, Rebecca.
-Hi.

326
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,973
Yeah, and she's actually
a really great piano player.

327
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,794
-I'm okay. (chuckles)
<i>-KATE: No, she's really great.</i>

328
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:48,315
So, I figured, for our jam
session today, we could have

329
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,107
a guest musician.

330
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:52,376
What do you think, Mom?

331
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:55,566
Oh, my God.

332
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,857
They're gonna kill you.

333
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,368
<i>When are you gonna tell them?</i>

334
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,226
We're thinking right before dessert.

335
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,819
Malik's making blueberry pie.

336
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:02,681
Smart.

337
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,075
You got to butter them up beforehand.

338
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:05,335
Stroke their egos a little bit.

339
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,658
Ask about Dad's addiction initiative thing.

340
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:08,918
He loves talking about that.

341
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:11,120
Annie, you still got knock-knock jokes?

342
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,033
I feel like I've aged out of knock-knock jokes.

343
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,253
Well, if I need help,

344
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,337
I'll give you the signal, okay?

345
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,494
(footsteps approaching)

346
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,424
What are you ladies conferencing about?

347
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,449
-Algebra. -Knock-knock jokes.
-Nothing.

and then you slept with her?

-Mm-hmm.

Wow, and how do you feel about that?

460

It seems impossible to me, but, um...

461
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,953

524
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,714
-Yeah, sure. Yeah.
-Yeah?

525
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:45,679
Let's go.

526
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,214
(sighs)

527
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,333
(water continues pouring)

528
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:55,727
MALIK: There you go.

529
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:58,042
BETH: Gnocchi looks...

530
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,861
excellent, Malik.

531
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:04,180
Thank you. Everybody, please, dig in.

532
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:12,143
<i>(Beth clears throat)</i>

533
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:14,300
MALIK: Um...

534
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,028
We had wanted to apologize

535
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,872
for the weekend that Deja came to Boston.

536
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:23,258
We should've handled that differently for sure.

537
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,144
I know that you guys have
already spoken with Deja, but...

538
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:28,202
I wanted to get a chance
to look you both in the eyes

539
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,901
and apologize myself as well.

540
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:34,188
It was definitely a mutual decision.

541
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:40,009
Thank you for saying that, Malik.

542
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,107
And may I just say

543
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:43,956
that, um... this is

544
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,400
the best butter sauce I've ever tasted, so...

545
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:48,957
Thank you. Brown butter.

546
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:52,948
Um, Mom, how's it going at the dance studio?

547
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:55,568
-I'd love to hear about it.
-What? -That's very nice, Tess.

548
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,832
It's unusually nice, Tess. Yeah, work is fine.

549
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,745
Busy, finding my way, but...

550
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,304
You know...

551
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,246
it's good. Thanks for asking,

552
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:08,091
for the very first time ever.

553
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:12,115
Does anyone want to hear a knock-knock joke?

554
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:14,440
-Okay, what's going on?
<i>-RANDALL: Hmm...</i>

555
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,913
-DEJA: What? What?
-MALIK: What?

556
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:17,319
You two are making eyes at each other,

557
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,980
and not the normal lovey-dovey eyes,

558
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:20,952
okay, it's the "we're up to something" eyes.

559
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:24,079
And Tess is showing
unusual interest in things she is

560
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,658
off-the-charts uninterested in, and I ain't heard

561
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:28,637
a knock-knock joke in this
house for a clean seven years,

562
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,175
so what's going_ You're tugging your ear.

563
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,067
-Why's she tugging her ear?
What's tugging that ear?
-RANDALL: What's she doing?

564
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,826
-I'm getting a C in Algebra.
-RANDALL: What?

565
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,119
But you've been working with a tutor. What the...

566
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,877
It's a tactic. It's all tactics.

567
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,600
-They're tactics. Spill it.
-Yeah, you right.

568
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,625
Now.

569
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:45,603
I'm finishing out this
school semester next month,

570
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:48,615
and I'm moving to Boston with Malik.

571
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:57,170
Knock, knock!

572
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,846
(engine turns off)

573
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,240
-Thank you for the coffee.
-Oh, you're welcome.

574
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,793
And I would've sprung for the muffin.

575
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,129
Oh, the muffin would've been moving

576
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,983
-a little too fast for me, but...
-(chuckles)

577
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:20,205
I had a lot of fun.

578
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:22,373
-Me, too.
-Mm.

579
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:24,230
A-And next time we go out,

580
00:22:24,264 --> 00:22:26,486
I promise I won't make you
date seven guys beforehand.

581
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:28,058
(both laughing)

582
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,685
Deal.

583
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:36,671
I'll call you.

584
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:38,628
I'd like that.

585
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:46,989

<i>-KATE: Are you still on the boat?</i>

597
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:29,059
No. I'm actually walking back
to the car, and for the record,

598
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:32,799
it was not a canoe. Legit yacht.

599
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,654
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

600
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,050
No.

601
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,904
We're at the school with my mom, and she's...

602
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,953
so happy.

603
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,549
W-We're happy.

604
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:47,282
Finally in a good place and...

605
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,596
(sighs) It just took a long
time to get here, Tobe.

606
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:52,715
How many bumps in the
road? Like 30 years of bumps.

607
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:54,938
We just lost so much time.

608
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:56,696
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

609
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,138
You still have time.

610
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:00,564
Kate,

611
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,834
you-you still have a lot of time.

612
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:06,282
<i>-(applause)
-REBECCA: Nice. Sounds so good.</i>

613
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:09,072
Here... but, Tobe, I've got to tell her tonight.

614
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,211
<i>I understand</i>

615
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:11,762
<i>(sighs) I'm sorry.</i>

616
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:13,484
I love you so much.

617
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:15,199
Love you.

618
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,133
Okay.

619
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,725
-Bye.
-Bye.

620
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:21,281
<i>(♫ Rebecca playing piano)</i>

621
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:30,604
You're joking, right?

622
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:34,154
I took on three extra A. P. classes

623
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,481
this semester,

624
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:37,472
so, technically, that gives me

625
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:40,093
enough credits to graduate.

626
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:43,013
And I can take the G.E.D. in December,

627
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,467
-with your permission.
-Permission not granted.

628
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,770
-Take a breath, babe.
-Uh...

629
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:51,209
You two, go upstairs, please.

630
00:24:58,274 --> 00:25:01,260
Harvard does offer classes
for current high school students

631
00:25:01,294 --> 00:25:03,397
and students that are looking to take a year off.

632
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:05,838
It would essentially be like a gap year,

633
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,531
and then I'd apply to college in the fall.

634
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:08,824
Enough. You don't have to show us

635
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:10,517
the whole PowerPoint presentation.

636
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,259
<i>BETH: You know what, Deja, you're 17 years old.</i>

637
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,734
You're a junior in high school.

638
00:25:13,768 --> 00:25:15,228
You're not dropping out to move in

639
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,120
with your boyfriend in another state.

640
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:19,674
It wouldn't be dropping out.
It would be graduating early.

641
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:22,262
MALIK: I promise, we would
be doing a lot of studying.

642
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:24,087
I-I mean, we hold each other accountable.

643
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,509
We encourage each other.
-(laughs) I bet you do.

644
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:29,097
-That's rude.
-I'm rude?

645
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,622
I'm sorry, this whole thing is rude.

646
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,248
Y'all are rude.

647
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,670
You are not old enough to
make this kind of decision.

648
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:38,088
-Oh, now I'm not old enough?
<i>-RANDALL: What are you talking about, man?</i>

649
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:42,820
All those times you told me
I'm "wise beyond my years"?

650
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:43,921
(chuckles)

651
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:47,004
It's because I am, Randall.

652
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:51,811
I've lived a lot more life in my 17 years

653
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,697
than a lot of people twice my age,

654
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,568
and you, out of anyone in this world,

655
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:01,241
knows that best.

656
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:09,329
(chair scrapes)

657
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:10,623
-Randall.
-Hmm?

658
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:12,358
Can you take a breath and have a conversation?

659
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:15,412
-Can we do that?
-No, we can't, Beth.

660
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:19,763
'Cause I have nothing to say about any of this.

661
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:23,616
(footsteps departing)

662
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:30,305
(door noises)

663
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:34,427
Hi.

664
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:36,456
I thought you were at Molly's.

665
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:38,847
Aunt Molly was tired.

666
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,376
Whose car was that?

667
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:43,477
Uh,

668
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,894
believe it or not,

669
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,213
I was on a date.

670
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,132
You went on a date?

671
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:51,760
Well, eh, kind of. (chuckles)

672
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:55,040
Miguel and I went and did
this silly speed dating thing,

673
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,219
and I ended up running into a man

674
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,992
that I actually knew there,

675
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:00,379
and we went and had some coffee.

676
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,403
You went and got coffee until, like, 10:00?

677
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:05,492
You were the one telling me to get a life.

678
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:08,812
No, no, I told you to stop
watching that stupid show

679
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:10,107
with stupid Miguel.

680
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,628
So, what, what, you're, like, dating now?

681
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:13,757
Uh,

682
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,814
I don't know.

683
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:17,261
Look,

684
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,179
Kate, I know it's weird,

685
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,597
but I have to...

686
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,714
start to try to move on.

687
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:25,185
Oh, right. Move on from Dad,

688
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,857
because he's dead. I'm aware.

689
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:29,328
I'm sorry.

690
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:30,851
I'm sorry, yeah. I, I'm_

691
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,800
I should have been a little
bit more sensitive with you

692
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,189
when I brought it up, but I really believe

693
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:36,649
that I deserve happiness.

694
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:38,175
I think it's what your father would want.

695
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,801
In fact, I know it's what your father would want.

696
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,787
Oh, by making out with some
random dude you just met?

697
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,512
Okay, you know what?

698
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:47,565
You are on some thin ice
with me right now, young lady.

699
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:50,295
That is not what happened, and
maybe one day you'll understand.

700
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:53,347
No, Mom. No, I won't. And neither would Dad.

701
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:57,606
And he wouldn't be happy for
you running around town like a slut!

702
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:03,291
You don't know what you're talking about.

703
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,921
<i>(door slams)</i>

704
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:13,742
(sighs)

705
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,243
(sighs)

706
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:19,613
(sighs)

707
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,340
-Mom.
-Hmm?

708
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:23,462
Thank you so much for all of your help today.

709
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:25,453
Oh, my pleasure.

710
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:27,212
I had a blast.

711
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:30,196
And I learned who "Doja Cat" is.

712
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:32,783
Not a cat, but a rapper.

713
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:34,445
(chuckles)

714
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:36,236
When does Toby get in?

715
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,267
<i>Ah, in an hour.</i>

716
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:39,176
You know,

717
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,848
you both have been working so hard.

718
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:42,440
If you ever want to go have a date night,

719
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:44,729
or, you know, go out for the afternoon,

720
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:46,058
I am...

721
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,565
so happy to come over and watch the kids for you.

722
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:51,897
Actually, that's...

723
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,005
what I wanted to talk to you about.

724
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:56,375
Toby and I talked, and...

725
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,843
What? What's wrong?

726
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,166
Well, given your last PET scan,

727
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,659
we just don't feel comfortable

728
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,847
with you taking care

729
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:06,607
of the kids alone anymore.

730
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:10,124
We know that you would
never do anything intentionally.

731
00:29:10,157 --> 00:29:11,782
It's just without another adult around,

732
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:14,079
we just can't_ Mom, I'm really sorry.

733
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,422
Oh, so that's why you wanted
me to go to school with you today

734
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:20,475
instead of watching the kids here.

735
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,486
Not 'cause you actually wanted me to go with you.

736
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:25,584
No, I did want you to come.

737
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:27,665
Okay, um...

738
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:31,573
I think I'm gonna go home, Kate.

739
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:50,733
(cracks knuckles)

740
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,730
Apologies for walking out.

741
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:58,941
Didn't expect that conversation.

742
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:02,464
(scoffs)

743
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:04,572
I get it.

744
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:11,018
You know, you and I have
spent a lot of time together, Malik.

745
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,625
And, uh,

746
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:14,754
I feel like...

747
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:18,337
I've tried to impart some wisdom to you.

748
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,063
No, you-you've been great to me.

749
00:30:20,095 --> 00:30:22,930
And you're on a path, man.

750
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:26,384
You are on a great path.

751
00:30:30,182 --> 00:30:34,196
Deja needs to find her own path now, Malik.

752
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,669
She's got two big years ahead of her.

753
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,480
Two years that could
determine the rest of her life.

754
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:48,501
You need to end it, Malik.

755
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:50,150
-You need to do it for her.
-What?

756
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,638
I'm not gonna... I love her.

757
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:54,595
If you really love her, man, then you will do

758
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:56,387
what is best for her.

759
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,971
But leaving school, leaving her home...

760
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:01,596
Moving six hours away.

761
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:05,444
Moving in with an 18-year-old and his daughter.

762
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:08,995
That is not what's best for her, man.

763
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:14,057
You are a very smart young man. You know that.

764
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:23,593
I'm gonna go ahead and not tell Deja

765
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,778
about this conversation.

766
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:30,162
Because I really do love her.

767
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:34,143
And I care about you all's relationship.

768
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:38,018
And I can promise you she
would not feel good about this.

769
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:45,529
I'm just saying,

770
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,752
Bubble Gum is...

771
00:31:46,784 --> 00:31:48,643
I've just never seen anyone over the age of nine

772
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:50,135
order that before.

773
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:51,884
It's the universal worst flavor of ice cream.

774
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:55,635
Well, maybe I... like an underdog.

775
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,027
What are you doing?

776
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:04,817
I'm sorry, I thought we
said that was on the table.

777
00:32:04,818 --> 00:32:06,826
I said I might want to have sex with you.

778
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,686
I didn't say I wanted to hold your hand.

779
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:10,611
O-Okay.

780
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:13,440
Wait, hold_ Why?

781
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,268
Yes, we did, we came together

782
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,554
in a time of loneliness

783
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,727
and-and addiction.

784
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,686
But what if...

785
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,892
What if that inner darkness
actually turned out to be

786
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,651
something kind of wonderful?

787
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,314
You've watched too many rom-coms, Kevin.

788
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:33,855
I think you're scared.
-I...

789
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:35,414
I... (inhales sharply)

790
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,999
There's

791
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,361
no reality to a relationship working with us.

792
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:46,226
Your kids are in L. A. My kid is in Pennsylvania.

793
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:48,830
I know that, but look, you and
I obviously have a connection.

794
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:51,936
It's a false equivalency, Kevin.

795
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:57,616
Your... inner darkness... (clears throat)

796
00:32:57,617 --> 00:32:59,462
is not the same as mine.

797
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,727
Have you noticed that when
you text at 3:00 in the morning,

798
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:03,697
I'm always awake?

799
00:33:05,456 --> 00:33:09,070
Our darknesses are not...

800
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,953
the same.

801
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:17,634
You are chasing the wrong
blonde in the wrong city.

802
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:19,258
And if you want

803
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:23,174
that rom-com love story,

804
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:26,498
you should go make things right with her.

805
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,385
I'm not even sure I know which
blonde you're talking about,

806
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:30,512
to be honest with you.

807
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:33,127
You see how that's a problem?

808
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,183
-Yeah.
-Aw, Kevin,

809
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:36,709
you've been blowing up women's lives

810
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:39,009
for the better part of two decades.

811
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,028
-I know you mean_ Oh, come on.
-Ah!

812
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,658
I know you mean well, I do.

813
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:45,148
But, you know, you are, like, a big handsome

814
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,066
wrecking ball.

815
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,791
I'm not blowing people's lives up, no.

816
00:33:47,824 --> 00:33:49,948
Okay. All right, you married one,

817
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:51,507
and then cheated,

818
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,931
and then nearly married her again.

819
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,700
The current one, you couldn't say "I love you,"

820
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,220
but now you're obsessed
with hating the new boyfriend.

821
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:03,736
Be careful, or you're gonna blow that up, too.

822
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:09,602
I'm too messed up already.

823
00:34:09,603 --> 00:34:12,462
Leave me in peace.

824
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,743
(Dialing) (sighs)

825
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:20,638
 (sighs)

826
00:34:21,346 --> 00:34:23,204
(line ringing) -MIGUEL: Hello?
-Hi.

827
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:24,646
Hey, Rebecca!

828
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:25,858
How was the coffee?

829
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:29,076
Oh, Miguel...

830
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,365
Kate and I just got in this horrible fight.

831
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,782
She said some really terrible things to me,

832
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:36,143
and I lost it.

833
00:34:36,177 --> 00:34:40,025
I mean, I really, really, really lost my temper.

834
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:42,372
God, Miguel...

835
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:44,842
I slapped her.

836
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:48,003
Hey, it's okay. I'm-I'm here,

837
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,922
and there's no judgment.

838
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:53,229
Every once in a while a parent loses it. Okay?

839
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:56,083
Yeah, I know, but it was
just so hard to go out tonight

840
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:57,874
in the first place, you know.

841
00:34:57,908 --> 00:35:00,895
This grief, it's just so...

842
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:04,642
It's so... deep.

843
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,142
And, I don't know, it's just, (crying)

844
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:09,984
it's-it's unbearable, you know?

845
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:12,406
 <i>(crying) It's like I don't know how to do this.</i>

846
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:14,995
I don't know how to do any of this.

847
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:18,240
(sobbing)

848
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:30,224
Worst Case Scenario game needs to be retired.

849
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:32,414
And where'd you go?

850
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,316
To the stoop.

851
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,987
Next time you want to leave
me with Romeo and Juliet,

852
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:39,621
give me a little heads-up, huh?

853
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:41,770
Sorry.

854
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:44,258
I ran into Malik on his way out.

855
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,618
Oh, yeah?

856
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:48,229
Yeah. I talked to him.

857
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,174
Didn't go great.

858
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,849
What did you say?

859
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,770
I said that he should think about Deja here,

860
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:58,524
and that he should take a step back.

861
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,153
(laughs) Oh, babe.

862
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:02,458
That didn't turn out well for
Romeo and Juliet's parents.

863
00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:04,378
It's not gonna turn out well for us.

864
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:05,956
What happened with the parents? I don't remember.

865
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,648
The kids killed themselves.

866
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:09,120
That's what happened to
the parents; The children died.

867
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,733
Because they tried to keep them apart.

868
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,957
I won't let her life go off
track when she's come this far.

869
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,881
-I think we need to be firm about that.
-Mm-mm.

870
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:16,938
I don't think you understand how dangerous

871
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:19,957
the position we're in is right now.

872
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:21,741
Imagine

873
00:36:21,742 --> 00:36:22,712
that you were that age,

874
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,970
and somebody told you that you could not date me.

875
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:29,833
You're making a mistake, Randall,

876
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,059
and we'll lose our daughter.

878
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:54,621
No, you're not supposed to
respond to a text with a call.

879
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:57,243
Yeah, sorry, man, I thought
it might be an emergency.

880
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:58,598
Everything okay?

881
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,030
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

882
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,125
Everything okay with my kids?

883
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:02,419
Yeah, I just left.

884
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:05,118
Franny did that thing where
she scoots over to Nicky,

885
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:07,263
<i>you know, and kind of leans into him, like a hug.</i>

886
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:09,319
That's the, uh, the hug tackle, I call it.

887
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,079
It's the_ it's the best.

888
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:13,338
Oh, it's the best.

889
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:14,951
Uh,

890
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,865
listen, I want to tell you something. Um...

891
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:23,387
When you're buying food, or ordering food,

892
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:26,703
like a smoothie or something,

893
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:29,161
don't ask Madison if she wants one.

894
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:31,051
Just get it for her.

895
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:33,738
You know, she's-she's got
her eating issues and all that,

896
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:36,558
and, um, sometimes she says
she doesn't want something,

897
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:37,787
but she really does want something,

898
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,080
and it's just easier that way

899
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:41,835
if you just, you just get it.

900
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,081
You called just to tell me that?

901
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:49,703
I texted you, but yeah.

Can I come in?

905
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:11,467
Of course. Yeah.

906

(Rebecca sighs)

907
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,297
Mom, I'm really sorry.

908
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,433
No, I overreacted.

909
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:40,265
I'm very sensitive about all of this and...

910
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:42,918
what can I say?

911
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:45,539
But I shouldn't have snapped at you.

912
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:49,057
Snap at me all you want.

913
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:51,942
I did it to you for years.

914
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:54,893
I took everything out on you.

915
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,942
And I'm really deeply sorry.

916
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:02,494
I feel like I wasted so much time with you

917
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:04,993
that could have been really great.

918
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:07,913
And now that we are finally great,

919
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:11,663
it's jus... the timing sucks.

920
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,525
Yeah.

921
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:19,194
Timing is everything, isn't it?

922
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,848
KATE (whispers): Yeah.

923
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,530
Your father walked into a bar

924
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,883
when I happened to be singing.

925
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:30,932
I mean, if not for that timing,
then none of any of this.

926
00:39:34,244 --> 00:39:37,281
And then four gazillion
other things had to happen

927
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:40,496
in order for this to happen right now.

928
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:43,835
For me to be sitting here with you...

929
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:46,372
with my daughter.

930
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:49,449
My girl.

Wondering...

933
00:39:56,236 --> 00:40:00,244
what the hell she has in that mystery folder.

934
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:03,520
I was wondering if you would be willing

935
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:05,942
to teach Jack piano.

936
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:10,252
It's braille sheet music.

937
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,648
I know that music is

938
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:17,347
