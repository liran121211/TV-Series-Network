00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,293
- MATT: Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

180
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,628
- Matt.
- (chuckles)

181
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,733
Firm handshake.
You own your own house?

182
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,635
- MATT: I mean, it's a town house.
- Oh, man,

183
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,269
this is gonna be a good one.

184
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,905
TOBY: Hey!

185
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,407
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- RANDALL: Hello, family.

186
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,310
The Black Pearsons have arrived
for Thanksgiving.

187
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,278
(imitates airhorn blowing)

188
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,112
- KATE: So good to see you.
- (knocking on door)

189
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,585
- REBECCA: Hi. Oh...
- Ah.

190
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,754
- Mwah. Hi, I'm Marguerite.
- (chuckles)

191
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,656
I've been waiting
an eternity to meet you.

192
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,958
- You are stunning.
- Oh.

193
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,527
Miguel talks about you
all the time.

194
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,437
REBECCA (laughs):
Oh, come on in. Hi, thank you.

195
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,197
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

196
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,834
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

197
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,169
- REBECCA: Come in, come in.
- Right on.

198
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,805
- Oh, you remember Matt, right?
- Oh, yeah.

199
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,483
- Yeah. Hey. Hey, Miguel. Yeah.
- Hey. Good to see you.

200
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,676
Hmm.

201
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,545
- REBECCA: Um...
- That was awkward, right?

202
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,980
- Yeah, there's a lot going on here.
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,149
- ADULT RANDALL: Hey, Kate.
- ADULT KATE: Yeah.

204
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:06,119
Tell the story of Mom making us
those homemade turkey costumes.

205
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,621
Oh, my gosh, okay,
they were so cute,

206
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,456
but there were so many ruffles.

207
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,191
Like, you couldn't even
move your arms.

208
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,393
- (laughter)
- Hey, guys?

209
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,697
Um, so after dinner, I'd love
to have a little family talk.

210
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,199
Just the four of us and Miguel.

211
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,201
It's so rare that we're all
together like this.

212
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,203
It's nothing bad, I just...

213
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,674
I want to go over
a few things, okay?

214
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,319
- Okay. - Yeah, of course, Mom.
- Of course. Yeah, yeah.

215
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,647
- You got it.
- Cool. Yep.

216
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,517
Yep. It's gonna be a hell
of a Thanksgiving.

217
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,587
♪

218
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,730
Okay.

219
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,665
JANET: Ooh.

220
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:52,766
(inhales)

221
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,602
Did you add
the secret ingredient?

222
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,838
I did not, 'cause you didn't
tell me what it is.

223
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,007
- I didn't?
- No.

224
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,176
- You did not, and you know that.
- Ah. Well...

225
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,445
So, have you found
your wedding dress?

226
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,181
'Cause I can dig through
my closet for mine.

227
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,952
I'm okay. I think
I'm gonna go with something

228
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,787
flowy, less traditional.

229
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,122
JANET:
Well, you know, the months

230
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,858
leading up to the wedding
are so stressful.

231
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,860
- Uh-huh...
- My advice:

232
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,895
Starve yourself early on,

233
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,765
and it'll give you a buffer
for bad decisions later.

234
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,300
REBECCA: You know what,
Mom? I think I look just fine.

235
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,878
You think they're gonna
kill each other?

236
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,138
DAVE:
Oh, it's quite, quite possible.

237
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,106
JANET:
So, how is the gravy coming?

238
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,309
Ooh, you didn't strain it.
Look, see all the lumps?

239
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,887
Yeah, okay, Mom,
I'm just getting started...

240
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,591
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.
- ...so give me a chance.

241
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,083
MARGUERITE:
Sorry I'm-I'm not more help.

242
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,218
I'm a horrible cook.

243
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,587
When I'm in the kitchen,
it's like,

244
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,423
- "Houston, we have a problem."
- (both laugh)

245
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,130
Um, where-where
is the-the toilet?

246
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,132
Oh, this way. I'll show you.

247
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,106
- You need some help with that?
- Yeah.

248
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,941
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- All right.

249
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,110
Yeah, it's, uh, it's Pinot noir.

250
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,645
It's, uh, Rebecca's favorite.

251
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,147
- Oh, yeah? Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

252
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:17,651
- Uh, let's see. There we go.
- All right.

253
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,321
Is it okay?

254
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,623
Sure.

255
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,792
(sighs)

256
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,695
I-I just want this to go well.

257
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,163
I want the kids
to like me, you know?

258
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,834
I'm hoping to stick around for
as long as Rebecca will have me.

259
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,672
- Yeah? Yeah. Oh.
- Yeah.

260
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,808
COMMENTATOR: Dan
Marino thinks it's a blitz...

261
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,876
(TV continues indistinctly)

262
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,450
Why do you keep
looking at Kate, man?

263
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,619
She's just gained
a lot of weight.

264
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,855
KEVIN: Of course she has.

265
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,857
Think about her life, man.

266
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,358
She lives with Mom,

267
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,969
she's got the worst ex-boyfriend
of all time,

268
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,730
she thinks her dog
killed our dad.

269
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,131
(exhales)

270
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,133
I can totally tell when
they're talking about me.

271
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,301
Randall was shocked
when he saw how big I've gotten.

272
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,571
Hey, everybody gains
the freshman 15 at college.

273
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,141
Yeah, well,
I gained the freshman 40

274
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,408
and I'm not even in college.

275
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,650
ADULT KEVIN:
All right, everybody.

276
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,986
So, this is it, this is the land

277
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,689
that will eventually become
the Pearson family mecca.

278
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,091
Soak it in, people.

279
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,826
RANDALL: Hey.

280
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,928
So, this talk.

281
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:36,372
You think Mom's gonna
tell us she needs

282
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,198
to have her driver's license
taken away?

283
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,567
Or what if she lost all
her money to online scammers?

284
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,536
Or maybe she and Miguel
want to become a throuple.

285
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,238
- RANDALL: Oh, Lord. Man... Kate?
- What?

286
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,607
- It could be anything.
- Kate, what do you think?

287
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,610
I just think that we should
trust Mom, you know?

288
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,880
Let her share
what she wants to share.

289
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,116
-Yeah.
-TOBY: Hey, Kate? I'm-I'm at my wit's end.

290
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,617
I had to strap him
into the stroller,

291
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,628
'cause he-he w... he just...
He won't walk with his cane,

292
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,797
and when I pick him up,
he goes nuclear.

293
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,622
Have you tried narrating to him?

294
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,391
Like, the colors of the birds
or the trees?

295
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,793
He just gets really frustrated

296
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,303
when he doesn't know
the full picture.

297
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,930
Yeah, I-I know what he likes,
it's just hard to narrate

298
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,241
a David Attenborough documentary
when he's losing his mind

299
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,268
because he's had too much sugar.

300
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,970
Seriously?

301
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,438
TOBY: Yeah, seriously.

302
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,940
You know, guys, when I... um,

303
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,441
if Jack's upset
at home sometimes,

304
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,610
I'll just, I'll sing to him.
(chuckles)

305
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,445
Oh, Jack likes music?

306
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,914
- KATE: Toby.
- Wow. Thanks, Kev.

307
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,281
Hey, can you just,
can you help me

308
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,818
- instead of instructing me?
- Yeah, Tobe, I can.

309
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,799
They're like that
all the time lately.

310
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,424
Yeah, baby stage is rough.

311
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,627
Beth and I used to have
these intense wordless fights.

312
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,505
You ever had a woman
scream at you with her eyes?

313
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,798
- (chuckles)
- Oh, stop the presses,

314
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,299
ladies and gentlemen.

315
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,669
The Pearson girls are teaching
Grandma how to floss.

316
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,471
Aww, snap.

317
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,340
Get it, Rebecca.

318
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,309
All right, everybody, come on.
Gather around, let's go.

319
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,578
Come on. I want to show you
what's up.

320
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,781
So, uh, all right, I know
it's just flags for now, right?

321
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:05,618
But, um, I'm following
Dad's sketch to a T.

322
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,288
And, uh, okay, so we got Randall
right behind you.

323
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,633
That right there, that is your
family wing, that whole thing.

324
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,360
- RANDALL: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- KEVIN: You know? And then, uh,

325
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,628
Kate, your family wing
is gonna be right there.

326
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,833
That whole thing right there,
and then, uh, uh, well...

327
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,970
- Mom.
- Mm-hmm?

328
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,973
The primary suite, for you.

329
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,341
Right-right in the center.

330
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,477
-REBECCA: Wow.
-Yeah. Yeah... And I haven't decided

331
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,988
what we're gonna do
with this area quite yet.

332
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,722
But, you know, I was tinkering
around a couple of ideas.

333
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,448
Bocce ball court,
I thought, maybe?

334
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,684
- That'd be fun.
- Hey. Guys.

335
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,453
Pearsons, Damons, Rivases,
let's do a family photo.

336
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,322
- All right.
- Oh.

337
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,894
You all right?

338
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,561
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
taking everything...

339
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,397
- taking everything in.
- All right.

340
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,866
Let me ask you
a question, Kevin. Um...

341
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,634
Do you have any plans
for a guesthouse,

342
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,669
maybe for people
outside of the family?

343
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,972
Oh, uh...

344
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,673
(laughs):
Well, you know, it's a, it's a,

345
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,242
it's a family compound, Miguel,

346
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,411
so it really wasn't on the top
of my priority list.

you're Mr. Construction Guy,

No, no, no.
I think you should stay

(laughs) You see, Jack,

the relationship between
mothers and daughters

362
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,451
is very complicated,
and it is a dynamic

363
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,453
that us men
will never understand.

364
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,257

in a perpetual hellscape...

375
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,285
I know this is anti-feminist,

376
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,287
but can you please
carve the turkey?

377
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,290

I mean, he's not the sweetest,

387
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,313
he is the perfect amount
of sweet.

I-I thought,

Dave got a new job, and...

518
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,971
I can barely get her
to visit me here.

519
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,007
Do you really think
she's gonna drive eight hours?

520
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,643
Yeah, she will.

521
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:54,847
(stammers)
I promise, Janet, we will.

522
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,689
You know, just...
Give me ten minutes.

523
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,461
YOUNG RANDALL: Smile. Face.

524
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,196
- Uh...
- BETH: Um, oh.

525
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:13,232
It's-it's my, uh,
sixth favorite thing about you.

526
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,801
My dimples.

527
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,302
REBECCA: Aww, that was it?

528
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,871
- That's sweet.
- (clapping)

529
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,206
MIGUEL: Okay, Marguerite.

530
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,741
- All right, here we go.
- Oh...

531
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,976
Um, I wish I could
say it in French.

532
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,479
Uh, what-what is the word
for nourriture? Um...

533
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,148
Um... apples.

534
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,851
- Uh, orange. Um...
- What kind of...

535
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,529
-REBECCA: Eating. Bell... uh, stomach ache.
-No, no, no, no.

536
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:34,921
- MIGUEL: Tummy ache.
- Oh, no.

537
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,990
Um, it is a place
with colorful flowers.

538
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,359
- (buzzes)
- Can't say "flowers."

539
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,327
- REBECCA: Okay.
- MIGUEL: Take us home.

540
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,696
Come on, old guys, we got this.

541
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,570
MATT: All right, Rebecca,
let's get some points.

542
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:52,439
Okay, this is kind of similar
to a turtle, but not...

543
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,707
- Uh, a tortoise.
- No, not a tortoise.

544
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:58,110
Oh, Miguel, you had
two of these growing up,

545
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,779
- named Lucy and Desi.
- Oh, lizards.

546
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:00,947
- Yes! Okay.
- Lizards.

547
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,682
MIGUEL:
How did you even remember that?

548
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,683
- (laughs): All right.
- REBECCA: Um...

549
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,686
Oh, uh, okay, you and Jack

550
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,788
once went to Froggy's,
you saw "Mean" Joe Greene,

551
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,790
- you got his...
- Autograph.

552
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,625
- Yes.
- Yes.

553
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,794
- (laughter)
- Um...

554
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,363
You used to call me Mary Tyler
Moore because I wore a...

555
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,031
- A beret.
- (laughs): Yes!

556
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,634
REBECCA (laughs):
This is so fun. Um...

557
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:25,872
Okay, you were chased
by one of these one year

558
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,207
at the Lundy family picnic,
you had to escape

559
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,542
by jumping in a kiddie pool.

560
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,777
(laughs): The bumblebee.

561
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,479
Yeah, that was not
my finest moment.

562
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,581
REBECCA: Oh, I
thought it was really cute.

563
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,415
- (Miguel laughs)
- Um...

564
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,117
Oh, your biggest fear in life.

565
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,986
Balding. Going bald.

566
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,321
- (Miguel laughs)
- Okay, okay, okay, okay...

567
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:46,493
Uh, okay, this is the greatest
Billy Joel song of all time.

568
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,795
Uh, ♪ She's always a woman. ♪

569
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:51,097
Okay, but another word
for the last word of that song.

570
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,966
- MIGUEL: Uh, uh, girl?
- Not girl, not girl.

571
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,301
But, um...

572
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,671
Oh, uh, okay.
Um, Susan Dey from L.A. Law.

573
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:01,073
- You always say she's one beautiful...
- Female!

574
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,350
Female, yes! I love you, Miguel!

575
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,277
Time's up, time's up,
time's up, guys.

576
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,280
(exhales)

577
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:12,351
(laughs)

578
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,653
All right.

579
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

580
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,199
(Beth exhales)

581
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,902
Aww. Look at this.

582
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,839
So much love. (Tongue clicks)

583
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,509
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

584
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,845
but I've been sent
to confiscate your phone.

585
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,047
What? "Sent"?

586
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,281
By whom?

587
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,117
Damn near everybody.

588
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,720
- Have I been that annoying?
- Yes.

589
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:52,024
The girls know
and love your mom.

590
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,926
I know.

591
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,697
I feel disconnected from her.

592
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:02,134
She used to live
30 minutes away from us.

593
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,237
The girls are used to her
just popping over.

594
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,907
Now she lives
on a whole other coast.

595
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:13,245
Kev is building her a house.

596
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,157
She's practically raising
all these babies with them.

597
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,917
And I'm happy for them, I am,
I just...

598
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,353
I miss her.

599
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,591
I know.

600
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,228
But I am gonna need
to take the phone.

601
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,463
- Your mom was pretty adamant about it.
- Okay.

602
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,270
(sighs)

603
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,306
(footsteps approaching)

604
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,049
(Toby exhales)

605
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,723
We just keep having the same
argument over and over again.

606
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,459
I know.

607
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,196
You're upset that I'm not
around more.

608
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,632
I'm sensitive about that.

609
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:08,134
Pointed jabs, rinse and repeat.

610
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,973
I know.

611
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,210
But in this... (grunts)

612
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,680
...specific argument,
I want to say...

613
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,252
...we were both fat kids.

614
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,155
And it was hell.

615
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:32,959
And Jack has our genes.

616
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,264
So if I can help him
to eat healthy

617
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:43,335
and to avoid any of that pain,
I'm gonna do it.

618
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,815
Do you remember
the song "Kiss Me"?

619
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,986
It played during the
makeover/transformation scene

620
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,620
from She's All That.

621
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,022
Freddie Prinze Jr. is standing

622
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,091
at the bottom of the stairs,
and the formerly

623
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,760
nerdy girl Laney Boggs
walks down the stairs

624
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,862
in this incredible red dress,

625
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:12,932
and she's so gorgeous
that he's completely floored.

626
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,802
♪ Kiss me, out of
the bearded barley... ♪

627
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,804
Do you remember the scene?

628
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:20,039
I don't think
that the makeover scene

629
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,374
from She's All That is the piece
of cinematic history

630
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,610
- that you think it is.
- Okay.

631
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,845
(laughs softly)

632
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,218
After my dad died and I started
gaining all the weight,

633
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:36,522
I would stop myself from eating
by singing "Kiss Me."

634
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:49,168
♪ Swing, swing,
swing the spinning step... ♪

635
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,371
I would imagine myself
at Kate 2.0

636
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,206
walking down the stairs

637
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,176
thin and beautiful.

638
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,178
Like I was meant to be.

639
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:05,918
Until I would eat something bad
or too much of it.

640
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:10,522
You know, and then, I just saw
Kate 2.0 slipping away.

641
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:12,691
And the shame would
keep building

642
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,326
and I'd keep binging and...

643
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,663
my entire life has been
a cycle of just...

644
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,099
(exhales)
...dieting and binging.

645
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:24,203
I mean, food has always had
this intense power over me.

646
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,906
And I don't want it to have
that power over our kids.

647
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,708
I want them
to enjoy Thanksgiving

648
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,944
without having shame about it.

649
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:34,280
Toby...

650
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,516
I need you to know
that I've put a lot of thought

651
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,718
into what I feed our children.

652
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,088
A lot of thought.

653
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,690
And I...

654
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,326
I just don't know
how you don't know that.

655
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,529
(footsteps approach)

656
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,765
Sorry to interrupt. Um...

657
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,700
Kate, are you ready
for that talk?

658
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,804
Yeah. Yeah.

659
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,939
Okay.

660
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,050
I can't stand her, Jack.

661
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,952
Every single word that comes
out of her mouth,

662
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,221
- every word i-is just...
- I-I... I know.

663
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,989
I know, she just...

664
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,759
She-she feels like
she's losing you.

665
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,962
And she knows
she's driving you crazy...

666
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,297
(sighs) If someone knows
they're acting crazy

667
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:28,667
and never stops,
that is crazy, right?

668
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,271
Look, I just, I think
things are heightened right now.

669
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:36,342
I mean, with the holiday,
the wedding, them moving.

670
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,644
Who's moving?

671
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,916
You're moving to Connecticut?

672
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,751
Yes.

673
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,587
Your father finally got
his dream job.

674
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,189
Two years before retirement.

675
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,524
We're moving right after
the holidays.

676
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:57,029
Mom.

677
00:29:57,063 --> 00:30:00,532
I'm gonna miss you so much.

678
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,102
My baby girl.

679
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,670
Aww.

680
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:08,140
Rebecca, your dinner
was very good.

681
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:09,976
- It was.
- No, no, the turkey was dry.

682
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,544
I cannot believe
you're gonna be so far away.

683
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,680
I need you here
for my wedding, Mom.

684
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,516
Aww. Jack, why did you
tell her like that?

685
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,052
You weren't supposed
to just blurt it out.

686
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,820
REBECCA: Yeah, my mom told you

687
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:22,821
- in confidence, Jack.
- Yeah.

688
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,390
What the hell?

689
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,159
(stammers softly)

690
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:35,501
Seems like I've been focusing
on the wrong guy all day, huh?

691
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,836
(laughs softly)

692
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,106
I'm sorry, what?

693
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,743
I did something terrible.

694
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,345
To Sophie.

695
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,181
You know, I blew it.

696
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,886
And I can literally
hear him sometimes.

697
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,289
I can hear his voice.

698
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,427
You know,
h-his disappointment in me,

699
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,230
in my choices and...

700
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,698
things I should have
had a handle on.

701
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,703
You ever get that feeling?

702
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,576
Uh, I'm not sure I get anything
you're saying right now, Kevin.

703
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,611
You should drink some water.

704
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,413
You were his best friend, man.

705
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,450
So...

706
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,528
if you're even considering
acting on whatever the hell

707
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,955
is going on with my mom...

708
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,622
Just know when you feel
the Earth

709
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:34,860
rumbling beneath your feet,
it's him.

710
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,828
Turning over in his grave.

711
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,339
(Rebecca sighs)

712
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,945
I'm a little nervous,
so I wrote down some notes.

713
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:54,981
Um...

714
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:03,222
There is no easy way
to start this.

715
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,923
Um...

716
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:11,497
When Dad died, it was a shock.

717
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,833
Right? And we were
all left scrambling,

718
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,469
trying to figure out

719
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:20,806
our roles and how to move on.

720
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,941
Um...

721
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:27,579
And the one silver lining
of this awful disease

722
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,150
is that I have the opportunity
to make a plan.

723
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:35,687
To try and ease
some of the burden, so...

724
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,791
First things first, um,
no matter how this thing goes,

725
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:43,529
no matter how slow or fast,

726
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,999
if decisions need
to be made for me,

727
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:50,302
Miguel is the captain
of that ship.

728
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:54,006
- We have talked through every sad scenario...
- Mm-hmm.

729
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,309
...and the last thing
he needs to deal with

730
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:00,879
are disagreements about my care.

731
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,115
So I need to hear you all
agree to that.

732
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,816
We agree.

733
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,817
- Of course.
- Yes.

734
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,952
- REBECCA: Yeah?
- Great.

735
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,620
Thank you.

736
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:13,192
Um, and Kev, Miguel wasn't
asking about the guesthouse

737
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,660
for fishing buddies.

738
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,830
If we are really doing this,

739
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,233
if this incredibly
generous thing you're doing

740
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,169
for all of us is real, then...

741
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,805
...at some point,

742
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,640
I'm probably gonna need
permanent care,

743
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,009
and they're gonna need
a place to stay.

744
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,986
But hopefully, we are

745
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,056
a very, very long way away
from that. Um...

746
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,327
But in the event that, uh,
Miguel, God forbid,

747
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,996
is not here to make
those decisions for me,

748
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,599
I'm gonna need one of you
to stand in for him.

749
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,434
(inhales)

750
00:33:55,467 --> 00:34:00,339
And I've thought long and hard
about who that should be.

751
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,909
I just, I don't want there
to be any confusion or fights.

752
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,913
There are a lot of reasons
for my decision.

753
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:13,485
I just, I hope that
the three of you can respect it.

754
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:21,660
Kate, I want it to be you.

755
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:32,738
(exhales)

756
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,040
Hmm.

757
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,651
Believe it or not,
that was the easy part

758
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,511
of the family meeting. Um...

759
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,284
My last request is, um,

760
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:49,955
less a request and
more of a demand, actually.

761
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,891
Um...

762
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,162
This disease is a real bastard.

763
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,497
And it-it's set me on a road

764
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,400
that's gonna have a lot
of ugly twists and turns,

765
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,302
and I'm afraid
it's gonna be a lot...

766
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,240
...harder on all of you

767
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,851
than it will be on me
and I hate knowing that.

768
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,244
I hate it.

769
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,445
(exhales)

770
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,281
But what I don't want,

771
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,283
I don't want every holiday
for the camera

772
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,419
to be focused on me.

773
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,789
So I need you all
to hear my voice right now,

774
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:27,326
your mother's voice,
with all of her faculties.

775
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:32,664
You will not make your lives
smaller because of me.

776
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,101
This thing
that's happening to me

777
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,138
will not be the thing
that holds you back.

778
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:43,141
So... take the risks.

779
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:47,879
Make the big moves,
even if they're small moves.

780
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:51,717
Forge ahead with your lives
in any and every direction

781
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,852
that moves you.

782
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:58,357
I am your mother, and I'm sick.

783
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,160
And I'm asking you be fearless.

784
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,132
And if that seems like a tall
order, well, guess what? It is.

785
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,235
But...

786
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:12,304
The only acceptable response

787
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,506
is a resounding "Yes, ma'am."

788
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,844
ALL THREE: Yes, ma'am.

789
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,094
Okay, I will call you tomorrow
to go over everything.

790
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,221
Dress, food, venues.

791
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,790
- All of it.
- Oh, I can't wait.

792
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,363
(whispers indistinctly)

793
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:44,303
Oh. There you are.

794
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,940
(exhales)

795
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,743
- Thanks for helping me clean up.
- Oh, ye... of course.

796
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,679
You know, I'm always,
uh, happy to help.

797
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,647
(laughs softly)

798
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,286
(chuckles)

799
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:03,555
He thought it was "Piano Man."

800
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,557
Huh?

801
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:08,794
Billy Joel's, uh, best song?

802
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:11,229
Yeah, remember, we argued
about it all night at Froggy's?

803
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:14,065
Uh, Jack was for "Piano Man"

804
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,968
and I was for
"She's Always a Woman."

805
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,204
Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah.

806
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,506
Yeah.

807
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,110
(exhales)

808
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:28,580
Earlier, um, my jabs at Matt...

809
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,150
...they weren't harmless.

810
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,587
And they weren't accidental.

811
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,028
Not were mine, at her.

812
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:51,002
(sighs)
These past two years, Miguel,

813
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:56,675
you have been so good to me,
to us, and...

814
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,649
...I-I just think somewhere
along the way, I just...

815
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,652
I'm moving to Houston.

816
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:10,956
I got, I got a job offer there
a few months back.

817
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,425
It's-it's... It's near my kids.

818
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:18,330
And it's why she was making
Houston jokes tonight.

819
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,469
Oh.

820
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,103
I'm sorry.

821
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,006
I-I'm sorry to tell you
like this.

822
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:34,346
I feel like I've been
staying around,

823
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,983
you know, because I, um...

824
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:45,691
It's... It's just,
it's time, Rebecca.

825
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,496
Now that you're back up
on your feet, um...

826
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,501
It's time for me to go.

827
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:11,082
It's just, I don't, I don't...
I don't know what else to do.

828
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,922
You're my favorite person.

829
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,270
(door closes)

830
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,740
Oh, Captain, my captain.

831
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:37,576
Uh...

832
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,110
I got the plans here.

833
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,846
You know, I was thinking, um,

834
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,614
maybe we could
go over them together.

835
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:44,349
Maybe tomorrow,
we could walk the property,

836
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,753
just you and me,
and you tell me what I missed.

837
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,489
I'd like that very much.

838
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:54,493
- Um...
- Kevin.

839
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,497
Really is a hell of a thing
that you're doing.

840
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,033
Back at you, Cap.

841
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,102
Back at you.

842
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,576
I don't know what to do, guys.
She's still crying.

843
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,277
You can't do anything.

844
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,746
You can't just
fix people, Randall.

845
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,451
This house is too sad.

846
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:21,119
Hey, where are you going?

847
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,797
I heard the pool closed down.
(clears throat)

848
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,255
The one we went to growing up.

849
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,167
I just want to check it out
before it disappears.

850
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:27,602
Kev, right now's probably
not the right...

851
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:29,427
Don't follow me. I'm not 12.

852
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,664
(door closes)

853
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:37,769
(Rebecca crying)

854
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,446
(exhales)

855
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:59,157
He's moving to Houston.

856
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,235
I got to ask. (Laughs softly)

857
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,041
Why me?

858
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,746
What?

859
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:26,117
You are my daughter
and my best friend.

860
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,153
(Rebecca crying)

861
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,823
(softly): It's okay.

862
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,826
It was always you, Kate.

863
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,014
(whispers indistinctly)

864
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,851
(exhales): Oh...
