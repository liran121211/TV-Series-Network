over FaceTime and not in person

176
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:49,375
and that there happens to be
a 24-second shot clock

177
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,604
on the whole thing,
since a prematurely balding man

178
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:54,200
is about to walk into my office
and blow up my entire day.

179
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,173
(inhales) So I just wanted
to call you really quick

180
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:57,928
and say happy birthday, Kate.

181
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:00,091
I love you very much, and I miss you.

182
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,122
Aw. I miss you, too.

183
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,353
You sound stressed.

184
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:05,450
No wasting time on me.
Now, listen,

185
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:07,846
I know you have the day off,
so I have arranged for your mom

186
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,143
and Miguel to take the kids to Train Park.

187
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,639
With Nicky, of course, since
they're all attached at the hip

188
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:13,836
since he started staying with them.

189
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,501
Wait, they're taking the kids?

190
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,498
For the entire afternoon.

191
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,760
And you, my beautiful wife,

192
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:22,623
get a peaceful, childless house
for the whole day.

193
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:25,552
I have a massage therapist
showing up in one hour.

194
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:26,816
And don't worry...
I know what you like.

195
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,058
I asked for a woman with the hands

196
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,114
of an offensive lineman.

197
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,378
(chuckles)

198
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,076
Toby...

199
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,582
And the shot clock is going off.

200
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:34,938
Okay, I love you very much.

201
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:37,234
Happy birthday.
Kiss the munchkins for me, okay.

202
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:39,107
Oh, my God, here they come.
All right. Okay, bye.

203
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:42,042
-Love you.
-I love you... - (beeping)

204
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:44,040
...too.

205
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:48,068
Look at this.

206
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,334
Oh, my God.

207
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,699
He's so romantic.

208
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,029
I know.

209
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,460
No, I-I miss him so much it hurts.

210
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,588
Malik sending you love letters from Boston?

211
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,640
Huh? Aw, that's adorbs.

212
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:03,294
That boy is adorbs.

213
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,836
You know, your dad used to send me love letters

214
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,278
on our summer break.

215
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,541
Like, full-on, cursive, handwritten...

216
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,705
Y'all not listening. Okay.

217
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,436
That's fair. Hey!

218
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:15,699
There's my romantic birthday boy.

219
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,496
You decide on your wish yet?

220
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,660
Can we go in the next room, please?

221
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,735
Okay.

222
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,176
-It's all kind of one room, but okay.
-Mm.

223
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:29,777
Um... (clears throat)

224
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,808
Got an email.

225
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:34,336
The cops got the guy who robbed us.

226
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:36,266
(gasps)
-Caught him breaking into a parked car.

227
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,098
Wow.

228
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,327
-Are they sure it's our guy?
-Mm-hmm.

229
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,717
He pawned all of our jewelry, but, um...

230
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:45,087
you remember how we couldn't find

231
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,884
one of our wedding photos last year,

232
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,553
-thought we were losing our minds?
-Mm-hmm.

233
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:49,880
He had it on him.

234
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,743
Just the picture, not the frame.

235
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:54,439
(groans)
Yeah.

236
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:55,904
He's, um...

237
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,233
he's getting arraigned today.

238
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:01,362
I think I might go down there.
Randall,

239
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:02,792
-it's your birthday.
-I want to look him

240
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,890
in the eye, Beth, tell him what he did to us.

241
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:06,587
-To our family.
-Okay. Baby,

242
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,465
-let's play a game, okay?
-Hmm.

243
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,085
-There's two doors you can choose from today.
-(inhales deeply)

244
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:13,376
-(sighs)
-Behind door number one

245
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,739
-is your beautiful, "top of her game right now" wife...
-Yeah.

246
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,602
...who is fulfilled
in her new job

247
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:20,666
and-and has a new skincare line

248
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,328
-that has her positively glowing.
-That's true.

249
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:26,823
She is clicking on all her sexy cylinders.

250
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,299
-Mmm.
-And is ready to grant you

251
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,850
any birthday wish you want.

252
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:33,646
-Mmm.
-Like a less-problematic Aladdin genie.

253
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:34,844
-I like that.
-Yeah.

254
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,507
-Yeah.
-Behind door number two,

255
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,867
you have confronting the creeper
who broke into our home

256
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,699
and upturned a year of our lives.

257
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,624
You're gonna pick door number two, aren't you?

258
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,088
-I need to look him in the eye, Beth.
-Oh, my gosh.

259
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,218
-You are a very unusual man.
-I know.

260
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:52,616
But you really are at the top

261
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,047
-of your game right...
-No, no, no.

262
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:56,310
You only get one door, baby.
You made your choice.

263
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:58,107
All right? Hey, ladies?

264
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,228
Mom-mobile's leaving in three.
All right?

265
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:03,133
Damn.

266
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,130
I would've chose door number Beth.

267
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:07,925
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

268
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,523
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

269
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:11,620
(departing footsteps)

270
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,662
(kids chattering)

271
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:20,720
Kevin!

272
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,520
Class. Class!

273
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,879
Kevin, please.

274
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:29,110
(soft chuckling)

275
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,707
-CNN ANCHOR: ...now underway...
-Okay.

276
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,970
-In minus 15 seconds.
-Here we go.

277
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,599
-(Kevin cackles)
-Kevin, please settle.

278
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,055
MAN: T-minus ten, nine, eight,

279
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,694
seven, six.

280
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:42,050
We have main engines start.

281
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:45,789
Four, three, two, one...

282
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,079
-and liftoff, liftoff.
-(kids cheering)

283
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:51,243
Of the 25th space shuttle mission,

284
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,173
and it has cleared the tower.

285
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:57,327
(indistinct chatter on TV)

286
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:01,073
TOM MINTER: So, the 25th space
shuttle mission is now on the way

287
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:04,867
after more delays than NASA cares to count.

288
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,364
This morning they looked as though

289
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:10,003
they were not going to be able to get off.

290
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:19,678
(distorted chatter on TV)

291
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,304
MINTER:
Looks like a couple of the, uh,

292
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:27,566
solid rocket boosters, uh, blew away

293
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:32,025
from the side of the shuttle in an explosion.

294
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:38,715
MAN: My controller's here,
looking very carefully at the situation.

295
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:42,009
-Obviously a major malfunction.
-It seems that...

296
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,001
I think they're having a little problem there.

297
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:57,553
MIGUEL: Hey, guess what, guys.

298
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,082
Did you know that this train
goes all the way around the park

299
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:03,743
-two whole times?
-(gasps) Two whole times?

300
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:05,508
You hear that?

301
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,105
How is this my life?

302
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:08,768
(chuckles):
Would you stop bitching?

303
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:11,798
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just
this damn Facebook. I-I..

304
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,160
You know what, every morning since I got here,

305
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,623
I Facebook stalk the girl who got away.

306
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:17,821
I told you about her, right?

307
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,552
-Sally?
-Sally, yes.

308
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:21,815
-Yeah.
-Yes, you tell us about her every day.

309
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,979
Every single day.

310
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:27,107
Well, every single day, I lose my nerve,

311
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,703
even though she's just a few hours from here.

312
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,266
(sighs) Here I am on a baby train.

313
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,296
Oh, Nicky, shush.

314
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:36,060
And who doesn't like trains?

315
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,256
-Everybody likes trains.
-JACK: Yeah.

316
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,887
Hey, Jack.

317
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,117
Did I ever tell you how my dad
used to take me on trains

318
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:43,381
when I was a little girl?

319
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,712
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

320
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:48,741
Any Sunday my dad had to go into the office,

321
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:52,070
he would, uh, take me on the
train into the city with him.

322
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:56,423
Mmm. I loved those Sundays.

323
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,688
My dad would, uh, sit there reading...

324
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:03,385
He was a big reader, my dad, novels mainly...

325
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:07,312
And, uh, I'd sit across from him just watching

326
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:10,673
the world go by as the train rumbled beneath us

327
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,704
(chuckles)

328
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,510
And then, when we would get close to the city,

329
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:17,598
he would walk me to the very front of the train,

330
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,827
and we'd walk back

331
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,857
through each and every car.

332
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,788
All the way.

333
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,620
All the way to the back, to the...

334
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,828
The, um...

335
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,474
Oh, the-the last car.

336
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,035
No, no, no, no. D-Don't te...
Don't tell me.

337
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,334
(train engine sputters)

338
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:38,130
(engine revs)

339
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,298
(quietly): The last...

340
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:43,955
Oh, that was amazing.

341
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,742
-I'm a new woman.
-I'm glad.

342
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,417
Your husband's very thoughtful.

343
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,703
I wish mine would order me a me on my birthday.

344
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,650
Yeah. It's very Toby.

345
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,481
Actually, it isn't.

346
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,534
He's usually more of, like, a giant in-person

347
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:00,498
grand gesture kind of guy.

348
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,017
This outsourcing is a little new.

349
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,398
Not to say it's not wonderful
and much needed and...

350
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,827
-You know, honestly, it's simpler.
-(phone vibrates)

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,432
(groans softly)

352
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:18,461
(knocks)

353
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:19,824
Kevin Pearson.

354
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,288
(sighs) Send him in.

355
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:25,616
Thank you.

356
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:29,108
Casey.

357
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:30,606
What, it's been, um...

358
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,190
Five years.

359
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,799
Five years to the day
since your national meltdown

360
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,829
-on my set.
-You counted.

361
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:38,726
You count, Kevin,

362
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,422
when somebody torpedoes your life and career,

363
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:43,631
-you count.
-Huh.

364
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,447
I supposed you would, but hey,

365
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:48,012
looks like you landed
on your feet, though, right?

366
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,219
I mean, this is a hell of a show.

367
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,075
The writing is phenomenal.

368
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,073
I never worked on it.

369
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:55,181
I'm a fan.

370
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:56,847
Oh.

371
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,494
Look, man, I...

372
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:03,258
We both know we were forced

373
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,254
to take this meeting by our agents, right?

374
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,952
I mean, y-you don't want me
to do whatever movie this is.

375
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:08,717
I don't want to do whatever movie this is.

376
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,979
They want to reboot The Manny, Kevin.

377
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,001
-So...
-There is no film.

378
00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:17,998
They knew you'd never show up if...

379
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:19,463
Let me get this straight.

380
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,393
-They want me to play the Manny again?
-What?

381
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,956
No, you're far too old.

382
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,387
No, you play the dad.

383
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,583
A dad to twins, ironically.

384
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:28,748
Huh.

385
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,244
Kevin, I-I saw the last film.

386
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:35,234
I actually purchased a ticket.

387
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,136
And after 90 minutes, when I realized

388
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,676
it was only halfway over, I started to lick

389
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,841
the movie theater seats in an
attempt to give myself COVID.

390
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,372
Okay.

391
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,175
I know what's out there for you right now.

392
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:48,606
This is good.

393
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,302
You get to raise your family in Los Angeles,

394
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:54,032
work one day a week and become a zillionaire.

395
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:56,902
Or say no.

396
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:58,391
And spend the rest of your years

397
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,955
travelling to Vancouver every weekend

398
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:02,565
to shoot Treat Williams indies

399
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:04,763
where you got to do your own hair.

400
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,981
Over my dead body.

401
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:16,625
(sighs) Thank God.

402
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,645
Mr. Watkins,

403
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,622
you are being charged with burglary

404
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:23,718
while in possession of an offensive weapon

405
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,483
and criminal trespass.

406
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:27,445
Do you understand the charges?

407
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,910
WATKINS: Yes.

408
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:33,095
MAGISTRATE: Preliminary hearing
will be set for four weeks from today,

409
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:36,724
and bail has been set as noted.

410
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:41,125
-(departing footsteps)
-(door opens)

411
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:45,286
(door closes)

412
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:50,577
Excuse me, Officer, um...

413
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,872
-Randall Pearson, councilman for District...
-District 12.

414
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:55,403
Yes, sir.
My wife and I voted for you.

415
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,968
We plan on doing it again.

416
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,632
Well, that makes this a lot easier.

417
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,495
Um...

418
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:02,763
Do you think I could speak
with him for a couple minutes?

419
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,544
Sure thing, Councilman.

420
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:08,974
I'll be right here if you need me.

421
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:19,163
Do you know who I am?

422
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,006
You're the guy from my picture.

423
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,785
(door opens)

424
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,344
(Jack sighs)

425
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,188
-Hey.
-Hey.

426
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,411
How are they?

427
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,439
Oh, they barely said a word on the ride home.

428
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,534
And I started their day out with Tang, Jack.

429
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:59,297
-With Tang.
-Yeah. We'll talk to 'em, Bec.

430
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,425
Just like we did when the goldfish died.

431
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,922
Uh, a spaceship filled with heroes

432
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:06,919
exploded on national television.

433
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,627
I don't think the Splishy and Splashy model

434
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:11,195
-is gonna work here.
-Bec.

435
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:13,643
We can do this.

436
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,662
Okay? Okay.

437
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,030
(approaching footsteps)

438
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:24,359
Hey, Big Three.

439
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:26,689
REBECCA: Hey, guys?

440
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:29,184
Uh, Daddy and I just...
we wanted to see

441
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:32,165
if there is anything
that you wanted to talk about.

442
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,185
About today?

443
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:41,532
'Cause I know, for me...

444
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:44,761
I had a lot of sad feelings.

445
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,756
-Did any of you maybe feel like that?
-JACK: Yeah.

446
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,917
You know, like maybe when Splishy and Splashy...

447
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,015
(whispers):
Don't do Splishy and Splashy.

448
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,979
I'm telling you, it's a good way in.

449
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:57,336
All the teachers were crying.

450
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,172
Yeah.

451
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,235
I bet they were, Bug.

452
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,564
It's a good thing they were that high up.

453
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:07,703
That means they were closer to heaven.

454
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:09,523
Yeah.

455
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:11,719
I think that's a really nice thought, Bug.

456
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:17,281
Maybe Splishy and Splashy will take care of them.

457
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,836
Boys, how about you?

458
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:26,557
You-you guys feeling a little sad, too?

459
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:30,436
Can I have more mac and cheese?

460
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:33,685
Yeah.

461
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,718
-REBECCA: I can get it.
-No, no.

462
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:37,469
I got it, I got it. I got it.

463
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,804
-ELIJAH: So good.
-Look who's back.

464
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:45,801
-(Madison chuckles)
-How was book... club?

465
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:49,090
Oh, hey. You remember Elijah,
right? From book club?

466
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:51,358
-(baby fusing over monitor)
-No, I mean, yeah. (Stammers)

467
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,122
I didn't realize, uh...

468
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:54,663
I didn't realize everyone was still here.

469
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,039
Oh, I'm just helping Maddy clean up.

470
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,336
She always hosts and gets stuck with it.

471
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:01,801
Well, that's nice.

472
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:04,172
I'm just gonna grab the kids
and take them to the party.

473
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,703
Oh, perfect timing.

474
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,468
They are just starting to stir from their naps.

475
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,196
(softly): Good.

476
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:11,461
How was book club?

477
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,390
-Oh, my God. (Chuckles)
-So good.

478
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:14,956
We read The Queen of the Tearling.

479
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:16,619
-(imitates explosion)
-Everybody's mind was blown.

480
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,449
Yeah, n... Eli called me
a Kelsea today,

481
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:22,187
-so he is basically my best friend for life.
-(Elijah laughs)

482
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,731
-Well, I only speak the truth.
-Aw.

483
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:27,099
Oh, you haven't read it?

484
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:28,564
Not a page.

485
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:31,093
You know, the last thing I read was, um...

486
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:32,826
was Parasite.

487
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:34,388
Subtitled movie.

488
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,584
-Kev, considers it reading.
-Well, it's Korean,

489
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:38,091
so you have to read it to understand it,

490
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,579
unless you speak Korean, so...

491
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,810
Hey, I don't want to geek out or anything...

492
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:44,337
-Oh, Eli, maybe not now.
-I'm just gonna say it once. You said I could.

493
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:48,067
-Okay.
-Hill 400 is a freaking masterpiece.

494
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,298
-Yeah?
-You are so good, man.

495
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,896
Thank you.

496
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,427
Thank y... That's very kind.
I appreciate it.

497
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:55,522
Um, so I'm-I'm gonna grab the kids, right?

498
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,182
And then Elijah and I will-will
get out of your hair.

499
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:00,281
Unless you want help with the dishes.

500
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:01,779
Oh.

501
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:04,408
Wow, that's so nice.
No, that would be huge.

502
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:06,871
Who knew fantasy nerds could be such slobs?

503
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:09,334
Um, everyone who's ever met a fantasy nerd.

504
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,530
(laughs): Right.

505
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:13,427
Walked into that one.
Should we...

506
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,058
-Hmm? Mm-hmm. Great.
-ELIJAH: Another bottle? Yeah, absolutely...

507
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:16,989
So, I'll just grab the kids, then.

508
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,095
(Madison chuckles) -ELIJAH:
I, uh... when I was, uh...

509
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,049
(quiet chatter)

510
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:27,268
My name is Randall Pearson.

511
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,568
Two years ago, you broke into my home.

512
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:35,151
You broke through a window
and stole some jewelry.

513
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:38,812
I caught you on the way out with a knife.

514
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,473
I don't remember.

515
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:48,707
I have, uh, holes in my memory.

516
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:52,770
Do you have any water?

517
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,075
I don't.

518
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:56,706
I can try to get you some.

519
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,172
Thank you.

520
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:05,024
It was a terrifying moment for my family.

521
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:08,722
My wife, my daughters.

522
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:10,415
I'm sorry...

523
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:14,424
You know what they did with my dog?

524
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:19,600
I don't. I can
try to find out for you.
