00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,966
We don't...? Okay, well, you
know, we'll pitch on it later.

177
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,168
Kevin's trying to show that
he's supportive that I'm dating.

178
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,003
Yeah, I know. It's really cute

179
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,605
-when he tries to make it look natural.
-MADISON: Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,174
Elijah, these blueberry muffins are insane.

181
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,109
-Really, they're from scratch?
-Yeah.

182
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,378
I'm kind of a baked goods snob.

183
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,313
It's homemade or bust for this guy.

184
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,815
-(chuckles) -Well, maybe
you can whip up another batch

185
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,517
-for me to take to Thanksgiving.
-Sure.

186
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:06,286
Madison, you are gonna
love Thanksgiving at the cabin,

187
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,622
by the way. And I can't
wait for the twins to see me

188
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,823
in the Pilgrim Rick hat.

189
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,559
Although I do hope it doesn't scare Nicky,

190
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,026
because he gets really weird around hats.

191
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,299
Uh, well, what about you?
You got plans for the holidays?

192
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,570
Oh. Um... Well, you know,

193
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,304
it's probably just gonna be
a quiet one with the family.

194
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,073
-KEVIN: Hmm.
-Hey, is that beauty

195
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,676
-yours?
-Yeah. Yes, she is.

196
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,511
This is a Gibson J-45.

197
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,013
This is the guitar that Bradley Cooper used

198
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,481
-in A Star Is Born.
-(strums chord)

199
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,849
I'm just kind of getting the hang of it.

200
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,517
Yeah, that sounds great, man. You're a rock star.

201
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,319
Yeah. Well, I've been taking

202
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,721
Springsteen's online MasterClass,

203
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,155
-so...
-TOBY: Mm-hmm.

204
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,657
You aren't talking to me at all, are you?

205
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,325
-Mm. Work call.
-KEVIN: Yeah.

206
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,260
These are insane. Are these you?

207
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,162
-Yeah.
-I love you. (kisses)

208
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,530
No, not you, sir.

209
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,499
-Talking to a man named Elijah.
-(chuckles)

210
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,702
He's doing a deal in two different time zones,

211
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,336
so, like, eight of the 16 hours

212
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,105
that he's been back? It's been that.

213
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,240
I never thought that I
would get jealous of AirPods.

214
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,842
-MADISON: Aw.
-KATE: Yeah.

215
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,843
I thought that his ears were mine

216
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,044
once we said our vows, but...

217
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,379
Well, listen, you don't have to come

218
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,081
to the-the pilot taping of The Manny tomorrow.

219
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,683
Why don't you spend some quality time with Toby?

220
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,551
Are you kidding? It's not every day

221
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,020
that our brother gets to star

222
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,088
in a reboot of a show that made his career

223
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,389
and then almost cost him his career.

224
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,925
-We're gonna be there.
-Okay.

225
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,727
-All right. All right.
-ELIJAH: Oh, man.

226
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,429
That all sounds so exciting.
The live audience and all.

227
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,531
Well, why don't you and Madison
come? Come to the taping.

228
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,299
-Seriously?
-KEVIN: Yes.

229
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,301
-Be great.
-Okay.

230
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,469
-Yeah.
-Great! Terrific.

231
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,071
-Yes.
-Now,

232
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,541
-let Brunch 'N' Stuff begin.
-MADISON: I like it.

233
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,809
-Brunch 'N' Stuff.
-MADISON: Yeah.

234
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,544
-All right.
-Better.

235
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,647
All right, well, we're getting
there. We're getting there.

236
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,317
(gasps) We have to get the bread pudding.

237
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,786
My dad and I

238
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,120
used to come here sometimes,

239
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,123
and we'd skip dinner and go straight to dessert.

240
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,793
Bread pudding it is, then. All right.

241
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,628
-(Beth chuckles)
-I'm so excited

242
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,697
to be exploring D.C. with you.

243
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,705
What's wrong?

244
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,709
That's my old ballet teacher.

245
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,614
I haven't seen him since I quit dance.

246
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,523
-("The Untold" by Secession
Studios playing) -(dancing footsteps)

247
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,408
-(music stops)
-May I?

248
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,278
Sorry. I hope that it's okay
that I'm here. I just wanted

249
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,815
to get a little practice in
before the showcase tonight.

250
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,282
No need to apologize.

251
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,351
Pirouettes used to be tricky for me, too.

252
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,053
My old dance teacher taught me

253
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,990
to imagine a string, right, from the crown

254
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,626
of my head pulling me all the way up

255
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,494
to the ceiling.

256
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,997
Yeah. (chuckles)

257
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,366
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

258
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,537
Why'd you pick me?

259
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:16,476
I feel like I'm playing catch-up
to everybody else here.

260
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,245
I was the best at my old dance studio.

261
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,346
But here?

262
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,381
I'm not the skinniest

263
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,284
or the most flexible. I don't
even have the best feet.

264
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,723
My dad wants me to be a lawyer like him.

265
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,494
You know, my mom was a lot like your dad.

266
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,998
She wanted me to be an educator just like her.

267
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,834
This whole dance world never made sense to her.

268
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,570
But I fought to be a part of it.

269
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,806
Just like you did.

270
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,011
Stacey, I chose you because I saw a fire in you

271
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,913
that I recognized in myself.

272
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,652
Try again.

273
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,823
Try again.

274
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,934
Our new neighbors are just like you.

275
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,036
KATE: Hey.

276
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,370
Where's Sophie?

277
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,806
She's on the phone with her mom.

278
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,640
PEGGY: Well, do you think my feet are too big?

279
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,543
HANK: No. There's just more of you to love.

280
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,478
(TV mutes)

281
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,216
Are you gonna say something about my weight?

282
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,084
Do you want me to?

283
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,054
No.

284
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,523
You gonna say something about my drinking?

285
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,093
Do you want me to?

286
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,497
No.

287
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,502
L.A.'s been tough.

288
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,806
I joined an acting class,

289
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,641
you know, hoping it would help me.

290
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,810
That's great, Kev.

291
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:00,180
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, but now you want to tell me

292
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,514
what's really going on?

293
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,020
Kevin.

294
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:12,459
(breathes deeply)

295
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,527
I met this girl.

296
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,832
And she was really cool,
so we started hanging out.

297
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,767
You know, I've been lonely

298
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,171
because, between Sophie's
classes and my auditions,

299
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,638
you know, we don't get much time to talk.

300
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,741
Kevin, what did you do?

301
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,880
It was just one time.

302
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,815
I swear.

303
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,152
(sighs) Oh, my God.

304
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,788
Oh, God, Kevin. K-K...

305
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,991
How could you do this to Sophie?

306
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,026
How could you do that? She loves you so much.

307
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,095
Don't you think I know that?

308
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,298
I can't even look at her, Kate.

309
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,732
Every time I'm in the same room as her,

310
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,034
I feel like I'm gonna throw up from the guilt.

311
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,103
Good.

312
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,509
-You need to tell her.
-No.

313
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,011
It will kill her, Kate.

314
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,678
What if she doesn't forgive me?

315
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,347
Okay, well, what...? So, what do you expect?

316
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,016
What... What am I supposed to do?

317
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,517
I'm supposed to keep this from her now?

318
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,185
She's one of my best friends.

319
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,221
And I'm your brother.

320
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,824
This is incredible. Everything looks so real.

321
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,492
Yeah. The first time Kev brought me backstage--

322
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,829
You wouldn't believe it--
The host of Survivor was there.

323
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,265
-Jeff Probst?
-Jeff mother-lovin' Probst.

324
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,167
-(chuckles) What did you do?
-Uh, I freaked out.

325
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,069
I spilled my cold brew from crafty all over him.

326
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,570
Crafty is craft services. It's where they keep

327
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,005
-all the snacks. Yeah.
-Oh...

328
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,340
Yeah, stick with me, kid.
I'll show you the ropes.

329
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,774
-Hey! What's up?
-KATE: Hi.

330
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,843
Thanks for coming. Thanks
for coming. Thanks for coming.

331
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,679
Hi. So good to get to spend some time with you.

332
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,414
We haven't seen you since, what, breakfast?

333
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,715
(Toby chuckles)

334
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,451
-Toby.
-What? It's a joke.

335
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,853
'Cause we-we live together. Never mind. I'll get

336
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,555
-one of the writers to punch it up.
-KEVIN: Mm.

337
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,123
A punch-up is when the writers take a bad joke

338
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,791
-and they make it funny.
-Oh, I know.

339
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,027
I learned that from the Friends reunion.

340
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,029
ELIJAH: Hey, I saw a gumball machine

341
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,466
on the way in. Now, are the gumballs real?

342
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,634
They are. They're real, yeah.

343
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,370
Not only that, but you
don't have to put a quarter in,

344
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,038
-so you can just have at it.
-Really?

345
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,907
-KEVIN: Yeah.
-Thanks. Okay. Okay, you know what?

346
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,977
-I'll bring some back for the group.
-(phone vibrating)

347
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,211
-Thank you.
-KATE: Oh, thanks.

348
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,213
And I have to take this.

349
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,148
-Sorry about the... joke.
-(Kate clears throat)

350
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,084
-It's all right. Don't worry about it.
-Thank you.

351
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,918
Yello.

352
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:22,555
Oh, hey, Madison. Listen, I sent you

353
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,391
some flight options for
Thanksgiving. I don't know

354
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,658
if you saw or not, but I'm thinking we

355
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,260
should book early because, you know, the seats

356
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,163
tend to fill up... What-what...
What's this? You keep looking

357
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,332
at each other. What am I missing?

358
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,167
Is this an Elijah thing? Because obviously,

359
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,602
I mean, he's more than welcome to come.

360
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,804
Kevin, can we talk about this later?

361
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,472
I don't want to do this here

362
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,673
on such an important day for you.

363
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,142
No, you just want to sit here and continue

364
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,645
to share ominous looks with each other.

365
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,281
Okay, fine.

366
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,949
Um...

367
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,851
I don't want to go to the cabin.

368
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,522
I want to spend Thanksgiving with Elijah

369
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,492
here in L.A. With the twins.

370
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,830
P.A.: Hey, Kevin? We need you on set.

371
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,832
Oh.

372
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,434
Perfect.

373
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,868
Um...

374
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,407
Well, hey, you know, um, to be continued.

375
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,385
We don't have to stay.

376
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,654
We can get the bread pudding to go.

377
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,624
I saw that man every day

378
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,693
from when I was 12 to 17.

379
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,129
I was his favorite,

380
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,699
until I started struggling,
and then he just dropped me.

381
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,073
When my dad died, he didn't
even pick up the damn phone.

382
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,907
Want me to go over there

383
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,576
and show him where his ballet shoes can go?

384
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,711
No.

385
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,916
But I will.

386
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,723
Hey. I'm right here.

387
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,402
Bethany.

388
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:19,172
It's so nice to see you. How long has it been?

389
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,341
Uh, 23 months.

390
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,111
Wow. That long, huh?

391
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,213
Well, you look well.

392
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,517
So, w-what have you been up to? Fill me in.

393
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,685
Um...

394
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,587
I'm an architecture major at CMU.

395
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,626
That's wonderful. I always
knew you had a bright mind.

396
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,797
Why don't you stop by the
studio one of these days.

397
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,166
The girls would love to see you.

398
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,737
-Sure.
-Yeah.

399
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,472
Great.

400
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,311
Take care.

401
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,150
Um...

402
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,219
Let's just forget about the bread pudding and go.

403
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,787
Let's go.

404
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,322
Yeah.

405
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,125
All right, let's go.

406
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,966
Hey, phones off, now.

407
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,169
-Hey, guys. You made it.
-Hey.

408
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,636
How you feeling?

409
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,005
Excited and terrified.

410
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,774
-(chuckles)
-Which for some reason

411
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,742
is making me have to pee a lot, you know.

412
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,344
It's like I'm about to get onstage and perform.

413
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,246
But this should be the easy part for you.

414
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,614
You already done all the hard work.

415
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:35,848
Now, you just sit back and watch.

416
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,917
That's what I thought, but when you perform,

417
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,319
it's like you have some control.

418
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,820
Now, I'm just the lady waiting in the wings,

419
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,356
hoping everything goes well.

420
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,160
I can't fail at this again,
Randall. I just... I can't.

421
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,928
You won't.

422
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,299
I'm sorry. "You won't" is not good enough.

423
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,700
Okay? I don't mean

424
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,934
to put too much pressure on you, baby,

425
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,469
but I'm freaking out right now,

426
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,471
and I'm gonna need one of
your all-time greatest pep talks,

427
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,507
and I'm gonna need it now.

428
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,309
Beth Pearson, you're an incredible human being...

429
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,811
Damn it. I got to pee again, baby. I'm so sorry.

430
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:05,878
Okay.

431
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,318
Not to brag, but...

432
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,320
I think we may have Emeril beat.

433
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,987
Emeril should be watching us on TV.

434
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,790
(both laugh)

435
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,992
Well, at least we don't
have to worry about dessert,

436
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,329
since Matt is bringing his "famous" pumpkin pie

437
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,331
to the Thanksgiving he invited himself to.

438
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,733
What? I invited him.

439
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,135
Yeah, well, he didn't really
give you much of a choice,

440
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,238
did he? I mean, what else were you gonna do?

441
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,872
This needs some brown sugar.

442
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,481
-(babies crying)
-What's going on down there?

443
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,015
You know, they've been crying for hours.

444
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,251
They're gonna grow up to sound

445
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,152
like Gilbert Gottfried, aren't they?

446
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,420
-(audience laughs) -KEVIN
(imitating Gottfried): Aren't they?

447
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,388
Are you okay?

448
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,756
TYLER: Let me help.

449
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,558
I knew this wouldn't go over well.

450
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,760
It's a lot to spring on him.

451
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,596
Maybe it's just easier if I
bring the twins to the cabin.

452
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,198
KEVIN: ...for the next Marvel
superhero movie. I think I've got this.

453
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,601
-(audience laughs)
-(applause)

454
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,604
You know, I just, I want to be
a good dad to my kids, is all.

455
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,672
I-I want to be the best dad

456
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,173
to my kids 'cause...

457
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
that's what my kids deserve.

458
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,110

Earth to Kate!

464
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,121
Oh. What? Did you say something?

465
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,525
Yes. I said that I brought
my Thelma & Louise DVD.

466
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,793
Rewatch session tonight?

467
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,628
Sure. I mean,

468
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,563

00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,334
Kevin's being weird.

00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,170
What do you think is going on?

472
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,574
Have you noticed the drinking?

473
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,477
Yeah. Yeah.

stressed about career stuff.

477
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,620
It's taking a lot longer than he'd hoped it would

478
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,822
to get started with the acting stuff.

479
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,160
Yeah, you're-you're probably right. (chuckles)

480
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,163

488
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,989

-Mmm.

489
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,325

I don't know. We're having fun. (chuckles)

493
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,502
Wow. What a rave.

494
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,872
He's a nice guy, and

495
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,174
we're having a good time. I mean, it's...

496
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,510
it's not the great romance that you two have,

497
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,546
but that's once-in-a-lifetime stuff.

498
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,016
This jet lag's killing me. I'm gonna go lay down.

499
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,485
Okay.

500
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,898
Are you mad at me about something?

501
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,065
No. Of course not.

502
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,368
Then-then what is it?

503
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,575
Soph, I made a horrible mistake

504
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,243
that I'll regret for the rest of my life.

505
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,515
What?

506
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,618
It happened one time,
and it didn't mean anything.

507
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,157
The girl from your acting class?

508
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,959
Yes.

509
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,234
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

510
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,369
You are all that matters to me, okay?

511
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,605
The last thing I'd want to do is hurt you.

512
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,908
Okay, I... I knew that something
was wrong. I even asked Kate.

513
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,077
Don't be mad at Kate. I
begged her not to say anything.

514
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,850
I-I'm sorry,

515
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,685
Kate knew?

516
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,086
I had to tell somebody. Sophie,

517
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,354
it was, it was eating me up inside.

518
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,890
That must've been really hard for you.

519
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:11,891
No.

520
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,594
No, that's not what I... Soph...

521
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,901
KATE: Here he comes.

522
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,470
Kevin, that was amazing.

-We're doing this here.

Guys, the prop guy said
that this thing costs $20,000.

529

Yeah, that's right. It does,
and it's not a toy, so...

Oh. Sorry.

535

same room as one another?

-Of course not.

All right? I'm the one that invited Maddy

539
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,335
-for Thanksgiving... -You
know what, Elijah? The
only man allowed to speak

540
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,104
is the one holding the
jelly baby, and that is me.

541

547

00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,134
(chuckles) Thanks.

700
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,302
-Later, man.
-Yup.

701
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:01,547
Thanks again for all your help.
You are one hell of a sous-chef,

702
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,849
-Miguel.
-Oh, that would be one hell of a compliment,

703
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:07,386
-except I'm pretty sure that you're my sous-chef?
-Mm.

704
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,687
-No. You are.
-Really?

705
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,990
-Yeah. (chuckles)
-I think that... Mm.

706
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,159
Okay.

707
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:17,296
Um, I'm sorry about earlier.

708
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,132
The little digs at Matt. Way out of line.

709
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,668
He seems like a really nice guy.

710
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,403
-He really does.
-Your opinion

711
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,305
matters a lot to me, you know?

712
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,575
-(chuckles)
-And I hate to break it to you,

713
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:33,712
but you're-you're basically
my best friend, Miguel.

714
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,150
Back at you.

715
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,152
(chuckles softly)

716
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,421
Oh, um, I was thinking,

717
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,491
I'd like to invite Marguerite
to Thanksgiving, too.

718
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,259
-If that's okay?
-Oh.

719
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:48,927
I thought Marguerite was old news.

720
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,996
Yeah, well, Marguerite made a comeback.

721
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,132
Turns out she has a hell of a golf swing.

722
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,836
Well, good for Marguerite. (chuckles)

723
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,871
Yeah. I look forward to meeting her.

724
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,940
-Great. Okay.
-Okay.

725
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,780
(door closes)

726
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,051
(strumming chords rhythmically)

727
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,189
Hmm.

728
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,525
Kev, Kev, Kev. Shh, shh, shh.

729
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,527
Could we just keep the jam sessions

730
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,195
to the daylight hours, please? I'm still working

731
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,197
-out here.
-No problem. Sorry.

732
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,966
Sorry. Oh, hey. Real quick
tip. Just brother to brother,

733
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,235
that whole Bluetooth thing?

734
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,737
It's driving Kate crazy.

735
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:35,641
-Thanks for the heads-up.
-No problem.

736
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,309
You know, in fact, uh, just a little tip for you.

737
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,245
The reason I'm out here
pacing around on my Bluetooth

738
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,047
is because I usually take
these phone calls in this room.

739
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,216
The room that you're
currently using as an Airbnb.

740
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,985
-So that's...
-Okay. I was just trying to help you out, man.

741
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,887
-Uh-huh.
-All right? But if you want me to leave,

742
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,923
uh, you just say the word. I can...

743
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,426
You have a good night, Kevin.

744
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,095
-Okay. You have a good night. Okay.
-Okay. All right.

Hi, Vincent.

It's Beth.

Bethany Clarke.

764
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,882
Um, well, Pearson now, but, um...

765
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,718
I used to be a student of yours.

766
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,887
Well, Bethany. How wonderful to hear from you.

767
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,056
Still burning the candle at both ends, huh?

768
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,759
Well, I wish I could say I
pulled back over the years,

769
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,394
but, uh, here I am.

770

(chuckles) My wife is not pleased.

771
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:48,567
Um, how have you been?

772
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,237
I'm well. I'm really well. In fact,

773
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,106
I'm the head of new student
recruitment and development

774
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,309
for the City Ballet of Philadelphia.

775
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,411
Wow. Would you look at that?

776
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,948
I always knew you'd go far, Bethany.

777
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,016
I always saw that in you.

778
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,956
Was there, um, something else?

779
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,925
Yeah.

780
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,994
Um...

781
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,870
I was with you every single day, Vincent.

782
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,606
During my formative years,

783
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,977
you were my sun and my moon and...

784
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,213
Hell, you were like a god
to me, if I'm being honest.

785
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,848
And...

786
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,652
It meant so much that you chose me

787
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,988
out of all the other girls to be your favorite.

788
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:47,025
That confidence you had in me meant everything.

789
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,029
I was ready to be your star.

790
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,567
But, uh...

791
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,168
when my dad died

792
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:00,071
and I couldn't perform up to your standards,

793
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,740
you just...

794
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,209
...tossed me aside.

795
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,911
You literally...

796
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,814
You literally replaced me with someone else

797
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:13,018
without a word of comfort or explanation.

798
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,986
You just...

799
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,689
didn't look back. (chuckles)

800
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,194
Well, I'm-I'm, uh, I'm sorry
you felt that way, Bethany,

801
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:26,998
but it wasn't my job to, uh, coddle you.

802
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,268
It was my job to give you
the technique you needed

803
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,504
-to be a star.
-Yeah. You're right.

804
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:36,207
And, um, and I probably reached my peak, but...

805
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,778
When I think about it, that...

806
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,915
...failure, it...

807
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,686
it turns my stomach like I'm on a roller coaster.

808
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,888
I...

809
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:53,559
It's the part of me that made me feel so small.

810
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:56,528
And it's the part of me that...

811
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:00,632
I tried to hide from my
husband and from my girls and...

812
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,234
It's the part of me I hated.

813
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,638
Well, Bethany, I, uh,

814
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:09,407
I-I don't know what to say.

815
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,880
I thought I would dance on
the world's biggest stages.

816
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,949
But I've learned that there is power...

817
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,654
...in waiting in the wings.

818
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:26,458
In being there for the dancers that are stars

819
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,693
and the ones that aren't.

820
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,296
I...

821
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,601
for so long had put a part of myself away.

822
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,605
But not anymore.

823
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,977
I'm the little island girl who
danced before she walked.

824
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,179
And you took that from me.

825
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,719
But now I'm taking it back.

826
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,723
I know who I am.

827
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,127
