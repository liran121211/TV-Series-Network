First day of summer, we don't want to be

3
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:04,920
the last ones in the pool.

00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:05,919
Hey, where you going?

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,462
Heard the pool closed down.

6
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:08,860
Just want to check it out before it disappears.

7
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:10,987
What are you doing?

8
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:13,521
I hate that I'm doing this over FaceTime,

00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:14,902
-and I miss you.
-I miss you, too.

Southwest flight attendants

into a parody song again.

If you and Toby need your space, just tell me.

14
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:26,978
Yeah, Kev, it's...

15
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:28,933
that's not even our problem right now.

16
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,648
We have a lot more going on than that.

17
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,889
Hey, can you just, can you
help me instead of instructing me?

18
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:34,398
Yeah, Tobe, I can.

19
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,630
I'm here with them every day doing the hard work.

20
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,937
What do you want me to do?

21
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,719
Just not have any opinions about our kids

22
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,123
because you're overly
sensitive about everything I say?

23
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,826
We just keep having the same
argument over and over again.

24
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:49,297
You're upset that I'm not around more.

25
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,816

learn how to swim at the Y.

No. [chuckles] She's doing the backstroke.

43
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:29,809
And you would've learned how to do that, too,

44
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,764

00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,821
the entire time?

178
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,645
[chuckles] Are you just now realizing that?

179
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,685
We've seen this, like, 18 times.

180
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:54,116
It's just so much shirtless Brad Pitt.

181
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:55,854
-I get distracted. [laughs]
-No, I...

182
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:57,598
Fair. Fair.

183
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:00,760
You know what's funny? Um...

184
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,275
Sometimes, I...

185
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,678
imagine

186
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,126
hanging out with Old Toby.

187
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,776
"Old Toby"?

188
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:10,960
Yeah.

189
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:11,832
You know, who he was

190
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,613
before he lost all the weight at the gym

191
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,826
and got his fancy job and better clothes.

192
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:19,214
I guess Old Toby's like my Tyler Durden.

193
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:22,219
I-I know that sounds crazy.

194
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:25,130
[sighs] You guys just need a good weekend.

195
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,477
Yeah.

196
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:28,949
We do.

197
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:30,950
You're right.

198
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,153
Which is why I'm just...

199
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:34,585
I'm gonna go to the Bay to be with my bae,

200
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:37,010
you know, with an open heart and mind.

201
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:39,442
Old Toby is still in there.

202
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,836
Go find him.

203
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,891
Yeah.

204
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:44,702
Okay.

205
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:47,394
[cell phone buzzes]

206
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,391
Hey, babe. Don't worry,

207
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,042
I'm already packed and leaving on time.

208
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:53,647
-Miracles do exist.
-TOBY [over phone]: There's a,

209
00:07:53,648 --> 00:07:55,774
there's a, uh, slight hitch in our giddy-up.

210
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,466
Okay, my-my meeting for my
Tokyo project got rescheduled,

211
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,724
so I won't be able to be at the airport,

212
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:04,198
so I-I booked you the finest electric vehicle

213
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,630
that San Francisco has to offer to pick you up,

214
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,714
and I am... I am, uh, hustling here

215
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,581
to make sure I can get back to the apartment

216
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:13,188
to personally roll out the
red carpet for you myself.

217
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,226
No worries; We have the whole weekend.

218
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:18,918
Oh, I know it, Kate. I am very excited.

219
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,176
I have made plans. I've made so many plans,

220
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:23,086
my plans have plans.

221
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,562
Listen, I'm gonna try and clear my plate here.

222
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,733
Uh, I'm gonna text you the guy's info.

223
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,556
I'll leave my phone on, in
case there are any problems,

224
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:31,615
and I hope you have a safe flight.

225
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:33,874

-Okay, love you.

But do not fret, my sweet pet,

237
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,994
Mommy took one more step in, and she's fine.

238
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:15,735
Just put your face in the water.

239
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:17,603
Pretend it's one giant bathtub.

240
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,734
You blow bubbles in the bath all the time.

241
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,387
Right? Watch.

242
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,037
Mommy'll do it.

243
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,674
Ooh, there's probably a lot of pee in here.

244
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:25,989
JACK: ...sinking to the bottom.

245
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,899
Hey, how about you swim to that wall.

246
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,463
-Think you can do that?
-[squeals] See?

247
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:31,595
-It's easy.
-JACK: Okay, here we go.

248
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:33,502
But, Kate, how will we know

249
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:35,071
that your brand-new bathing suit even works

250
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:37,420
if you don't get it wet?

251
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:38,502
Jack.

252
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:40,492
Yeah, I-I got him.

253
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,752
Jack!

254
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:44,704
Okay. I got you.

255
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:46,485
-He's just a child, Jack.
-Yeah,

256
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,525
-and someday he's gonna be a man.
-[coughing]

257
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:51,347
Hey, you're not ready for the deep end yet, bud.

258
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:53,389
Leave me alone.

259
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:57,210
[sighs] Okay, uh, hey,

260
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:58,990
Bug, you're gonna stay here with Daddy.

261
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:00,422
I'm trying to get her to
put her face in the water,

262
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:03,023
so good luck with that.
-Okay.

263
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:03,940
Great.

264
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,760
Hey, 'no problemo'. We got this.

265
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,150
Put your face in the water.

266
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,738
Daddy, it's not gonna happen.

267
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:17,052
All right; Why do they
make it so hard to get out?

268
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,703
They're trying to make it hard to get into

269
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:21,265
so teenagers like you aren't
wandering around drinking beer,

270
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,349
playing with safety equipment.
-Hey.

271
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,291
What? Oh.

272
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,475
[laughs]

273
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,256
I'm literally trapped.

274
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:30,123
Ah, don't worry.

275
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:31,859
We're not gonna be stuck here all night.

276
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,335
No, I'm not... I'm not talking
about the pool. Although...

277
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:37,027
...if I die where I had my first sloppy kiss

278
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,849
with Stuart, I will be pissed. Um...

279
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,455
No, I'm...

280
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:43,930
trapped in Pittsburgh.

281
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,173
What's so bad about Pittsburgh?

282
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:50,070
Nothing. Nothing's wrong with Pittsburgh. It's...

283
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,961
It's my life in Pittsburgh.

284
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,223
Yeah, I mean,

285
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:55,264
I wake up, eat breakfast,

286
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:59,000
go to the diner where I serve
greasy food to unhappy people,

287
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,863
then I go home and eat dinner, watch TV.

288
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:04,568
Oh, yeah, there's-there's the added bonus lately

289
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,952
of listening to Mom get flirty on the phone.

290
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:09,332
She has a flirty voice. It's... it's haunting.

291
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,460
Only thing I get excited about is

292
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,586
eating ice cream at the
end of the day, but, um...

293
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,310
we can all see where that's gotten me.

294
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,919
So...

295
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:24,484
Aren't you glad you asked?

296
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:55,631
You being here felt like cause for celebration.

297
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,008
This is some of the finest bubbly going.

298
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,005
-Well...
-I am so excited

299
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,133
that you are finally here.

300
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:04,131
I can hardly stand it.

301
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:05,389
-I can't believe it. You're here.
-[chuckles] I know.

302
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,387
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

303
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,471
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

304
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,575
-Très délicieux.
-Mmm.

305
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:14,265
Come here. I want to show you something.

306
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,925
Over to the right is Coit Tower,

307
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:20,456
over the hill is North Beach,

308
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,496
and if you look right through
there, when there's not fog,

309
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:24,162
which is...

310
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,413
never...
-[laughs]

311
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:28,161
-...is the Golden Gate Bridge.
-Wow.

312
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:30,540
It's a really beautiful view.

313
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,365
It really is, isn't it?

314
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:39,395
Mmm.

315
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,219
It has been...

316
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,461
forever.

317
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,764
It sure feels like it.

318
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,720
I think I'm nervous.

319
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,371
-Oh...
-[chuckles]

320
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,678
Well, it's cute.

321
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:54,123
[sighs] Can we just...

322
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:57,705
promise to not let this much time go by?

323
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:00,802
I... promise.

324
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:05,432
Now, I think we have about 20 minutes

325
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,646
before the vegan barbecue arrives,

326
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:10,772
which I know doesn't sound
sexy, but I promise you that it is.

327
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:13,422
-Well, then, bon appétit.
-Mm-hmm.

328
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:15,070
-[giggles]
-[grunts]

329
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:16,684
[sighs]

330
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:21,634
I missed that. Mmm.

331
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,970
Well, I mean... you.

332
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,447
-W-Well, everything.
-Yeah.

333
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:28,098
-You know what I mean. [sighs]
-[laughs] Yeah.

334
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,877
-Is that offensive?
-Offensive?

335
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:32,432
I want those words written on my tombstone.

336
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:35,262
Oh, babe, The Great British Bake Offis back.

337
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,215
You want a little cake and a cuddle?

338
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,300
How about a little squeeze and a scone?

339
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:42,470
Ah, I would love to, my sweet profiterole,

340
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:44,206
but I have... I actually have

341
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:45,987
a work phone call that I have to make real quick

342
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:48,375
that I would've made earlier, were it not for

343
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:50,589
the eight-hour time difference in Tokyo,

344
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,473
so I'm gonna knock this out
real quick, I will not be long

345
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:57,629
Then it is just me, you, Paul and Prue; Okay?

346
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:01,640
Okay; Yeah, I'll just be here.

347
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:08,237
You know I'm always down
for a little Netflix and chill, right?

348
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,669
Wink!

349
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:12,988
-[laughs]
-Let's see what this guy's watching.

350
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,472
Oh, right,

351
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:18,684
Inside Bill's Brain: Decoding Bill Gates.

352
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:21,592

00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,412
Toby,

528
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:36,966
I thought that we were just, like,

529
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:39,653
wrapping our heads around
the idea of San Francisco, and...

530
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:41,521
and now we're making this big decision

531
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:43,083
and putting an offer on a house

532
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,671
that I'm-I'm seeing for the first time?
-I know.

533
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,687
I'm sorry. I just, I-I didn't,

534
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,901
I didn't want to present you with hypotheticals.

535
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:53,249
Kate, trust me, I have put
a lot of thought into this.

536
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:56,439
There are these incredible hiking trails

537
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,355
that lead to an awesome park right on the Bay.

538
00:21:58,357 --> 00:22:01,560
We're near the airport
for easy trips back to L.A.

539
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,751
Kate;

540
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,677
We can do this.

541
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,806
We can make a life up here,

542
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,631
together.

543
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,834
Come on, let me show you where
your mom and Miguel can stay.

544
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,083
Come on. You're gonna love it.

545
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:23,599
Okay, Katie girl. You ready to
get your face in the water, huh?

546
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:26,400
Come on, come on. Let's do
it together, let's do it together.

547
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,189
-We'll do it together.
-No, no, no, no, no!

548
00:22:28,191 --> 00:22:30,983
Okay, okay, how about, uh...

549
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:35,952
How about a new tactic, okay?

550
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:39,556
How about... how about we float on your back?

551
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:42,883
Okay? I'll be right here so
that you don't go under, okay?

552
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:46,354
All right, here, just let go, just let go.

553
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:49,543
Okay, so...

554
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,458
you're in a bad spot,

555
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:54,320
but that's just for now.

556
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:55,969
Dad hasn't been gone that long.

557
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,971
-Everything's weird.
-Yeah.

558
00:22:57,973 --> 00:23:00,441
And maybe instead of
focusing on what's not so great,

559
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:02,439
you can focus on what you want to happen next.

560
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,914
Like, what do you want to
do? What do you want to be?

561
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:08,475
God, you guys. Come on;

562
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:11,682
Guidance counselor's not
a good look on either of you.

563
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:14,123
If you could dream of doing anything,

564
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,360
what would it be? Anything.

565
00:23:17,373 --> 00:23:19,413
That is the problem.

566
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:22,283
I can't think of anything.

567
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:24,280
Okay, I'm not like you guys.

568
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,350
You know,

569
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:26,278
you want to be an actor,

570
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,327
and you want to change the world.

571
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:31,619
We're the exact same age, and you guys are

572
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,310
way ahead of me.

573
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:37,827
Randall, you've already
met the love of your life.

574
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,863
And, Kevin, I mean,

575
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:42,968
you're so far ahead, you've
already ruined one marriage.

576
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,005
I just...

577
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:55,331
When I look into my future...

578
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:58,237
I literally see

579
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:00,765
nothing.

580
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,060
No job, no family.

581
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:08,471
Nothing.

582
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:11,436
TOBY: You know,

583
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,823
you wouldn't think it would
take this long to get a Lyft

584
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:17,041
in the town where the company was started.

585
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:19,598
Hey, listen, I'm sorry

586
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,074
that I sprung the house thing on you like that.

587
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:24,332
I-I meant for it to be a grand gesture,

588
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,468
and I think it might have been a grand mistake.

589
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:29,350
I'm just excited for you to be up here.

590
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:31,053
I know.

591
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:31,756
I am, too.

592
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:35,187
I'm just processing is all.

593
00:24:35,188 --> 00:24:36,892
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah.

594
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,225
Everybody at work is really
excited to meet you tonight.

595
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:41,321
I think we're gonna have a really good time.

596
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,102
Me, too.

597
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:46,781
-The driver can cancel? That's a thing?
-Mm-hmm.

598
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:48,898
-Okay.
-Can we just walk?

599
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,656
Uh, it...

600
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,165
No, I'll just get another one.

601
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,205
Well, I thought you said
your boss lived close by.

602
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:58,331
Yeah, it's not far, but it's... it's...

603
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,907
-You know.
-But what?

604
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,776
It's-it's all up... uphill, so...

605
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:12,567
There we go. Casey is
gonna be here in eight minutes.

606
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:16,611
Why is the car spinning in circles?

607
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:18,826
Oh, this is so beautiful.

608
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:21,214
Yeah, my-my boss sold his first company

609
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,397
to Google for a boatload of money.

610
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,296
Like, literally, that's how he got his boat.

611
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:27,842
But he's surprisingly down
to earth, as is everyone,

612
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:29,265
especially for a bunch of tech weenies.

613
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,049
Oh, and here's a warning.

614
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,328
Do not ask anyone what they actually do

615
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:34,979
for work, trust me.

616
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,976
There they are. The couple of the hour.

617
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:38,974
Finally, I get to meet the famous Kate.

618
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,102
-Hi.
-Kate, this is my boss, Amir.

619
00:25:41,103 --> 00:25:43,142
Nice to meet you, and you are way too young

620
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,444
to be the Amir that I've heard so much about.

621
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:46,095
What are you, like, 25?

622
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:48,005
I love her instantly, Toby.

623
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,568
-I knew you would.
-[Kate laughs]

624
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:51,436
-Well, thank you for having us tonight.
-Are you kidding?

625
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:53,780
I've been wanting to meet
you ever since Toby joined us.

626
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:56,350
-Come on, I'll give you a tour.
-Okay. -[Toby sighs]

627
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:58,171
So you've been with the company a while, then?

628
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:01,209
Yupper. Started here after Facebook,

629
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:04,444
-and just never left.
-Wow. And what do you do?

630
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:07,241
Uh, you know how most businesses can't afford

631
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:11,959
non-technical managers
ideating unrealistic features?

632
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:13,221
Mm-hmm.

633
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:16,476
And your kids are so cute.
Toby showed me the picture

634
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:18,647
of Hailey wrapped around Jack like a baby koala.

635
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:21,910
I called my wife immediately
and told her, "Let's have a baby."

636
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:24,341
-Oh.
-TOBY: Their cuteness is powerful.

637
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:27,452
-Oh.
-It really is. Thank you.

638
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:30,664
So, whether it's reporting or machine learning,

639
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:32,662
I automate tasks for the company

640
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:34,485
because no one wants communication

641
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:36,092
and product inefficiencies between the engineers

642
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:37,687
and everybody else, right?

643
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:39,609
-Right.
-Which is where I come in.

644
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,478
What do you know about infrastructure platforms?

645
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,582
-Um... -She thinks they're
overrated, just like Smash Mouth.

646
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,819
Have you tried this? Try this.

647
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,468
-Oh. Thanks. Sure.
-Thanks so much. Can I borrow her? Hey, come on.

648
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:48,814
-Enjoy.
-[laughs]

649
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,291
How you doing? You doing okay?

650
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,984
Yeah. Yeah, I really am.

651
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,458
-I mean, Toby, everybody's really great.
-Yeah.

652
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,685
-Hi, Kate. Sorry to interrupt.
-Hi.

653
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:59,800
But Warren said you agreed
to trade him Steph Curry.

654
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,797
-What? No!
-Is that true?

655
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:03,795
Why would I do that? Curry's
like the heart of my team.

656
00:27:03,944 --> 00:27:05,724
Sorry. This is fantasy basketball.

657
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:08,111
I'll be back in one and a half seconds.
-Bro.

658
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:09,892
[laughing]: What are you...

659
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:12,627
What are you talking about, I give you Curry?

660
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:14,190
-WARREN: You said it.
-TOBY: I said it in a bar.

661
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:16,361
-WARREN: Oh, no.
-I said it in bar.

662
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,923
You can't believe anything anyone says in a bar.

663
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:20,920
-WARREN: That counts.
-That does not count.

664
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:23,048
-Not in the state of California.
-It's happening. I'm sorry.

665
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,611
[indistinct chatter]

666
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:39,697
I'm so happy you came. [laughs]

667
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,086
Toby's been a lifesaver up here.

668
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:44,926
Most popular at the company by multiple degrees

669
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:47,982
in an office where everyone
genuinely likes each other.

670
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:50,000
Well, the feeling is very mutual.

671
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,070
Thank God he turned down
the job offer back in L.A.

672
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:57,115
Losing him would've been a huge blow for us.

673
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:04,274
-Will you just excuse me for a second?
-Sure.

-No, not at all.

-Do you understand it?
-Uh... Warren might.

682
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:42,029
-We work here, and we don't understand it.
-Yeah.

683
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:44,147
-This is my point.
-We need to leave.

684
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:46,143
Uh, yeah, good-good call.

685
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:47,968
We got to... We have dinner reservations, okay?

686
00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:49,606
Let's just find Amir, and we can say goodbye.

687
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,040
We're not saying goodbye.

688
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,761
We're not going to dinner. We need to leave.

689
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,870
Okay. I'll just call us a Lyft.

690
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:59,213
Hey, what is...? Okay.

691
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:01,732
Kate? Kate? Kate, Kate, Kate.

692
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,285
What is...? What's-what's the matter?

693
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,277
You got a job offer in L.A.?

694
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,263
Y-Yeah, I applied for that job

695
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:12,501
long before I got the job up here.

696
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,127
And the official offer came in

697
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,975
two weeks ago, and it was a joke.

698
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:17,929
It was, like, a big step-down
in title, and barely any money.

699
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,535
You made a decision that directly affects me

700
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:21,730
and our children without telling me?

701
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:23,946
-You lied to me.
-I didn't lie to you.

702
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:26,374
And you made a fool out of me in there.

703
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:28,339
Uh...

704
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:32,948
Can we just talk about this
before we get in this car?

705
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,583
No. I need a minute.

706
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:04,731
All right, how much?

707
00:30:05,382 --> 00:30:06,858
How much what?

708
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,287
How much more does the job pay up here?

709
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,132
You want me to give you numbers?
-Yeah.

710
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:14,027
Yeah, Toby, I'd like numbers.

711
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,982
I need to know how much
is worth me giving up my job,

712
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,057
and a house where Jack feels comfortable,

713
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:22,314
not to mention being near
my family and my sick mother

714
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:24,928
in the same city as Hailey
has two cousins the same age

715
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:27,316
to grow up with.
-That's not a fair question.

716
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:30,388
It's not fair that you're not
thinking about our family?

717
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,232
I'm not thinking about our family?

718
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,960
Wow. That's awesome.

719
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,784
How have you been, then?

720
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:37,481
What do you think I have been doing up here?

721
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:39,433
Living out of a suitcase,

722
00:30:39,435 --> 00:30:41,561
not-not sure which city I'm waking up in,

723
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:44,746
spending all these lonely
nights in this antiseptic apartment.

724
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:47,423
This is all for our family, Kate.

725
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:49,550
Do you know that we have a blind son?

726
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,418
Oh, really? I-I didn't realize.

727
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,315
I thought he was just clumsy.

728
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,034
He knows every inch of our house.

729
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:57,409
We're teaching him a song to get to the park.

730
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:58,973
Okay, you think it's easy to just, like,

731
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:01,101
uproot him and-and put him in a new environment?

732
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:03,962
Okay; You get to ask a bunch of questions.

733
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,877
Let me ask a few.

734
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:08,308
Have you penciled out how expensive it would be

735
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:11,178
to send Jack to a special school if he needs one?

736
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,477
Because I have.

737
00:31:12,478 --> 00:31:15,865
Never mind all of the assistive
technology he's gonna need.

738
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:20,169
Do you know a braille
notetaker alone costs six grand?

739
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,466
And that-that-that... that's just

740
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,464
when he's living at home with us.

741
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,017
What if he wants to go off to college

742
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,532
or live on his own one day?

743
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:30,280
I have big dreams for our son, Kate,

744
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:33,354
and I'm gonna be damn sure
that he has whatever he needs

745
00:31:33,356 --> 00:31:36,129
to live his life however he so chooses.

746
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:39,616
And we can't afford any of that
on an assistant teacher salary

747
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:42,048
and some middling job in Los Angeles

748
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:44,592
that doesn't pay me any real money.

749
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:46,172
Right. Money.

750
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:48,696
Still haven't told me the number.

751
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:54,495
It's not just about the money, is it?

752
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:58,982
It's kind of about you. Right?

753
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,979
Watching you up here; I don't know

754
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,498
You're pretty much the happiest
you've ever been, aren't you?

755
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:06,542
Kate; I am away from my family.

756
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:09,664
I'm-I'm on four planes a week. I am exhausted.

757
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:12,573
Yeah, but you're happy, right?

758
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:14,570
You're happy with your job, with your stature.

759
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:15,959
-[laughs]
-Personally, you're happy.

760
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,323
I-I don't know why you just can't admit it.

761
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:19,606
Yes, yes! I'm happy! I'm happy.

762
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,083
And this is gonna sound like a strange question

763
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:23,169
to ask my wife, but don't you want that for me?

764
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:25,905
Of course I want that for you.

765
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,937
Then why doesn't it feel that way?

766
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:34,544
You know, sometimes I look at you, Toby,

767
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:37,873
and I don't even know who you are anymore.

768
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,167
I don't.

769
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:42,055
You drink expensive champagne.

770
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:44,335
You know how to work a room.

771
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,172
You're not the guy

772
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,103
who wore those terrible Hawaiian shirts

773
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,495
or would make those loud, inappropriate jokes.

774
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:52,264
You're not the guy who'd ask for the wine list

775
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:54,177
and says, "Bring me the whole left side."

776
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:56,954
The goofy guy from our first date,

777
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,894
the Old Toby,

778
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:01,717
the guy that I fell in love with.

779
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,953
I miss him.

780
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:09,821
I miss him so much that I've been picturing him

781
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,168
this weekend here with me.

782
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:14,973
So this whole time that I've been thinking

783
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:16,928
that we're really connecting,

784
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:19,359
you've just been imagining yourself

785
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,855
with a different version of me?

786
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,222
That is not what I said.
That's not what I'm saying.

787
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:26,567
-Is he... is he here?
-Don't do that.

788
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,738
Is he here now? Oh, you
know, maybe we should just...

789
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:31,344
we should get him out here.
Hey, let's get Old Toby out here

790
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:34,730
to join in on this fun! Huh? Hey, you know...

791
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:37,358
you know what I'd love to say to Old Toby, Kate?

792
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:40,332
He was a mess.

793
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:44,457
He was miserable and insecure and self-loathing.

794
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,105
And all-all of that goofiness

795
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:50,926
and-and the loud jokes--
That was out of self-defense.

796
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:54,343
Kate, you fell in love with a coping mechanism.

797
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:57,092
And FYI, if that guy hadn't changed,

798
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:59,741
he would have jumped off a
bridge or died of a heart attack

799
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:01,549
making a joke at his own expense.

800
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,772
Wait. I almost did that last part.

801
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:12,242
What is so terrible about me right now?

802
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,606
That I don't want to dress like a clown?

803
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:19,099
That I want to buy a nice house for my family?

804
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,782
I don't know, Toby.

805
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:24,527
You're just different.

806
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:28,367
And you're not, Kate?

807
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:31,555
Why is this conversation all about me?

808
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:34,522
When-when... when we first got together,

809
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:38,035
it felt like you and me against the world.

810
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:40,471
And today, you couldn't go 20 minutes

811
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:42,511
just us, without FaceTiming the kids.

812
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:44,509
After shooting down an entire day

813
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,940
that I spent weeks planning for you.

814
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:49,084
Admit I'm happy?

815
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,905
Kate, what about you?

816
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,023
You love the life that you are living,

817
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:58,089
this life that you are building without me,

818
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:00,580
where you're the... you're the working supermom

819
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:03,011
who gets to live with her brother again.

820
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:05,898
You finally get to be the fully realized

821
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:08,387
version of yourself, and all you had to do

822
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:11,287
was get me out of that house.

823
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,339
When I was younger, I would...

824
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:22,975
well, I couldn't even think about the future

825
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:25,737
because it just was blank.

826
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:29,688
And... [sighs heavily]

827
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:31,685
I felt that way for a really...

828
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:34,544
a long, long time until I met you.

829
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,509
And you...

830
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,308
you took away a lot of that emptiness.

831
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,640
And so, yeah, Toby, now...

832
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,916
I have a full life

833
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,530
that I could have never dreamed.

834
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:50,356
And I feel healthy, I feel connected,

835
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,917
I feel like I have a purpose.

836
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,854
I love my life. I'm-I'm really, really happy.

837
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:08,418
Except for the one thing that's
making me really, really sad.

838
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:26,659
Thank you.

839
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:31,943
We should have talked about the L.A. offer

840
00:36:31,945 --> 00:36:34,689
even if it wasn't a good one.

841
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,273
We probably should have also talked

842
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,270
about the fact that for most of my life,

843
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:46,481
I have been desperate,
desperate to feel valued at my job,

844
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:50,416
to not just feel like I'm taking up space.

845
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:53,941
I can relate.

846
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:55,268
And...

847
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:00,569
I'm not just taking up space here, Kate.

848
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:03,243
And neither are you.

849
00:37:03,244 --> 00:37:08,365
As wrung out and as exhausted as I am,

850
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,299
I'm happy for us.

851
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:14,263
We have both figured out our worth.

852
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,441
We evolved.

853
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:19,007
I love you.

854
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:20,828
I love our family.

855
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:24,081
But there are some
real-world logistics at play here,

856
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:25,995
and we are gonna have to move to San Francisco.

857
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,557
That's how these logistics are gonna play out.

858
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:31,380
I need you to get on board because...

859
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:34,661
moving here is the only way
that we are gonna stay a family.

860
00:37:34,663 --> 00:37:36,988
It is the only option.

861
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:40,539
[Kate sighs]

862
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:45,023
I'm gonna go get some air.

863
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:49,773
Okay.

864
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:54,090
[door opens]

865
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:59,747
All right, gang; It's time
to get the hell out of here.

866
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:00,791
How?

867
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:04,241
We climb.

868
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,112
Hey, Katie girl, look at me. Look at me.

869
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,505
I believe you can do it.

870
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:34,471
Okay, and Mommy, Randall and Kevin--

871
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:36,338
