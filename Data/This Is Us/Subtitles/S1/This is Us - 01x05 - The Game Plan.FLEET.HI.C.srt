00:05:57,793 --> 00:05:59,043
Breakfast in bed?

181
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,377
Yeah.

182
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:02,046
What did I do to deserve this?

183
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:03,714
I don't know.

184
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:05,349
You've done a lot of
really nice things for me,

185
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:07,468
so I wanted to return the favor.

186
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,887
Oh. By cutting up cardboard
into little squares

187
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,188
and putting it in a bowl?

188
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,389
Those are cheese squares.

189
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:14,892
- Oh, yum.
- Hmm.

190
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:16,143
Yeah. What's on top?

191
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,361
Oh, hemp seed.

192
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:18,812
Hemp seeds on top?

193
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:19,897
Mm-hmm.

194
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,532
Boy, you really buried the lede.

195
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:23,233
- (chuckles)
- Now I'm in.

196
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:24,401
- (laughs)
- What? You're not

197
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,904
gonna have any nonsense made-up food?

198
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:30,240
No. Getting weighed at our
meeting this afternoon.

199
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:32,326
You know what?

200
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:34,662
So am I.

201
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,914
I probably shouldn't eat, either. Damn.

202
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,000
Mm-hmm.

203
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,717
Hey, what do you want to
do after the meeting?

204
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,002
I was thinking miniature golf.
Last time,

205
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:44,088
I was like, 20 under
going into the 18th,

206
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,556
but that little windmill

207
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:48,392
owns my ass.

208
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,260
I can't. Steelers.

209
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:51,562
- Sunday Night Football.
- Hmm.

210
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:52,930
(quietly): Saturday Night Football.

211
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:53,931
With who?

212
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,432
Oh, no one. Just me.

213
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:57,885
- All right. I'll watch with you.
- Oh, no.

214
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:00,346
Thanks, but I'm good.

215
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:02,573
Seriously?

216
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:04,942
You'd rather watch by
yourself than watch with me?

217
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:06,944
Yeah. It's my thing.

218
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:09,029
I have a little ritual. You know?
It's my thing.

219
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,248
Well, your thing...

220
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,449
is sad.

221
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,585
Not to me.

222
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:15,786
(sighing): Okay.

223
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:16,954
Okay. How about this?

224
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:18,539
You can watch football...

225
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,040
all by yourself,

226
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,960
which is totally normal, but with me.

227
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,628
- Toby.
- Hmm?

228
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,059
This is something that I do alone. Okay?

229
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,883
Sure.

230
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:32,269
- Great. Thank you for being so sweet.
- Yeah.

231
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:37,391

Thank, God. Can we please
watch the game now?

244
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:14,178
PAT SUMMERALL: The Rose Bowl is back.

245
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,680
Not an empty seat anywhere.

246
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:17,302
JACK: Hey.

247
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:19,683
- REBECCA: Excuse me.
- That was amazing.

248
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:20,818
- Ah, yeah? Really?
- Yeah.

249
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,102
REBECCA: Oh! Shelly, Miguel.

250
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:23,771
- There they are. Hey!
- JACK: Yeah.

251
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:25,189
- So sorry we're late.
- It's okay.

252
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,523
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

253
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:27,858
MIGUEL: Damn, kids, man. Yeah, we were

254
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,109
just about to head out the door,

255
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,661
and the baby decides to projective vomit

256
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,029
- all over little Andy.
- Yeah.

257
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,864
- Almost got me, too.
- So, what does Andy do?

258
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,282
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.

259
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:36,533
He slaps the baby.

260
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,202
(gasps) Right across the face. Pow!

261
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:40,337
- No! Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine. Yeah.

262
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:42,206
But then the baby's screaming
bloody murder, I'm screaming

263
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,208
at Andy, and me, standing there,
covered in vomit, and I'm like,

264
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,626
Andy, she is a baby.

265
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:47,127
Like, you literally slapped a baby.

266
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,378
Which really helped, as you can imagine.

267
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,214
SHELLY: Of course, then
Andy starts crying,

268
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:52,299
- baby's crying, babysitter's crying.
- MIGUEL: We need drinks!

269
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:53,717
We need drinks. We'll be right back.

270
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,018
REBECCA: Okay.

271
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,137
Wow.

272
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,057
Promise me we are never having kids.

273
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,525
(groans)

274
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,591
I think it's time for shots.

275
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:07,064
ANNOUNCER 2: 26 is having a tough day.

276
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:13,063
- sync and corrections by Caio -

277
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,827
ANNOUNCER: The first half,
the Rams, surprisingly,

278
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,078
- lead Pittsburgh 13 to ten.
- MIGUEL: Pathetic.

279
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,141
Can't stop the run.

280
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh, and Bradshaw sucks!

281
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,101
Oh, no, Bradshaw's gonna have

282
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,903
a huge second half, though. Right, babe?

283
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,439
Yeah. Big... big second half.

284
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:35,778
Are you okay?

285
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:38,614
Mm. Fine.

286
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,916
Okay.

287
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,162
Actually, no.

288
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:47,605
Um, what did you mean before when, uh...

289
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,107
when you said...

290
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:51,609
(chuckles): "Promise me
we'll never have kids"?

291
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:53,744
(chuckles): Oh. I
shouldn't have said that.

292
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:55,446
Yeah, but... you did.

293
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:56,963
Kind of said it twice today.

294
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:59,003
And I shouldn't have.

295
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,138
Okay?

296
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,923
Sorry.

297
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,341
You know what we need to be doing?

298
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:04,592
We need to be feeding

299
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:06,477
the ball to Franco more, right?

300
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,321
That's...

301
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:09,871
'Cause we-we never really talk about it.

302
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:13,518
And I don't want to talk
about it now, either.

303
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,937
We always say we're gonna
talk about it in the future,

304
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:19,273
but it's the future now,
Bec, and I want kids.

305
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,775
SHELLEY: You know what, we're gonna

306
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,994
- go grab another drink at the bar.
- Okay.

307
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,529
SPORTS ANNOUNCER: and
see how the fans...

308
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:25,530
Let's go to the Ginger
Man and Paul Hornung.

309
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:25,863
(sighs)

310
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,615
L.A. fans have to be happy, Paul.

311
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:28,950
BETH: Bedtimes are at 8:00

312
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:31,925
and 9:00... that's teeth brushed,
in the bed. 8:00 and 9:00.

313
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,838
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien,

314
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,089
and then lights out, right?

315
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,508
That's too far.

316
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,843
Okay, listen, relax.

317
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:39,961
We're gonna have a nice,

318
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,045
quiet evening at home. Okay?

319
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:42,680
The girls are gonna play.

320
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:44,348
I'm gonna memorize my
lines and get off book.

321
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,300
Look, we want to make it clear
that we're not normally

322
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:47,628
in the habit of leaving
the girls overnight.

323
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,031
Let alone with two men who
probably haven't been

324
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,065
around kids that much.

325
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,400
One of them's best known

326
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,201
for leaving a kid at a fire station.

327
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,570
Oh, my God, please,
take care of my babies.

328
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,071
And, please, don't call us.

329
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,739
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.

330
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,074
Oh, one more thing,
though, before you go.

331
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,409
So, Tess was the, uh,

332
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,077
the white wine drinker, right?

333
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,996
Annie likes the red 'cause
I don't get that wrong.

334
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,747
- Piss them off.
- (under breath): Thanks.

335
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,416
It's still too far. I can
tell by the way you...

336
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,667
- Yes.
- It's a little too far.

337
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,085
- He plays too much.
- It's okay.

338
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,420
- It's okay.
- He plays too much.

339
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,754
Hey, call us if you need anything.

340
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,756
(whispering): Don't call us.

341
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:22,229
So, I have, you know, this-this
issue with-with cracker control,

342
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,432
so what I've been finding
to be really helpful

343
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,100
is if I...

344
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,268
take the portion

345
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,686
out of the box

346
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,238
and then I put the
portion onto the plate

347
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,106
- and then I put the box
- (whispering): Just pass it.

348
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,408
Away... and then I know...

349
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,278
how... how many crackers

350
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,363
I'm allowed to-to have.

351
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,781
(whispering): Just pass it.

352
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,700
To h... to have,

353
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,702
so then I know that
if-if I'm only allowed

354
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,454
to have ten crackers,

355
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,922
then I have the ten
crackers on my plate,

356
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,091
which is fine, but at the same time,

357
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,293
there are other crackers
that I like than-than

358
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,794
other crackers. So, I might not like

359
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,596
saltine crackers as much as I like

360
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:56,597
a Cheez-It type cracker,

361
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,050
but so, what I'll do

362
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,468
with the Cheez-It type cracker

363
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,720
is maybe put a little
bit more on the plate,

364
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,772
but I'm still rationing,
so if I have a saltine,

365
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,641
then I might put ten on the plate,

366
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,442
but there might be 20
if it's a Cheez-It.

367
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,277
But I still put the box away.
So, I-I mean

368
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,646
I-I think that's... that's a win.

369
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,814
- MAN: Yeah.
- (applause)

370
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,453
(mouthing)

371
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,577
She was always away on business.

372
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,330
So, I was used to being alone
but this, you know, this...

373
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,332
but this was a different kind of alone.
She was always away

374
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,334
on business, so I was used to being...

375
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,836
but... so, I was...

376
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,421
She was always away on business,
so I was used to being alone,

377
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,006
but this was a different kind of alone.

378
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,008
You know? This-this... is
a different kind of...

379
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,976
I thought you two were watching a movie.

380
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,094
We want to have

381
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,478
a Barbie fashion show.

382
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,813
Oh, cool. That sounds fun.

383
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:47,348
So, go play Barbie fashion show.

384
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,600
We need you to be the celebrity judge.

385
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,601
Right.

386
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,770
Uh, the thing is I can't

387
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,488
because I got this rehearsal tomorrow

388
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,823
and I really want to be off book, so...

389
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:56,991
What does "off book" mean?

390
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,659
Off book. Off book means, uh,

391
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,827
means that I know my lines.

392
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,529
So, uh, you, uh...

393
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,780
have Grandpa be the judge.

394
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,331
Grandpa's not a celebrity.

395
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,332
Yeah.

396
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,035
Their logic seems sound.

397
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,287
Thank you.

398
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,007
Okay. Um... tell you what? You want to,

399
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,008
you want to help me? You want to,

400
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,176
you want to read the play with me?

401
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:16,460
- Okay.
- Yeah. Oh, come on.

402
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,461
- Okay.
- Yeah, let's do that.

403
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,879
Come on, over here. William,

404
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,214
- let's do it.
- I'm not much of an actor.

405
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,017
Oh, doesn't matter. I just need
to get the lines down, so...

406
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,685
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.

407
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:27,354
Uh, you're gonna be
Jessica, David's wife.

408
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:29,557
Why does she get to be Jessica?

409
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,225
- (chuckles)
- Well, um, be...

410
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,561
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?

411
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,563
Gracie's Jessica's mom,
which is kind of cool.

412
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,064
It means you get to boss
your sister around.

413
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,532
How's that sound?

414
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,235
So. William, multiple questions.

415
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,703
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you,

416
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:45,239
- it's a little delicate.
- Go ahead.

417
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,042
Do you know how to read?

418
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,494
Yes, I can read.

419
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,580
I knew it. I was joking.

420
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,381
Of course you know how to read.
(chuckles)

421
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:56,550
Trying to be funny. Okay. So if you

422
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:59,837
could please read the role of Brad.

423
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,590
Terrific, okay. Whoa, where we going?

424
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,924
I have to pee.

425
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,893
Oh, I kind of do, too.

426
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:09,199
What are you... Oh, good God. (chuckles)

427
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:17,485
Mm.

428
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:26,092
Now, this is what

429
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,209
I'm talking about.

430
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,707
Okay, babe, here's the plan.

431
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,042
Sex first.

432
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,460
Right away.

433
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,045
Loud, adult,

434
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,796
no kids in the next room sex.

435
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:37,965
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.

436
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:41,135
We just need to get the job done.

437
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,638
And under no circumstances
are we allowed

438
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,806
to fall asleep afterwards
watching House Hunters.

439
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:48,726
Don't want to miss the whole
night sleeping. Right?

440
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:50,478
Ooh.

441
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,897
We'll do it in the shower.

442
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,398
That's good.

443
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Won't fall asleep in
the big fancy shower.

444
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:59,904
And we'll order room service before.

445
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:03,074
That way we will finish
our loud adult shower sex

446
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:06,077
just as room service arrives
and we will slip on robes

447
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,913
and eat burgers... No, wait...
spaghetti.

448
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,548
No, I like burgers better.

449
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,751
We will eat burgers in bed.

450
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:15,586
Ooh.

451
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:18,589
Oh. Now, the big question is...

452
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:21,592
what to order on pay-per-view.

453
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:24,178
Oh, I already hope they,
uh, I hope they have that

454
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,847
Huge Grant-Meryl Streep movie
that sounds like a black lady.

455
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:29,600
Come on. Florence Foster Jenkins.

456
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:31,569
Baby, they already got
Florence Foster Jenkins.

457
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,987
I'm late.

458
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,745
I'm a week and a half late, Randall,

459
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,531
and I feel like crap.

460
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:46,584
And I was chewing on
ice all day yesterday

461
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:49,036
and I almost threw up
when I looked at pizza

462
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:51,956
and I cannot bring myself
to go to the drugstore

463
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,291
and get a pregnancy test.

464
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:57,428
I'm bugging out, baby.

465
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,264
I need you to talk me down.

466
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:03,100
Oh.

467
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,301
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, good.

468
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,303
Come on in. We got carrots, celery,

469
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:08,472
broccoli, no dip. You're welcome.

470
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:10,141
Thank you, that's so nice.

471
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:12,143
Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is
my good friend, Shooter.

472
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,478
- Shooter, Kate.
- Hey.

473
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,615
- Nice to finally meet you, Kate.
- Hi. Nice to meet you, too.

474
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:19,817
Great news. You both love sports, so...

475
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:21,986
sports party.

476
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:25,489
AL MICHAELS: and the Kansas City
Chiefs on Sunday Night Football.

477
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,324
COMMENTATOR: Bradshaw drops back.

478
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,076
Bradshaw's got time...

479
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:30,961
(crowd exclaims)

480
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:34,298
So, what do you think, Jack?

481
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,167
Looking like it's gonna come
down to the fourth quarter.

482
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:45,509
You want to do this now?
Okay. Let's do it.

483
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:48,012
So...

484
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,182
I am not enough for you.

485
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,434
Am I not enough for you, Jack?

486
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:55,352
- Okay, back to the bar?
- Yup.

487
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:57,521
I never said that. I just meant

488
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:59,524
we need to have this
conversation at some point.

489
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:00,191
Okay.

490
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,493
And you want to do that
right now, at Froggy's

491
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:04,528
- during the Super Bowl?
- Yes, please don't make us

492
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,081
- miss a second of your drama.
- Could you butt out?

493
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,667
Hey...

494
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:11,619
babe,

495
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,704
we joke about it.

496
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,840
We see people with kids and go,

497
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:17,291
"Oh, thank God that's not us."

498
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,343
We joke about it. Right?

499
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:20,878
Did I not get the joke?

500
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,546
I'm not...

501
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,014
Babe, you're right.

502
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:25,466
You are right.

503
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:27,885
And coming from the
family that-that I did,

504
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,554
I definitely never saw
myself having kids.

505
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:33,023
- Okay.
- But then I met you.

506
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:36,727
And, you know, we're j...
we're great together

507
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:39,313
and I love our life.

508
00:17:39,315 --> 00:17:41,198
But the older we get,

509
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,367
the more I think that...

510
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,653
the more I think there's
got to be something bigger

511
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:49,540
than just me and you.

512
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:52,042
Well, thank you very
much for involving me

513
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:55,880
in this huge invisible
change of yours. Huge.

514
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,582
Because you knew when you
met me and married me

515
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:01,051
that I did not want to
be one of those women

516
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:03,053
whose sole purpose in
life was to be a mother.

517
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:06,223
If that's what you wanted, you
should have married my mom.

518
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,259
I was thinking more your sister.

519
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,094
Oh. You probably were.

520
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:13,681
- I'm... it's a bad joke.
- I'm not there yet, Jack.

521
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:15,566
I'm not there yet.

522
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:18,602
- I am only 29.
- Almost 30.

523
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:19,515
I know how old I am!

524
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,022
Hey, Sid and Nancy, will
you two take it outside?

525
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,941
- Could you just shut up for a second?
- Mind your business.

526
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:25,776
None of us can hear the
game over your mouth.

527
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:27,411
- Wow.
- You got to learn some manners, pal.

528
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:29,113
You need to control your woman.

529
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:30,748
- You need to watch your mouth.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

530
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,249
Jack, sit down.

531
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:35,920
Come here. It's not worth it.
Jack, sit down, please.

532
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:37,254
Jack.

533
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:39,290
(grunts)

534
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,208
- God, Jack.
- Jack! Jack.

535
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,960
No! No, no, no, no.

536
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:45,379
(indistinct chatter)

537
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:48,799
Yeah, we should really be having kids.

538
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,307
(low, indistinct conversations)

539
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:11,628
Aren't you gonna say anything?

540
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:18,318
Uh, yeah. Like, how?

541
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,499
You take the pill every day
like clockwork, right?

542
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:21,179
Yeah.

543
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,130
What, did I accidentally drop
one in my shake or something?

544
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:25,048
No. I...

545
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,550
I mean, I changed medications last month

546
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,552
and there might have been,
like, a brief window.

547
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,886
A brief window?

548
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:32,639
Sorry.

549
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,224
A brief window, Beth?

550
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:35,859
Did it not occur to you that
that might be something

551
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:37,311
- you want to run by your husband?
- Well,

552
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:38,312
I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.

553
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:40,397
Well, there goes Charleston.

554
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:43,233
Okay, I'm sorry, what?

555
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,869
Ten years from now, when the
girls are both off at college,

556
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:49,039
I thought that we would take an
early retirement in Charleston.

557
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,907
Oh, forgive me, Randall,

558
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,826
but what in the holy hell
are you talking about?

559
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:54,494
Since when do you want
to move to Charleston?

560
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:56,496
I saw something about it on CNN.

561
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:58,749
Like, they got a great quality
of life, good restaurants.

562
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,720
Sometimes at work, I look
up places on Zillow.

563
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:07,391
Oh, okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that I'm screwing with

564
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,393
your super top secret
Charleston dream, honey.

565
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:12,019
No, my issues are nothing
compared to yours.

566
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:12,697
Nobody's saying that.

567
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:13,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, here's a riddle...

568
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:17,267
who has two hands and was about
to go back to work full-time

569
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:19,269
and maybe, maybe... start
to remember who she was?

570
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:20,771
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:22,439
But now will have to split her time

572
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:26,276
between a diaper station
and a home office?

573
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:28,278
This girl, right here.

574
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,080
- It's two thumbs.
- What?

575
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:31,782
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say

576
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:33,450
- "what has two thumbs and is
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

577
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:34,618
- Gonna be splitting time betw..."
- Shut up.

578
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,670
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.

579
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:40,590
Hey.

580
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:42,626
- Also, some Altoids.
- Please.

581
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:45,629
SHOOTER: Look at that picture.

582
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:47,264
That is a vivid picture.

583
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:48,882
I feel like I'm at the game.

584
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,635
ANNOUNCER: Over across the field, here.

585
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:53,770
Yeah. It's a really nice TV...

586
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:55,138
What is this?

587
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,640
Plasma?

588
00:20:56,642 --> 00:20:57,941
LED?

589
00:20:57,943 --> 00:21:00,143
You know, I'm really not sure, but...

590
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:01,144
Hey, Toby!

591
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:02,145
TOBY: Yeah?

592
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:03,230
Uh, do you guys like

593
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:04,981
- jicama?
- Plasma or LED?

594
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:06,950
TOBY: I...

595
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,652
have no idea.

596
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:09,820
- Kate? Jicama?
- What?

597
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:11,071
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?

598
00:21:11,073 --> 00:21:13,824
Can... can you actually just move, Tob?

599
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:15,959
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep.

600
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,911
ANNOUNCER: The receiver's all set.

601
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:20,163
To the right, Ben looks straight

602
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:22,165
over the middle, and
going for the end zone!

603
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:23,250
- (TV beeps)
- TOBY: Hey.

604
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:24,801
Shooter, uh, tell Kate

605
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:26,253
about that time we accidentally

606
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:28,338
went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.

607
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,473
- (laughing): Oh...
- (Toby laughing)

608
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:30,757
Uh, you got to hear this.

609
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,975
So, we were trying to... I'm sorry.

610
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:33,176
Toby, you paused the TV.

611
00:21:33,178 --> 00:21:34,428
It's like, paused.

612
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,679
Yeah, just for a second. Listen to this.

613
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:36,680
No, this is a great story.

614
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,348
No. O-Okay,

615
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,317
I know it's not a big deal, really,

616
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,985
but I kind of like to watch sports

617
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:43,103
as they happen live.

618
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:44,488
Probably just me, right?

619
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,440
- Okay. Okay. Here we go.
- I don't know.

620
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,442
- ANNOUNCER: tends to wait...
- Now we're behind the game!

621
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,110
Fast forward it!

622
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:52,612
ANNOUNCER: Touch down!

623
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:54,698
And Heyward made it all
alone down the left side...

624
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,615
That's great. That's your team, right?

625
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:56,616
That's my fantasy team.

626
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,034
- What's that?
- You know what,

627
00:21:58,036 --> 00:21:59,202
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

628
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:00,454
I'm actually not feeling good.

629
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:01,621
I'm gonna go ahead and go.

630
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:03,006
- Oh, no!
- Yeah...

631
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,007
Are you sure?

632
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:05,292
- Yeah.
- No, Kate, stay.

633
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:06,543
Shooter...

634
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:08,128
- it was really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

635
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,346
- What... wait, wait, wait.
- Seriously,

636
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:10,547
- thank you for the jicama.
- What...

637
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:11,798
I'll talk to you later.

638
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,184
What is happening?

639
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,552
You have to let her go, David.

640
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:16,853
This is crazy, man.

641
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,722
She's gone and she's never coming back.

642
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,391
- Whew.
- (scoffs)

643
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:23,026
You really never acted before?

644
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:24,194
Nope.

645
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:25,228
Voice like silk.

646
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,898
- (chuckles)
- Yeah.

647
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,234
How am I supposed to move on, David?

648
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:32,569
No. I'm David.

649
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:34,738
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?

650
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,240
And who made you the
expert of moving on?

651
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:39,242
Or the expert of anything
for that matter?

652
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:42,245
Is that how you're gonna do it?

653
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:44,664
No.

654
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,966
Good.

655
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:48,385
It's your line. Uh,

656
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:49,669
- Tess, honey, you have the next line,
- Uh...

657
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:51,555
- pay attention.
- I-I'd rather

658
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:53,056
you not move on. I'm...

659
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:56,259
I'm obv... I'm obviously
not planning to.

660
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:57,394
It's not good.

661
00:22:57,396 --> 00:22:58,762
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

662
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:00,180
- No.
- No. Okay.

663
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:01,932
There she is! Do you see her?

664
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,433
Who, David? Did I see who?

665
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:04,601
Her! She's right there.

666
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:05,602
And ever since she died,

667
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:06,770
her ghost has been haunting me.

668
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,238
Hold up.

669
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,440
What's the matter, sweetheart?

670
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:12,576
What's happening in this story?

671
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:14,744
You're not following the story?

672
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:17,747
Do you follow it?

673
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,450
Of course. Yes, of course I follow it.

674
00:23:20,452 --> 00:23:21,785
Um... (muttering)

675
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:23,119
- Mm-hmm.
- She died, right?

676
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:24,254
She's dead.

677
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:26,089
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.

678
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:28,258
So when you die you become a ghost?

679
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,793
No.

680
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:32,462
- No, no, no, no, no. No.
- Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.

681
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,452
So what happens when you die?

682
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:40,971
What happens when you die?

683
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:44,724
Uh, is... you die.

684
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:46,309
Forever?

685
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,778
Sure... or not.

686
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,947
I don't know. Honey, here's
the thing, you know,

687
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:53,149
do we want ghosts or do we not
want ghosts? Because I can...

688
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,819
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick,

689
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,787
is Grandpa gonna die?

690
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:59,823
(whispering): Why are
you asking me this?

691
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:02,993
Yes? Yes.

692
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:04,461
Soon?

693
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:06,329
Well, you know, I mean,

694
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:08,416
I wouldn't get too attached
if I were you, so...

695
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:08,889
(clears throat)

696
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:10,634
No! No, no, no.

697
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:12,302
That's not what I meant.
Look, I-I mean, I meant it,

698
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:13,970
but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?

699
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:16,506
Here's the thing about
death, is that it's natural.

700
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:18,975
It's just natural. I'm gonna die, okay?

701
00:24:18,977 --> 00:24:20,927
You two? You're gonna die.

702
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,513
Mommy and Daddy are gonna die.

703
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:25,932
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna die?
- KEVIN: No. Uh...

704
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:27,767
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, Wil...

- But it's not just about football.

Okay. What's it about then?

892
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:37,638
Okay. So, growing up,

893
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,641
I used to watch the
Steelers with my dad.

894
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,893
Right? Every single Sunday,

895
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:45,563
until I grew up and...

896
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:48,983
I moved out here and I
just got out of the habit.

897
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:51,902
It wasn't until the
2006 AFC Championship

898
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:53,738
when they played the Broncos.
Do you remember?

No.

900
00:34:57,577 --> 00:34:59,577
