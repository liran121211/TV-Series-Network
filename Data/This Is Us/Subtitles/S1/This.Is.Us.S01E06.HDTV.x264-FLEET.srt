00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:04,141
What?

3
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:06,438
I think it's time we go
at it alone for a while.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,832
You know? See what happens.

5
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,467
This doesn't say "pause" on my script.

6
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:10,969
Well, it doesn't say "suck"
either, yet here we are.

<i>I'm not cut out for theater.</i>

8
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:15,807
You do that a lot... doubt yourself.

9
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,576
You're so busy making sure that
Kate's not eating too much...

10
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:19,744
Kev, calm down.

11
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:21,646
And Randall's not too adopted!

12
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:24,549
I'm sorry. I should have been
there, and I'm gonna be there.

00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:37,789
I wondered if that man could
possibly be my father.

- Yeah, I'll, um...

29
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:21,575
- He just wants milk.
- I'll bring some home.

Do you want some more apples? Come on.

31
00:01:22,678 --> 00:01:23,978
Come on. Here, do you want to get out

- Yeah.

33
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:26,780
All right. Come on.

<i>Babe, a desk job?</i>

00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,451
<i>Bec, we need the money.</i>

<i>You don't even own a tie.</i>

37
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:01,148
So...

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,383
did you hear?

39
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:04,351
Uh... yeah.

40
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:06,186
Surprise birthday cake for
Sandra in the break room.

41
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:08,222
You know, it's never,
it's never a surprise.

42
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,323
Als... Okay, also,

43
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:11,158
I got promoted.

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,993
Project manager.

45
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:15,462
- That's great, man. Hey.
- Thanks.

46
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:17,431
And I'm bringing you with me.

47
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:20,935
Oh. Um...

48
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:22,970
thanks, but no.

49
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:24,619
- But thanks.
- No?

50
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,339
Keep this quiet,

51
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,108
but I'm, uh, gonna go out on my own.

52
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,511
I want to start my own thing.

53
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:32,813
I know it's risky, but once I
get things up and running,

54
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:34,949
I can spend more time with my kids.

55
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,918
All right, how 'bout
this: why don't you, um,

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,553
take till the end of the week,

57
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:41,388
think about it. I'm okay.

58
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,690
Don't need to think.

59
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:45,426
End of the week, okay? Huh?

60
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,071
Hi!

61
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,739
- Daddy's home!
- Hi!

62
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,274
- Hey!
- Dad! Dad!

63
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,642
- Hi. Dad!
- Kev.

64
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,177
- Dad! - Hi. Hey, buddy.
- Kev...

65
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:04,945
- I need to ask you a question...
- One second. - Dad!

66
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:07,281
- Hey, look-look at the progress you made, bud.
- Watch this.

67
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:09,131
I'm gonna help you out
after dinner, okay? Hi.

68
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:09,916
Hi, baby. Mwah.

69
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,352
- Dad!
- Yeah.

70
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,420
- We're getting ice cream!
- Ice cream!

71
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,288
- Ice cream?
- I promised them.

72
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,823
Ice cream? Ice cream?!

73
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:17,858
None for me if you want

74
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,960
- to be able to pick me up again.
- Please, you are tiny.

75
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:22,196
- Right. Mm.
- But ice cream must mean that the kids'

76
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:24,000
report cards came back
and they were good?

77
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:24,492
No.

78
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,333
Actually, mostly B's and C's. I caved.

79
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,936
I don't know. Parenting
makes my cerebellum hurt.

80
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:30,337
Sorry, your what?

81
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:33,307
It's the part of my brain
that makes my emotions.

82
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,843
I have been doing way too much
third grade science homework.

83
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:36,944
Mm.

84
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:41,081
But why don't you, uh, look at that.

85
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,050
Why does Randall's
teacher want to see us?

86
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:46,654
I don't know.

87
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:48,956

96

Hope you don't mind. Pianos get
forlorn if you don't play 'em.

97
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:20,554
- No, of course I don't mind.
- Where'd you learn

98
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:22,990
- how to play like that?
- My dad taught me.

99
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:24,616
And his dad taught him.

100
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,652
Dad, can you teach us to play?

101
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:28,620
Uh, I wish I could.

102
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:31,458
Grandma and Aunt Kate got all
the music talent in the family.

103
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,092
Me? I was always all knuckles.

104
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:34,259
Yeah, well, your dad's

105
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,794
got other skills.

106
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:37,696
Me, I managed to squeak
out a couple of dollars

107
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:39,431
on one of these back in the day.

108
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:42,067
Mostly trumpet, mm.
Any gigs I could get.

109
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,902
Will you speak at my career day?

110
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:45,437
Can Grandpa speak at my career day?

111
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,139
I don't think so, baby.

112
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:49,241
You're only allowed one speaker,
and I'm already signed up.

113
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:50,375
I pick Grandpa.

114
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,945
He had a cool job.

115
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,880
What are you saying, that Daddy
doesn't have a cool job?

116
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:58,917
But you guys love visiting
me at the office, right?

117
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,054
I like spinning in your chair.

118
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:04,756
You kind of have a boring job, Dad.

119
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:06,992
Trading commodity futures based
on long-term weather patterns

120
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:08,760
is not boring, okay?

121
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:14,933
Sorry, sort of fell asleep soon
as I heard the word "commodity."

122
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:17,369
Ooh, Uncle Kevin, can you
speak at my career day?

123
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,738
Daddy's doing career day!
End of discussion.

124
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,107
And it's gonna be lit.

125
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,812
That's not how you use "lit," right?

126
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:29,314
- No.
- No.

127
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:31,316
Sorry, I don't understand.

128
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:33,919
So you are saying that
Randall is gifted?

129
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,320
But his grades are average.

130
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,189
Are you sure you tested him right?

131
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,424
Jack, we know how smart he is.

132
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,260
Okay, so what's up with his grades?

133
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,629
M-Maybe is the-the teacher prejudiced?

134
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:45,063
- Jack.
- No.

135
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:46,431
When a child tests well

136
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,300
but his grades don't seem to reflect it,

137
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,968
oftentimes, he isn't being challenged

138
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,370
at his school.

139
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:55,073
And you maybe want to
consider other options.

140
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:57,042
They have wonderful programs

141
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:59,144
for exceptional children like Randall.

142
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,179
Not gonna happen.

143
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,714
Jack, please stop making me say "Jack."

144
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:05,651
Randall is one of the only
black kids at this school,

145
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,119
but at least here he has
his brother and sister.

146
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,820
I know. What about them?

147
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,556
I mean, can they go, too?

148
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:13,125
Mr. Pearson, all due respect,

149
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,594
Kevin and Kate wouldn't
do well in that school.

150
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:17,930
You see, that's where you're wrong.

151
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:20,632
All of our children are exceptional.

152
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:24,369
Can I touch you?

153
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,405
I just want to touch you one more time.

154
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:28,307
Just... one part of your body.

155
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,342
Your hair.

156
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:32,511
I want to wake up...

157
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,782
I'm sorry, I... I'm...

158
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,884
I'm not... I'm sorry, can we...
can we just start over?

159
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:41,753
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Kevin,
can I ask you something?

160
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:44,356
Yeah.

161
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:45,557
Why...

162
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,527
Just try to help me understand this.

163
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:51,263
Wh-Why, every time we
come to this scene,

164
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:55,634
this-this pinnacle of
grief, which should rip...

165
00:06:55,636 --> 00:07:00,872
I mean, literally rip...
tears from the audience,

166
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:03,875
why you summon up all the emotion

167
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:06,778
of a Google Maps voice.

168
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,650
Right. Uh...

169
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:13,218
I don't know. May...

170
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,120
- You know, maybe it's in the words.
- How would you know?

171
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:17,089
- You've never said them.
- Uh, no,

172
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,557
I think... I think I'm saying 'em.

173
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,292
No. I mean, yeah, like, s-some.

174
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:22,628
Kind of. But you're-you're
mostly paraphrasing.

175
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,096
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Y-Yeah.

176
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,764
You see, it's really simple.

177
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:29,001
Olivia is Jessica, your wife.

178
00:07:29,003 --> 00:07:31,136
- Okay.
- You are David.

179
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:34,339
You loved her,

180
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,375
but now she is dead.

181
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:40,646
So you are grieving the<i> loss</i> of her.

182
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:43,782
There's no longer any
such thing as gravity.

183
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:47,919
Have you ever lost anyone?

184
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,388
Yes.

185
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,656
Because I don't believe you.

186
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,257
Well, you know, Ron, it's not my job

187
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,258
to make sure you believe me.

188
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,193
Oh, yes, yes, it is! It is!

189
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:57,362
It is exactly your job!

190
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:59,331
Do your job.

191
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,465
What is she writing?

192
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,466
What are you writing?

193
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:03,335
That's her suicide note.

194
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:04,536
All right, all right, enough,

195
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:05,437
okay?

196
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,407
He'll get there.

197
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:09,775
Okay.

198
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,376
All right.

199
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,445
10:00 a.m. Tuesday, everybody.

200
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,814
Thank you. It's a process.

201
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,716
Just... let it go for now.

202
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:20,619
Yeah.

203
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:23,021
What are you doing tomorrow?

204
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:25,090
Oh. Uh, well, tomorrow
I was just gonna spend

205
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:26,992
the entire day feeling
like a failure, but, uh...

206
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,794
Come to a party with me.

207
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:31,163
A party? What kind of party we talking?

208
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,665
- I'll text you the address.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

209
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:40,339
There's no way in hell.

210
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:43,008
This job better be worth it.

211
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,376
See ya, world.

212
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,244
It's been real.

213
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:49,614
Oh, Jesus.

214
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:53,752
You sure you're all right?

215
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:56,221
Oh. Yeah, I'm good.

216
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:58,690
I'm good. Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,525
I'm good.

218
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:02,327
Uh, Mrs. Rosenthal...

219
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,462
Marin.

220
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:06,098
Oh. Marin.

221
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,400
I realize that my previous
employment with my brother

222
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:10,569
might not be directly applicable.

223
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:13,171
However, I am abnormally organized.

224
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,073
And I'm basically the not crazy version

225
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,975
of Jack Nicholson in<i> As Good as It Gets.</i>

226
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:18,744
Oh, I love that movie. Oh. Right?

227
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:21,079
"You make me want
to be a better man."

228
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,382
Oh! Sorry.

229
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:24,783
I'm sorry, you were saying...

230
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:27,119
No. I-I have grant writing experience,

231
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:30,622
and I'm used to dealing with
Hollywood types, which I know

232
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,657
are large contributors
to your foundation.

233
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,826
And I know you're on the
board of Stay In Touch

234
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,128
- and the Butterfly Ball.
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,462
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

236
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:39,898
Um, Doug Kincaid,

237
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,067
your boss before your brother, was it?

238
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:44,636
He speaks about you in
such glowing terms.

239
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:46,338
Why did you quit his firm?

240
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,708
Because I fell in love with him,

241
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,777
and it was not a healthy situation.

242
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,612
I like you, Kate.

243
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:55,247
You're qualified, you're smart,

244
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,516
and I need someone right now by my side.

245
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:59,184
Now, it's not assistant work.

246
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:01,186
It's part event coordinator,
part development associate.

247
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,121
I would be absolutely thrilled.

248
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:06,258
But there is some personal
stuff you may have to do,

249
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,659
an errand here or there,

250
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:09,628
maybe drive my daughter to and from?

251
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,263
Yeah. Okay.

252
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:12,664
Not much, so don't worry about that.

253
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,999
No, of course.

254
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,634
Yeah. So, do you want the gig?

255
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:17,402
Wait, really?

256
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:19,004
- I'm so excited!
- Oh!

257
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:21,239
Well, I'm so excited!

258
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,541
Oh, I wanted you from the moment

259
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:24,309
the toilet paper was stuck to your head.

260
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,478
Seriously, though, whatever you need,

261
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
I'm your girl.

262
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,115
Oh, hey,

263
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:32,884
this is my daughter.
Jemma, this is Kate.

264
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:35,020
So, I see you picked the fat one.

265
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:40,358
Oh.

266

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,145
Weather derivatives are
tradable commodities

268
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,975
that protect business owners

269
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,290
from future changes in the weather.

270
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,625
It's like licking a piece of pizza

271
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:01,128
so that nobody will eat it later.

272
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,865
Now I'm thinking about pizza.

273
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:05,749
Okay.

274
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,801
No, wait, I'm sorry... no, no, no, wait,

275
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,870
- I was gonna get it this time.
- Look, how am I supposed to inspire

276
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,839
an auditorium full of strangers,
and my own wife and kids

277
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,073
don't even understand what I do?

278
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:15,008
- That's not true.
- Really?

279
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,611
What do I do?

280
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:20,247
You trade weather.

281
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,850
You trade commodities based
on weather patterns.

282
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,251
And what does that mean?

283
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:26,520
Oh, damn, Randall, I don't know.

284
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,455
You swap lightning bolts
for thunder clouds?

285
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:31,592
Look, I know what your day is like.

286
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:33,494
I know that you like
one of your partners

287
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:35,062
and you hate the other one.

288
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:37,498
I know that you're gonna
redesign your office furniture

289
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,066
and that you might fire your assistant

290
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,201
- because she says "like" too much.
- It's nonstop.

291
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:43,604
Can I talk to you in depth
about weather patterns?

292
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:45,372
No, I cannot.

293
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:47,808
But I don't think you'd want
me to if I could, so...

294
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,145
Hey, what's-what's this really about?

295
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:54,815
Maybe I was meant to be a musician.

296
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:56,650
I'm sorry, what now?

297
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,118
Or an artist or a writer.

298
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Just think about it, Beth.

299
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:02,055
There's this whole genetic side of me

300
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:03,657
that nobody even knew existed.

301
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,361
I mean, William was a poet,

302
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:09,329
an artist, a musician.

303
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:11,832
You know, maybe I've had an
artistic side in me all along

304
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,801
and nobody knew to empower it.

305
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,235
You know, maybe I wasn't meant to be

306
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,137
a straight and narrow math geek

307
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,372
destined to wear a shirt
and tie every day

308
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:19,373
like my parents thought.

309
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,407
Maybe I was meant to live

310
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,309
a musician's life.

311
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:25,746
On the road and playing clubs, you know?

312
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:29,183
All right, well, in this musical
fantasy version of yourself,

313
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:30,984
what instrument would you... Sax.

314
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:32,886
Mm. Like Wesley in<i> Mo' Better Blues.</i>

315
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:33,954
Definitely sax.

316
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,522
Oh, yeah.

317
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:36,857
That's sexy, yeah.

318
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,125
You're making fun of me.

319
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:40,093
- No.
- No, you're making fun of me.

320
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:42,062
No, I am not. I'm-I'm not.

321
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:44,798
Your biological father just
came back into your life,

322
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
and it's bringing up all kinds of stuff.

323
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,335
It's-it's normal.

324
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:49,970
Look,

325
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:54,641
why don't you try out
this-this crazy artist side

326
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:58,278
of yourself and, you know, get
this presentation popping.

327
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,081
Let's see how it flies with
some eight-year-olds, right?

328
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,649
Before you, like, shift careers

329
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,519
and start playing open
mic saxophone nights.

330
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:07,221
- You know, maybe I will.
- Okay, yeah.

331
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:09,489
- I see you are making fun of me, but I will.
- No, yeah.

332
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,258
- Why don't you stop smiling?
- I can't.

333
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,227
- Stop smiling.
- I'm sorry.

334
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:16,296
This early midlife crisis is
so you, I can't stand it.

335
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,999
You want something to smile about?

336
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,902
- No, please.
- Do you, do you really?

337
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,982
Hi, can I speak to Michael please?

338
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:36,683
Hey, Tanner, it's Kate.

339
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,118
Yeah, Kevin's sister. How are you?

340
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,187
Oh, good. Are you by any chance

341
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,588
available on the third
for a charity event?

342
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,956
Hey, I have a question for you:

343
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,057
how do you feel about homelessness?

344
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,425
I know, it's a bummer, right?

345
00:13:45,427 --> 00:13:46,560
<i>So, we're looking to cater</i>

346
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:47,928
about 400 people.

347
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,429
Your restaurant's definitely
gonna want to be a part of this.

348
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:52,499
Oh, my... I know. Um...

349
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,233
Awesome, okay, great.

350
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:54,601
Thanks, Z. Bye.

351
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,003
You're killer.

352
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:00,240
I need you to take me to Ashley's.

353
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:01,842
Oh, well, what if Kate gave you a ride?

354
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:03,143
Do you mind?

355
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:05,512
No. Hi.

356
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:06,847
Sorry.

357
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,418
I'll be in the car, intern.

358
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:23,397
Hey.

359
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,499
Hey.

360
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,624
- Should we go in?
- Yeah.

361
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,902
Listen, what kind of
party is this anyway?

362
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,037
'Cause everyone seems pretty sad.

363
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,204
Of course they're sad.

364
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:32,873
It's a memorial service.

365
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,041
Come on, in we go,

366
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:36,443
before all the good cheese is gone.

367
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,150
What are we doing here?

368
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:45,218
We are here

369
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,454
because your wife...
do you remember her?

370
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,855
I think so, yeah.

371
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:50,840
The one that you love
more than life itself?

372
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:52,474
- Definitely rings a bell.
- Got it.

373
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:54,761
She wants to take a look at this place.

374
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,630
Okay, I'm looking.

375
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:59,366
Geez, this place is whiter

376
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:03,370
than Randall's already
pretty white other school.

377
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:05,305
I mean, look at these kids.

378
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,407
They look like little

379
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,642
Nazi robots.

380
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:10,344
That one's got a briefcase.

381
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,380
I... no kid should be
carrying a briefcase.

382
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,182
I think it's cute.

383
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:16,783
Yeah, it's cute now; next
thing you know, he's gonna be

384
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,552
trapped in a cubicle for
the rest of his life.

385
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,520
I tell you, it starts with a briefcase,

386
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,489
then you put on a tie,
you sit at a desk.

387
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,324
Next thing you know,
you are so conditioned

388
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,526
to the florescent lights
that when you step outside,

389
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,595
the sun actually burns your eyes.

390
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,163
Wow.

391
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:32,065
Yeah.

392
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,001
Wow. Really?

393
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,970
This isn't about me.

394
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:39,773
Well, it certainly isn't about Randall.

395
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,910
Hey.

396
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:46,079
Look, I... I wasn't gonna say anything

397
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:50,117
until I'd had a few details
worked out, but...

398
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,953
I think I'm gonna go out on my own.

399
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,588
Start my own company.

400
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,623
Big Three Homes. I just...

401
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,429
Doesn't feel like a very
good time right now.

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,767
I think it's great.

403
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,535
I think you should do it.

404
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:11,304
It's not that easy, Bec.

405
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:14,674
I mean... what does
this place even cost?

406
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:17,244
We'll figure it out.

407
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:20,180
We'll figure it out... we'll
send Randall to another school,

408
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:22,716
we'll get him a tutor, we'll
do whatever we have to do.

409
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:23,750
All right.

410
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:26,553
I just don't want you to be unhappy.

411
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,622
- I mean it.
- Okay.

412
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,593
All right.

413
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,195
We'll come back.

414
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:37,464
This is nice.

415
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,499
It's very nice.

416
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,237
Jemma, your mom told me
that you would be giving me

417
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,006
Ashley's address.

418
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,910
Jemma, will you answer me?

419
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,814
Jemma, I'm gonna need the address.

420
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,482
Why?

421
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,918
- 'Cause you need to get back to work?
- Yes.

422
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,119
And if I didn't value the work,

423
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,620
I wouldn't be tolerating this attitude.

424
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:02,422
Just so we're clear.

425
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:06,126
What'd she tell
you, you'd be an associate?

426
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,461
And you thought my mom was gonna

427
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,829
give you actual responsibilities,

428
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:11,498
because a few C-list
celebrities take your calls?

429
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,695
Clearly she only hired
you because she thinks

430
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,863
the fat girl can get through to me.

431
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,967
Guess she figured, bigger the better.

432
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:21,527
You know, I actually feel bad for you.

433
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,229
What the hell?

434
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:26,299
Yeah, well, don't feel bad for me, okay?

435
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,800
'Cause I have a ride home.

436
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:29,001
I'm sorry?

437
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:31,237
Get out. What?

438
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:35,007
Get out of the damn car, Jemma,
before I toss you out of it!

439
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:39,712
Oh, and you know what? You
can walk to Ashley's.

440
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:42,148
And fat girl to fat girl,
if you keep up the pace,

441
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:45,117
you can burn 417 calories
an hour walking.

442
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,269
I love American cheese. Mm.

443
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,972
- English cheese is so blue, it's angry.
- Yeah.

444
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,442
American cheese is like a... a
bed you can just fall into.

445
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:02,412
So, whose good-bye party is this anyway?

446
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,315
Frank Pendergrass... tree branch
fell on him three days ago

447
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,116
when he was jogging
through Central Park.

448
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,484
Bang. Dead.

449
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,019
- Well, that sucks.
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,521
You knew him how?

451
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,389
Oh, I didn't. No, the
obituary gave the address

452
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,024
of the service so, I thought...

453
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:16,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

454
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:17,393
What are you trying to say?

455
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:18,861
Hello.

456
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:21,164
I'm Frank's wife, Grace.

457
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,166
Hi.

458
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,701
Hi. Uh, I'm Jessica.

459
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,703
- This is my husband, David.
- Oh.

460
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,005
Were you students of my husband?

461
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,055
We actually met in his class.

462
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,293
- Oh.
- Right?

463
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,714
Students.

464
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,781
Mm.

465
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,783
Yeah, we were
sitting in the front row,

466
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,151
and we kept looking at each other,

467
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,487
and then finally Frank
stopped the class and said,

468
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:46,723
"You two are distracting me.
Go outside, have sex,

469
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,459
and come back when you're
ready to learn something."

470
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,260
Well, that sounds like Frank.

471
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:52,628
Yeah.

472
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,830
Frank.

473
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,732
Thank you both so much for coming.

474
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,201
- Thank you for coming.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

475
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,736
Thank you.

476
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,505
Well done.

477
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:05,108
No, no, no, hold on. No, no, no.
You brought...

478
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,309
You brought me

479
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,677
to a stranger's funeral?

480
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,213
- Memorial service.
- Whatever. Why, huh?

481
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,681
What, because I'm struggling
with the grief scene?

482
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,316
You said I would get there.

483
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,151
Yeah, well, I didn't say
you'd get there on your own.

484
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,352
This is insane.

485
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,592
But thank you very much for the lesson.

486
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:20,694
I appreciate it. Now I'm
gonna go have a drink.

487
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:22,363
Enjoy your cheese.

488
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:28,569
Hey, baby, what happened to<i> Jungle Book?</i>

489
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,904
It's over.

490
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:33,140
Well, Mommy snuck in a
quick shower... shh.

491
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:35,275
Got to get them in while
you can, little bug.

492
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:38,312
You're so pretty.

493
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:40,514
Thank you, baby.

494
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:43,517
Well, if I'm pretty, you're
pretty, 'cause we look alike.

495
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,285
Oh, can you get

496
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,721
Mommy's yellow blouse, the
one with the buttons?

497
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:49,656
- Just in the closet? Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

498
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,760
Ooh.

499
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:04,938
Thank you, bug.

500
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,140
Mwah.

501
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,541
Okay, I'm going to pick up Randall.

502
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:09,209
Good-bye, beautiful.

503
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,111
Bye, see you later. All right, baby,

504
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,980
I'm almost done getting ready.

505
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:16,488
Tonight, little man, you, me and a B-52?

506
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:17,351
Okay!

507
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,119
Okay, don't finish it; I got
to help with something.

508
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,788
Sounds good.

509
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:30,063
I'm sorry. I was, I was, uh...

510
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:33,634
People keep bringing me things,
like I forgot how to cook.

511
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:35,436
Mm, there's no room in here

512
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:38,772
and I don't know where to
put all of Frank's food.

513
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:47,614
You have a lot of pickles.

514
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:53,587
- I hate pickles.
- Mm-hmm.

515
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:54,922
But he loves them.

516
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:57,825
Yeah, he eats them in bed.

517
00:20:59,862 --> 00:21:02,196
"Ate."

518
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:04,498
He is now past tense.

519
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,701
He used to be "is."

520
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:09,503
Now he is "was."

521
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:15,209
Hey, I like pickles.

522
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:17,377
Good.

523
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:19,112
- Here.
- Okay.

524
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:24,518
How do you feel about holiday ties?

525
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,286
And sport coats.

526
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:27,955
Because I asked Jeremy,

527
00:21:27,957 --> 00:21:32,059
but he said he didn't want
anything of his dad's.

528
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:33,894
Yeah.

529
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,927
How old is Jeremy?

530
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:39,733
Fifteen.

531
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,134
That's tough.

532
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,372
15 is tough.

533
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:50,177
Uh, my dad and I...

534
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:53,580
used to build models
together, when I was a kid.

535
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:54,948
Yeah?

536
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,385
Yeah, we'd build, um, planes and boats.

537
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:00,420
I used to pick the most complex ones...

538
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:02,422
B-52s, aircraft carriers...

539
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:04,091
'cause they took the longest, you know?

540
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:05,926
See, I was one of three kids,

541
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:07,961
so you really had to strategize
to get your alone time with Dad.

542
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:09,530
You know, and eventually,

543
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:11,598
we had a whole fleet of them;
we had just rows and rows,

544
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,833
shelves of them.

545
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:15,402
You know, and then when he died...

546
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:17,638
when...

547
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,840
when he, when he died, I, um...

548
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:26,113
I... I threw all the models away.

549
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:27,648
I threw every one of them away.

550
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,351
I don't know why... why
I did that, you know?

551
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:33,420
You were how old?

552
00:22:33,422 --> 00:22:36,089
Uh, it was a long time ago.

553
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,960
I have, um...

554
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:42,262
I have this.

555
00:22:42,264 --> 00:22:45,165
This necklace, this is his and, um,

556
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:49,202
it's the only thing I have left of him.

557
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:51,238
And at first, you know, I
didn't want to wear it,

558
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,274
I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't
even look at it, but now it's...

559
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:58,779
It's all I have and I-I can't
take it off now, so...

560
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,878
It's okay.

561
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:16,229
Oh, my God, this is so dumb.

562
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,764
What am I doing? I'm...

563
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,667
supposed to be comforting you,
not snotting all over you.

564
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,677
Who are you again?

565
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:33,015
- Hey.
- Hi.

566
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,054
Randall,

567
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,970
- your daddy's here.
- We're almost done.

568
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:37,772
Best two out of three.

569
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:39,301
Okay.

570
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:43,742
Hey, thanks for...
thanks for having him.

571
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,473
Oh, I will take him as
much as he'll have it.

572
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,408
Show my own boys what manners look like.

573
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,611
Okay.

574
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:52,746
Um...

575
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,782
Hey, did Rebecca tell
you about his school?

576
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:58,385
No. What happened?

577
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:01,622
I guess he scored off the
charts on some tests,

578
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:04,458
and now they want to uproot
him during the school year,

579
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,426
send him to some private academy.

580
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,095
You know, take him away
from the other two.

581
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,329
Why? Is it, is it a boarding school?

582
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:10,330
No.

583
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,865
No, it's, uh...

584
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,035
it's uniforms and...

585
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,204
a lot of little white kids

586
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,306
marching around like it's Nazi Germany.

587
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:21,975
Oh, I see.

588
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,910
That's why you're running this by me.

589
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,246
What?

590
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:27,414
You're looking for me to give you

591
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,049
the black person seal of approval

592
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,019
for any messed-up parenting
decision you make.

593
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:34,121
How is it messed up? I just...

594
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:37,157
I don't want my son to
feel more different.

595
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,661
Okay, so you just want to hold
him back because he's black?

596
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:43,263
No. Absolutely not. I...

597
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:45,198
Jack,

598
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,001
- Randall is special.
- Yeah.

599
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:52,005
So, if you're looking for
somebody to make you feel better

600
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:56,443
about denying him a special opportunity,

601
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:59,479
you may just have to find
yourself another black person.

602
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,416
See you, guys.

603
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,950
Ready, Freddy.

604
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,585
Bye, Ms. Yvette.

605
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,487
- Did you win?
- Yep.

606
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,610
And I'll never forget
the look on her face

607
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,213
when I placed her child
back into her arms.

608
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:34,381
Never.

609
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:35,349
So, yeah, that's what I do.

610
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:37,484
Day in and day out, I...

611
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,487
save children, just like
you guys, from fires.

612
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,522
Thank you.

613
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:48,161
Let's give it up for
Kendal's mom, Mandy! Yeah.

614
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:52,666
All right, okay, uh, up next is

615
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:56,002
Tessa's dad, Randall,
who is a weatherman.

616
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,139
Oh, sorry, sorry.

617
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,140
Uh, strike that.

618
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,876
He's a... weather trader.

619
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,714
I don't know what that is, but
I think he's gonna tell us.

620
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:08,849
Here's Randall.

621
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:17,991
Hey, y'all.

622
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,660
Uh, yeah.

623
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,329
I'm a weather trader,

624
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,565
which I know can be a
little bit hard to explain,

625
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,435
and so, um...

626
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:30,737
I wrote you guys a song about it.

627
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,614
I thought Daddy couldn't play the piano?

628
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:42,749

I was with Grace.

650
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:56,990
Who?

651
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:59,526
Grace. Frank's wife.

652
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:01,094
Why?

653
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:04,376
Because she's sad. Her husband died.

654
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:06,000
Why are you mad at me?

655
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,404
Because we shouldn't be here.

656
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:12,005
This is not a play.

657
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,774
You know, she's a real person.

658
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,409
I'm a real person.

659
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:18,378
Yeah, I can see that...
maybe for the first time.

660
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:21,181
What happened to you?

661
00:28:21,183 --> 00:28:22,683
What happened is my dad died.

662
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,318
That's what.

663
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,155
And I hated him for it.

664
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,690
And I couldn't eat for a month,

665
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,592
and I used to wake myself up crying,

666
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:33,460
so I could cry myself
back to sleep again.

667
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,430
That's what happened.

668
00:28:36,432 --> 00:28:38,599
Why do you push all of that away?

669
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:43,652
You can't just kill the feelings

670
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:46,221
like they're some creature
that you're afraid of.

671
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:49,491
That pain is a part of you.

672
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:52,394
I can see it now.

673
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,296
I can feel it.

674
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,438
Sorry, pickle mouth.

675
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,207
I don't care.

676
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:12,786
Is Jemma okay?

677
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:14,521
What? She's fine.

678
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:17,024
She said she had a really
nice day with you.

679
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:19,493
Which I didn't believe for a second,

680
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:21,995
because you didn't come
back, so I pressed.

681
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:26,767
I am really sorry that I left her.

682
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:29,036
I can understand if you
want to press charges

683
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:30,671
for child abandonment.

684
00:29:30,673 --> 00:29:32,673
God, don't even worry about it.

685
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:34,174
I've left her at three malls myself,

686
00:29:34,176 --> 00:29:36,109
and I've wanted to shove
her out of the car

687
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:38,045
on the freeway at least once.

688
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:40,180
I don't know what to
do with her anymore.

689
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:43,550
I can't reach her.

690
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,252
Before yesterday,

691
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:48,221
she's spoken seven words
to me in two weeks.

692
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:49,690
And you heard them:

693
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:51,758
"I see you hired the fat one."

694
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:54,227
Is that why you hired me?

695
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:57,597
No! God, no.

696
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,932
Not entirely.

697
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:00,634
Yeah, I thought so.

698
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:02,102
I am not proud of it.

699
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:05,105
I am sorry and it's really
not the only reason.

700
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:09,076
I-I liked your resume before I met you.

701
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:11,778
But, yeah.

702
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,947
I thought that maybe you'd be able to...

703
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:15,782
understand her.

704
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:17,818
Her issues.

705
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,087
Oh, my God, it sounds horrible

706
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:22,155
when I say it out loud.

707
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:24,725
God, please don't quit.

708
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:32,132
No more personal stuff.

709
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:35,035
You saw my work; you know I can do it.

710
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:37,003
No more driving Jemma around.

711
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:38,839
Yu can afford an assistant for that.

712
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:40,941
- Done.
- And I want to chair the Butterfly Ball.

713
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:42,542
- It's yours.
- And I want an office.

714
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:43,910
- Okay.
- And I want an intern.

715
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,913
Okay, too far.

716
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:51,985
I'll see you at 9:00 tomorrow.

717
00:30:51,987 --> 00:30:53,653
Thank you.

718
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:57,657
Hey, is Jemma still here?

719
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:58,658
She's outside.

720
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,727
Okay.

721
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:05,932
Hello? Hello? Pearson Corporation.

722
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:08,135
Would you like to discuss the big deal?

723
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:11,638
Well, I'm too busy.
You'll have to call back.

724
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:14,709
You love coming to work with Dad, huh?

725
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:19,980
I wanted you here because I
need your help with something.

726
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:22,883
Come here.

727
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:25,452
What's that?

728
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:28,221
That is a house the
company's working on.

729
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:31,124
- Cool.
- Yeah.

730
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:33,660
You see, uh...

731
00:31:33,662 --> 00:31:36,463
You see, I don't know

732
00:31:36,465 --> 00:31:38,865
how many feet of
two-by-four I'm gonna need

733
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:40,200
for this wall right here.

734
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,135
You see how each... how each inch is...

735
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:43,203
is three feet?

736
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,739
22 and a half feet.

737
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:47,674
Wow.

738
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:49,209
That's pretty cool, buddy.

739
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,778
Didn't know you were
so good with numbers.

740
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,080
Wait, wait, wait. Come here.

741
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:57,784
What about this wall right here?

742
00:31:57,786 --> 00:31:59,986
How many... how many do I need for that?

743
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,729
I don't know that one.

744
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:07,405
You knew how do it a
second ago, now you don't?

745
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,663
I don't know it, Dad.

746
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:09,996
I think you do.

747
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:12,098
I don't.

748
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,668
Randall, that's enough.

749
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,037
- Come here.
- I don't want to.

750
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,207
Look. This wall, right here.

751
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:22,075
How much do I need?

752
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,589
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Tell me the answer.

753
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:25,979
How many feet? Tell me right now.

754
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:27,147
I don't know.

755
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:29,516
Damn, it, Randall, tell me the answer!

756
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,719
34.

757
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:34,521
What's that?

758
00:32:34,523 --> 00:32:35,989
34.

759
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:41,695
That's right.

760
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:46,234
Why are you pretending not
to know this stuff, huh?

761
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:48,201
Getting B's in math?

762
00:32:48,203 --> 00:32:50,170
Not letting people see
how smart you are?

763
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:52,505
I don't want to be different from them.

764
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:54,908
Different from who? Who,
the kids at school?

765
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,778
If... if I get an A, I'll get ice cream,

766
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,413
and Kate and Kevin won't.

767
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:02,048
And then they'll hate me.

768
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:12,726
Can I be honest with you?

769
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:14,153
Man to man?

770
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,789
You know, your mom and me, we always try

771
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,791
to treat you kids the same.

772
00:33:18,793 --> 00:33:21,861
Always have.

773
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:24,029
Hasn't always worked, because, well,

774
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:25,464
you're not all the same.

775
00:33:27,702 --> 00:33:30,903
You're adopted, and we don't
talk about that enough.

776
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:33,439
'Cause to me, you are every part my son.

777
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,913
Maybe I.. I don't want you
to feel like you stand out.

778
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:45,885
But I need you to know something.

779
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:49,288
I want you to stand out.

780
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,691
I want all of you to be as different

781
00:33:52,693 --> 00:33:55,728
as you can possibly be.

782
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,530
In all the best ways.

783
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:03,102
I love you as much as a
human heart can, kiddo.

784
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:06,805
You are an exceptional young man.

785
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:10,142
So don't let your dad's

786
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:16,115
poor choice make you feel
afraid to be different.

787
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:18,417
Okay?

788
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,287
Okay.

789
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:29,028
Okay.

790
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,551
Sounds better when you
put your fingers on it.

791
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:42,321
Hmm.

792
00:34:42,323 --> 00:34:44,489
You know how, in the movies,

793
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:46,091
when somebody's bad at something,

794
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:47,559
but they don't want to be,

795
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:50,529
and so they set their mind to it.

796
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:52,431
And then we see this montage

797
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:55,000
of them practicing and practicing.

798
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:58,236
And then comes the big
moment, and they're amazing,

799
00:34:58,238 --> 00:34:59,638
and everybody cheers.

800
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,941
I've seen a few movies like that, yeah.

801
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:04,643
I think I skipped the montage.

802
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:11,650
When you first told me
what you did for a living,

803
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,151
man, I didn't understand a word.

804
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,553
Hand to God, I mean,

805
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:17,556
you might as well have
been speaking German.

806
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:20,626
But I was watching your face.

807
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:23,929
In my better days, I
have met and played with

808
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:26,632
some of the greatest
musicians in the world.

809
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:29,067
And when they talked about music,

810
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:31,336
their face looked like your face

811
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:35,507
when you told me about whatever
the hell it is you do.

812
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,410
But if it'll help, I can
show you a thing or two

813
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:39,578
on the piano.

814
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,146
That would be great.

815
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:43,315
- Oh, not tonight, just...
- Oh, right.

816
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:45,550
- It's late is the thing.
- Yeah. No.

817
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:46,752
I got ya.

818
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:50,288
Good night.

819
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,556
Night.

820
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,334
You don't have to say bye to me.

821
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:04,036
I didn't quit.

822
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,044
I know what you're going through.

823
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,613
Stop trying to have a moment with me.

824
00:36:21,288 --> 00:36:24,122
So, my mom was skinny and gorgeous.

825
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:26,224
Well, <i>is</i> gorgeous.

826
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,927
She still gets hit on by everyone.

827
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:31,263
She once was asked if she was a model

828
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,597
when she had the flu.

829
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,935
Pretty hard growing up
with a mom like that.

830
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:39,271
I spent all my time
comparing myself to her,

831
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:41,273
and then I took it out on her.

832
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:44,009
And now we barely talk, and it sucks.

833
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:49,614
Hey, your mom's not perfect.

834
00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:52,517
She has her stuff, and
you have yours, but...

835
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:56,354
you got to cut her a break.

836
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:58,490
Or you're gonna regret it.

837
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:00,192
I promise.

838
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:04,429
Kate, will you please help me out?

839
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,064
No, I hate this dress!

840
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:08,166
I know. I don't care that
you hate it, though.

841
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:09,534
It's what's clean and what fits,

842
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:12,356
- and it's what you're wearing.
- I hate you!

843
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:15,340
Put it on, please; we're running late.

844
00:37:15,342 --> 00:37:16,575
- Hey, Jack?
- Yeah?

845
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,276
- Randall? You guys are ready?
- Yeah.

846
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,245
- We have to leave in five minutes.
- I know. I got him.

847
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:22,114
You sure about this?

848
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:23,281
Yeah, I'm sure.

849
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,984
Hey, listen to your mother.

850
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:28,120
See, you look great.

851
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:30,288
Come get your lunch, young lady.

852
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,590
Thank you.

853
00:37:32,926 --> 00:37:34,025
Got it.

854
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,360
- See it?
- Yeah.

855
00:37:35,362 --> 00:37:37,462
Yeah. Takes a little
time, but

856
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,097
you'll get the hang of it.

857
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,332
Here, look at me.

858
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:42,234
Looking sharp.

859
00:37:42,236 --> 00:37:43,435
You ready for your first day?

860
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:45,604
Are Kate and Kevin gonna ride with us?

861
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:47,139
We're gonna drop them off,

862
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,274
then we're gonna drop you off,

863
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:50,509
and then we'll all be back together

864
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:53,520
- after school, okay?
- Okay.

865
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:55,780
Hey, wait. Come here.

866
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,050
We'll tuck this low.

867
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:00,452
Nice and comfortable.

868
00:38:02,523 --> 00:38:04,322
Say bye to your mom.

869
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:13,532
Hot, plump ones coming through.

870
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:16,067
Mm-hmm. Whoo! Oh, um, Mom,

871
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:17,936
I have a soccer practice
after school today.

872
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,407
Yeah, I remember.

873
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,649
Come on.

874
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:27,145
I have something to say.

875
00:38:29,216 --> 00:38:33,318
Uh... my dad put on a tie every day

876
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,287
because he had to.

877
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:38,007
I put one on every day
because I want to.

878
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,359
It's important you know that.

879
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,563
Maybe I don't run into burning
buildings for a living,

880
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:48,967
but to me, my work is
challenging and exciting.

881
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,635
I will not apologize for the fact

882
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:52,938
that it's hard to explain to people.

883
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:54,753
Okay, Daddy.

884
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,077
Uh, also, William,

885
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,112
thank you for offering
to teach me piano,

886
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:02,981
but I don't think at this point

887
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:04,482
in our relationship it would be healthy

888
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,218
to introduce that dynamic.

889
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:09,554
And so,

890
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,123
starting next Tuesday, I'm
gonna be taking piano lessons

891
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,480
from Mrs. Perkins down the road.

892
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:18,496
There's gonna be a
recital in the spring,

893
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:21,766
and I hope that you will all
come and support me in this.

894
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:31,343
What was that?

895
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:33,078
That was a midlife crisis, baby.

896
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,314
But just a little one, so
go on, eat your waffle.

897
00:39:37,484 --> 00:39:39,417
"Just a little one." That's good.

898
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,519
He-He's gonna take piano?

899
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:43,021
Psst, hey!

900
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:44,122
Brought you a cappuccino.

901
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,191
Soy, yeah?

902
00:39:46,193 --> 00:39:48,159
- You're too kind.
- Yeah.

903
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:50,896
Also wanted to say that, uh...

904
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:53,098
You know, I wanted to
say that I forgive you.

905
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,432
For the lesson. Um...

906
00:39:55,903 --> 00:39:58,403
What can I say? It worked.

907
00:39:58,405 --> 00:40:00,205
- Mm, I'd say it did.
- Yeah.

908
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:03,041
But, um, that's not the only lesson.

909
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:05,477
No? Okay.

910
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:08,480
What happened between you and me...

911
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,384
is never gonna happen again.

912
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,654
Oh. I-I thought...

913
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:17,956
I know you did, but this is who we are

914
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,557
and all we are.

915
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,929
You're my husband, and
I'm your dead wife.

916
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:27,699
And you will never sleep with her again.

917
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:30,101
Now, how does that make you feel?

918
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:34,406
Sad.

919
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:36,007
Great.

920
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:38,176
Use that.

921
00:40:42,382 --> 00:40:44,616
Okay.

922
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:00,198
- Hey.
- Hey.

923
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:19,017
So what was that about teleportation?

924
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,119
Yeah, the teleportation
and the freeze breath

925
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,120
or, like, hot breath.

926
00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:24,656
Hey, have fun.

927
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:27,192
Bye, Dad.

928
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:28,524
Love you.

929
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:31,496
What's up?

930
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:47,881
